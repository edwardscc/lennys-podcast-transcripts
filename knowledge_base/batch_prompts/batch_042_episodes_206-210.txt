And then I got myself a word processor off of eBay so that I could just sit down and write and do the important stuff. And even when I stopped using all the technology, even when I got rid of all the apps, I would sit down on my desk and I'd say, \"Oh, you know what? There's that book that I've been meaning what to do some research in,\" or, \"Let me just clean off my desk real quick,\" or, \"You know what? I should take out the trash.\" And I kept getting distracted because the problem is not our technology. The problem is our inability to deal with discomfort. So, what I have adopted for myself and what I'd advise anyone who finds themselves in this situation is to always identify what is that internal trigger, what is that itch that you are looking to escape when you get distracted, because that is the source of 90% of our distractions.\n\n(00:00:51):\nIt's not the pings, dings, and rings. It's the feelings. But to me, that's incredibly empowering because once you realize, \"Wait a minute, it's just a feeling.\" It's all it is, it's just an emotion. Then you can have tools ready to go. You can have arrows in your quiver ready to take out as soon as you feel that discomfort.\n\nLenny (00:01:10):\nToday, my guest is Nir Eyal.

Great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:29):\nI feel like we have a chance to record the most valuable hour in podcast history because it could give people more time to do the things they want to do. And this is based on a book that you wrote. It's called Indistractable, which is all about helping people become less distracted, become better at focus, and it might be the most essential skill in the workplace today. And so, what I'm hoping to do today in our chat is just basically give people as many tactical skills and pieces of advice and tools to become less distractable and to get better at focus. How does that sound?\n\nNir Eyal (00:04:59):\nThat sounds great. I love that you're setting the expectations high. I'll try and meet them.\n\nLenny (00:05:03):\nWell now, we got to hit them. Okay, so here's the question. I'll just start really broad and let's just see where this goes. My question is just how does one become less distractable, slash how do I become less distractable?\n\nNir Eyal (00:05:15):\nOkay, so there's a deeper motivation here. It's like, \"I need help,\" which is great. That's my favorite thing to do, is to actually get concrete with people about what their specific challenges are. But let me back up here. So, this is what I spent five years writing a book about, because why did it take me five years to write a book? Because I was so distracted. So, I wrote this book for me more than anyone else. That's the only reason I write books. It's not because of what I know, but because of what I want to know. And I discovered that there were so many myths and tropes and just flat out harmful things that I was doing to hurt my own productivity. And when I really went down to first principles and looked at the research, I found that there were so many things that I was doing wrong.\n\n(00:05:56):\nBut since I've changed my ways and adopted what the research literature says about distraction, it's improved my life in inconceivable ways. I'm in the best shape of my life at 45 years old. I have a better relationship with my family than ever. I'm more productive at work than ever before, not because I didn't know what to do. That's what I find is really emblematic of people today is not that we don't know what to do. It used to be maybe, okay, our grandparents, they didn't know what to do because the information was scarce. They had to go to the library and look things up. Well, today, with the internet, we all basically know what to do. And if you don't know what to do, Google it. You can find the answer out there. But we all basically know common-sense stuff like if you want to get in shape, you have to exercise and eat right, okay?\n\n(00:06:38):\nYou don't need a diet book to tell you that. If you want to have better relationships with your family, you have to be fully present with people. If you want to do better at work, you have to do the hard work that other people don't want to do. We already know these things. What we don't know is how to get out of our own way, how to stop getting distracted. And so, that was certainly my problem. And so, what I wanted to do was really dive into the problem because the conventional solutions didn't work for me. When I have a problem in my life, I'll think about it, I'll write about it, I'll talk to friends, I'll talk to my wife about it. If I still can't figure it out, I'll read books about it. And what the conventional wisdom out there written by a lot of college professors that are all tenured is stop using technology, stop checking email, get off social media. It's melting your brain, but that's not very helpful, right?\n\n(00:07:23):\nMaybe if you have tenure, that's okay, but I can't stop using technology. My career will plummet. I have to use these tools. So, I wanted much more practical advice, and what I discovered was that the root cause of distraction is much more interesting and the solution is far more empowering than stop using technology, technology's evil, it's melting your brain. So, where do we begin? Maybe the best place to start is by first, before we dive into the tactics around how do we become indistractable, the first place to start is what is distraction? Understanding the term really, really matters. And the best way to understand what distraction is, is to understand what distraction is not. What's the opposite of distraction? So, if you ask most people, what's the opposite of distraction?\n\n(00:08:06):\nThey'll tell you focus, right? I don't want to be distracted, I want to be focused. That's not exactly right. Then in fact, the opposite of distraction is not focus. The opposite of distraction is traction. Becomes pretty easy when you look at both words, traction, distraction. They're opposites because both words come from the same Latin root, trahare, which means to pull, and they both end in the same six letters, A-C-T-I-O-N that spells action, reminding us that distraction is not something that happens to us. It is an action that we ourselves take. So, traction, by definition, is any action that pulls you towards what you say you were going to do, things you do with intent, things that move you closer to your values, and help you become the kind of person you want to become. Those are acts of traction. Now, the opposite of traction, distraction, is any action that pulls you away from what you plan to do, further away from your goals, further away from becoming the kind of person you want to become.\n\n(00:09:01):\nAnd what separates traction from distraction is one word, and that one word is intent. I love this Dorothy Parker. She said, \"The time you plan to waste is not wasted time.\" So, I think we need to stop medicalizing and moralizing what people do with their time. Why is it that someone going on Reddit or on social media or watching a YouTube video that's somehow morally inferior to watching a football game on TV? It's not. Anything you want to do with your time and attention is fine as long as it's done with intent, as long as you're doing it on your schedule, and not someone else's, certainly not the tech company's schedule. So, anything you do with intent is traction, anything else is distraction. So, what I discovered, for me, was that I was getting tricked by distraction in that the most pernicious form of distraction I discovered was the kind I didn't even realize was distracting me.\n\n(00:09:53):\nSo, let me know if this sounds familiar to you, Lenny. I would sit down at my desk. I would look at my to-do list. By the way, we can talk about why to-do lists are one of the worst things you can do for your personal productivity. We can get back to that later. But I would sit down at my desk and I'd say, \"Okay, I've got that big important project. That's what I'm going to do this morning. I'm not going to get distracted, nothing's going to get in my way. Here I go, I'm going to get started, but first let me check some email.\"\n\nLenny (00:10:17):\nAre you watching me because this happens to me every morning. You got to stop.\n\nNir Eyal (00:10:21):\nThis is totally autobiographical. This is what I used to do all the... \"Oh, let me just scroll that Slack channel. What's everybody at the office doing? Oh, let me just catch up on industry news.\" That's important. That's part of my job. I'm being productive, right? And what I didn't realize is that distraction was tricking me into prioritizing the urgent and the easy stuff at the expense of the hard and important work I had to do to move my life and career forward. So, just because it's a work-related task, doesn't mean it's not a distraction. In fact, that's the worst kind of distraction. Far worse than playing Candy Crush or whatever because then you're putzing around, then at least it's obvious that you're distracted. But if you're just checking work email, you feel productive even though that's a distraction because it's not what you said you want to do with your time and attention. So now, we have this framework. We have traction, we have distraction.\n\n(00:11:08):\nNow, there's one more thing that's super important, then we'll have the entire picture so that we can stop thinking about the model and actually get to a brass tacks of what do we actually do. Now that we have traction distraction the other thing we have to consider are triggers. We have two kinds of triggers. We have external triggers. These are things in our outside environment, the usual suspects, the pings, the dings, the rings, all this stuff in our outside environment, which we tend to blame for distraction, but studies find, that's only 10% of the reason we get distracted, 10% of the time it's because of something outside of us. What's the other 90%? Turns out 90% of the time that we get distracted, it's not because of what's happening outside of us, but that most distraction begins from within boredom, loneliness, fatigue, uncertainty, anxiety. That is the cause of 90% of our distractions. So, whether it's too much news, too much booze, too much football, too much Facebook, you are always going to get distracted from one thing or another unless you understand the root cause of the problem.\n\n(00:12:09):\nSo, step number one to becoming indistractable is to master those internal triggers or they will become your master. Now, we're working around those four points. Step number two, make time for traction. We can talk about that. Hack back the external triggers and step number four, prevent distraction with pacts. So, you asked a big question, I gave you a big answer. That's the overall framework. That's a strategy. Tactics are what you do. Strategy is why you do it. So, I wanted to explain the strategy before we got into the tactics.\n\nLenny (00:12:36):\nAmazing. I love this word traction because it relates to kind of the other side of this podcast of growth, product market fit, building products people want, getting traction with users. So, I really like that there's this additional way of thinking about traction, which is basically not being distracted. Can you just repeat the four steps again for people to have this in mind?\n\nNir Eyal (00:12:55):\nStep number one, master internal triggers. Step number two, make time for traction. So, this is where we're turning our values into time. We can talk about how to do that. Step number three is hack back the external triggers. This is where we get into the pings, dings, and rings, not just the obvious stuff like your phone, your computer. I take about a page and a half to talk about that. That's kind of kindergarten stuff. But what about all the non-obvious external triggers? What about stupid meetings that didn't need to be called? What about emails that didn't need to be sent and received? What about our kids? Our kids are wonderful. I know you're a new dad, they're fantastic to have kids, but they can also be a source of distraction. So, how do we deal with all those external triggers, and then finally prevent distraction with pacts and pacts are this firewall, this last resort against distraction that we can use to keep distraction at bay and it's really about these four steps in concert in this order that anyone can use to become indistractable.\n\nLenny (00:13:47):\nAwesome. Does this spell something clever, by the way?\n\nNir Eyal (00:13:49):\nNo, I didn't have an acronym, but I do have a pretty picture.\n\nLenny (00:13:53):\nAwesome. So, let's go through this and I'd love specifically example you shared, I think many people run into this. There's a hard thing I need to do and I'm just going to go check my email and Twitter instead. I feel like that's a very common distraction, and so sharing, getting into that at some point would be awesome, but otherwise let's get into these four steps.\n\nNir Eyal (00:14:09):\nYeah, well, we can absolutely do that. So, is that something you encounter? It sounds like a...\n\nLenny (00:14:13):\n100%. Every time. I have my to-do list, work on next week's post, and then I'm like, \"Oh, let me just go check Twitter or maybe tweet something and that'll be fun,\" and then totally check my email. \"Oh, inbox zero. Let's get all the way to zero. Oh, that's cool. Okay, now the days are over.\"\n\nNir Eyal (00:14:28):\nExactly. And by the way, we are cut from the same cloth. This is exactly the pattern I used to get into and I knew I wasn't doing my best because I wasn't putting in the time to the things that were most important. I was doing just what was easy and what was urgent and that's not good enough. So, if we use this model, step number one is master the internal triggers. So, for you, Lenny, so when you say, \"Okay, I know I've got to do this big important thing, but now I'm going to go check email,\" I would guess that there's some kind of underlying emotion that you're trying to escape. Let's put yourself in the shoes that you were in when you said, \"I was going to do that big important thing, but now I'm going to check email instead.\" Do you remember the last time that happened, by the way?\n\nLenny (00:15:11):\nEvery morning.\n\nNir Eyal (00:15:13):\nEvery morning. This morning?\n\nLenny (00:15:15):\nYeah, this morning.\n\nNir Eyal (00:15:16):\nOkay, perfect. Do you recall what you were feeling right before you went to Twitter or checked email or did the thing that you didn't want to do as opposed to the thing you said you were going to do?\n\nLenny (00:15:27):\nI don't know if this is an emotion or feeling, but there's just this, I need to get serious and start using my brain and there's going to be this deep work moment where I just get real deep and it takes a lot of effort to push me into that. Sometimes easier, sometimes harder. So, maybe it's avoiding this, \"Oh, okay, I'm going to really have to think.\" It's like, I guess, it's the fear of the brain starting to really have to work.\n\nNir Eyal (00:15:51):\nYeah, that's hard work. So maybe, it's a bit of laziness. Maybe, it's a bit of momentum. There's this uncomfortable feeling of this cold start problem. \"Oh, I don't really want to do it right now.\" So, this is incredibly important and I appreciate your candor here around what you feel because all of us experience it and we don't want to talk about it. We want to think that it's, \"Oh, I'll just grayscale my phone,\" or, \"I'll just turn off notifications and that's going to solve the problem,\" and it never does. And let me tell you, I tried all of it. I went to Alibaba and I bought myself one of these flip phones from China like we used to have in the 1990s with no apps, no internet connection, and then I got myself a word processor off of eBay, so that I could just sit down and write and do the important stuff.\n\n(00:16:33):\nAnd even when I stopped using all the technology, even when I got rid of all the apps, I would sit down on my desk and I'd say, \"Oh, you know what? There's that book that I've been meaning what to do some research in,\" or, \"Let me just clean off my desk real quick,\" or, \"You know what? I should take out the trash.\" And I kept getting distracted because the problem is not our technology. The problem is our inability to deal with discomfort. So, what I have adopted for myself and what I'd advise anyone who finds themselves in this situation is to always identify what is that internal trigger, what is that itch that you are looking to escape when you get distracted, because that is the source of 90% of our distractions. It's not the pings, dings, and rings. It's the feelings. But to me, that's incredibly empowering because once you realize, \"Wait a minute, it's just a feeling.\" It's all it is, it's just an emotion. Then you can have tools ready to go. You can have arrows in your quiver ready to take out as soon as you feel that discomfort.\n\n(00:17:27):\nSo, let me give you one tool that I use every single day. Feel free to use it next time you feel this same problem. It's called the 10-minute rule, and this is just one of a dozen different techniques that you can use that I put in the book, but this is one that I use almost every single day. So, for me, I've been a professional writer now for over a decade, and writing is never easy. I hear people say like, \"Oh, just form a writing habit.\" I think that's ridiculous. I don't know what they're talking about. A habit is defined as a behavior done with little or no conscious thought. I don't know how to write out of habit. Writing is always hard. Fricking work. I've written two bestsellers, thousands of articles and let me tell you, it's always difficult. It's hard, and all I want to do when I write is just Google this one thing or let me just check the news real quick or let me just do anything but the actual writing. So, here's what I do.\n\nLenny (00:18:15):\nBy the way, there's a great quote that I'll share real quick about this that I think I share often on this podcast that I think it's falsely attributed to Hemingway, but it's that, \"Writing is easy. Just sit down at the keyboard and bleed.\"\n\nNir Eyal (00:18:27):\nOh my God, that's so true. It's so true, and I've not figured out how to make it suddenly easy. Every single word is hard to type out, but I got to do it right and I love doing it. I love having done it. In the process, it's very difficult. But after I make the discovery, after I create something that I think is useful, then it's a lot of fun. But doing the work is really difficult. So, here's what I do. Every time that I am tempted to go do something else, which is all the time, what I will do is I will take out a timer, I'll take out my phone and I'll say, \"Set a timer for 10 minutes.\" I'll put the phone down and my job is for those 10 minutes, whenever I'm ready, get back to the task at hand or do what's called surf the urge.\n\n(00:19:12):\nSurfing the urge acknowledges that these emotions are like waves. They crest and then they subside. But that's not how we think about emotions. Most of us think about emotions as always being there. If I feel bored, I feel like I'm always going to be bored. If I'm frustrated, it feels like I'm always going to be frustrated, but that's never the case. Emotions are like waves. So, your job is to set that timer for 10 minutes and realize you can do just about anything for just 10 minutes. So, the idea is not to say don't do it. We know that this technique that a lot of people use of abstinence, telling yourself, \"Don't do that, that's bad,\" actually can backfire. And we can talk about the psychology if that's interesting of why abstinence backfires. But a much healthier technique is not to tell yourself no. It's to tell yourself not yet.\n\n(00:19:57):\nYou're not saying no, you're saying not yet. And so, you can do just about anything for 10 minutes. So, what I tell myself is, \"Okay, I'm just going to wait 10 minutes before I check email, before I scroll social media, before I Google something that is just trying to procrastinate doing the work.\" I can do that. I'm a grown man. I can do whatever I want. I can do that in 10 minutes. And so, for those 10 minutes, all I have to do is either get back to the task at hand, get back to writing, or surf the urge, which is simply experiencing that sensation, acknowledging, \"You know what? This is hard work. That's okay. That's why I'm feeling frustrated. That's why I'm feeling bored. That's why I'm feeling anxious. That's why I have this cold start around I don't really want to do this work because it's difficult.\"\n\n(00:20:34):\nSo, what I do is I take a deep breath and I repeat a mantra that I made up for myself. You can make up your own mantra. My personal mantra whenever I feel this internal trigger is I remind myself this. I say, \"This is what it feels like to get better. This is what it feels like to get better.\" And just saying that for as long as I need to until that emotion crests and subsides and then get back to work. What you'll find nine times out of 10 is that by the time those 10 minutes are up, you will have forgotten about that sensation. You'll be right back at the task at hand. And so, that's what's called the 10-minute rule. And of course what you're doing over time is that the 10-minute rule can become the 12-minute rule, can become the 20-minute rule, and most importantly, you are proving to yourself that you have agency that you said you were going to focus on a task and you did. That's the most important part.\n\n(00:21:22):\nThe flip that we need to change in people's minds is this ridiculous belief that technology is hijacking our brains. There's nothing we can do about distraction that our focus is being stolen. It's not being stolen, we're giving it away. And so, what we need to do is to empower ourselves by showing ourselves in practice as well as in theory that we can postpone that distraction when we say we will.\n\nLenny (00:21:46):\nWhat I like about this is one, it's kind of like the Pomodoro technique, but it's shorter. The 10 minutes I think is a really clever tweak versus 20 minutes, which a lot of people recommend. And then I guess a couple of follow-up questions. Do you do this one time in the morning and then not come back to it? Is this like a jump start for the day and then you start... If I start a thing like this, it won't be 10 minutes, it'll be like an hour because I'm like, \"Okay, I did the hard thing, I'm into it. I'm just going to keep working.\" So, is this like a jump start for the morning or do you come back to this throughout the day?\n\nNir Eyal (00:22:13):\nSo, you can do it whenever you find yourself slipping off track. And so, the Pomodoro is a version of this. I don't think it's complete enough because Pomodoro just said, \"Set the timer, do it.\" Okay, fine. And that's great if it works for you. By the way, anything I'm saying right now, if the thing is working for you, if your life is awesome and you're doing what you said you're going to do, maybe this isn't the podcast. Maybe my book isn't the book for you, right? I'm talking to the people who, for whatever reason, you know you're capable of more, you know you're drifting off track. Maybe if like me, you said you were going to exercise but you didn't or you said you're going to eat right, but you don't. You said you were going to work on that big task, but you procrastinate. That's really who I was and that's who I wrote this book for.\n\n(00:22:49):\nAnd so, you can use that technique whenever you get distracted. It's not the whole picture. So, it's super important. Remember we talked about those four steps. This is just step number one. There's about a dozen different things you can do. Maybe this particular 10-minute rule doesn't work for you, doesn't work for everyone. There might be other techniques you use. So, there's dozens of different techniques just about this step around mastering internal triggers. But the next step to answer your question of well, how long do I go for? Do I do it for an hour? If now, I'm in the zone? And my answer is emphatically no. You don't go as long as you think you can. What you want to do, and this is step number two, is you're making time for traction by turning your values into time, which means you are going to make a time box schedule because you cannot call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from.\n\n(00:23:39):\nI'll say that again. You can't call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from. So, for me, at least, when I would succumb to, \"Oh, let me just check email for a quick minute, let me just see what's happening on Twitter for a quick minute,\" part of that was because I would justify to myself, \"Well, this is a work-related task. I got to do it sometime,\" and there wasn't a specific time to do it on my calendar, so I would keep thinking, \"Well, I got to do it sometime. Might as well just do it now.\" And that's a huge mistake because if you can't look at your calendar and say, \"Oh, that's traction.\" Okay, check email, write the blog post, post the podcast, go on social media. If that's not what's written in your calendar, if it's not there, it's a distraction. And so, it's not just work-related stuff. I literally have time in my calendar, spend time with my daughter, go on social media, watch Netflix. It's in my calendar. So now, I took what was previously distraction and I turned it into traction by putting it on my schedule.\n\nLenny (00:24:37):\nSo, you actually do this through the day you have, \"I'm going to check Twitter during this time of the day, I'm going to hang out with my daughter during this time of the day.\"\n\nNir Eyal (00:24:44):\nExactly. And you're adjusting it never in the day. So, you never want to do that. You always want to make sure you're doing it the day before. And so, what I do once a week, Sunday evenings, it takes me maybe 10 minutes a week. 8:00 P.M., I sit down, I look at my schedule for the week ahead and I ask myself, \"Does this schedule reflect my values?\" What are values? Values are attributes of the person you want to become. I'll say it again. Values are attributes of the person you want to become. So, there's three life domains, you, your relationships, and finally your work. So, what you got to do is you look at your calendar for the week ahead and you ask yourself, \"How would the person I want to become spend time taking care of themselves?\" That's the you domain. If you can't take care of yourself, you can't take care of others, you can't make the world a better place.\n\n(00:25:26):\nSo then, you put in your calendar how you want to take care of yourself. What might that include? Well, time for rest. We all know how important sleep is, but I used to yell at my daughter and say, \"Oh, it's your bedtime. You got to get to bed.\" And then one day she said to me, \"Daddy, do you have a bedtime?\" She was absolutely right. I was a hypocrite because I know how important sleep is and I didn't have a bedtime. Now, I have a bedtime. It's in my schedule. Then put in time for whatever else is important to you. Is reading important to you? Is prayer important to you? Is meditation, is exercise, is video games, is that important to you? Great. Whatever's important to you according to your values, put it in your schedule. Then you're going to put your relationships in. So, don't let the relationships in your life get whatever scraps of time are left over.\n\n(00:26:08):\nPut time in your schedule for your significant other, for your kids, for your buddies. How many of us are trapped in this loneliness epidemic because we don't make time for our closest relationships, including adult friendships? Don't let those wither away. Put time in your schedule for those, as well. We know that most friendships, they don't die in some big blowout. Relationships starve to death because we don't invest in them. Put time in your schedule for those relationships. We can talk about how to do that, as well. Then finally, the work domain involves two kinds of work. We have what's called reactive work and reflective work. Reactive work, reacting to notifications, reacting to emails, reacting to taps on the shoulder from your colleagues. That's going to be part of everybody's day. I get that, but don't let that be your entire day because what most people do, they habituate into not wanting to think.\n\n(00:26:56):\nThey don't want to think what's important. \"So, just let me look at my email inbox. My email inbox will tell me what to do. What's really important for my business? That's really hard. I don't really want to think about that. I'll look at my to-do list and I'll start ticking off easy tasks to do that make me feel productive.\" That's terrible. What you want to do instead is to book time in your schedule for this reflective work time, which is where you do the kind of work that requires you to work without distraction. Planning, strategizing, thinking, for god's sakes, can only be done without distraction. So, that fills up your calendar, as well. And what you're going to find, that there's never enough time for everything, which is good because what this forces you to do, and this is one of the main reasons why to-do lists suck, is because to-do lists have no constraints.\n\n(00:27:38):\nYou can always add more to a to-do list. You can always add more, but here's what happens. This is what happened to me. I would get home from work. I have a very busy day and I'd look at my to-do list and it's a hundred items long and I think, \"Wow, I've been working real hard all day and look at all this stuff I still didn't do. Loser.\" And so, day after day, week after week, month after month, I was reinforcing this self-image as someone who doesn't know how to manage their time. And then I started saying stupid stuff like, \"Oh, maybe I'm no good at time management. Maybe I have undiagnosed ADHD. Maybe there's something wrong with me.\" There's nothing wrong with me. There's something wrong with this very stupid to-do list method, which doesn't force you to understand that there are trade-offs that you have to prioritize properly and that can only be done with constraints and that constraints come from your calendar.\n\n(00:28:23):\nSo, you're turning your values into time by making time for traction and having this calendar and then, only then you can look at your calendar and say, \"Ah, whatever it is I plan to do, that's traction. Everything else is distraction.\"\n\nLenny (00:28:36):\nI want to share a couple things that worked for me that are very much along these lines. One is booking. I call it deep work time within the day. This was the only thing I had in the calendar, so I didn't do the other things, which I think would've been really helpful, but I had a, I called it deep work time. I will slap you if you book anything over this meeting.\n\nNir Eyal (00:28:36):\nI love it.\n\nLenny (00:28:55):\nAnd I did that every Monday morning, Wednesday morning, and Friday sometime, and on that...\n\nNir Eyal (00:28:59):\nWho was slapping you?\n\nLenny (00:29:01):\nI would be slapping the person that booked time over that slot and nobody can...\n\nNir Eyal (00:29:05):\nOkay, got it.\n\nLenny (00:29:06):\nAnd I don't know if that's allowed these days. I don't know how this...\n\nNir Eyal (00:29:10):\nDepends who you're booking with, I guess.\n\nLenny (00:29:11):\nYeah, make it a little less aggressive maybe. But that worked a ton. It was like a two- or three-hour block of deep work time and that made a big dent in my ability to have time to focus because people weren't booking me as a PM.\n\nNir Eyal (00:29:23):\nYeah, I love it. And by the way, I want to hear more of these, but that illustrates a really good point that when the stakes are high enough, I hear people a lot of times saying, \"I just can't find the time to focus and I can't get this done and it's impossible these days.\" And then I say, \"Well, let's make a little wager here.\" Let's say, I get this around physical fitness a lot or somebody says, \"Oh, I want to be an author. How do I do that? How do I write the book? I can't seem to find the time.\" And they constantly say why They can't, they can't, they can't. \"There's this constraint. My boss wants this. My kids want that.\" They have every kind of excuse. And then I say, \"Okay, let's say that if you don't work out, 8:00 A.M. Monday morning, if you don't work out, you're going to have to pay me $10,000. Are you going to do it? Are you going to work out?\"\n\n(00:30:03):\n\"Well, of course, I'm going to work out. Easily. Yes, of course.\" Okay, so we've established you can. Now, we're just negotiating the price. So, this has to do with step four around making pacts, making what's called a pre-commitment, and one of them is a price pact. This is how I got in shape. I used to be clinically obese. Today, I'm in the best shape of my life, partially because I use these pacts. Now, the important thing is you have to do this last. If you don't figure out the internal triggers, most importantly, if you don't make time for traction in your schedule, if you don't hack back the external triggers, this fourth step won't work. But as the last line of defense, it's incredibly impactful and we can talk about how to do that, as well.\n\nLenny (00:30:39):\nI heard the all-in guys did this to lose weight. I think Sax and Jason did a pact, too. I think it was a lot of money, a hundred thousand dollars or something wild for...\n\nNir Eyal (00:30:49):\nOh, that's awesome. Actually, that's what I used to finish this book, as well. Maybe they read my book, I wonder, because I talked about this exact situation.\n\nLenny (00:30:55):\nYou hit it. It sounds like. You made it.\n\nNir Eyal (00:30:57):\nI did? Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:31:00):\nAnother trick I'll share that I found useful around the to-do list. So, I used to-do lists, but I've learned that I can't just let them grow is when I had a regular job. I wrote it down in a notebook and every morning, I rewrote the to-do list so that it reminded me like, \"Okay, I've copied this thing 10 times now. I'm not going to do it. I'm just going to push it out.\" So, that act of just rethinking about it every day was really impactful. But that works for people that are okay with an analog to-do list. If it's digital, that doesn't go away.\n\nNir Eyal (00:31:29):\nSo, I just want to clarify, there's nothing wrong with taking things out of your brain and putting them on a piece of paper. That's wonderful, but that's step one. And so, the big mistake that people make is they put stuff on their to-do list and then they wake up in the morning and what are they supposed to do? \"Well, I'll do whatever's on my to-do list.\" And so, what they tend to do is the easy stuff. I've known people, I hate to tell you, I used to do this myself, too. I would do a task and then forget to put it on my to-do list. So, I would go back in and write it on my to-do list just so I could check off the box. How messed up is that? It's ridiculous. And I think this is something that I think really does need to change is that we have this culture where checking stuff off your list is our little emotional reward, right?\n\n(00:32:12):\nBut that's ridiculous. We need to stop measuring ourselves by how many cute little boxes we check off. And rather, a much more important metric is not, \"Did I finish the task?\" I don't want you to track, \"Did I finish?\" That's not the important part, but people are probably scratching their heads. What do you mean? Isn't it all about finishing what I have to do? No, the important part is figuring out your productivity. It's figuring out how efficient you are at using your time. So, a much more beneficial metric to track is not, \"Did I check off the box? Did I finish?\" Rather, it's, \"Did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction?\" I'll say it again. \"Did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction?\"\n\n(00:32:53):\nBecause that is the only way to understand how long things take you. The problem with to-do lists is that there is no feedback loop, there's no feedback mechanism. How long do things take you? So, this is why you have what's called the planning fallacy with people who use to-do lists, which says that on average, studies have found that tasks take people three times longer to finish than they estimate. Why does that happen? Because when you say, \"Okay, here's that thing on the to-do list. I'm going to work on that and see how long it takes me to get it done.\" So, you work on it for five minutes and then you get an email and then you get a notification and then you start talking to one of your colleagues and you never actually track how long that thing took you to finish, as opposed to when you say, \"Look, I'm going to work on that task for as long as I said I would, but without distraction. That's it. That's all I'm going to do.\"\n\n(00:33:39):\nWhat you now have is a metric of how far you got. So, I worked on that presentation, it needs to be 30 slides long, and I worked on it for 30 minutes and I finished two slides. Okay, great. Well now, I know that I need 10 more of those time boxes to finish the entire task. And this is why it turns out that people who measure themselves the way I espouse of people who say, \"I'm just going to measure myself based on, did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction regardless of whether I finished,\" the kicker here is they actually finish more. They get more done than the to-do list people because now, they understand how long things take them to finish and they can appropriately time that as opposed to what most of us did.\n\n(00:34:20):\nWhat I used to do before I wrote Indistractable was procrastinate, procrastinate, procrastinate. \"Oh crap, I got to get this done. The deadline's here, so I'm going to work all night to finish it,\" and of course, that's not when you do your best work and it's very stressful.\n\nLenny (00:34:31):\nSince you mentioned deadlines, do you have any advice lessons on that as a tool to get things done?\n\nNir Eyal (00:34:36):\nWhat we find is that people who are very deadline motivated, they do finish what they say they're going to do, but of course, the quality is crap. They're typically getting by by the skin of their teeth, and I did this all the time. This is my entire college career and my MBA at Stanford career was waiting, waiting, waiting, and then finishing at the last moment. And I could do well enough, but of course, I could do so much better if I worked without distraction. And so, it wasn't until, and we all know this basically, right? We know that putting in a little bit of diligent effort, a little bit at a time with plenty of lead time is going to give us a much better result than cramming at the last minute. But the reason people don't do this is because they don't understand how important it is, one, to manage those internal triggers.\n\n(00:35:22):\nIf you're constantly thinking, \"Ugh, that project is going to suck. I don't really want to work on it. I don't want to make those sales calls. I don't want to make that presentation. I don't want to do that thing that feels uncomfortable,\" and you don't have the tools to deal with that discomfort, you're always going to procrastinate because fundamentally, procrastination is an emotion regulation problem. It's not a character flaw. There's nothing wrong with you, you're not broken. It's just that you don't have the tools to deal with emotional discomfort and that's the part that everybody skips over. So, we don't want to talk about these uncomfortable feelings, but that's where it has to start. And then, the part that people don't do is actually planning out not the task itself, but the time to work on the task without distraction. That's the part that if you can implement that step two that I talked about of making time for traction, that becomes a game changer.\n\nLenny (00:36:08):\nSo, I've tried things like this where it's here throughout the day, I'm going to try this, I'm going to do this and this, and I just don't end up doing it. Things come up or I just get distracted. I'm like, whatever. I guess one question is how often do you find yourself doing the things you set out in your calendar? And then two, any other advice for actually staying on track and doing things you set out to?\n\nNir Eyal (00:36:28):\nOkay, so number one, did you have tools in place to deal with the discomfort? What did you do when you didn't feel it?\n\nLenny (00:36:32):\nI did not. I did not have that surfing the wave and the ten-minute trick, and I'm curious if there's other tricks in that bucket actually, but no, I did not.\n\nNir Eyal (00:36:39):\nAbsolutely. Yeah. So, that's the most important thing and that is the most important section. That's why I put it at the front of the book because again, procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, and I think this is fascinating. Personally, I really wanted to dive deep and not only understand why do we not do what we say we're going to do, but why do we do anything and everything? What is the seat of human motivation? And I think I didn't understand it properly. I think most people don't understand motivation properly. Doesn't that blow your mind? If you think about it, \"I know what to do. I agree, this is what needs to get done. I just don't do it.\" Isn't that ridiculous? And by the way, this is not a new problem. Plato, 2500 years ago, the Greek philosopher talked about this very same problem. 2500 years before the internet, before social media, before all these things that we think are so distracting online, the Greek philosopher has had the same exact problem.\n\n(00:37:27):\nThis is part of the human condition. It is part of our DNA that we constantly get distracted. But to me, that's a fascinating mystery. Why is that? Well, if you look at the deeper question of why do we do anything and everything, the seat of human motivation most people think is about carrots and sticks. If you ask people, why do we do what we do? It's about the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Jeremy Bentham said something similar to this. Sigmund Freud called it the pleasure principle. Neurologically speaking, it's not true. It's not true. It's not about the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. It's not about carrots and sticks, but in fact, the carrot is the stick, okay? This is where I want to give you that matrix-like... Remember that scene, the Matrix, where there's that kid with a spoon and the spoon starts bending and the kid says, \"Imagine there is no spoon,\" right?\n\nLenny (00:38:14):\nAbsolutely.\n\nNir Eyal (00:38:14):\nWell, the carrot is the stick. What do I mean by that? We know that the only reason we do everything in anything from a neurological perspective is not about the pursuit of pleasure. It is all about the desire to escape discomfort. Everything you do, even the pursuit of pleasurable sensations, the carrot is the stick, because even wanting to feel good, craving, lusting, desire, hunger, that desire for something that feels good is itself psychologically destabilizing. The carrot is the stick. So, what that means, I think that's incredibly empowering because what that means is that whenever we don't do something, whenever we procrastinate, it's just a feeling. It's all it is. It's just a feeling. And so, when we learn those tools, it doesn't mean where I think people start intellectualizing it and thinking, \"There must be something broken with me. Maybe you need a pill, maybe you need a treatment.\"\n\n(00:39:07):\nChances are there's a ninety-nine percent chance, there's nothing wrong with you. It's simply that you don't have these tools. So, that's where we have to start, is absolutely understanding and applying these techniques so that when you feel that discomfort, you use that discomfort. What I found in my research writing this book is that high performers in every industry, business, the arts, sports, high performers, they feel the same internal triggers. They also feel lonely. They also feel bored. They also feel stressed. They also feel anxious, but they use that discomfort like a rocket fuel to propel them towards traction. Whereas what distractable people do, as soon as they feel uncomfortable, as soon as they feel bored, as soon as they feel lonesome, as soon as soon as they feel indecisive or stressed, boom, they're escaping it with a drink, with a click, with something to take their mind off of that discomfort. So, that has to be step number one.\n\nLenny (00:39:55):\nThat is fascinating. Basically, distraction is an emotional regulation problem. It's the way you put it. What else works in helping you manage that discomfort? We've talked about this ten-minute trick, the timer, the surfing of the urge. What else is in that bucket of things I could try when I'm just like, \"Nah, I'm just going to go check Twitter. I need to work on this thing, right now.\"\n\nNir Eyal (00:40:13):\nYeah, so there's a bunch of different techniques you can use there in terms of the internal triggers. We can get into some of the more nitty-gritty techniques. There's lots and lots of them. The most important thing here though is that once you have some in your toolkit that you want to try, let's say it's a ten-minute rule, it's surfing the urge, there's re-imagining the task, the temperament, all kinds of things that you can do. The next thing is to put it on your calendar, which we talked about briefly. So, let's say you say, \"Okay, I've got that time when I...\" What did you say that you want to do, that you check email instead?\n\nLenny (00:40:40):\nStart on my newsletter post for the next week, or just continue.\n\nNir Eyal (00:40:43):\nTo write it?\n\nLenny (00:40:44):\nYeah, write it.\n\nNir Eyal (00:40:46):\nOkay. And did you have that in your calendar? That was part of the time punch-me-in-the-face-if-I-don't-do-it kind of thing?\n\nLenny (00:40:50):\nThat was back when I had a regular job. These days, it's just, what I used to do is my first half of the day until 3:00 is just deep work time. I called it it's-time-to-build time, and then 3:00 beyond is meetings. So, it was actually a huge block of time of focus time, but it was not subdivided by the things I wanted to do throughout the day.\n\nNir Eyal (00:41:10):\nI see. Okay. So, step two would be putting on your calendar, \"I'm going to work on writing this newsletter for 30 minutes, 45 minutes, whatever amount of time.\" Make it whatever is reasonable for you based on how long you think you can do it. Put that on your schedule. Okay? Step number three is hack back the external triggers. So, did you find that when you said I was going to work on writing this newsletter, was there anything in your external environment that was pinging, dinging, kids, pets, spouse, anything like that?\n\nLenny (00:41:38):\nIt's interesting that now that you say that, just that fact that only 10% of distractions are from that. So, it makes me, on the one hand, I recognize that most of the time, there's not a thing pulling me to Twitter, LinkedIn, or whatever. Most of the time, it's just like, that's probably something interesting going on. But there's definitely times when I see a little badge or my little phone gets a little push or yeah, my wife's with a kid in the distance. I'm like, \"Oh, let's go check out what's happening there.\"\n\nNir Eyal (00:42:02):\nYeah. So, that's where we want to hack back. So, the reason I use the term hack. To hack something is to gain unauthorized access. Someone hacks into your bank account or hacks into your database. We know that these technologies are gaining unauthorized access to our attention span when they're constantly pinging and dinging us. So, there's some very simple things you can do. Setting a schedule in advance so that your device turns off as it goes to do-not-disturb during certain times of the day or before you begin this task, before you start writing, you make sure to turn on do-not-disturb, so that there's nothing in your way. On my desktop, I have a do-not-disturb set from midnight to 11:59 all the time. It's constantly on do-not-disturb because I don't want these constant notifications disturbing me when I'm doing focus work.\n\n(00:42:52):\nSo, making sure that that's on. When it comes to, many of us work from home today, so making sure that your family knows when the time is that you are indistractable. And I'll give you one tip. I know you have a baby at home, but soon, that baby is going to be a toddler. And so, one thing that we did in my household is that my wife went to Amazon and she got what we call the concentration crown. And the concentration crown is just this little wreath thing that she wears. It looks like a little princess thing. It has little LED lights. It lights up. There's a picture of it in the book. And when my daughter was only six years old, we told her, \"Look, whenever mommy is wearing the concentration crown, that means that she can't be interrupted and she will be with you within 30 minutes.\"\n\n(00:43:37):\nSo, her time block was always no more than 30 minutes. So, we said, \"We will be with you within 30 minutes. Please don't interrupt unless you're bleeding. Okay? If you're bleeding, you can interrupt us, but unless you're bleeding,\" this is when my daughter was only six years old. She could find something to do. It's okay for kids to be bored time to time, but as long as mommy was wearing the concentration crown that told her, and by the way, me, as her significant other, as her husband, worked really, really well because I would always interrupt her and say, \"Hey Julie, can I ask you this one thing?\" And she was working on her computer, but I didn't know whether she was listening to a podcast or a video or doing work that needed concentration. So, hacking back those external triggers, making sure that they don't gain unauthorized access by interrupting the interruption, whether it's with your kids, your colleagues.\n\n(00:44:24):\nSo, every copy of indistractable has this little pull-out piece of paper, this piece of card stock that you fold into thirds and you put on your computer monitor. Okay, it's this big red sign on your computer monitor that says, \"I'm indistractable at the moment. Please come back later.\" Now you can say, \"Well, why don't I just put on headphones and my colleagues will know I'm not to be interrupted?\" Yeah, but then they think you're putzing around, playing video games or something on your machine, as opposed to if you say, \"No, I'm doing focused work right now, please come back later,\" you're making it acceptable to not constantly be interrupted. You're making it okay culturally appropriate to work without distractions. So, those are just some ways that you can hack back those external triggers.\n\nLenny (00:45:03):\nI love that crown idea. I think a lot of people are going to use that. This time of year is prime for career reflection and setting goals for professional growth. I always like to spend this time reflecting on what I accomplished the previous year, what I hope to accomplish the next year, and whether this is the year, I look for a new opportunity.

I imagine, this is a lot of people are thinking. Is there like a way to block Twitter?\n\nNir Eyal (00:46:07):\nYeah, absolutely. So, that's a perfect lead-in to step number four. So, we talked about step one, master internal triggers, make time for traction, hack back the external triggers. We just talked about step number three. Step number four is preventing distraction with pacts. So with pacts, there's three kinds of pacts. We have a price pact, where there's some kind of financial disincentive to go off track. So, this is where we talked about earlier. You're making some kind of bet. We could talk about how I got into shape for the first time in my life using something like this. How I finished the book using something like this. That's a price pact. There's an identity pact, which is very, very impactful, which is what you're doing is you're forming a personal identity. So, this comes out of the psychology of religion where we know that people who call themselves a certain moniker. For example, if you say you're a devout Muslim, you're not debating whether you should have a gin and tonic because devout Muslims don't drink.\n\n(00:46:58):\nIf you say I'm a vegan or vegetarian, a vegetarian doesn't wake up in the morning and say, \"Hmm, I wonder if I should have a bacon sandwich for breakfast.\" No, they are vegetarian. That is who they are. So, that's why the book is called Indistractable. Indistractable Is meant to sound like indestructible. It is your identity, it is who you are. And so, is it any different for someone to say, \"You know what? I'm sorry I don't check every ping and ding every 30 seconds. I'm Indistractable. Or, \"You know what? If we're going to have a meal together, if we're going to sit down and have lunch together, I want to have that lunch free of distractions. So, can we put away our phones?\" Is that any different from someone who says, \"I have particular dietary preferences,\" or, \"I have a particular religious garb?\"\n\n(00:47:35):\nNo, maybe it's not the norm. Maybe it's a minority of people who do that. But that's what I think it's going to take for the world to become indistractable, is that more of us show how great of a life we can have when we have some of these principles and make it part of our identity. And then the third pact is what's called an effort pact. And this gets into your question around what kind of tools we can use. An effort pact is where there's some kind of friction, some kind of effort that you need to take in order to get distracted. So, as the last line of defense, that's why this is the fourth step, the last line of defense, the firewall against distraction is making sure that you keep yourself in just as much as we keep distractions out. So, I'll give you a personal story here. I don't don't know if this is a family show. Is it okay if I talk about my sex life a little bit?\n\nLenny (00:48:22):\nAbsolutely. Let's talk and get into it.\n\nNir Eyal (00:48:25):\nIt's not as exciting as it might sound. I've been married for twenty-two years now. My wife and I found that we weren't being as intimate as we used to be. And this was when I first started writing the book. And part of the problem was that every night, we would go to bed and she would be fondling her iPhone and I would be caressing my iPad. And we weren't being intimate because we were busy playing with our devices as opposed to each other. And so, I started doing this research around Indistractable and I learned about this technique around making an effort pact. And so, what we did, I went to the hardware store and I bought us this $10 outlet timer and this outlet timer, anything you plug into it will turn on or off at a particular time of day or night, whatever you set.\n\n(00:49:15):\nAnd so, in my household, until this very day, every night at 10:00 P.M., my internet router shuts off. So, what does that do? We know that every night, 10:00 P.M., the internet router's going to shut off. So, my daughter knows, my wife knows, I know. I got to get everything done that I need to do online because the internet's going to shut off. Now, could I turn the internet back on? Of course, I could. I could tether, I could go pull out the router and replug it in, but that takes effort. And so, what I've done is if all else fails, if the internal triggers, making time for traction, hacking back, if all else fails, I've inserted a bit of mindfulness in something that I used to be mindless about. Now, I have to ask myself, \"Wait a minute. Do I really need to go all that trouble of replugging and unplugging my router or should I do what I said I was going to do, which is get to bed on time and maybe be intimate with my wife?\"\n\n(00:50:05):\nIt's made a world of difference and I'll tell you honestly, Lenny. Now after a few years of doing this, it's become part of our routine. We all know bedtime's at 10:00 P.M. That's when we need to start getting ready for bed. The internet router's going to shut off. We actually don't even need this anymore because it's become part of our routine. So, that's one very cheap tool anyone can use as part of this effort pact. Another thing that I use almost every day, my daughter uses it as well, is this wonderful app called Forest. Do you know Forest?\n\nLenny (00:50:32):\nNo.\n\nNir Eyal (00:50:33):\nIt's awesome. So, here's the way Forest works. So, it's this cute little app here. I can show it to you. I'll pull it up. And the way Forest works is when you say you're going to do focused work time, you plug in how much work time you want. So, let's say I'm going to do 40 minutes of focused work time. There's that cute little virtual tree that's planted on my screen as soon as I hit go and if I pick up my phone and I do anything with it, that cute little virtual tree gets cut down. It's just a small reminder to say, \"Yep, that's not what you said you were going to do right now. You said you were going to work with that distraction. Here, you are picking up your phone.\" It reminds you, this is not what you said you were going to do. So, it inserts that bit of friction, that bit of effort. Another, you asked for more tools. Another product I love is called Focusmate. Have you tried Focusmate?\n\nLenny (00:51:22):\nIs that the one where they match you with somebody and you're kind of working, watching each other work?\n\nNir Eyal (00:51:25):\nYes, exactly. It's like a chat roulette without the dirty bits. So, I love this company so much, I actually invested in it. So basically, what you do is you go online, you look at this calendar and you pick a time when you want to do focused work. So, one of my issues used to be getting started. Once I got started, I was good, but getting started 8:00 A.M., I kind of like what you were saying with this cold start problem. So, what it does is it gives you this pact, again, this pre-commitment you're making with another person, \"Okay, 8:00 A.M., I'm going to be there. And if you don't show up, you're going to get a bad review.\" So, it binds you to another person to build this effort pact to say, \"I will be here at that time.\" You say, \"Okay, what are you working on? What am I working on? All right, go.\" And for that entire time box, you work without distraction. And just seeing that other person who's also working without distraction is a wonderful way to bind you into what you said you were going to do.\n\n(00:52:17):\nSo, those are just a few tools. There's many, many others.\n\nLenny (00:52:20):\nAmazing. Okay, so let me actually try to just list out all the things you've shared so far and it's going to be across all the four steps and then I'm going to follow up on a couple things here. So, here's my notes. One is this idea of just set a ten-minute timer and just tell yourself, \"I am going to work on something that I really want to work on right now for 10 minutes and that's all I'm going to do.\" And while you're doing that, surf the urge, you're going to feel like you don't, but just surf it and feel it and be aware that this is difficult. The calendaring of your day, that feels like a fundamental part of your approach is just figure out what you want to do during the day. Ahead of time, put it on the calendar. So, your to-do list is your calendar, essentially.\n\n(00:53:02):\nThere's this whole idea of pacts. You shared a bunch of different pact ideas, there's like I'll pay you a lot of money if I don't do this. There's this Wi-Fi. Okay. And then I guess that translates into some of these other things. The Wi-Fi killer device, the Forest app, the Focusmate app and product. And then there's a few other things you shared. Just do not disturb, like set a timer so that during the day, you have do-not-disturb on during set times. For you, it's all the time, which I try to do, too. And then obviously, let your wife through important contacts and then make your family aware of when you're going to be working so that they know not to bother you. Maybe this concentration crown.\n\nNir Eyal (00:53:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:53:42):\nOkay. Before we move on to a different topic, I'd love to spend a little more time in that first bucket because it feels like your point is so important that most of our distraction is this emotional regulation and we just don't like discomfort. And so, I'm curious what else you could teach me and teach people about getting better at managing that emotion. Are there any other tactics in that bucket that might be useful?\n\nNir Eyal (00:54:02):\nAbsolutely. So, there's three big buckets in terms of mastering these internal triggers. We can reimagine the task, reimagine the trigger, and reimagine our temperament. And so, maybe I can give you one big tip I think that I discovered when it came to reimagining our temperament. If we think about our temperament as these immutable qualities, as the attributes of our personality, we have to be very careful about what kind of identity and what kind of limitations we let in to our psyche. And I'll give you a good example of this. So, a few years ago, there was this line of research around what's called ego depletion. Ego depletion is this idea that willpower is a depletable resource. And you saw some researchers doing studies that seem to suggest that willpower was something that you run out of, that for me, I would come home after a long day of work and I'd say, \"Oh, I'm out of willpower. I'm 'spent', there's nothing else I can do. Give me that pint of Ben and Jerry's. I'm going to sit in front of the TV because I'm spent. There's no more willpower left.\"\n\n(00:55:03):\nAnd some of these studies seem to suggest there was this phenomenon except the problem became that in the social sciences when something sounds a little fishy, when it sounds too good to be true, the scientific process dictates that we should rerun those studies. And it turns out that these studies around ego depletion could not replicate. We couldn't find the effect. And so, there was one exception to this and that exception was in a study done by Carol Dweck, she's one of my research heroes. She wrote the book Mindset, you're probably familiar with, and she did a fascinating study where she found that ego depletion does actually exist, but only for one group of people.\n\n(00:55:42):\nWho was that group of people? It turns out that the only people who really did run out of willpower the way you would run out of charge in a battery were people who believed that willpower was a limited resource. And so, this is super, super important to not let ourselves be influenced by these ridiculous notions, these beliefs that somehow we are impaired, that we are limited, that we're addicted. That's a really popular one, that we're all addicted, we're all unable to control these behaviors. That is not true. And in fact, it's only true if you believe it is true. So, it should be part of our practice to tell ourselves we are indistractable. Indistractable is meant to sound like indestructible. It's meant to sound like a superpower. So, repeating to yourself that you're not limited, it's just about your actions. It's not a moral failing. It's not something wrong with you. It's not that technologies are doing it to you. It's simply a series of behaviors that we have to practice.\n\nLenny (00:56:37):\nI really like that. That's a theme that comes up a lot on this podcast is people that feel like they're responsible for their situation, they didn't cause it, but they're still responsible. It is their responsibility to deal with it, end up being more successful. And there's this idea of just being high agency.\n\nNir Eyal (00:56:52):\nSo, one of the things that I think is important to remember here is that there's a lot of things that the individual can do. I think there's a lot of things that we can do within a company or an organization, as well, that we can make our workplace indestructible. But then I think there's some things that we can do on a societal level, and these are called social antibodies. That social antibodies are when society spreads norms or manners that help us overcome otherwise antisocial or destructive behaviors. And so, the good news is that we have been here before with something far more harmful and far more addictive than social media or technology distractions. If you think back to the 1980s, I was a child of the '80s. I remember the '80s very well, and I remember when I was growing up, we had ashtrays in our living room.\n\n(00:57:41):\nIn fact, everyone I knew had ashtrays in their living room. And today, that sounds crazy. You couldn't imagine walking into someone's home and lighting up a cigarette. If someone did that to you, that would be crazy. No one would do that today. Well, why? Why did that happen? Why would it be so incredibly rude to just walk into someone's home and light up a cigarette? Well, because there wasn't a law that said that that was illegal, someone's private residence. What changed was that we have new norms, new manners around how to behave when it comes to these destructive behaviors. So, I remember when my mom took away those ashtrays in our living room and she threw them away, and one day, one of her friends came over and took out a pact of cigarettes and was about to light a cigarette. My mom said, \"No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. We are nonsmokers.\"\n\n(00:58:26):\nYou see, she had this now and that she used to describe herself. She described herself as a nonsmoker. If you'd like to smoke, if you'd kindly go outside. And of course, that's the norm today. But it took great people like my mom to go against the trend for these antisocial behaviors. So, I think the same thing is going to happen when it comes to becoming indistractable. Frankly, with or without my book, my book was intended to accelerate this process, but we're going to do this naturally because what humans do throughout history when it comes to figuring out how to use a technology well is that we adapt and we adopt. We adapt to the technology by forming new behaviors, new norms. So, just like my mom said, \"Hey, we are nonsmokers. That's my identity. I'm a nonsmoker. If you'd like to smoke, you're going to have to go outside.\"\n\n(00:59:09):\nWe need to be comfortable with saying, \"Hey, we are indistractable.\" If someone sits down with you across the table and you're having a nice conversation, they take out their funny, say, \"Hey, hey, if we're going to have a conversation, let's be here both in body and mind.\" That means putting these devices outside of meetings. If we're going to have a business meeting or a personal meeting, we're going to declare these no-phone zones because that's who we are. We want to be indistractable. So, we adopt these new behaviors and we see that happening already. And then we adapt to these behaviors, I should say, with these new norms. And then we adopt new technologies that help us fight the bad aspects of the last generation of technology, and that's what we have always done.\n\n(00:59:48):\nIn fact, right now, there's an explosion of tech companies that are making a lot of money. A lot of these apps and startups are making money with tools to help fix the last generation of technology. And so, there's all kinds of tools listed in my book from Forest and Focusmate, all kinds of tools that can help us put technology in its place, ironically enough, with new and better technology.\n\nLenny (01:00:09):\nYou've touched on this point that I want to come back to around how you're not as confident that we're as addicted to technology and apps as we think, and I think that's really important. I'm excited to chat about it. Before we get there, I wanted to chat and follow this thread essentially of becoming Indistractable at work and building a company essentially that helps your teammates become less distractable. What advice would you give to leaders at companies to help employees at the company have better focus, essentially?\n\nNir Eyal (01:00:37):\nA lot of folks that I've worked with in the past have said, \"Look, I can become indistractable. I follow these four steps, fantastic. I'm indistractable. But what if my company's not indistractable? How do I help other people become indistractable? Or what if my boss is not indistractable and they're constantly asking me and pinging and dinging me for stuff and I'm not able to do my best work? So, what do I do about that?\" So, there's a whole section in the book on how to build an indistractable workplace. And what I discovered was in the research in writing this book is that indistractable companies have three traits. And so, the first trait is that Indistractable companies provide employees with what's called psychological safety. This comes out of the research from Amy Edmondson at the Harvard Business School. And what she discovered was truly that companies have to provide employees with psychological safety.\n\n(01:01:23):\nMeaning, if you can't talk about a problem, if you can't raise your hand and say, \"Hey, you know what? I'm just not able to do my best work when I'm constantly expected to reply to every email, to every notification, every 30 seconds. I can't do my best work.\" If you can't talk about this problem, that is the problem. As I like to say, distraction is a symptom of dysfunction. Distraction is a symptom of dysfunction. And when it comes to the workplace, if you don't give employees that psychological safety to say, \"Hey, how do we deal with this problem just like any other problem?\" That in fact is a problem. It's not the technology, it's the fact that you can't get together and talk about this problem without fear of somebody thinking, \"Oh, you're lazy,\" or, \"You don't want to be on call,\" or, \"You're expecting other people to work for you.\"\n\n(01:02:04):\nNo, that's not the issue at all. It's simply that we need to formulate how to fix this problem just like any other business challenge. The second trait is employees need a forum to talk about this problem. So, in researching this book, I ask people, what's the most distracting technology? What technology in the workplace do you find to be most distracting? The number two was some kind of group messaging service, and Slack was mentioned the most number of times. By the way, number one was email. Number two was some kind of group messaging platform, and Slack was mentioned the most often. And so, I went to visit Slack headquarters. I went to go see my friend Amir, who used to work there at the time, and I knocked on the door and I expected to see a company that was incredibly distracted because if it was the technology that was the source of the problem, nobody uses Slack more than Slack.\n\n(01:02:52):\nThey should be the most distracted company on earth. But that's not what I found at all because Slack, in fact, embodied these three attributes. They gave people psychological safety. They gave people a forum to talk about these problems. How did they do that? They actually created Slack channels at Slack. They had one Slack channel called Beef Tweets, and Beef Tweets was a channel where people could talk about their beef with a company. And it wasn't that necessarily management had to fix every problem. That's not the point. It's that they had to acknowledge that employee's voices were being heard. And how did they do that? Surprisingly enough, they did it with emoji. So, when a problem that an employee mentioned was fixed, they sent the green check mark emoji, but if it was a problem that maybe couldn't be fixed, but what they wanted to acknowledge that management had seen it, they would send the eyes emoji.\n\n(01:03:38):\nAnd so, the important thing here is to give employees some kind of forum. It could be a Slack channel, it could be another case study in the book is the Boston Consulting Group, which I used to work at. They've gone from one of the most distractable companies to today. They're ranked as one of the best places to work in America. They have these meetings where they talk about PTO, predictable time off. And so, they completely changed that organizational culture by following these steps, as well. The last, the third attribute, which is the most important of the three, is that management must exemplify what it means to be indistractable because culture is like water. It flows downhill. And so, people will look to management to see how they behave, and they will act in accordance with those expectations. So, at Slack Company headquarters, in the company canteen, it says in bright pink letters, it says, \"Work hard and go home.\"\n\n(01:04:31):\nWork hard and go home. That is not something you would expect to see at a hard charging Silicon Valley startup, but that's what you see there because everybody in the company, this was before the acquisition. I don't know what it's like now, but when I wrote the book, this was certainly the case that everybody from Stewart Butterfield on down, the CEO on down, believed that to do people's best work, they had to work without distraction. So, if you use Slack on nights and weekends, you were told, \"That's not what we do here.\" You were reprimanded because that was not part of the company culture. So, it's really those three traits, psychological safety, a form to talk about these problems, and management has to exemplify what it means to be indistractable.\n\nLenny (01:05:04):\nI want to move to a different topic, but before we do, is there one thing or maybe two things that a listener can do, say today or tomorrow or this week, that would make it significant dent on their ability to focus and avoid distraction?\n\nNir Eyal (01:05:18):\nI would say understanding these four steps of master the internal triggers, make time for traction, hack back the external triggers, and preventing distraction with pacts. If you can do one small thing in each of those four strategies, one small thing, that's a wonderful, wonderful first step. You don't have to do everything in the book. I'm giving you many of different options, but one small thing in each of those categories is huge. Now, when it comes to the workplace, one of the benefits of making a time box calendar is that you have a physical artifact. You have something that you can print out and show to other people. And so, I hear this a lot when it comes to people who say, \"Okay, I'm indistractable but my boss isn't, what do I do? I'm constantly ping and ding from my boss. How do I get control over my time?\"\n\n(01:06:02):\nHere's what you do. This is called schedule syncing or managing your manager. Here's what happens. You print out your calendar or you show it to them on your screen, and you say, \"Hey boss, I need 10 minutes with you, Monday morning. Is that okay? Can I get 10 minutes with you?\" And now, what you're going to do is you're going to show them your time box calendar for your working hours. You're going to say, \"Okay, boss, you see here's my time for email. Here's my time for that meeting you asked me to go to. Here's time for that big project I'm working on. Now, you see this other piece of paper? Okay, you see this other list here? This is a list of things you've asked me to do that I'm having trouble fitting into my calendar.\" So, what I'm helping you do here is avoiding the worst piece of personal productivity advice.\n\n(01:06:40):\nThe worst piece of personal productivity advice is if you want to be better at time management, you need to learn how to say no. What kind of stupid advice is that? Only a tenured professor who can't get fired would give you that kind of stupid advice. If you tell your boss no, you're going to get fired, that's dumb. You don't tell your boss no, you ask your boss to help you prioritize. That is your boss' most important job is to prioritize. So, you're not saying no. You're saying, \"Here's my calendar. Here's this list of stuff you've asked me to do. Help me prioritize.\" And here's what's going to happen. Your boss is going to look at your calendar and say, \"You know what? That meeting, you really don't need to be at that meeting. But that thing on that piece of paper that you listed over here, that's way more important. Can you swap that out?\"\n\n(01:07:23):\nAnd let me tell you, I've started three companies. I've sold two so far, and bosses, your manager will worship the ground you walk on because we're all wondering, \"What is it that you're doing?\" And I know we have to trust our employees, et cetera, et cetera. Yes. But we're still wondering, \"Hey, that thing that you said was going to be done isn't done. Why not? How are you spending your time?\" So, if you can proactively sit down with your boss so that they understand how you are spending your time, and again, this takes maybe 10 minutes, you do this schedule sync process that not only works really well in the workplace, it also works really well at home. So, my wife and I used to have conflicts over who's going to pick up our daughter, and why didn't you take out the trash? And we would have these conflicts because we didn't synchronize our schedules.\n\n(01:08:07):\nWell, now, we take maybe five minutes a week. Sunday evening, we sit down together. Let me look at your schedule. Let me look at my schedule. \"Okay, now we're synchronized. It's amazing.\" We prevent so many conflicts just by doing this simple schedule sync process.\n\nLenny (01:08:20):\nI love that advice. I recommend a very similar approach to people to align with their managers. Basically, I call it managing up. And the way I describe it, manager taught me this is, I call it prioritizing and communicating. You could prioritize and not communicate, and your manager would be like, \"What the hell? Why didn't you do this thing?\" It's, \"I prioritized. I never told you. Here's where I put it on my list.\" Or you could just communicate like, \"No,\" and that doesn't work as you said. The best combination is just like, \"Here's what I'm doing, here's why I will prioritize this and let me know what you think. Would you agree? You want to move it up? You want to move it down?\"\n\nNir Eyal (01:08:51):\nExactly. And how much input. We always talk about one of the reasons I hate to-do lists is because to-do lists are just a register of output. It's the stuff you want to have done, but you can't have output without input. If you go to a baker, let's say it's your kid's birthday party and say, \"Hey, I want two dozen cupcakes.\" Well, the baker's going to say, \"Okay, I need flour, I need sugar, I need butter. I need all these inputs in order to make the output.\" But somehow when it comes to knowledge work, we just add more and more outputs without considering the input. What is the input for knowledge work? It's only two things. It's your time and your attention. That's it. Your time and your attention. So, in order to get the output, we have to think about the input, which is why the schedule syncing and time boxing is so important. Again, that's something that a to-do list can never give you.\n\nLenny (01:09:36):\nAwesome. Okay. For our last topic, I wanted to spend some time on Hooked, which I think could be its own podcast. That could be a whole other episode of your first book that did really well. And essentially, this book, Hooked, is about teaching people how to get people hooked on their product. I know that you have this very contrarian perspective on, are we actually addicted to technology? Is it hurting mental health? All these things. So, this is contrarian corner. I'd love to hear your perspective on just, why is it that we're not as hooked on social media and technology as people think?\n\nNir Eyal (01:10:08):\nYeah. Okay, so there's a lot there. So, let me explain what Hooked was for compared to Indistractable. So, Hooked is about how do we build habit-forming products for good. And so, the idea there was that I think we need to use more of these techniques when it comes to healthy behaviors. We want people to get hooked to a language learning app. Duolingo, one of my former clients. That's a great thing that they found ways to get people hooked to learning a new language compared to the way we used to learn languages. Getting people hooked to exercise. One of the case studies in Hooked is Fitbot, which is an app that helps people form these habits around exercise. Getting hooked to a personal finance app to help you save money, getting hooked to enterprise software. That's all great, right? If it helps you become more productive, helps you live a happier, healthier life, that's wonderful.\n\n(01:10:53):\nSo, nobody's worried about people getting addicted to enterprise SaaS. That's not an issue. So, the vast majority of products out there, they're not worried about addicting anyone. The real problem the vast majority of businesses out there have is that nobody cares. They have a wonderful product that could really improve people's lives, but people aren't using it. And so, it's really about how do you get people to keep coming back to your product or service, not because they have to, but because they want to. And so, what essentially I do at Hooked is steal the secrets of these Silicon Valley giants. I literally ripped out their psychology to understand what makes their products work so well, so that everybody in every conceivable industry that is devoted to improving people's lives can use those habits for good. So, that's what Hooked is for. So, if Hooked is about good habits, Indistractable is about how do we break bad habits, but for different products, we want to build a good habit with the exercise app, with these SaaS app, with the good habits, and we also want to break the bad habits.\n\n(01:11:49):\nSo, that's the two sides of the same coin. They're not negations, they're complements. And I think I am uniquely qualified to write both these books because I know these techniques work and I know where they don't work. And I can tell you, having written Hooked, these techniques are very good. They're very effective. They're not that good. This isn't mind control. We're not hijacking people's brains. And there's a lot of people out there, a lot of tech critics have made a lot of money and gotten a lot of speaking gigs over scaring the crap out of people because people love that stuff. I was a journalism co-major in college, and the first rule of journalism is if it bleeds, it leads. So, you can get a lot more attention and a lot more press, a lot more invites to Ted Talks if you tell people, \"Technology is melting your brain, it's super evil. Let's shut it all down.\"\n\n(01:12:40):\nThis is the classic chicken little story. People love that stuff. The truth is much more nuanced, but nobody likes nuance. Nobody likes the answer to every complex question, which is always the same. \"It depends. It depends.\" For some people, overusing technology is a real problem. So, for people who are pathologically addicted, that can be very harmful because, what is the definition of addiction? An addiction is a compulsive dependency on a behavior or substance that harms the user. Now, that's about 3% to 5% of the population is pathologically addicted, but we toss out this word addiction all the time. Everything's addictive. My wife ordered a shoes from DSW, and on the box it says, \"Danger, addictive contents inside.\" It's shoes, people. Shoes. And so, what we have done by pathologizing, by medicalizing this behavior is that now, everything's an addiction. \"Oh, you like playing Candy Crush? It's addictive. You like social media. It's addictive.\"\n\n(01:13:37):\nNo, it's not addictive to everyone. No more than saying, \"Hey, a lot of people have a glass of wine with dinner, but not everyone's an alcoholic. So, why do we think everyone who uses social media is addicted?\" They're not. But we love that terminology. We love it. Why? Because even the word addiction comes from the Latin addictio, which means slave. So, it's much easier to tell ourselves, \"I'm enslaved. My brain is being hijacked. My focus is being stolen. It's all Silicon Valley's fault.\" As opposed to saying, \"Wait a minute, this isn't really a distraction.\" I'm sorry. \"It's not really an addiction, it's a distraction,\" because then now I have personal responsibility. Now, I have to do something about it. That's no fun. Can I just blame somebody? But for the vast majority of people, save the people who are actually pathologically addicted, which by the way, I do think we need special protections for. If you're not a child who I do think we need special protections for, and you're not pathologically addicted, this is a personal responsibility issue that thankfully, all of us can overcome if we have the right tools.\n\nLenny (01:14:33):\nWow, this is quite the contrarian juicy corner. I wish we had more time to dig into all this stuff. So, basically, I checked Twitter a lot. I checked my phone a lot. You're saying that essentially, don't call it addiction. I'm just finding more things to get distracted by to push away from all these uncomfortable emotions that I'm feeling doing hard work.\n\nNir Eyal (01:14:52):\nThat's exactly right. And again, it doesn't mean it's your fault, but it is your responsibility as we talked about earlier, because who else's responsibility is it? We love these simple narratives. We love these simple stories of something bad is happening, so this is the bad guy. Well, sometimes the bad guy is also us, or at least we have a role to play in taking responsibility for this stuff. And so, if it was something that is insurmountable, if something you can't do anything about, for example, children, I think children are a protected class. My fifteen-year-old can't walk into a bar and order a gin and tonic. She can't walk into a casino and start playing blackjack. She's not ready for that. So, I do think we need regulations to protect children. I think we also need protections around people who are actually pathologically addicted.\n\n(01:15:35):\nIf you know people are getting addicted to your product, you do have an ethical responsibility. And I've written about this for the past 10 years now about specific legislation that I think we need around what's called a use and abuse policy for people who are pathologically addicted. But for 95% of us, it's not an addiction. It's something we can absolutely take control over if we want to and if we have the right tools.\n\nLenny (01:15:58):\nVery interesting food for thoughts. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with?\n\nNir Eyal (01:16:06):\nThere's a wonderful quote that I really love from Paulo Coelho who said that, \"A mistake repeated more than once is a decision.\" A mistake repeated more than once is a decision, such a great quote. And I think it's time that we realize that if we are not doing something about this problem, we are deciding to be distractable. The difference between an indistractable person and a distractable person is that an indistractable person says, \"Ah, okay, I see what you did to me there. I see I got distracted. I'm not going to let it happen again.\" How many times can we get distracted by social media, by whatever, before we say, \"Okay, I'm going to take steps today to prevent getting distracted tomorrow\"? That's what defines an indistractable person. So, if you really want to summarize my work in Indistractable into one Mantra, it's that the antidote for impulsiveness is forethought. The antidote for impulsiveness is forethought. Fundamentally, distraction is an impulse control issue. That's all it is, and it's a skill like any other.\n\n(01:17:04):\nWe learn skills. Why do we expect that we should just be born with this innate skill to fight distraction? It's a skill like any other. And so, the antidote for impulsiveness is forethought. If we plan ahead, if we know that we're going to take steps a day to prevent getting distracted tomorrow, there's no distraction we can't overcome.\n\nLenny (01:17:22):\nI love it. I love the message of empowerment and agency. I feel like that's so applicable to product management and a lot of the people that listen to this podcast. And just another example of that even though the world is making life more difficult for us, potentially, you could still do something about it. And I really like just the general message that you can do something about it. With that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nNir Eyal (01:17:44):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny (01:17:45):\nAll right. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nNir Eyal (01:17:48):\nThere's this book called Alchemy by Rory Sutherland that I love. It's a fantastic book. It delves into the psychology of various experiences. So, highly recommend that. And I'm reading a book right now, actually. It's all myself right here called The Experience Machine by Andy Clark, which I'm really enjoying.\n\nLenny (01:18:04):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nNir Eyal (01:18:08):\nOkay, so it's not very recent, but it's one of my all time favorite movies that nobody's seen, which is Empire of the Sun. Have you ever seen Empire of the Sun?\n\nLenny (01:18:16):\nNope.\n\nNir Eyal (01:18:17):\nOkay, you got to see it. So, one of my favorite movies, it has Christian Bale in it when he was only, I think, 12 or 13 years old. Steven Spielberg was the director, John Malkovich stars in it. Unbelievable movie that for some reason nobody saw. So, if you're a Christian Bale fan, which I am, I think he's a fantastic actor, Empire of the Sun, classic, awesome movie.\n\nLenny (01:18:38):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask people when you're hiring them for a job?\n\nNir Eyal (01:18:43):\nI'm not a big fan of interviews in general. I'm a huge fan of small projects. So, what I'll oftentimes do is pay people to do a small project and then I can see their work output. I find that that works much, much better than any question I can come up with.\n\nLenny (01:18:59):\nAwesome. A few other people have mentioned that exact idea, especially at a company. I think about Linea, where they pay people to do a little project within their company. They're kind of like contractors for the company for a little bit.\n\nNir Eyal (01:19:09):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:19:10):\nIs there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love, whether it's an app or something physical?\n\nNir Eyal (01:19:15):\nI went to Japan a few months ago and I just became obsessed with all things Japanese, and so I bought a hundred different little gadgets that helped me make Japanese food at home. So, I had this little sesame grinder thing. The Japanese are so good at making devices for everything, so I would just put this under the general bucket of everything Japanese.\n\nLenny (01:19:36):\nI use Muji pens, which is an amazing Japanese brand. They're just like...\n\nNir Eyal (01:19:43):\nYes, we have Muji. Yes, exactly. I have some of those, as well. They're great.\n\nLenny (01:19:44):\nGo Japan. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends, either at work or life, that you find really useful?\n\nNir Eyal (01:19:52):\nSo, I do have several mantras that I repeat to myself daily. One of those is my life purpose. My purpose in life is to explain the world so that it can be made better. Now, that might not apply to everyone. That's my personal life motto. It kind of just helps me recenter and refocus my purpose for living, which is to serve others, to make the world a better place. And the way I do that is to explain the world so that it can be made better. So, of course, that's not going to apply to everyone, but I do think there is something very useful about sitting down and saying, \"Wait, what is the purpose of my life?\" And so, for me, having that mantra, which I literally repeat every single day as like a little prayer, I'm very secular. I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I think there's a lot of wisdom to be adopted from the practices of organized religion, and one of those is this secular prayer reminding me of my purpose.\n\nLenny (01:20:36):\nI love that. Final question. You wrote a book about building habits. What's your best and worst habit these days?\n\nNir Eyal (01:20:45):\nThis is tricky. So, I think the reason I'm struggling answering this is because there's a difference between habits and routines and a lot of things that people think are habits are not really habits. So, I was going to say exercise. I used to be clinically obese and now I exercise. But that's not technically a habit because it's not done with little or no conscious thought. It's a routine, but I think that's probably one of my best routines is that I've finally, for the first time in my life, really gotten into physical fitness. I have maybe not quite a six-pack, but maybe like a four-pack at forty-five years old. I'm pretty proud of that and I'm not saying that to brag. I'm saying it as a testimony to the fact that when you say you're going to do something and actually do it, how wonderful that feels.\n\n(01:21:29):\nJust live your life with intent. I'm not athletic. I never was athletic. I still don't really like exercise, but I do it and I eat right because I say I will. So, I think that's probably my best routine and probably my worst habit is that I still feel these impulses. If the definition of a habit is an impulse to do or behavior with little or no conscious thought, you better well damn believe that I feel the impulse to check Instagram for a quick minute or to look at this. I still feel that. I think the difference is that now, I know I'm going to feel those. I know that's part of my daily experience, and I have those practices in place so that they don't get the best of me.\n\nLenny (01:22:04):\nJust along those lines, something I was going to ask but I forgot is, how often do you not do the things you had in your calendar? What percentage of the things don't get done the way you planned?\n\nNir Eyal (01:22:12):\nSo, when things change dramatically, then I tend to fall off track. So, the first time, if I make a big change in my calendar, I'm much more likely to fall off track. The more I can go from week to week with small parts of my calendar changing, the more I'll get to a hundred percent doing what I say I'm going to do. But I would say on average, once I have, I pretty much have my more or less calendar set for the week. I would say maybe 10% of the tasks I'll go a little too late on or I'll start, but then of course the idea is to make sure that doesn't happen again next time.\n\n(01:22:41):\nBut there is, of course, some wiggle room. So, when that might happen, let's say it's 10% of the time I go off track, well then I'll say, \"You know what? I put in too much time for writing. An hour of writing is too much. Maybe I should just start with 45 minutes. Let's see if I can do that block. I'll adjust it a little bit because I got other stuff that I want to take care of.\" So, it's those small adjustments within day-to-day, whereas before I wrote Indistractable, it was all kinds of stuff. It was half the day that I would go off track.\n\nLenny (01:23:07):\nAmazing. I was going to ask what it was like beforehand. Nir, I think we delivered on our promise. There's at least a dozen very tactical things you can do to become more indistractable and to focus better. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks learn more about the stuff you're doing? Where do they buy your book? Where they learn more about the things you can do for them? And then finally, how can listeners be sold to you?\n\nNir Eyal (01:23:28):\nI appreciate it. Thanks. So, my website is nirandfar.com. That's spelled like my first name, nirandfar.com. And my two books, Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, and they're available wherever books are sold and what you can do for me, become indistractable. Honestly, I don't care if you buy the book. If you can adopt some of these practices and help change this mindset that we're all victims, that we're being hijacked because of the tech companies. If you can start putting the word out there that this is something that has improved your life in some small way and tell others about it, this is how we start spreading those social antibodies, just like my mom did around smoking. I think we should all do the same.\n\nLenny (01:24:09):\nI am going to be working on that as soon as we get off. Nir, thank you so much for being here.\n\nNir Eyal (01:24:14):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:24:15):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:24:18):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# The 10 traits of great PMs, AI, and Slack’s approach to product | Noah Weiss (Slack, Google)\n\n## Transcript\n\nNoah Weiss (00:00:00):\nWe have this mental metaphor that we talk a lot about, getting to the next hill. The actual wording is \"Take bigger boulder bets.\" I think teams can often get lost crawling up that hill, not realizing that there's a huge, incredibly beautiful range behind it where we've over time freighted new teams from scratch that incubated in a new area before the areas mature.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:00:19):\nWe did that with a lot of these native audiovisual products like huddles and clips really in the pandemic because our customers were demanding it from us. I think in the AI space, we're trying to hear from customers, what do you wish Slack could do if it had these new superpowers? Let's incubate a couple teams or prototype, give them space to run and pilot and then get something to launch that's amazing. Blows people away. That's the formula that we've seen.\n\nLenny (00:00:45):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Noah Weiss. Noah is chief product officer at Slack where he spent the last seven years. Prior to that he was head of product at Foursquare, which is near and dear to my heart as you'll hear at the top of this episode. Prior to that, he was a PM at Google and at Fog Creek Software.\n\nLenny (00:01:10):\nIn our conversation we cover the 10 traits of great product managers, how to work effectively with strongly opinionated and product-minded founders, what Noah has learned about working effectively with AI in your product over his last 15 years at Google and Foursquare and now Slack. We talk about a process called Complaint Storms that helps Slack build better product. Plus, what he is learned from Slack's self-service business plateauing back in 2019 and how they turned it around and what they took away from that experience.\n\nLenny (00:01:38):\nAlso, how he thinks about competition with Microsoft Teams and with Discord. Also, a bunch of new data advice, which I found very helpful. This was such a great in-depth conversation about all things product and leadership, and I'm really excited for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Noah Weiss after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nLenny (00:01:58):\nThis episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life.\n\nLenny (00:02:22):\nThis has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius. Together, we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact.\n\nLenny (00:02:46):\nGuided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at sidebar today? Jump the growing wait list of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more. That's sidebar.com/lenny.\n\nLenny (00:03:17):\nThis episode is brought to you by Superhuman. How much time do you spend in email each day? How about your team?

I'm excited to finally get to join and been a longtime listener.\n\nLenny (00:04:29):\nI feel the same way in reverse. I've been really excited that you're finally on the podcast. I don't know if you know this, but this is actually going to be the last podcast I'm recording before I go on pat leave. This is going to play while I'm on break. Coincidentally, you're actually just returning from pat leave is what I just learned.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:04:46):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:04:48):\nLet me ask you a question. What advice do you have for someone about to enter the beginning of baby life from someone that is exiting that and going back to work?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:04:55):\nFirst off, I mean obviously congratulations, you're about to go on. A rollercoaster of emotion, sleep and everything else. I literally went back to work two days ago. I think my, maybe, advice about being a new parent is better than my advice about being at PM right now. Here are the three ... My wife and I wind up coming up with three maxims that we want to be using throughout the first two months to keep ourselves grounded.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:05:19):\nFirst one, I would say a little bit better every day. No matter how many books you read and how much money ouster you consume, there's nothing like actually doing it. It's a physical thing being a new parent. Getting a little bit better every day, giving yourself permission to be like that didn't go great and that's okay. That's number one.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:05:39):\nNumber two, don't over extrapolate from the early days. The fourth trimester is a real thing. These babies come out. They're not fully baked. They can't even support their own heads. If you try to extrapolate everything, the next 18 years are going to be the first 18 days, it's going to be sobering. Keep that perspective. They develop so much every week, part of the fun.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:06:03):\nThen the third thing, which I got advice from this from a good friend is like you got to fully get into it as a parent. There's nothing that replaces. Actually, you got to change the diapers. You got to do the feeds. When they're up, even though they can't talk, you got to talk to them. You got to listen to what they're saying and just be fully present near the moment.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:06:24):\nI realized for myself, and then basically at full digital detox. You saw how long it took for me to reply to your emails. I was like, \"Throw the devices away. Just fully with our daughter, [inaudible 00:06:34], and our family.\" I feel like it was so much more rewarding. I felt really connected with her now after these couple months. It's a crazy time. You're going to really love it. It's going to drive you mad at that times as well. That's all of it.\n\nLenny (00:06:47):\nAll right. We're going to be pivoting this podcast into a parenting podcast. This is awesome advice. I wrote everything you just said on this little post-it as you're talking. I'm going to put that up in our nursery and see how it all goes. One thing that's tough about my career path in this weird life is I don't get a nice pat leave, paid pat leave from a big company.\n\nLenny (00:07:06):\nI've actually been working on stacking guest post and podcast ahead of my leave so that I can actually, as exactly as you said, just get fully into it.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:07:14):\nSmart.\n\nLenny (00:07:16):\nYeah. I have awesome guest posts coming. All these podcasts are backlogged, so I'm hoping it all works out.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:07:21):\nThat's a smart way to do it. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:07:23):\nOn a totally different topic, you're ahead of product at Foursquare. I don't know if you know this. I actually built a startup on Foursquare's API. It's a company called Localmind. For folks that don't know about it, the way it worked is basically let you talk to someone, checked in on Foursquare anywhere in the world if you're thinking about going there.\n\nLenny (00:07:39):\nYou could be like, \"Hey, is this bar fun right now? What's happening there?\" Before you actually show up. We ended up selling the company to Airbnb. Ended up not being a big problem for enough people and that's how I ended up at Airbnb. But it was quite magical and API was amazing. I guess I just want to say thank you for building an awesome product and awesome API.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:07:58):\nThank you for being a developer on top of the ecosystem. I mean it's interesting with Foursquare. I will talk about this I'm sure later. I feel like I have more lessons learned and more scar tissue from the crazy up and down of ... I don't know what. It was 2010 to 2015 roughly. I think there's something actually where you learn more from the things that don't fully work out or don't quite achieve what you wanted to achieve.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:08:27):\nYou actually have a feedback loop where you get a lot of negative signal about like, \"Okay. That didn't work. That didn't work. What can I actually learn, take away from that?\" It's still great. I still love using Foursquare. I think we got caught in the death star of Instagram's ascent back in 2012, 2013. But I hope a product like that exists forever in the future and I'm glad you got to build the company, landed Airbnb through it. It's a great story.\n\nLenny (00:08:52):\nLooking back at Foursquare, do you think there was a path to building a massive consumer app type business or is that just never going to work out? I know they went in direction of B2B data business. I guess was there a path or was it just like, \"No. That was never going to work out?\"\n\nNoah Weiss (00:09:09):\nIt's tricky. I mean I'm not going to do 30-minute post, because I probably bore everyone. But it's not about this. We've all thought about this a lot on the early team there. I think the biggest probably lesson learned, frankly, is that we were really close with the Instagram folks early on. They were big developers on our platform. They used the Foursquare API before they were bought by Facebook.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:09:28):\nI think in hindsight we were a little bit mistaken to believe that the idea that the atomic unit would be a person talking about a place that they're at and you have to have a physical place to tie it to versus a person sharing a moment or an experience that they're having in the world. Sometimes that might have a place connected to it.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:09:47):\nI think that one change in framer on what you would say a customer actually wanted to do, that probably was the thing that took this away on the social side. I think on the more local discovery side, it's actually what people wind up be using the product much more for over time getting personalized recommendations and getting tips when you go to a place and all the push notifications.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:10:10):\nAgain, it was hard to stay ahead, I think specifically of Google, because they had billion plus Google Maps users distributed on Android and iOS. Even though they might only take a couple years, eventually they would wind up replicating a lot of the functionality and then I think it was hard to regain that momentum. Much of this stuff is luck and timing and just coincidences of history.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:10:37):\nI think there was a path. I think in the end we lost their social sales and then Google was able to catch up on the utility side. Now the company's built a really valuable B2B API company which offers a story. I mean Slack is in some ways a pivot, obviously, from a consumer company to a B2B company. But that that's my mini postmortem, what could have been with Foursquare.\n\nLenny (00:11:00):\nIt's interesting how many consumer companies pivot to B2B because it turns out that's where the money ends up being.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:11:06):\nYeah. I think the feedback to you get from our people willing to pay for the product that you're building is so much faster than can I build a large-scale consumer business and when they hope to have enough reach to then slap ads onto it. That's a much more of a try to hit a home run and hope it works out. But you don't really know if you're doing it along the way. Yeah. I think B2B is a easier to have a more incremental, successfully business than pure consumer.\n\nLenny (00:11:34):\nOkay. Speaking of Foursquare, Dennis Crowley was the CEO and founder, a very strong product-minded founder. I know you've worked with a number of very strong product-minded founders including Stewart Butterfield, Dennis, obviously we just talked about, maybe others. I'm curious what you've learned as a product leader working with very opinionated founders.\n\nLenny (00:11:56):\nI think this is interesting not just as a product leader working with very product-minded CEOs, but also as a first PM at a startup you're often put in this tough spot of just the founders just telling you what to do and you have to go build it versus having a lot of say in agency. I'm curious what you've learned about working and being successful in that position, which is often really hard.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:12:14):\nI would say to folks in general, if you're joining company and the CEO does the role that is your functional area of expertise, it's probably the area where you'll learn the most because they're hopefully world class at it. But also, one will you'll be the most frustrated at times because you're going to feel like you have less agency. You should just know that going into it.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:12:33):\nIf you go to company to run by a former marketer and you're in marketing, they'll probably want to have a lot of say and influence over that. I think just going into knowing that is good. Looking back, I would say probably two main things stand out of what's really worked with both Dennis and Stewart, not just for me but I think for the teams that work with him as well.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:12:52):\nThe first is, I think as much as possible, I think maybe we'll talk about this a little bit later as well, is getting to the point where you have alignment on the principles for what it means to build a great product of that company. Not just about if the intuition and tasting gut, but how do you distill that to principles that become the language of the company so that everybody else can start thinking through a similar frame or similar lens when you're designing a product.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:13:17):\nBecause otherwise it can feel a little bit Goldilocks every time a team builds something, they take it to the CEO. CEO is like, \"No, not quite right. Again, no, not exactly that.\" Then you don't have the language to actually have a more constructive review. Then doing that at the little strategy as well. I think the product founder CEO is always going to be the holder of the vision for the company. I'm sure at Airbnb. I imagine Brian was very much like that as well.\n\nLenny (00:13:40):\nAbsolutely.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:13:41):\nI think it's actually great to say, \"Okay. The overall vision for the company, is it the responsibility of any one team to have everyone buy into that vision, but then to have space for teams to be able to actually do creative work, do explorations because you know that it's aligned with that high level vision.\"\n\nNoah Weiss (00:13:57):\nIf you can get that alignment and you can get those principles as the common language of what creative software looks like, I think you can have a really good working relationship. Then the other bit I would just say is I think when to involve the founder CEO in a project is really important. The short version I think that works the best is almost like a U-curve where the X-axis is time and the Y-axis is level of involvement.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:14:22):\nI think you want to get the founder CEO really involved early on, especially if it's a big new project, to make sure that there's strategic buy-in that you agree on the principle strategy and approaching you agree on the goals and the anti-goals, getting that to then the team can run and explore. Then I think at the very end you want them to really be bought in that did you build something that's up to the quality ... the company?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:14:43):\nIs this something that's going to customers, literally taste the soup. What's missing in it? I think at most companies that have a maniacally customer-focused founder, if you don't do that last step, it's going to be much more painful after you launch because they weren't part of that co-creation of the team. I think that formula winds up working pretty well if you throw in that alignment on principles and envision.\n\nLenny (00:15:08):\nThat usually sounds nice in theory, but I often imagine you get to that final step and the founder is like, \"What the hell is this? This is not at all what I was hoping it be.\" Is there an example of that, that comes to mind where you maybe went through that and then it's just like, \"No. That did not work out the way we expected\" and if not, no problem.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:15:26):\nYeah. I mean I think that does happen. The ship is maybe ... the end of the year is the level of engagement and often that last level of engagement, that's where there's actually the most rapid refinement that you're doing. I think what's important there is that hopefully you're refining in code and you're not still at static design mocks because using the software is so different than looking at what the software will visually appear.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:15:51):\nI think what we would wind up doing with Stewart at Slack, for example, is we would get the entire development team, engineers design product, user research and Stewart together in a room and we almost do a bug bash together. The idea was like, \"We're doing it all together. We're trying to make the best product possible, making great softwares really messy and we're all trying to clean up the mess together.\"\n\nNoah Weiss (00:16:15):\nSometimes you might find things like, \"Okay. This entry point really isn't working, maybe we have to move this entry point. That's maybe a bigger change.\" But I think often what you'd find is just all those bits of polish and refinement and doing the little delightful things that might otherwise be missing to raise that craft bar and doing a real collective way so it doesn't just feel like the team says. \"We want to ship.\" The founder says, \"No, it's not ready.\"\n\nNoah Weiss (00:16:38):\nIdeally as a group you're saying, We want to get it to a bar that's going to delight our users and here's the gap from where we are today to what we want to shift.\" I think that mentality winds up being a lot more constructive, but that's not always easy to do.\n\nLenny (00:16:54):\nYou talked about creating these principles, which is an awesome approach of just creating guardrails for the team so they think the way the founder and the head of product think. What are some examples of principles you have and had early on maybe at Foursquare or Slack?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:17:07):\nI mean Slack I think is where we enshrined them much more because we scaled the org so much, more that we needed principles. I think for us, they were really about unpacking just the mission, which for Slack is making people's working lives simpler, more pleasant, more productive. That's the mission of the company. The question is how does software help do that? That's what the principles or their answer.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:17:31):\nFor us, we've got five, four principles. They've largely stayed the same. Some of the language has changed over the last couple of years. But at least for the last four or five years we've had these. The first is be a great host, which is all about that level of craft, the relentlessly saving people's steps. If you're, let's say, a host at Airbnb, it's like putting clean towels on the bed. No one has to wonder \"Are these for me?\" That type of foresight.\n\nLenny (00:17:57):\nThat's actually a value at Airbnb. Exactly.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:17:59):\nOh, really?\n\nLenny (00:18:00):\nIt's actually be a host at Airbnb is one of the four core values.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:18:03):\nRight. Maybe we borrowed that or someone was inspired by it. But be a great host. It sounded aspirational. I love that.\n\nLenny (00:18:09):\nYeah. Yeah. It's a little bigger.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:18:11):\nThere's a famous user design book called Don't Make Me Think, which we sold the title of for our next principle. That's really just about as people building the software, you know how it works so well. You care about all the nuances and intricacies and you really want your users to love it as much as you do. But often actually, that owner's delusion that someone else will care as much about the software that you built as you do, prevents you from actually making something that's simple, comprehensible, understandable.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:18:43):\nOne of the core tenets of Slack is pretty complex under the surface, is how do we actually make people not have to think, how do we not reinvent the wheel if there's existing design patterns to use, how do we actually wind up designing for people who come from many different backgrounds and we cater to their needs in ways that don't make them have to customize it too much?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:19:03):\nThere's a saying we also have, which is more clicks can often be okay. You'll often have in optimization experimentation circles like, \"Oh, every click, remove it.\" But I actually think in a lot of software when it's not transactional, helping people understand what they're doing, giving them confidence, helping them have trust in the steps, we've seen that that can actually be a better experience. That's another example of don't make it stressful, help people chill out when they're using this offer. That's the idea beyond that one.\n\nLenny (00:19:32):\nShifting a little bit. I know you guys have been working on a bunch of AI stuff at Slack. I believe you've been working on AI related stuff for many years. I think at Google you worked on a lot of AI related products. I feel like a lot of people are just getting into this and trying to figure out, \"How do we integrate AI and ML and LLMs into our product and how do we not just waste our time chasing things?\"\n\nLenny (00:19:55):\nI want to ask you just in your time working with AI over the many years you've been doing it and share a little bit about what you've been doing there. What are some things you've learned about how to be actually effective and build valuable products and not just fall for the shiny object issue and trap?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:20:11):\nI mean, it's almost 15 years ago now that I was working at Google in search on what later became called the knowledge graph. This idea of building a canonical repository of information of people, places, things in the world and relationships between them. Back then, it was a lot of the same ideas, but obviously the techniques. I have got a lot more mature.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:20:33):\nWe used natural language processing to extract all this information from the web and try to build this database of facts. An idea then was could you take queries, people have like, \"What are the tallest fountains in Europe or what of the most popular beaches in Southern California?\" Be able to actually give answers not just 10 blue links.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:20:53):\nI think the thing that's really changed, it's super exciting in the last 6, 12 months with LMs and chat GPT and everything else is the idea that now you can take not just knowledge about the world but actually have natural language generation where suddenly the computer can talk back to you in a way that feels extremely human. Then the creative applications of that are pretty massive and exciting.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:21:19):\nThat's, I guess, the lineage there. I think from over the years back at Google at Foursquare, we did a lot of personalization and recommendations at Slack we have search and ML that's coming infused throughout the product. I think a couple things come out as ... I guess the principles that we've used over the years, back then at Google, one of the big ones, was that the promise of the UI has to match the quality of the underlying data, which is to say ... I think this is actually one of the failings of the various LMs right now is they all appear supremely confident even when they're completely hallucinating.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:21:53):\nI think that's going to be something that people are going to have to work on a lot, which is to figure out how to be not so faultless, to acknowledge when you're not sure, because otherwise, it undermines the trust people have in the system. Using a lot of transparency about where the data comes from so people can actually build credibility and the tools is really important.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:22:11):\nThen I think making sure that as you're designing the products that you have virtuous cycles that are naturally part of the product experience where you can get training data as a byproduct of people naturally using the software and then can make the model that you're building behind the scenes smarter, more accurate, more predictive.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:22:29):\nA classic example of that would be Netflix back in the day, their rating system, they actually have a feedback loop from their customers then make the system better at predicting. I think people you are still trying to figure out what does that look like in this world in LLMs?\n\nLenny (00:22:42):\nSomething I hope that you're all building at Slack is a way to ask a bot questions based on all the conversations in the Slack. I've been looking for that product for a while now.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:22:51):\nI can safely say we have a lot of prototypes internally where we are playing with this. I think it is actually funny as a aside in one of the original Slack, I don't know, product vision decks back in 2014. There was our whole strategy, there's four parts. Then part number four, which was a joke at the time, was then do magic AI stuff on top.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:23:13):\nWe didn't even know what the state of AI would be. By the time hopefully companies have their collective knowledge in Slack and now we're finally at the period where the magic AI stuff seems finally pretty amazing, pretty magical. Yeah. We're doing a lot of prototyping internally and also trying to work with the ecosystem around as well, because there's so many companies doing amazing work in this space.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:23:33):\nThat if you work at a company where you have so much knowledge in your Slack channel repository that you can suddenly get amazing leaps in productivity to help you better do your job because that knowledge is in Slack, but it's sometimes hard to reach and I think these technologies can make that possible.\n\nLenny (00:23:50):\nThis reminds me of something Gustav, the CPO and CTO and co-president of Spotify share that they always have a deck and a vision of just a play button within Spotify, you just play and all magic happens and it's the best music and thing exactly what you want to hear and just how that isn't actually possible and it's still not possible. Exactly to your point, you have to really think about how does it act? How close is it to the reality? If it's not actually there, he was saying how like, \"We'll pick two songs that are correct at a 10 just because we don't really know exactly what you want to hear right now.\"\n\nLenny (00:24:23):\nThere's no point in trying to design that right now because that's not actually going to be delivering on the promise.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:24:27):\nRight. Yeah. I love that. Our version of that has always been that you open up Slack and suddenly instead of having to read through dozens of channels or find these mentions that magically Slack could just tell you in order that you would care about a summary of all the interesting things that have happened and then let you dig in if you want to your very own personal chief of staff who knew everything that you cared about and read everything that you could read.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:24:52):\nI don't think that's going to quite be possible anytime soon. But I think Spotify heading towards that north star you wind up developing. I hope a lot of really compelling projects experiences along the way.\n\nLenny (00:25:02):\nYeah, man. The more I think about it, the more amazing opportunities exist in Slack. It's all text. It's amazing. Okay. There's a lot of cool stuff coming I imagine.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:25:10):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:25:10):\nI can't wait.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:25:11):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:25:12):\nOn that topic, how do you think about creating teams within Slack and AI specifically? Are you recommending each team think about how AI can make their stuff better or are you dedicating, \"Here's the AI team and they're going to work on stuff\" and you guys just keep ship what you're shipping and keep moving your metrics?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:25:29):\nI mean the unfair answer is a hybrid of the two, which is to say we have a central machine learning and search team. But a lot of people have expertise in this field to build infrastructure that everybody can use. What we've done is because the space is evolving so quickly, literally every month, the capabilities are evolving, the risks and tradeoffs are evolving a ton.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:25:52):\nWhat we want to do is actually spin up a couple different teams that are focused on prototyping, using that common infrastructure but in specific directions that are all a little bit different. We've got a common ML, let's say in search team and now we have a bunch of teams that are working in parallel and different customer problems that we're trying to solve using that shared infrastructure.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:26:17):\nI think this isn't the steady state. I think over time, what it'll probably look like is that all the existing product areas, as soon as we know more of the shape of what the technology is capable of will just have AI capabilities as part of their roadmaps. Just like every product team is responsible for their own mobile roadmap. They don't outsource it to someone else.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:26:37):\nBut I think today when things are moving so quickly, you actually want a little bit of a more ad hoc, flexible approach to move quickly and that's what we're doing.\n\nLenny (00:26:49):\nThat's what I've been hearing from everyone I've been asking this question. The search ranking team is always seems to be the center of all this and then it's a few experiments here and there. That's an interesting pattern I've been noticing.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:26:58):\nGood to know.\n\nLenny (00:27:00):\nI heard that you have a process internally called Complaint-Storms. I'd love to understand what that is.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:27:05):\nIt something that started. I want to say back in end of 2019, maybe early 2020. The idea a little bit was how do we help as a team look at the software that we build with fresh eyes, because we've been set at Slack for a long time. Slack maybe more than almost any other company maybe like Figma is probably similar. I was listening to the podcast just earlier today where if you work on Figma, you work on Slack.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:27:30):\nYou also live in Slack and you live in Figma all day so you can become more of a power user than anyone else on earth. What we were realizing, especially for people trying to build Slack for the next million customers, the people who have never used Slack before, it was becoming increasingly hard to have empathy for what their usage of Slack would look like. How would they look at it in a more critical way? How would they care less than we cared?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:27:56):\nWhat we started doing with these complaints storms and idea was really simple, which is we'd get a team together often Stewart myself would also join and we'd actually start off with other products first in adjacent spaces and we'd say, \"Okay. As a group we're going to go through the customer journey from the moment you land on the website through, let's say it's a workplace product, getting your first account going, getting the first couple of users on board, getting to the point of value.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:28:21):\nWe're going to do it on one screen. Someone's going to project and then people are going to fill in every issue, everything that's confusing, every pain point, not bones, but ways in which if you didn't care about the software, you don't work on it, what would actually confuse you? What would stop you in your tracks?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:28:38):\nFrom that you went generating a bunch of amazing inspiration by looking at someone else's product in a really critical way for things you might want to try in your own product. Once you get to that, then it becomes easier to actually do with your own software, but it is a little painful obviously. Same with watching usability tests to look at your own baby in a way that is, \"Okay. I'm trying to find all the words. I'm trying to find all the problems.\"\n\nNoah Weiss (00:29:03):\nBut that's one up being a pretty great source. Whenever a team I think either gets stuck or feels like they reach a dead end in a direction is doing complaint-storms about the product area that they're in or using adjacent products just to get inspiration. Then I think it unlocks a lot more creative views than the problem space.\n\nLenny (00:29:23):\nIt's similar to a process that I learned Stripe has called friction logging. But I love the nuance here of starting with someone else's product because I could totally see how that makes you feel better looking at your product in real life. It's not like we suck. It's okay, everyone's has so much opportunity.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:29:38):\nExactly. Yeah. I've heard that from Stripe, too. I think gets a similar place. I think it's the doing it ... I think the byproduct is that you also get calibration on product pace, product quality, and as a team you develop that together. Again, similar to the principles, it's like how do you get these things that are hard to actually feel collectively on the same page about and how do you calibrate? It's another good way to do it.\n\nLenny (00:30:01):\nI'm imagining some PMs might be hearing this and wonder, \"Okay. Great. Now the founders and the execs have all these things that they want us to fix. I have goals to hit. I got a roadmap. How do you think about prioritizing things that come up in these sorts of sessions for the team and how do they mix and match versus all the other stuff that you want to do? Or is it just like they don't actually have a huge roadmap and this is a way to inform the roadmap?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:30:23):\nNo. I mean, more broadly, I think the way that we think about, or us to think about our roadmap for any feature team at Slack is that it's a portfolio and it's meant to be a portfolio that's diversified a couple different ways. I think one is you want to diversify things that are meant to be new capabilities versus making the thing you've already built a little bit better every day. Similar to parenting.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:30:47):\nAre there things that are meant to be risky that you aren't sure are going to work but might have a lot of upside versus things that are known bets. Then I think often you're balancing are you doing things that are meant to have impact that you're already very confident in versus things that are meant to learn about a new possibility space.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:31:05):\nI think for most teams, this stuff usually wind up tactically filling up that bucket of, \"Let's make the existing product a little bit better every day for users.\" At Slack we have this thing we call customer Love Sprints, which is an interesting way team to figure out how to get this on their roadmap is it's hard to allocate that work throughout the quarter.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:31:26):\nWhat we'll wind up doing often is have a team do a two-week customer love sprint, almost like a hackathon, but with that burndown list of what we think is the lowest effort, highest impact changes that we can make to generate more love from our customers and whatever that feature areas. Then people just sprint for two weeks, design product engineering, and then you have a bunch of things that you celebrate.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:31:48):\nAt the end, the goal is to ship all of them. This isn't hacks that you throw away. That's how we end up prioritizing it off in that work is actually making it this really fun total change of pace throughout the quarter to not do big feature work that may take months, but to do all these small delightful things that customers are going to love at the end. That's the other way that we figure out how to balance it in.\n\nLenny (00:32:11):\nI love that. How often do you do these sorts of customer Love Sprints?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:32:14):\nI would think teams that work on very user facing products do it at least once a quarter. I think other teams that work on maybe less user facing might do it maybe twice a year. But quarterly is a pretty healthy cadence.\n\nLenny (00:32:26):\nWow. I didn't know about that. That connects to ... Slack has always been a very delightful product. I remember early on the animations were so awesome, the little twirly, I don't know, pounds hashtag thing. It feels like Slack has always invested in delight. How do you operationalize that? Is it these customer Love Sprints? Is there something else that's just like we need to allocate some percentage, just make things really fun even though it's not going to move any metric?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:32:51):\nI would say it's a little bit good DNA of the company, honestly, which is that for co-founders trying to build a massive online role playing game for many years that was called Glitch and their background was all in building delightful, playful experiences. Glitch didn't work out. But, yeah, there's a whole long backstory. But the short version is a tool they had built internally that they then wound up spitting out a company from which became Slack.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:33:18):\nI think that DNA we're trying to build a consumer grade experience that just happens to be for work is really ingrained in the company. It's also a big part of how we hire. I would say certainly the majority of PMs designers and engineers who joined Slack had never worked at an enterprise software company before. It's not like most people had worked at Oracle or SAP, it's most people had worked at consumer companies or game companies.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:33:44):\nThey bring that focus in the spirit and then I would say the last bit beyond kind of the principles and the complaints-storms and the customer love is that we have this amazing team that we call the CET team, the Customer Experience Team. They're in some ways the team that is doing our scale at Foursquare is most often in touch with our customers.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:34:02):\nFrom the very early days people used to do CE shifts if you worked in products so that you can actually figure out what's frustrating, what's confusing. We have a really great pipeline for getting the insights from the CE team of what are the obstacles, the pain points, the most frequent complaints into the hands of the product teams to be able to prioritize, to figure out, yeah, not all these are going to move a given metric. They might not achieve something for the business.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:34:28):\nBut collectively, I think the way that Slack thinks about competition is we obsess it about customers. We build something they'll love enough to tell their coworkers and the rest takes care of itself.\n\nLenny (00:34:41):\nSpeaking of competition, something I wanted to ask you a bit about. Early on Slack was competing against this product called HipChat and that's actually what I used at our startup and we love HipChat. It was so hilarious, just these memes everywhere and their billboards are amazing. But then Slack ate their lunch later on. I'm just thinking out loud, discord feels like that was the big threat and how Microsoft Teams obviously.\n\nLenny (00:35:03):\nI'm curious just how you think about competition and even just what you've learned about working in a space where there's a lot of competition and thinking about that long-term and even short-term.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:35:12):\nYeah. I mean each of those is an interesting mini lesson learned about those. I think the through line for all of them I would say is still the max that we have in trailing, which is we're customer obsessed but competitor aware. I think it's a little bit different. I think some companies are like ... I don't know, Uber for example, I think was notorious competitor obsessed and they tried to delete customers when they could.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:35:35):\nI think HipChat. I don't think Slack sought out to kill HipChat. At Foursquare we used ... I think it was called Campfire back in the day for the 37 singles people. It was a whole generation of those products. I think Slack came along and I think they had a couple of innovations. One was they had a great mobile experience that synced across every client. Search actually worked and then they brought a lot of the best parts of consumer messaging into the workplace like the emoji and reactions and all those bits.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:36:04):\nI think it turns out that if you're 10X better on a couple of those axes, then you can see a huge change in behavior. I think that's what happened with that move from the HipChat Campfire to Slack world. Discords interesting. I mean we keep aware of Discord. But it is so much more focused on the consumer. Originally, it was [inaudible 00:36:23] out for community space. I think at Slack the lesson I would have, I think we learned in a good way is we've always really been focused on groups of people who are trying to do work together.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:36:33):\nThat winds up being a completely different audience to build for than communities. I think that focus has been really helpful and I think Discord's amazing and many people love it and the people who use Discord certainly use it in very different way than people who use Slack at work.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:36:49):\nI think Microsoft obviously has become over time the biggest competitor there. I think the origin of Teams really was a defensive move for them to protect Office because Office is an incredible, very profitable monopoly in the productivity space. I think when they built Teams it was more of a covering their flank versus Slack on the ascent.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:37:10):\nI think as Teams has evolved over time, it's become much more of a video conferencing product that competes with Zoom and Google Meet. The people who use Teams use it completely different than Slack where you live and breathe and channels and work and workflows all day long.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:37:25):\nI think what we've seen there too is that a lot of our customers, they happily use both. Most Fortune 500 companies have either a subscription or a Google Workplace subscription and all of those customers who use those also use Slack. We like to say that Slack is this connected tissue that makes all the rest of your tools that much better.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:37:44):\nI think there we've taken very much an open ecosystem and platform approach and we've just been focused on how do we keep building the best version of what Slack can be as a new category of software for our customers and staying aware of our competitors, but really obsessed on what are the new ways that we can delight our users as the years go by.\n\nLenny (00:38:04):\nSlack is a big-ish company within now let's say a big company. But it feels like you still are launching really interesting stuff, you launch huddles, clips, there's this AI stuff coming, sounds like. I'm curious what you have done at Slack to enable these sorts of zero to one bets and what you've seen is important to allow for innovation along those lines.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:38:26):\nI think maybe we're all a little self-delusional, because I think everyone who works at Slack likes to think that we're still at a small startup. I think keeping that spirit alive, honestly culturally has been a big part of it. I think going back to the principles early on, one of the ones that we did talk about, literally one of the actual wording is take bigger boulder bets.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:38:43):\nThe idea there is that it's really easy to fall into the trap of just constant incrementalism. The concept, it's like a feature team and you have like a KPI and you feel like your whole life is measured by that similar KPI going up 1% a quarter and then you lose sight of what's beyond the horizon. We have this mental metaphor that we talk a lot about getting to the next hill.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:39:07):\nThe idea is that if you're in a mountain range and you're maybe in the little valley, you can see what's right in front of you. But you have no idea how tall the mountains are behind. I think teams can often get lost crawling up that hill, not realizing that there's a huge, incredibly beautiful range behind it.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:39:26):\nTake bigger boulder bets. Get to the next hill to see what the horizon wants around you. That's how we think about it strategically. Then I think structurally the way we've approached it is that we've over time freighted new teams from scratch that incubated in a new area before the area mature. We did that with a lot of these native audiovisual products like huddles and clips really in the pandemic because our customers were demanding it from us.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:39:49):\nThey were like, \"We love living in Slack all day. But we feel disconnected from our teammates when we can't be in the same physical place. What can you do to help us?\" That's where that came from. I think in the AI space now, it's a similar thing, which is what we're trying to hear from customers. What do you wish Slack could do if it had these new superpowers? Let's incubate a couple teams, a prototype there and then figure out what can get to real product market fit.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:40:14):\nI think when we have those teams, I think it's important to just give them space to run, to give them ... get a gel free card for maybe the normal process of, \"Okay. Our planning quarterly reviews\" and make it feel something that is the pace of learning is what matters. How fast are you prototyping, how fast are you learning from users and then getting to do that publicly and pilot and then get something to launch that's amazing, blows people away. That's the formula that we've seen.\n\nLenny (00:40:43):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth.

I'm curious what's maybe the most interesting or unique or fun or funny ritual or tradition on the product team of things you all maybe do regularly?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:41:56):\nOne of the things that we do, which is always a little bit funny, I mean, it's more of a emotional thing rather than a practical thing is that at all hands we'll often wind up taking specific tweets that people had about the product and Twitter. People say the craziest thing sometimes. Sometimes they're really heartwarming like customer love, but often it's just the meanest, most frustrating complaints that people have.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:42:21):\nIt's honestly meant for us to just have a pulse on, we're at people actually saying and feeling in the wild and not thinking too seriously, but keeping that sense of ... I think that the distance you have from your users as your user base gets more and more diverse and larger I think can make it harder to actually develop the product because you're not designing for yourself anymore.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:42:41):\nI think all the ways that we help keep people grounded in what are actual users actually saying. That's one big way. The other that reminded me of which is actually probably better, maybe delete that last one because it's kind of boring.\n\nLenny (00:42:55):\nNo. It's great. We're not deleting nothing.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:42:57):\nFine. Usability. I'm a big believer in you want to be data-informed, but you don't want to be so data-driven that you actually don't have a pulse of what real people feel when they're using your product. We're really big into user research, not as it gives you the answer, but it helps at least pose a lot of questions for you when you watch how someone actually uses the software.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:43:21):\nHistorically, it's really hard to get PMs, let alone engineers actually attend user research sessions. What we wound up doing, especially in the pandemic when we first went remote, is now you can dial into usability sessions and to make it really attractive for the team, what we would do is have people live in a thread, write their real time thoughts of ... so painful, how they use that, or I can't believe they missed that, or, oh, that gave me this idea from seeing how they were doing that to do this other thing.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:43:50):\nThen you wind up having the PMs, the engineers, designers and the user researcher all in one Slack thread live, responding, reacting to usability session. Then suddenly that thread becomes actually the best source of truth for the research report that then gets written up.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:44:06):\nBut I think most importantly, it gets the team almost like the complaint-storms, but actually watching someone else do it in the shoes of an actual human being trying to use the thing that you thought was so brilliant and yet has all these flaws. It's humbling. It's filled with humor and also it's I think really constructive for the teams to do it that way.\n\nLenny (00:44:27):\nI was going to ask where they actually share these thoughts. In Slack makes a lot of sense.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:44:31):\nYeah. I mean it turns into a report at some point, but literally just link back to the original thread and then you have 100 people's reaction as the report is ongoing.\n\nLenny (00:44:41):\nIf only there was a AI tool to summarize all of your thoughts.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:44:45):\nWe've got a prototype for that. Hopefully it'll work well enough that actually be useful for customers, too.\n\nLenny (00:44:51):\nYou tweeted once about how ... I think maybe around the time you joined Slack around 2019 that the self-service business of Slack basically plateaued and it wasn't clear why. I'm curious just what that period was like and how did you get to the bottom of what was going on and turn things around.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:45:09):\nYeah. It was actually a couple years after I joined, but it was a point where I was focused on the self-service business because we had this period with Slack where I would say maybe 2014 to 2017 where it was almost all self-service and it was just growing like gangbusters. Then we started spinning up the sales team and an enterprise team. We started focusing mostly on that.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:45:30):\nI think we saw the team that was working on, but it was primarily the company's focus was all driving enterprise deals, getting to that next level of maturity. Then in 2019, I think we started to see that when we looked beneath the surface, the fundamentals of the self-service business weren't looking as healthy as they used to be.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:45:50):\nI think the biggest thing as we dug into it was a little bit to what we were talking about earlier with the motivation and complaints terms is it was getting harder to understand what the next generation of Slack customers really wanted from the product. Whether you're thinking about this as crossing the chasm or moving from kind of early adopters to the needs, the more majority or later adopters, I think we're at that point where not every technologically sophisticated company on earth was using Slack, but most were, and we were getting into a market that customers just had different needs. They had different levels of sophistication.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:46:24):\nWe did a lot of user research. We looked at all these cohort curves, which you can imagine suddenly they're like, \"Huh, they're not as healthy as they used to be like. What's going on?\" I think we got a bunch of insights from it. But I think really what we want to change about how we were operating was instead of to continue to try to optimize the things that had worked over the last couple years, we said, \"Okay. Let's throw the whole roadmap away and instead let's come up with a bunch of hypotheses about what could be new levers that could actually help based on the insights that we now have about the next set of customers.\"\n\nNoah Weiss (00:46:56):\n\"We're going to try to quickly learn which of these levers are real and which of these are just totally off the mark.\" We had to say for the next six months, we're probably not going to drive any impact at all. It's only going to be about learning. But at the end of that, hopefully we wind up finding a couple different levers that had years of room run and that's what wound up happening.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:47:19):\nWe wound up doubling the rate of our new pay customer growth in the year and a couple years after that and accelerating the self-service business. I think it really came from stepping back, being humble, not feeling like we deserve to have every company on earth sign up and then figuring out how to optimize for learning. In the long term you could get the impact.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:47:39):\nBut knowing that for the next couple quarters we're going to sacrifice impact for the sake of learning. I think that was a good muscle to build, but it was definitely not easy to do at the time.\n\nLenny (00:47:49):\nWell, the story begs the question, what are the levers that worked? Whatever you can share.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:47:53):\nOne of the big things that we wound up focusing on is what we talk about is comprehension, desirability. The fundamental challenge I think for new users or new teams using your product once you get past the kind of tech early adopters is do they comprehend what this thing is for? Do they understand how it works? Then desirability is why should they care? Most people at work are not like,\" Hey. You know what I want to do today is start using an entirely new tool and convince all my coworkers to get on board.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:48:22):\nThat is not part of your job. Your job has goals and measurements and everything else. Really ... understanding that. How do you push on that in that new user experience? It sounds maybe a little ludicrous, but Slack always has a free product. Obviously, there's a free tier that you can use, but we had never actually figured out a trial strategy where we actually gave you a taste of the paid product.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:48:44):\nEither we're on the free tier or we get to pay for the paid tier. And that wound up being one of, I think the Ripest veins is figuring out how to give people a taste of the full premium Slack experience so that they would never want to go back and doing that in a variety of different points in the customer journey. Then I'd say the other biggest thing I would call the one out is we really need to figure out a new north star metric for motivating the teams across Slack.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:49:09):\nAt that point in time, we basically had paid customers and then we had creative teams, which is the very, very beginning, very, very end of the journey. We did a lot of quantitative research and data science and wound up coming up with this new metric we call successful teams, which is a little bit ... I feel a lot of companies have this Facebook, I'm lucky number seven or whatever it was.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:49:28):\nWhere what we found was that if you could get five people using Slack, the majority of the work week to just communicate at all, that would be a successful team there were going to be 400% more likely to upgrade over the next six months. That seems like a very low bar, five people to use Slack throughout the work week, not even every day. But it turns out that if you could get that level of critical mass the rest would take care of itself.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:49:54):\nWe wound up motivating not just the team that was focused on self-service but all these other feature teams across the company to drive more new successful teams, knowing that if we can move that which is much earlier in the funnel but not a top of funnel metric, then it would actually drive upgrades and paid customers and thus revenue long-term. That was a huge turning point for how we rally product teams around somebody to actually drive that self-service business.\n\nLenny (00:50:22):\nMan, this feels like its own podcast. Just to analyze the things you learned down this journey, and there's so many takeaways here. One is just the importance of an activation metric that is predictive of retention sales. It sounds like you landed on five people in a company like DAU basically for a week, something like that. That's awesome.\n\nLenny (00:50:40):\nThen the other interesting takeaway here is I'm actually doing a bunch of interviews with founders of the most successful B2B companies and interestingly, not all, maybe half are like, \"I still don't think we have product market fit. They're at a billion dollars valuation growing crazy.\" They're like, I feel like I have product market fit with the current users but I don't with the people I want next.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:51:08):\nThat's exactly right. I think that's exactly right. I think of product market fit is almost like you keep stacking these S-curves where you get product market fit in a small group and then you suddenly reach exponential growth because you can crack that coal group, that type of audience, but then you start declining because you start hitting the ceiling of, we've got in, I don't know what it might be every development team in the US to be using this product.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:51:30):\nThen you jump up to the next S-curve, which is like how do we get technology savvy teams that aren't developers or how do we get people who are in large eventerprises who are outside the US. Each become new curves that you have to build product market fit for. I think it's just all a huge exercise in being self-critical, being humble, not presuming that you've cracked this thing forever and keeping kind of a very beginner's mindset of what does the next audience need. \"\n\nNoah Weiss (00:51:58):\nYour previous audience. Didn't need it all.\n\nLenny (00:52:01):\nIf you think about the pie chart of what you had to change to make it work, how much of it was it messaging, positioning, onboarding, optimization versus product features?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:52:10):\nI would say maybe 60-40 in the sense of the early journey. I mean not just obviously positioning messaging, but the entire experience of unboxing Slack if you will with your team. We called it the day one journey, but extended to really kind of day 30 in reality and it's a single player and multiplayer experience. It is really complex.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:52:33):\nBut then I think what we realized was you can make that incredible, but if fundamental parts of the product were missing that would make it comprehensible to the next audience, then you're going to have problems. It sounds maybe impossible to remember, but Slack used to not have wizzywig message composition.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:52:53):\nYou used to have to use mar, down. Making that wizzywig was a huge boost making mobile work offline so it worked no matter where you were in the world was another big one. All the things about configuring your sidebar notification so that as you scale it you should just Slack it and become overwhelming. Those are some of the foundational product investments that we wound up making so that next generation of Slack customers could get value and not be overwhelmed or daunted by it.\n\nLenny (00:53:22):\nMaybe one last question along these lines, people look at Slack as maybe the first major product-led growth success story and they always look at Slack of like, \"Oh, we just want to grow Slack. Let's see what they did.\" For people that are studying Slack's journey and success, what do you think Slack did right early on that maybe people don't recognize or don't appreciate enough that founders today should be thinking about more so versus just like let's just make a freemium product.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:53:48):\nRight. I mean, I think, maybe the most telling thing is when Slack started, certainly when I joined still, I don't think a word or acronym product-led growth existed. It wasn't like we were really good at taking this playbook and applying it. I think it was more that whole term of art became a thing as maybe many other freemium SaaS products took off.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:54:13):\nNot to be repetitive. But I think the core of it really was building a product that customers loved enough that they would put their own social capital on the line to get their coworkers on board 5 to 50 people.\" At the time the biggest company I imagined using Slack was 50 people because I don't know how this is going to work beyond that, maybe it'll become pandemonium. Obviously, that was the initial, I think real, real strong product market fit.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:55:11):\nBut the other bit which then was what powered the enterprise business was teams of 5 to 50 people who worked at larger companies. I think what wound up happening was that you would have teams that was independently at a company like IBM or Disney or Capital One or whoever it might be, or Comcast discovering Slack using it for themselves because they thought it would just make their working lives simpler, more pleasant, more productive, and maybe not even know that anyone else at the company was using Slack.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:55:39):\nThen by the time we then scaled our enterprise sales team, I mean, truly the exercise initially was just take customer domain, sort by number of active users and call them in the order of that which is, \"Hey, by the way, you have a couple thousand people actually using Slack at your company. Do you want to think about a broader deployment or controls or analytics?\"\n\nNoah Weiss (00:55:59):\nI think that was it. That's consumer great experience that customers love enough to get their coworkers on and pay for themselves. Then at enterprise companies like having a bunch of different flowers sprouting so that eventually you could roll up an enterprise-wide deal and then was all the tactics. But I think that that was where it started.\n\nLenny (00:56:20):\nThe way you described it at the beginning of make a product that people want to share with their colleagues reminds me of a ... I was just listening to an interview with Seth Godin who's this marketing legend. I think he has a new book. He is on every podcast. He had this really great quote that the products that win are ones that you want to tell your friends about.\n\nLenny (00:56:37):\nIt's a really simple concept. Basically, it's like it's word of mouth is how you have to win. But I think that's so true and every successful company I talk to ends up being like, \"We just want to build something people want to share with their friends,\" even if it's growing in some other way, SEO paid feels like that's always at the root of it is you just want to tell your friends about it because you love it. Slack I think is a great example of that.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:56:58):\nI think that's true. I mean obviously, there are categories of enterprise software that isn't true for in security or ...\n\nLenny (00:57:05):\nBut even that I think if it's an awesome security product you're like, \"Hey, you got to check out this century or whatever or sneak.\"\n\nNoah Weiss (00:57:13):\nYeah. Good friends with Vanta's CEO Christina. I feel like they run those stories where whoever would've thought that a compliance company would be something that people raved about to their other startup friends, like, \"Oh, my God. You don't want to deal with SOC's compliance? You got in Vanta. It's amazing.\"\n\nNoah Weiss (00:57:29):\nYeah. Maybe that is true. I think especially in this day and age where all the marketing acquisition channels have been so saturated, people optimizing so much, I think it's really hard to scale a big enough business if you don't have some amount of word of mouth and customer love driven growth. I think it's hard to scale it on like, \"We're going to just play the cat game and in hopes that the numbers work out.\"\n\nLenny (00:57:51):\nI remember Slack rolling out at Airbnb and all the designers getting so excited about it, creating their channels and everyone's just like, \"What the hell are they doing as this thing?\" Then it did exactly what you're describing just spread. Everyone's just like, \"Whoa, this is cool.\" They're all telling each other that how useful it is to them and spread like crazy.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:58:07):\nI love that.\n\nLenny (00:58:09):\nIs there anything else on Slack that you think would be interesting to share in terms of what makes it a successful product team, product business before I move on to another topic?\n\nNoah Weiss (00:58:20):\nThe other thing I think is maybe a little bit interesting in terms of how we develop product and it's really different and it's changed over time, which is that obviously the easiest person to build for is yourself and the next easiest is people who look almost exactly like you or have similar preferences and sophistication. I think in the early days of Slack, that's basically what we did.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:58:41):\nI mean it was really just trying to build for small technologically savvy teams in terms of you could build a pretty big business making a great product for them. Over the years, obviously, that's changed. One of the things I think that we've done, which has worked really well, one obviously is we've figured out how to do experimentation in a SaaS product, which is not always obvious because the metrics are much longer term than you land at a checkout page and then you hit Checkout.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:59:07):\nBut I think the other thing is we figured out how to scale up getting real customers using Slack in the wilds for new functionality. We have this really robust program that we call our pilot program where we have, I don't know, probably thousands of different customers that have all signed different agreements now where we can actually roll out to progressively larger user bases, because Slack is a multiplayer product.\n\nNoah Weiss (00:59:30):\nYou often have to roll out real net new functionality to a whole company or whole team because otherwise you can't use huddles by yourself, for example. Then we have a really great program for actually getting feedback from those customers both through Slack connect itself through surveys and this winds up being a lifeblood of feature teams where you can, by the time you actually launch a big net new feature for Slack, have done so much customer feedback from people actually using in the wild to get work done and so much more confidence in what you're building from the metrics and the surveys that we do that you know can't guarantee it's going to be a hit.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:00:05):\nBut you can be really confident not because it just worked well internally, which is no longer that predictive, but because it worked well for a thousand different companies, in 50 different countries, in 20 different industries. I think not early on SaaS companies don't need to figure that out, but I think as you grow and as you have a more diverse customer base as you said all these SaaS founders who said, \"Hey, you got to keep reestablishing product market fit.\"\n\nNoah Weiss (01:00:31):\nI think that is a programmatic way of being able to do that with your product development process. That's pretty interesting.\n\nLenny (01:00:37):\nAny tips for how to choose who to include in this group if someone wants to build something like this for themselves?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:00:43):\nI think the two most important things are you want a lot of diversity in terms of industry, company size, location and so on. I think you want to pick people who are actually motivated to want to be part of the development process and have a slightly higher risk tolerance. Not every company wants to actually be beta testing new functionality that might get removed.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:01:05):\nMaking sure we have this champion network that we built that people who love Slack enough that they're willing to put up with a little bit of pain in that rougher period are willing to have something that they try to use and then we decide actually we're going to kill that feature before we ever ship it to everybody. Diversity and pain tolerance.\n\nLenny (01:01:24):\nThis reminds me of something else, the CTO Stripe shared of how they build new product, which is they pick a couple customers that need a problem solved and they just build it for them essentially and with them and in B2B. Generally, it's a lot easier to build something people really want because they are very motivated for you to solve their problem and they're going to put in the time. You don't need a thousands of people involved, you just need a couple.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:01:46):\nYeah. I definitely think it was one of those things where if you can do it away and they say I can't live without it, the classic not ... Do you like it? Sure. But can you work without this thing? If the answer is definitely not, you've built something that probably a lot of other companies will want to.\n\nLenny (01:02:04):\nAll right. I'm going to shift to a totally different topic, which could also be its own whole podcast, but let's just see how it goes. You're with this, I'd say famous blog post on product management called The 10 Traits of Great Product Managers. I want to just try to go through this list briefly and just see how it goes. This could be an hour of conversation. But let's just run through it, because I think it'd be useful for people to hear and I think these are all 100% true even though you wrote this number of years ago at this point and let's just see what comes up. Then I have a few follow-up questions on this list.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:02:34):\nThese traits are ... I wrote this other thing, which is the five minutes about product management, which are all the things that people think product management is and why they switch to the job and they're disappointed by. Then I was like, \"Let me actually write a positive version of this,\" which is the things that the job actually is about. It's not a career ladder. It's not the, \"Here's the structured interview things that you should interview for.\"\n\nNoah Weiss (01:02:56):\nBut I think it's the actual job of product management, what is it about, what does success look like? I don't think they're really in a particular order in hindsight, but I'll read them in order. Living the future and work backwards I think is very much the idea of as a PM is one thing they're responsible for. It's having a longer-term vision and time horizon. How do you carve out time to not just be what are we doing over the next two weeks.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:03:20):\nBut six months, a year, two years from now, how do you immerse yourself in them and bring ideas back, bring inspiration back to the team.\n\nLenny (01:03:27):\nI'm going to just going to throw comments at as you're going through them, just add to them. I love that this is exactly Amazon's approach of work backwards, working backwards process. At Airbnb, this is actually the main thing Brian want pushed everyone to do is just think about the idealized product of a magical world where this is totally solid and then work backwards from that. Then Paul Graham talks about this, too, just live in the future and build it.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:03:53):\nI definitely riffed off at least the Paul Graham thing because I remember reading that essay of he thinks everyone thinks that you can get ideas by, I don't know, sitting with their co-founder laying in Dolores Park looking up at the sky and conjuring up the next unicorn or something. Definitely not how that works. You have to actually immerse yourself in the problem space and try to imagine what the future world looks like and then what's missing for people to get to that future state. Yeah. I agree.\n\nLenny (01:04:20):\nI also saw a great tweet by [inaudible 01:04:21] the other day about how if you're working at a company with good leaders, they're never going to be sad that your vision is too big and too ambitious. If there's some reality to it that often they want that just like, \"Let's go. Let's think bigger. How do we change the way we think about the future of all this stuff?\"\n\nNoah Weiss (01:04:39):\nYeah. I mean that was when I was at Google, the thing I took away most from any review with Larry and Sergei was they would ask how could we get 100X the scale or how could this work for this, would seem like an outlandish use case but would push the team to think much further into the future. Yeah. I think definitely what the founders always want.\n\nLenny (01:04:56):\nThat's what Brian Chesky always said too, just like, \"How do we 10X this? What would it take to 10X this idea?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:05:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:05:01):\nAwesome. Okay.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:05:02):\nOkay. The second one, which is maybe obvious, but thinking about how do you actually amplify your team? How do you facilitate ideas? How do you create energy? How do you create momentum? A PM role I think can be a little bit unsatisfying if you're useful, where you create things yourself opposed to you are the one who's amplifying what the work that's being created by everyone else is. You have to get into that more of a facilitator mindset.\n\nLenny (01:05:26):\nWhat I think about here is a lot of teams don't want PMs on their team or don't like PMs or don't think PMs are valuable. What I find is that just means your PMs not good because if you have a good PM, they're just going to help you do the best work of your life. They're going to help you clarify things, prioritize well, unblock you, all that stuff.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:05:45):\nTotally. I wish should find out who wrote that expression early on of PM should be mini-CEOs. I think that's the most dangerous piece of advice ever in the history of product management because I think that is how you end up having PMs who try to act like dictators instead of leaders and facilitators. Because if you're acting like that, yeah, your team can completely reject you and say I never want another PM again.\n\nLenny (01:06:09):\nYeah. So many UPMs are just like, \"I'm finally going to have the power, finally.\" If they move from engineering or some other role and then they get there like, \"Oh, what the hell? Is that to convince everyone of all these things I want to do?\"\n\nNoah Weiss (01:06:20):\nThat actually, I'm going to skip in a slightly different direction of the order of this post. But the fifth one that I wrote in there was your job as to facilitate the pace and quality of decision making. That is very different than you are the person who makes all the decisions. In fact, I think one of the things that PM struggled with early on is how do you actually get the team to be able to make high quality decisions quickly without you arbitrarily playing tiebreaker all the time.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:06:48):\nIt's a soft art to be able to do that. But I think that is actually how you have a really healthy team dynamic instead of PM to want to say, \"Okay. Now it's my turn to get to make the decisions.\" It's definitely not what the job is about.\n\nLenny (01:07:01):\nWhat that makes me think about is I taught a course on product management at one point that I paused for now of just the core job of a PM is to figure out what's next for every single person on the team. There's this meme or GIF of a dog on a train and he's just laying the tracks as the team is moving forward ahead of them just one step at a time. To do that, this is such an important part of that is just help people make decisions, unblock them.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:07:24):\nTotally. I'll combine two of these together. One is you do have to have impeccable execution. This is more of a baseline thing. But I've never seen a PM who was disorganized or didn't do follow-up or wasn't clear about expectations or timelines. It's not high in Maslow's hierarchy of PM enjoyment. But I do think it's a baseline expectation.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:07:47):\nThe thing I think is more enjoyable and probably the most important thing in the long-term is focusing on impact primarily to the customer experience but also to the business. I think there's that saying growth solves all problems. I think impact solves all PM issues, which is if a team is consistently building things people love and changing the director of the business, everything else is just an input.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:08:16):\nI think that focus and understanding as your point about laying the tracks is what direction do you need to go as a team to actually drive that impact? That's probably the single thing that PM can most control.\n\nLenny (01:08:28):\nI love that. I always recommend exactly that if your career is not going as well as you'd hoped or you're not getting promoted, it's usually you're not delivering impact, whatever that means to the company. It may be moving a metric may mean building great product that the founders really love.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:08:43):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:08:43):\nMain impact can mean a lot of different things. But it's so true. On the executing impeccably bucket, the way I think about that is as a great PM you need to have this aura of \"I've got this.\" Anytime someone puts something on your plate, it's not going to fall off. You're not going to forget about it. You're not going to let a ball drop that if the more you can create this aura of \"I got this,\" the more responsibility people are going to give you, the more impact you'll end up having, the more people want to work with you and all that.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:09:12):\nYeah. Ben Horowitz was a board member back at Foursquare. I remember he used to have this saying very Yoda of good leaders need to say what they're going to do and then do what they said. If they can't then they need to follow up and explain why. I mean that's like the amendment and I think that is what good execution looks like.\n\nLenny (01:09:33):\nThat last point is so important. You may not be able to do all the things on your plate, but just telling people. Hey, I'm not going to get to this thing. Let's reprioritize as such a small thing you could do and really creates that, or if you got this, they're not going to forget about this thing asked you to do.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:09:47):\nYeah. You're the shock absorber for the team. You're the thing that builds people's confidence that things are going to be running smoothly and you'll get over the Navajo speed bumps and whatever else. I'll combine two or three of these that are related or just more skills. I said right well. I actually think especially as you get to more senior positions, writing is the only scalable way of having influence on a larger, larger product org.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:10:15):\nThere's a book called On Writing by Stephen King, which I recommend to literally everybody. Stephen King, you're like ... See he's not maybe the most literary critical acclaimed author, but he's a prolific author who publishes things that people love and tell their friends about and he has a great short book on the practice of writing high-quality, high-volume production.\n\nLenny (01:10:39):\nBefore you move on, I'll throw a couple more books that I found useful in my writing. One is actually called On Writing Well. That's funny that they're so similarly titled, which basically every chapter is just another way to cut more from your writing. More and more parts you should cut. Interestingly, I do have a lot of guest posts in my newsletter and I find 90% of the time if I just cut the first paragraph of what they first took a crack at and jumps straight into the thing, immediately gets better. This book talks a lot about that.\n\nLenny (01:11:07):\nAnother book that is amazing for writing better is Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit by the guy that wrote The War of Art, forget his name. But that book is awesome and it's just like nobody wants to read what you're writing. Here's how to maybe make it something people want to read. Then recently I read one called Several Short Sentences or something like that. It's all about just writing short sentences and that helps a lot. There you go. Three more recommendations.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:11:32):\nOkay. I got to read the last two. I haven't read those, but they sound perfect. Okay. Maybe I'll throw one more. Let's say we talked about this earlier, but actually read this in the post many years ago, is optimizing for the pace of learning and knowing that long-term massive thing that's going to drive impact. I think it can be hard if you're a PM for a feature team. You're part of a big company. I don't know. I'm making this up.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:11:55):\nYou're on the AdWords team at Google and you're responsible for the bid input selector or something and probably is a whole team, honestly, now at this point. You've got such a set of blinders on that I think it can be hard to think about what else could this team become, what else could you drive beyond the thing that's right in front of you?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:12:16):\nOptimizing for learning, being willing to take those bolder bets, knowing you can be wrong in the short-term, but that you'll learn new levers that will be really fruitful in the long-term. It's a portfolio approach to product, but I think a really important one.\n\nLenny (01:12:30):\nI was just interviewing a product leader at Asana, Paige Costello. We were talking about how she's often the youngest person in the room and often manages people that are much older than her and more experienced than her and asked her just how do you that? How do you succeed in that environment?\n\nLenny (01:12:46):\nWhat she's found is just being the person that has the answers and the insights in meetings, people obviously run to her like, \"Hey, what do you think of this?\" Because she just knows what people are going to need. I think that's exactly what you're talking about here is just be the person that knows the most about the problem, the customers, the space.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:13:04):\nYeah. Then I'll combine the last two just because I know time. But the combination of ... I wrote data fluency, which is not to say that every PM needs to be a statistician. I mean it's great. I mean you've had a lot of great posts about how to understand some of the basics of experimentation, correlation, causation and statistical significance. That's all great.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:13:23):\nBut by data fluency, I think it's more actually what you were just saying, which is you know enough about the insights about your customers that it can then inform making higher likelihood product bets and that data can be quantitative, that data can be survey based, it can be from doing 100 meetings with customers yourself. Those are all types of data inputs to me. Being really fluent and then maybe combining that with great product taste.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:13:49):\nI know it's a controversial statement now to say that there is taste for product. But I do think in all the love of the frameworks and the analytics and everything else and in the field of product, I think people sometimes lose sight of, \"It's a creative field.\" It's not art on its own. But you could get all the inspiration from art and I actually think there's a lot ... there's a book, I think it's called Creative Selection, I forget the exact name of it, about some of the early iPhone development teams at Apple and working with Steve Jobs there.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:14:21):\nI've never worked at Apple. But I actually think it's the best book I've read about the just iterating creative work of building new products and what it means to have taste, which is to say you've developed some amount of intuition for what people will likely love before you're able to test it. Anyway, I think taste plus fluency and data, that too is a combination, is a pretty powerful combo.\n\nLenny (01:14:48):\nLet me ask you just a couple questions about this list before we get to a very exciting lightning round and I can let you go.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:14:55):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (01:14:56):\nOf these 10 attributes, say you're a new product manager, if you had to pick two or three that you think are most important to get right and focus on in your early career, which would you say they would be?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:15:06):\nI think for early on in your career, what I would say is getting great at execution. It's a thing that you can most control. Then I think building that news for impact, even if the impact is more local, because that's how you actually will demonstrate momentum and build credibility and then actually do think early on getting really fluent on the data and the research side that you can have insights that you can read back to your team.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:15:29):\nThose are to me the most slammed up ways of becoming someone who starts to build credibility as a product manager in any organization.\n\nLenny (01:15:38):\nAwesome. That's what I always tell on new PMs too, is just get really good at execution because that creates that aura of, \"Oh, this person's just killing it. They're just shipping on time. People know it's happening. They're hitting dates,\" things like that.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:15:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:15:49):\nThe last question is just say more of a senior product leader, say, on director. Are there three other attributes you think are ones they should focus on most or maybe the same?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:15:59):\nYeah. I mean I think this is where the pace and quality decision making starts to matter a lot more because you're still unresponsible sometimes for teams of teams and you're helping to facilitate high quality decisions, often ones that have a lot of uncertainty or risk or ambiguity. How do you keep the organization unblocked, not just a team moving well.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:16:21):\nI think the living in the future and working backwards, I think the more senior you get, it's always going to be the product founder who is responsible for the ultimate vision, but you become more responsible for that meeting a longer-term strategy to realize that vision. Becoming just someone who can dedicate more of your time to be out of the fray of the day-to-day and think more about the longer-term strategy that you want to pursue.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:16:47):\nThe last one, and we talked about just earlier, but I think being a really good writer, it is just the highest leverage usage of your time. If you want to influence an organization at least for one that doesn't just spend all day in meetings, but I think it's really hard to dedicate the time to it because you're probably spending most of your day in meetings. It's the antidote to that to scale your ability to influence the product direction and maybe even the principles and how you develop product at a company.\n\nLenny (01:17:17):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:17:22):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny (01:17:23):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:17:27):\nThese may not be the most unique, but I will say them, which is Innovator's Dilemma by Clayton Christiansen, whether you're working a large company and you're suffering it or you're working a startup and you're trying to out flank an incumbent, I still do think that and innovative solution, the follow on are the best books on product strategy to read.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:17:47):\nIf you're moving into more of a leadership or management position, I think Radical Candor by Kim Scott is just incredible and worth everyone reading. Frankly, if you're a PM and you're doing soft influence, I think it's really important. Then the third one, which is maybe a little off the beat of path, there's a book called Leadership in Turbulent Times by Doris Goodwin who's a presidential historian.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:18:12):\nIt's this amazing book that looks at four of the most notable presidents and how their leadership style evolved when they were in really critical hard times in their presidency. I just think it's actually the best book about leadership style and how do you evolve and how do you deal with crises, which again is maybe later on in your career. But I love getting inspiration from not just reading books about tech and product and I think that's one of the best ones.\n\nLenny (01:18:40):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:18:43):\nThe obvious answer, which I'm sure many people would say would be Succession. I'm not going to ruin anything for the finale because people haven't seen it all. But the writing, the Shakespearean level drama of it all, it's just incredible and just heart wrenching that you wind up loathing most of the characters. But you can't take yourself out of it.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:19:03):\nThe one that's maybe less common, and I watched right when we started paternity leave is The Bear, I don't know if you heard about it.\n\nLenny (01:19:11):\nThe restaurants.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:19:12):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:19:13):\nYeah. Seen that. Yeah.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:19:14):\nI'm a sucker for incredible cinematography, just what they do in basically the single room of this restaurant and kitchen and just the piece of it. I think it's just an incredible piece of art. I don't know if it's the best show ever, but it is a really moving, emotionally jarring piece of TV.\n\nLenny (01:19:34):\nAlso, quite stressful to watch.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:19:36):\nVery sure. I would not relax to it to go to sleep.\n\nLenny (01:19:39):\nBut Awesome. Okay. Favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:19:45):\nThat would depend a lot, I think on obviously, the seniority level and things like that. But I think the more general, and I always love to ask people is what unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product team? When I say unfair or you in secret, I usually mean not something that you probably read on a medium input. But what did you learn? How did you learn it and how does it work and how do you apply it? You also just get amazing interesting bits of inspiration from asking that.\n\nLenny (01:20:17):\nWhat is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:20:21):\nThis will also serve for recommendations for you based on or you've not thread about parenting clients because none of the products I've learned or loved recently have been software. But they're all maybe software enabled. The Nanit, which is a weird name, but it's this AI-enabled camera for basically watching your day as they sleep. It's like incredible, look, because you sleep analytics and really helps you be a less neurotic parent. I would highly recommend it.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:20:48):\nThe SNOO, which is basically this amazing device that can help soothe your kid when all they need is a little bit of that soothing while they sleep so that you can sleep a little bit more. You can tell the steam here is sleep. The last one is there's this chemical up baby that has this whole elaborate stroller system with interchangeable parts and, honestly, it's just an incredibly well-designed piece of hardware that works in and out of the car.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:21:16):\nYeah. I think I've re-appreciated really well-designed hard products that are not necessarily hardware from Apple and that has been what baby new parents is about.\n\nLenny (01:21:26):\nI have all three. Also, a huge shout-out to the Nanit team who sent me a Nanit and all the stuff around the Nanit. Thank you. I'm not going to name the specific PM who sent it to me, because I don't remember his name off the top of my head, but thank you, Nanit.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:21:41):\nYeah. It turned out there was a whole world of baby tech, which I had no idea. I mean, it makes sense that existed, but you never know about until you're a parent. Now, I'm obsessed.\n\nLenny (01:21:49):\nOne tip that for Nanit, my wife and I have been playing with different names for our kid and we have been changing his name in the Nanit so that anytime we go into the room it sends us a push, \"Hey, there's activity in the room with the names so that we could feel the different names.\"\n\nNoah Weiss (01:22:05):\nI love that. Yeah. My wife and I did something similar where we had three or four final name contenders and we didn't use the Nanit for. But we literal just picked a week and said, \"On Monday we're going to like refer to the future baby by that name for the entire week and give some personification to it.\" That helped us get down from four to one. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:22:28):\nWhat a wide-ranging set of pieces of advice we got on this podcast. Two more questions. What is something relatively minor you've changed in how you develop product at Slack that has had a lot of impact on your ability to execute?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:22:38):\nBy far, the biggest thing, which is more of a cultural shift is that we stopped spending so many cycles on design explorations of static mocks or walkthroughs and said, \"How quickly can we get into prototyping the path in real software, even if it's messy and you throw it away,\" at least for something like Slack. You got to live and touch and smell the software. You can't just look at it. That's been a huge unlock for avoiding spending months on design debates and just getting to, well, how does the software feel? That's what matters.\n\nLenny (01:23:12):\nSpeaking of Slack, final question, what is your favorite Slack pro tip that people may not be aware of?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:23:19):\nI'm going to give two because if someone asks me this, \"I'm like, these are the two things that if you're not in love with Slack, you'll fall in love with Slack.\" The first is obviously you have a sidebar, it can be unruly, but you can customize the sidebar into sections and each of those sections you can have settings like. \"Show unread only\" or \"Sort by recency,\" or \"Sort by alphabetical,\" whatever it might be. You can collapse the section so you don't see it all at once.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:23:44):\nI think having a well-managed sidebar, which doesn't actually take that long, it's like this amazing thing because then all this inbound is structured in an order and a grouping that fits how you want to view your working life. Customizing the sidebar. The second thing is just use the quick switcher for everything. Just hit Apple K and just start typing and it feels like they're playing a video game, just hopping around channels, people, files, search. Pretty much all the actions you can take are on as well.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:24:15):\nI think most SaaS products now have borrowed that pattern. You can use another software, but it works particularly well in Slack.\n\nLenny (01:24:23):\nNo. I know the last thing you needed was to record a podcast your first week back to work. I so appreciate you making the time. It feels like we're two ships passing in the night from pat leave and to new pat leave. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nNoah Weiss (01:24:39):\nI will confess that I haven't used Twitter in months because I was doing digital detox, but still I think @Noah_Weiss is a pretty good place to find me online and whether there or anywhere else, still love to have peoples like Slack feature requests, especially about things that you wish were possible or that would get the rest of your company to join on Slack because you love it, but you can't convince them. Those are always golden nuggets.\n\nLenny (01:25:04):\nAwesome. Noah, thank you so much for being here.\n\nNoah Weiss (01:25:06):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny (01:25:08):\nBye everyone.

At YouTube, when you joined, my understanding is YouTube was losing a lot of money.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:00:05):\nThere were many times where Google leadership reconsidered the acquisition and, \"Should we sell YouTube?\" if you can believe it or not.\n\nLenny (00:00:11):\nAt Thumbtack, it looks like you went from 1 to -1 and then back to 1.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:00:15):\nI remember in a board meeting, the new model really started to show legs and one of the board members, Brian Schreier at Sequoia, said it was the prettiest smile graph that he had ever seen.\n\nLenny (00:00:23):\nWhen you were at Facebook, you built what is called the New Product Experimentation team trying to create a startup within a startup.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:00:29):\nYou're thinking on a different time horizon. If you're a large organization and you do some performance management process twice a year and you're 0 to 1 incubator, you've already killed it. It's the wrong incentive.\n\nLenny (00:00:39):\nAs the chief product officer of Grammarly, I'm curious what word you most often misspelled?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:00:47):\nThe.\n\nLenny (00:00:47):\nYou do T-E-H?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:00:48):\nT-E-H. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:00:49):\nOh man.\n\n(00:00:53):\nToday my guest is Noam Lovinsky. Noam is currently chief product officer at Grammarly. Previously, he was an early PM at YouTube where he spent five years leading the creator product experience and then the broader YouTube consumer product experience. He then went on to take on the chief product officer role at Thumbtack, which involved helping the company reignite growth after a downturn caused by some changes Google made in SEO. He then went on to Facebook where he created the New Product Experimentation team whose charter was to incubate big new ideas protected from the larger Facebook org.\n\n(00:01:26):\nNoam has such a unique set of experiences taking products from 0 to 1, from -1 to 1, from 1 to 100, and even starting his own companies. He's never really been on a podcast before and he rarely ever tweets or post anything online, which we actually talk about. In our conversation, we walk through the lessons that he's learned through his amazing career at YouTube, Facebook, Thumbtack, and at Grammarly. We talk about when it makes sense to kill your project at a company, when it makes sense to ask to be layered at a company, why you should be keeping a nose out for which products matter most at a business and to find those products, why you need to diversify your growth channels at your business, why you should be finding work that is going to most stretch you to help you advance in your career, a bunch of advice for creating space for innovation within a large company and so much more. Noam is such a gem and I'm really excited to share his wisdom with you.\n\n(00:02:20):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow this podcast in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

I've heard so many great things about you from so many people. I think you're friends with a lot of guests that have been on this podcast. Something that I find really interesting about you and really respect about you is that you've worked at so many great companies and you've done so many big things in your career, but you barely ever tweet. You don't have a newsletter. I don't see many things on LinkedIn. I don't think you've even been on a podcast before. I think the only evidence I can find that you exist is you have this YouTube channel that's just like you go-karting and kids and people wishing you a happy birthday.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:05:00):\nOh gosh, I should go monitor that. I forgot about that.\n\nLenny (00:05:05):\nYou might want to go find it now.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:05:09):\nYeah, yeah, yeah that's funny. Yeah, it's funny. I think about that a lot, like am I doing something wrong? Should I be putting more effort in that? I mean, it's funny that you mentioned newsletter. I spend a lot of time with the Substack team's. I've been a very active advisor there. The team is fantastic by the way. And I think about it. Am I doing something wrong in my career by not doing that? But just to be honest, it doesn't come authentically to me. It doesn't come naturally to me. I get really focused on the thing that I'm working on and get really deep in the thing that I am working on and I have a hard time kind of multitasking a lot outside of that to be totally honest. The way that I kind of get to know the industry and other teams or whatnot is just through working with people.\n\n(00:05:58):\nI'm not a very big networker. I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that. I wish I were better at that. I get to know people by doing work with them, by helping them. And it doesn't necessarily scale in the same way that Twitter does, but it's served me well so far and it's more kind of authentic and it's what comes more natural to me. And so that's how I do it. So I'm doing a lot of coffees. I'm meeting people that way. I'm not doing a lot of tweeting or writing of newsletters. Maybe one day, but that's not me today.\n\nLenny (00:06:31):\nSo I think this is an awesome example of you can be incredibly successful as a product manager and as anyone in tech not investing time posting online. I am going to incriminate myself here, but I feel like the advice I always share with people is the best people are not spending time tweeting and talking online and sharing on LinkedIn. They're just doing the work. They don't have time for that sort of thing. And I think you're a great example of that. Is there anything along those lines that you share with folks that are just like, \"Hey, should I be investing time here?\"\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:06:59):\nI think everyone can chart their own path and has a way that is sort of authentic to them and leans on their strengths. What I often coach people is, do what you like. You're generally going to be a lot better at the things that really fill you up that really get you excited. Life is short. There's so many things to be doing out there. We're so lucky. The number of interesting waves of technology that I've experienced, it just makes me feel like it's going to keep happening for a long time. We're very fortunate to be born in the time that we are and have the opportunities that we are. So why spend your time doing something that doesn't feel good because you think that it might lead to some success, where if you lean on what's authentic to you and what makes you happy, chances are you're going to be one of the best people at those things?\n\nLenny (00:07:49):\nI love that advice. And I think it's so important. I think there's a lot of pressure on people too. \"I need to do this, I need to do that.\"\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:07:49):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (00:07:55):\n\"I need to tweet, I need to share content to be successful.\" This comes up a lot in this podcast, that the more you could just stick close to what gives you energy and what you enjoy doing, oftentimes that leads to things you wouldn't expect in a lot of success.\n\n(00:08:07):\nSpeaking of that, looking at your career arc, I noticed a really interesting pattern and a really diverse set of experiences. So just kind of talking through places you've been. At Facebook, you worked on 0 to 1 stuff. At YouTube, the way I see it as you almost went from -1 to 1. At Thumbtack, it looks like you went from 1 to -1 and then back to 1. So it's like a really unique turnaround story. And then with Grammarly it feels like it's like, I don't know, 1 or I don't know, 5 to 100, or wherever you end up taking it. So I thought it'd be fun to talk through each of these experiences because they're such unique approaches or such unique experiences and see what lessons and wisdom we can extract from your journey.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:08:51):\nThat sounds great. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:08:52):\nOkay, sweet. So I'm thinking reverse chronologically, we start with YouTube, which the way I see it is it's kind of -1 to 1. When you join, my understanding is YouTube was losing a lot of money. When you left, they were not losing money. And I was actually just looking, they're valued apparently at $200 billion today, YouTube as a business. I know you haven't been there for a while, but great work. What lessons did you take away from that journey? What stories come to mind from that part of your career that might be helpful to people?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:09:21):\nMaybe first to start looking with why hop around these experiences. I always tell people I feel like I'm an IC trapped in a manager's body sometimes. Fundamentally, I like to build, that's why I do this. I like to make things. And so sometimes the more fun way to make things is to start something and sometimes the better way to make things in the situation that I'm in is to try to support teams and lead through teams.\n\n(00:09:50):\nAnd so I joined YouTube through an acquisition of a company I started. In the beginning, what I was doing there is just rebuilding that product on Google infrastructure and for YouTube customers. And maybe the first lesson was actually to look around at what the rest of the team was doing and be really honest and open about the relative priority of the thing that you're working on even if it might lead to your project getting canceled.\n\n(00:10:26):\nSo one of the things that I remember doing really on is actually talking to the leadership team and being like, \"I don't think we should be putting 50 engineers on this project. Looking at the rest of the roadmap and the rest of the priorities, excuse me, I think this team would likely be better served elsewhere.\" Even though that was likely negotiating my way out of a job in month three, I don't know, I kind of felt like that was the right thing for the team and for the business.\n\n(00:10:57):\nAnd then that started a very interesting journey because from there, basically the leadership was like, \"You're right. We're going to wind that down and build some of those features into the existing product. And now you, you come and lead this focus area, we're calling the creator focus area.\" So I went from basically rebuilding the product that our startup had built to leading one of the three focus areas at YouTube. There was the viewer team, the creator team, and the advertiser team. And Hunter Walk, who's amazing, was leading the viewer team. And Shishir Mehrotra, who's also very amazing, was leading the advertising team.\n\nLenny (00:11:39):\nWhat an alumni community.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:11:41):\nThere was me. I was sort of like 29-year-old startupy guy working with these guys who were awesome. And YouTube in general, and continues to be, an incredible team. And so I think that was a first really good lesson. That in the right organizations, even in large organizations, advocate for what's best for the team, advocate for what's best for the organization even if that means that it puts you at a particular difficult moment. If it is a healthy team that rewards those sorts of decisions and actions, good things will happen. If it's not, that's good to know too. That's good to know early. So that's one thing that comes to mind.\n\n(00:12:32):\nMaybe one other I would say atypical career choice that I made shortly thereafter is then when I was put in that role, I really struggled in that role. I was reporting to the CEO at the time, a guy named Salar Kamangar, who's also awesome, Google's 6th employee and just learned a ton from him, like an incredible strategic thinker. But he was asking me questions that I felt like they were from a different planet. I was like, I didn't know what they meant and he just thought in a different way, a different level or different scale and that's still something that I was learning. Eventually I figured it out, but I was really struggling in that moment. I had a really good relationship with both Hunter and Shishir and they really helped me through that. And eventually, I went to Salar and said, \"Hey, I think I should actually report to Hunter. I think this would work better if we kind of combined the organizations this way and then we divided and conquered this way.\"\n\n(00:13:41):\nAnd again, very atypical, no one has ever come to me in my career and said, \"I would like you to layer me in this other person.\" But in that moment I was just like, \"This is how I will do better work. This is how I will get better support. I will be happier and more productive and it'll be better for the team.\" And you know what? For me anyway, I was right. We made that change. Hunter was a fantastic manager and support at YouTube. I learned a ton, grew a lot. And then eventually when he moved on, Shishir took over the organization and then I moved into the viewer part of the organization, which is where I spent the rest of my time there, which was leading and supporting the viewer PM team at YouTube.\n\nLenny (00:14:32):\nThese stories are amazing. It connects to your point that you're kind of an, I see, an inner child I see, where you keep trying to kill your career by accident. Like, \"Now, let's kill this project I'm working on. I'm going to demote myself a little bit.\" But clearly it's worked out. Is there anything that you saw that gave you that confidence that, \"This is actually going to be okay\"? Because again, people don't normally think this is how you get ahead in your career, is you kill your team and you layer yourself.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:14:58):\nYeah, I mean I think having a broader view of the company strategy, having an instinct for what we should be doing and why and how I might prioritize all of these investments if I were given the opportunity to do that, I think internalizing that and understanding that and then trying to align whatever is under your influence towards that overall goal is very helpful and made me feel like, \"I'm pretty confident this is going to be okay because it will lead to better results for the organization given what we're trying to do. And so as long as I'm trying to push decisions or actions that actually lead to better results, if it's a healthy culture and organization, I should be okay.\"\n\n(00:15:47):\nI think that the other thing is, just over the years, I got extremely lucky. The first job that I got out of school was an incredible group of people and it gave me a nose for talent. It gave me a nose for what great feels like and what a high functioning team feels like. It's hard to know that without experiencing that. And so in the moments, YouTube was also one of those teams, Grammarly is one of those teams, Thumbtack was one of those teams. Being able to sniff that out when you're trying to choose the next team is very important. But I think that's another thing that gave me confidence. I learned these people well enough, Hunter, Shishir, et cetera, to have the instinct that the right thing will happen, like this will be better for me and the broader team.\n\nLenny (00:16:49):\nGot it. So the key there is just you have to trust that the team around you is good enough, that you're not going to be pushed off into a corner. I think you made a really profound point here that a lot of people don't get about the job of a product leader and a product manager, that a big part of your job is to think about what is best for the business and work backwards from that. Not necessarily what's the best thing for the user is the highest priority, not necessarily what's the best thing for my team and how do I hit the goals that I'm obsessed with. It's what is going to be best for the business broadly and then make decisions there. Is there anything more you can say there about just how powerful that is as a way of thinking about prioritization and decisions as a product manager?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:17:31):\nYeah, it's a great question. I mean, I think ideally, things that are best for the customer, there's high overlap with that with things that are best for the business, but not always, right? And I think figuring out some principles that help guide those sorts of conflicts can be really, really helpful. At Thumbtack, we had principles about which sides of the marketplace we wanted to serve in which order and when we serve Thumbtack. So it was customers first, pros second, and then Thumbtack last. And that's actually the first two... Saying Thumbtack last is the easy thing to say. Actually doing it in action I think is a very different thing. But that first one of like, should we... Especially when you're starting a marketplace, as you know well, Lenny, supply is so critical. Many marketplaces live and die by the quality and liquidity and supply. And so why would you focus on customers first and the Thumbtack perspective and supply are the pros, the people that you hire?\n\n(00:18:41):\nWell, we always just felt that what the pros need from us is more customers. What the pros need from us is high quality customers. And so if we really try to make a great customer experience that attracts more customers, helps them find the right pros, provides the highest quality customers, then that will therefore be better for the pros. And so that's how we should prioritize. If we do those things right, then the business will benefit, right? And so doing things like raising prices because we think it's good for the business, even though it causes liquidity issues in the marketplace might be a little bit of a local maxima, locally optimizing rather than globally optimizing. So I think sometimes in these sorts of questions, trying to establish some set of guiding principles that help navigate some of these more ambiguous or thorny questions can be really helpful.\n\nLenny (00:19:38):\nI want to circle back to this first point you made, an experience you had convincing people that your first project shouldn't be something you work on. How long do you stick with something that isn't going well and then decide, \"Okay, let's convince people this is something I should move on from,\" versus you don't want to give up on a project quickly, you want to give it a shot?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:19:56):\nI mean, look, I don't know that it's a perfect answer, but I think the reality is just that what kills most projects most early companies is stamina. And I think that we all need to work on being more resilient about kind of like, I remember at Thumbtack, Marco, the CEO, we used to say that it feels like we're running uphill and chewing glass, and you're kind of like, \"That's right, we want to do that. That's good for us. Take our medicine.\" So you want to practice that sort of resiliency. But ultimately, I think that what starts to happen is you start to lose the stamina and you're just not bringing your best self to the situation.\n\n(00:20:42):\nAnd so many of these things that are so high ambiguity where you don't know exactly what to build or you don't know exactly, you're not getting the signal you need or the feedback you need to be able to hone it in and know that you're doing something well. They require just an ungodly level of faith and stamina. And so that's sort of what I look to. When you see a team that is motivated, that is building something like they're really excited about, I mean just the inertia, the quality, it's like a whole different game where when you see a team that's sort of down and out and they've really been hitting their head against the wall for a long time, sometimes they just need a change of scene, a change of pace, and they get to a much better situation. So my honest answer is, yeah, it's the, when do you run out of steam is usually the question. I think that happens usually like in the startup case, a lot of times before you run out money or these other things.\n\nLenny (00:21:48):\nWe've talked about Thumbtack a couple of times now, so let's talk about that. I love this description of running a pill, chewing glass. My understanding is when you joined, things were going well, and then things started to go much less well, and then you helped turn things around. Talk about that part of your journey and what you learned from that time.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:22:05):\nYeah, sure. Again, really fantastic team and really strong founders. That company was just on the bleeding edge of things like SEO and growing by SEO. It was one of the best organizations that are driving growth through that channel. But I think a thing that I learned really early, which Lenny with your background you probably know as well, SEO is a sort of a live by the sword, die by the sword channel of growth. I think that one channel growth company is always a no-no. And so that's a little bit of what we had at Thumbtack.\n\n(00:22:44):\nSo it was funny, because I remember when I joined and Marco and I had an agreement where it's like, \"Okay, I'm going to do my three months of onboarding, listening to our new leader inheriting a team.\" I've always gotten advice that that's what you should do. And Marco being an entrepreneur and a hard running founder is like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.\" And then a month in, it's like, \"All right, we got to run 2024 planning. Go.\" Or not 2024, sorry, at the time it was. And yeah, in the early days when I was there, Thumbtack was seeing triple digit growth. Then we had a couple SEO hits that got us down to double-digit growth. And then not too long after that, we were actually, for the first time in the company's history, seeing negative year-over-year growth and Google was just really coming down on our category as we were, by the way, trying to rebuild the whole product and change the monetization model and everything in between.\n\n(00:23:50):\nSo it was a really a tough moment of how much do we kind of spend to reinforce the old model while we're sort of building the new model, kind of changing the engine while the plane is flying. I think I remember in a board meeting, once we kind of turned that around and over time and also the new model really started to show legs and really started to work, one of the board members, Brian Schreier at Sequoia, said it was the prettiest smile graph that he had ever, ever seen. It was obviously a really proud moment there.\n\n(00:24:24):\nBut I think that the thing that I took away from that, which I tell PMs quite a bit, is growth masks all problems. You don't really have a, I think, true understanding of what is working well and what is not working well when you have incredible growth. YouTube was a great example of that. And at Thumbtac, it had incredible growth for quite some time, but it was essentially burning through a lot of demand. It was just dropping a lot of demand on the floor because there wasn't sufficient liquidity on the supply side to really meet that demand. The team knew and was trying to work on that problem, but it wasn't as urgent or high priority because you're having triple digit growth. What's wrong? Everything's going great, right?\n\n(00:25:11):\nAnd then the moment growth starts to slow or certainly when growth starts to be negative, all of a sudden the tenor in the organization really changes and you start looking at things very differently and trying to understand what's actually going on. And so I think it's actually a very healthy thing for businesses to go through as they turn into long-term sustainable businesses to have those sorts of moments, because I think otherwise it's just really challenging to identify where the true issues are. And I think as a PM, if you've only ever worked on things that grow and you've never felt the other side of that and how to help turn that around with your team, I think you lose a lot in your career if you don't experience that.\n\n(00:25:58):\nI'm kind of naturally paranoid. And especially as I manage growth, I often look at things and ask myself like, \"Okay, what do I do right now if it went negative? How would I prioritize things if it went negative?\" Having gone through that experience, I just look at things in a different way of urgency. I look at things at different levels of priority having gone through that experience.\n\nLenny (00:26:25):\nWith this Thumbtack story, I think it's rare that a business gets the smile graph that you described, this prettiest smile graph that this board member has ever seen. I think that is rarely the case. Usually, it doesn't come back up. Can you share what you did to help Thumbtack turn things around? I know it's very particular to Thumbtack in the business, but just anything there that would be useful to people?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:26:46):\nSure. First of all, this is very much the team. It's not just things that I did. So I mean, first was turning on multiple channels of growth. Up until then, Thumbtack had tried and stopped paid channels, other organic channels like referrals, all of the typical things. And so, we just went back to first principles on a lot of that and also just kind of reformed a team around that and basically got an amazing team together. One of them, Whitney Steele is running marketing at Descript now. Another one, David Schein is running a product at HIMSS. But basically I went back to first principles on some of those growth channels and experiment on our way to much, much better results.\n\n(00:27:42):\nI think that one of the things that we were doing incorrectly at Thumbtack is Thumbtack is actually a marketplace that is actually made up of thousands of marketplaces, right? Like DJs in Philadelphia is one marketplace, DJs in Atlanta is another marketplace, contractors in Sonoma is another marketplace. And then Thumbtack is obviously the container of all of those marketplaces. I think we were just bifurcating our targeting and our growth efforts a little too narrowly, assuming we had to grow in that way market by market rather than targeting more broadly, providing the more aggregate data to Google and others, and then optimizing from there. The fact that we already had really good showing in SEO and really good patriarch and SEO helped to bolster things like SEM and then eventually Facebook as well.\n\n(00:28:40):\nThose were kind of the growth levers, but the core issue with the Thumbtack product was that it was just a very high friction customer experience that really left customers waiting. So the way that Thumbtack worked basically was a customer would find them through a search query, they would come in and they would answer a number of questions about the job they needed done, and then Thumbtack would say, \"Okay, great, we'll get back to you in 24 hours.\" And this is a modern day experience, right?\n\n(00:29:17):\nAnd then what Thumbtack would do is they would take that job and they would federate it out to as many of the pros that might match the criteria, and then the pros would pay to quote to show up as a potential provider for that job. Now, I don't want to take anything away from that team because that worked phenomenally well for a really long time. And actually it's a perfect case study in like, \"|Just do the scrappy thing that works to grow.\" And they did that very well, but the stage and size of the business when I joined it had kind of outgrown that. And the team knew that. That's obviously a very high friction experience. The idea that the customer, they're super excited, they want to hire someone, and at that moment you'd be like, \"Cool, talk to you soon,\" not the best experience.\n\n(00:30:06):\nAnd the fact that you're asking your supply to put up money to even show up to customers in the first place, well, what the customers want to see is the supply. Like, \"Tell me who I can hire.\" Also, a lot of friction on that side and also in some cases some unfair revenue on that side because if folks are paying to be seen and maybe they're looked at, but there's not really high intent, then they're not going to get the customers they want, they're going to be spending revenue, they're not going to be getting revenue back. It turns into just a bad loop obviously.\n\n(00:30:40):\nSo the main thing we did is to rebuild that whole loop, change the monetization model, build a system where essentially pros could provide instant quotes. Lenny, I'm sure from Airbnb, this is very familiar, the move from request to book to instant booking. It was a very similar thing in a different kind of category of service and supply obviously. But that shift and doing that shift across those thousands of marketplaces and then finding the right friction point for monetization and when and what to charge people for and all of that change, that is what really, at its core, turned the growth engine around at Thumbtack. And it's just a real testament to those founders that they believe that, saw that, and were willing to run a pill and chew glass to get to that point. I don't know the details of the business anymore. And if I did, I wouldn't speak to it. But from what I hear, things are going well, so I think that that served the company well.\n\nLenny (00:31:45):\nYeah, as you were talking about that, that's exactly an experience Airbnb went through. I actually led that effort at Airbnb. It took three years of my life.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:31:53):\nOh my gosh, we should talk about that one day.\n\nLenny (00:31:57):\nYeah, I've written about it here and there, but honestly very quietly is one of the biggest transformations Airbnb went through, shifting from I'm going to go request a book to basically every book now on Airbnb is instant. And that was a very difficult and painful journey. But looking back, I don't think Airbnb would've made it if not for that. And unlike Thumbtack, we did it before things were starting to fall apart. And actually, I was going to say the lens that we used that I find really helpful here is, you should be asking yourself, \"If somebody was to come into our space and disrupt us and start now to become the new Airbnb, what would they do?\"\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:32:33):\nYeah, totally.\n\nLenny (00:32:34):\nAnd it was obvious that it'd be be make it instant, just the way it works. Welcome to Airbnb disruptor. And so, yeah.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:32:40):\nAnother learning there is any product you work on that involves bits and atoms is exponentially harder than products that just involve bits. But it's amazing how something as seemingly simple as make an instant ends up being so incredibly deep and complicated. And especially on an existing business, making that transition while still growing is just very, very complicated. Fantastic learning I'm sure you had as well.\n\nLenny (00:33:07):\nVery difficult to change people's expectations and behavior. This could be its own podcast episode, just changing marketplaces into an instant experience.\n\n(00:33:14):\nI wanted to circle back real quick to the first lesson you had there, which is adding new channels. I think this is a really interesting takeaway here. So essentially Thumbtack was reliant on SEO. Google slash the sword, as you described, started changing things so traffic stopped coming. I think a cool lesson here is just if you're reliant on one growth channel, which I think most companies actually are, I think most companies have one main driver, I think a lesson here is potentially before things start to fall apart, especially if you're SEO-driven, start to explore more practically paid referrals.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:33:46):\nTotally. I mean I think maybe it's, again, it's kind of living through that. Now, anytime I look at a product or look at a team, it's one of the first things that perks up the paranoia of just like, \"Oh no. You don't want to be in that situation. Let's figure out now how you start to diversify because you just never know, like you say, when one of those might dry up.\"\n\nLenny (00:34:09):\nImagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn.\n\n(00:34:20):\nLinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10X increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs, and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated 2 to 5X higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.\n\n(00:35:29):\nIs there anything else from your time at Thumbtack that stands out as an interesting lesson or takeaway that you bring with you to the work you do now?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:35:37):\nI would say this, I think especially at the leadership level, the team that reports to the CEO, that group doesn't always have the opportunity to do a lot of project work together, right? You've got your CFO, you've got your head of sales, you've got your product and your engineering. There's just not as often as natural ways for that group to work together. And then when something happens like growth goes negative, that group is very important. And that group's ability to tackle hard things together is very important. I think that one important lesson from that is, no one can be a bystander on product strategy. Just because you've got product in your title doesn't mean you're the only one that should be thinking about product strategy certainly at that level. Certainly not in engineering.\n\n(00:36:39):\nThe CFO, the head of people, everyone needs to have a seat at the table when it comes to product strategy, what the company's doing and what they're going to do to grow out of the situation that they're in. Because otherwise, in those hard times it can kind of be like a, \"What have you done for me lately?\" sort of a dynamic. And that's just not the right dynamic to have on that team. I'm not saying that at Thumbtack we had the right dynamic, but I think it was a really important learning in that moment of how that team, even if they didn't typically get as involved in things like product strategy and what we're building, how everyone had to be all hands on deck and really thinking about those sorts of problems because it's the only way I think you can get a whole company and team out of those situations by everyone getting involved in doing their part and pulling on the levers that they have in their area in order to do that well. I don't think it can work in any other way.\n\nLenny (00:37:38):\nSo there's a lesson there. Build a relationship with the leadership team before things start to go awry.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:37:44):\nThat, yes. Certainly that, but I think it's also incumbent for people in our roles and engineering roles to bring strategy to that discussion, to that group, in a way that it is possible for everyone to engage and everyone to internalize and understand what it means for their area and to even have obviously a say in because they're on the leadership team at the end of the day. They should feel like their fingerprint is also on the company strategy, and as soon as it starts to feel like that's their world, that's our world. And I think that's true for any of the functions. It's true for what's happening in sales, it's true for what's happening in marketing. As product managers, we naturally need to be the connective tissue across all of that, but I think the whole leadership team at that level should feel like connective tissue across all of those functions.\n\nLenny (00:38:39):\nOkay. Let's transition to Facebook. This is I think an example of 0 to 1. So when you were at Facebook, you built what is called the New Product Experimentation team. I actually thought it was called the New Product Experiment Experience team, but I think it's New Product Experimentation team. My understanding is the idea there is, instead of Facebook having to buy the next Instagram and WhatsApp and all the things basically incubate startups within Facebook in a stabled concept, a startup within a startup, create all these startups within a startup. And as an outsider, it feels like it was really fun for a while, but it hasn't let any amazing new businesses for Facebook. Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm curious what that experience was like, what you took away from it, how it went, what you think about when you look back at that part of your journey.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:39:28):\nI was one of the few folks that kind of joined that team early and help build that team. How it ended up and how it closed down, I am not familiar with because I wasn't there. But I think in terms of was it a success or not because it didn't build the next Instagram I think is a little bit of the wrong bar to set for things like that. To some extent, it's like, \"Did the group win the lottery or not? And let's judge there. Let's judge their success.\" Obviously I'm not saying that discovering something like Instagram is just winning the lottery, but you get what I mean in terms of the rarity of those sorts of discoveries and those sorts of products.\n\n(00:40:12):\nI think that that team was very realistic about what I would say would be the champagne level outcomes and/or more like the kind of beer, nice dinner kind of level outcomes.\n\nLenny (00:40:28):\nYour wine.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:40:29):\nYeah, the wine. Yeah, thank you. That's a better analogy. I think we built knowing those sorts of outcomes would also be very beneficial to the organization. So as an example, one of them is, at Facebook scale, doing things that don't scale or doing things that start out small was just a muscle that was really hard to come by, right? It's like any community product that you build, any kind of social where there's community density that's important early on, any product that you build that way, starting with a million users is a really hard way to do that. At places like Facebook and Google, it's like it's hard to run an experiment with a hundred people. It's not hard, it's impossible, right? And so this idea that you would have to get real small, that you would have to start very targeted, that you would have to start with things that clearly don't scale and don't have a chance of being big from the get-go is really, really hard in an organization like that.\n\n(00:41:47):\nAnd so creating that space for NPE to be able to do that, to be able to help remind the organization what are the mechanisms we need to be able to build and learn that way was very beneficial. Even simple things. At an organization of Facebook size, maybe experiences at an Airbnb, it is really hard for product managers, engineers and designers to talk directly with customers. It is basically impossible. You're almost always talking through some third party, some recruiting agency and getting reports and you're not always in the room. Imagine building a startup, like a product from day one and not being able to sit right next to your customer and being like, \"Show me how you do this or show me how you do that.' It's incredibly hard. You're looking for such faint signal.\n\n(00:42:48):\nThe idea that you would try to get it through layers of indirection and games of telephone is crazy, but at that scale, that's what you have to do because there's all of these legal concerns and many other realistic concerns about what you can say to who and who you can talk to and what you can tell them about what you're doing and all of these things. So creating an environment where those sorts of constraints were lifted and were different was very beneficial, I think, to the organization and started to shed a light on some of the things that were broken that make it hard to build 0 to 1 in those sorts of environments.\n\n(00:43:31):\nI also think it was a really fantastic recruiting tool. It did build a really great group of folks, many of which have left to go start interesting companies. But I guess what I'm trying to say is I think when you're an organizational leader, and Schrep was the org leader that was supporting NP at the time and he's fantastic and really did a good job of firewalling that team, I think you're looking at a set of objectives and a number of ways that you might help the company and the organization. Even if you set that light on the hill to be like, \"Go find the next Instagram,\" many of the things that you would do along the way to find the next Instagram end up being very beneficial to the broader organization. We saw a lot of that in PE.\n\nLenny (00:44:28):\nThat's a really interesting perspective. There's a lot of other goals with something like this, it's not just find the next massive business. It's the way I think what I'm getting from this is shine almost a mirror on the organization, like, \"Here's the things we can't do with the regular business and we have to do something. We have to set this up in order to try something totally new and radical recruiting tool\" I think is interesting.\n\n(00:44:49):\nThere's actually a team at Airbnb, the way I described it was, I don't know how many people know about Burning Man and how it works, but there's this trash fence around the side that catches all the trash so it doesn't go into the desert. And I feel like there's teams sometimes that are the trash fence of the company.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:45:04):\nThat's funny, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:45:04):\nWhere someone's about to leave and they're like, \"No, go work on this coal stuff over here in the fringe,\" which is really interesting. But just instill within the company and maybe help with that. Just keep people that are awesome at Meta. [inaudible 00:45:16].\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:45:16):\nYeah. You're right that the team didn't discover the next Instagram. For what it's worth, things like Threads and ideas like Threads were in that team all of the time. I think that if that team caught the wave of generative AI and all of the opportunities and new technologies there, I think things could have also... Because those are certain moments where you having small, really motivated, dedicated teams that aren't thinking about anything mainline can lead to faster discoveries, I think that can also help. But there were a number of things that basically ended up becoming features in other products and they were just easier, faster ways of validating and building them because you didn't have the constraints of the mainline product development organization, right?\n\nLenny (00:46:07):\nFor someone that is thinking about trying to create a startup within a startup, something a lot of big companies are trying to do, is there a piece of advice or two that you'd share for helping this be effective? Maybe one is just the goal may not be build the next big business. There's these sub goals also. What comes to mind?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:46:26):\nGod, there's so many. Schrep did a really fantastic job of removing a lot of these constraints. So one is I would say think really hard about the incentive system. Smart, good people, even if they're not trying to, they end up kind of gaming things towards the incentive system. And so think long and hard about that. So for instance, if you're a large organization and you do some performance management process like twice a year and that's how you're going to evaluate and incentivize people in your 0 to 1 incubator, you've already killed it. It's the wrong incentive, it's the wrong timeframe. It creates adverse selection, problems for the sort of people that you bring in. And so it's hard in an existing organization to say, \"We're going to take all these company processes around even how we level people and pay them and motivate them. And we're going to throw them out the window for this group.\"\n\n(00:47:27):\nHow you build the infrastructure you use, this is something that the NP team did really well. Everyone got to do their own thing from an infrastructure perspective. Just do what is best for the problem you're trying to solve in this moment, knowing that you're likely going to throw away a lot of this code anyway. Being able to do that in an organization like Facebook or Google, if you ask anyone that works on those things, is really hard. It takes someone like a Schrep to be like, \"Nope, they're going to get to do this. Sorry.\" And so I think that's really helpful.\n\n(00:48:01):\nFor what it's worth, one of the organizations that we talked to that I felt like was doing this in one of the best ways was Nike. Nike has this incubation lab. It's a completely different operating model. They recruit a completely different type of person, very different incentive system. And essentially, where they end up plugging them into Nike is that when they have something into the distribution marketing kind of growth arms of Nike. But for the product discovery process, they're doing their whole different thing. Once they find some fit, then kind of Nike comes in and goes, \"Boom. I'm going to help you explode your fit.\" But I think that the number one thing I would think about would be the incentive system and the adverse selection that that can cause.\n\nLenny (00:48:52):\nTo me, the most important element of the incentive system, and maybe I'm reading between the lines, is you're basically competing against them starting their own thing. And having upside if things go super well feels really important versus, \"I'm just going to get a cool salary at Meta and work on this thing.\" That doesn't lead to the same experience as a startup where everything's on the line.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:49:10):\nYeah. And also what time horizons, right? When you're starting a company, you're not thinking like, \"In the next six months, I'm going to get a promo and I'm going to get a good rating and things are going to go well.\" You're thinking on a different, excuse me, time horizon, and you're thinking about an outsized impact or an outsized incentive. And so I would think about that if you're starting things internally as well.\n\nLenny (00:49:34):\nAwesome. Okay. Let's move to the final bucket, Grammarly, which is where you're at now. The way I'm thinking about it is this kind of like a one, two rocket ship or I don't know, 10. It's further along than one, but that's where you're at now. To me, Grammarly is interesting because it's one of the very few successful B2C subscription businesses. There's almost none. There's Duolingo, Grammarly. And I know you're doing B2B also, but there's so few. There's so many dead bodies trying to build a business on top of consumer subscription. And so I'm just curious. What the current state of Grammarly? How are things going? What do you think has been the key to it being successful all this time and continuing to grow? And what lessons have you learned? I know you just joined relatively recently, but anything you've taken away from that journey so far?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:50:26):\nWe don't talk about it often, but Grammarly is a much bigger company from a revenue perspective than I think people realize. The company has been around for 15 years and was profitable from day one, and continues to be quite profitable. So it's a very, very healthy business that is much larger than folks might realize. And that is actually quite intentional because the company was trying not to be noticed for a long time, very intentionally. The fact that you would have grammar and spell checking in Google Docs or grammar and spell checking in Word. People would often write off the company that like, \"How is that a business? How is that a feature? These products already have it.\" And that was very convenient for Grammarly because they could kind of navigate between these giants in tech and grow a very phenomenal business on this use case that people had written off.\n\n(00:51:30):\nNow, come the advent of LMS, it's no longer a use case that people are writing off and sort of the dream of the founders that machines can assist us in communication in this way that they've had for 15 years, I feel like now the whole industry is like, \"Well, this is obviously how we're going to communicate and machines are going to do all these things for us.\" And Grammarly is now sort of in the center of that hurricane. And again, I think it's a similar thing where it's like, \"Well, there's ChatGPT. There's Microsoft Copilot. How is Grammarly going to have a chats?\" But yet things still seem like there's the future. The future is bright.\n\n(00:52:14):\nAnd so to your question, I think what has made it work, I've only been here for 10 months so please kind of take this with a grain of salt, but my instinct is that people really love Grammarly because of how it works and where it works. And what I mean by how it works is Grammarly is one of the few products where you just install it and it makes you better. You don't have to configure it, you don't have to manipulate it, you don't have to change anything about what you're doing. You carry on and across all of your applications, across all of your tabs, you'll start getting pushed assistance to you in the right moment. You could ignore it if you want, no big deal, but it takes a very, very small amount of effort to tap on one of those things, get some value and keep going.\n\n(00:53:04):\nI think that a product that is that easy to use, that easy to extract value from, but then also that prevalent, how many different text boxes do you write in a given day? I mean, it is not less than 10, it is tens or potentially hundreds, right? And so it is everywhere and it is very, very low effort to get real value from it. And then the where we work is what I said, you don't have to change anything about your workflow. Grammarly meets you where you are and you get value from it. Doing that really well at this level of quality for a user base of this scale, essentially it's like a huge AI achievement masquerading as a little UX innovation, right? But that experience, that UX that sort of brings AI to the masses has obviously served Grammarly really well. I think those are some of the strengths that we're going to continue to lean on to now provide a very different type of assistance and value that we can because of where the technology has moved.\n\nLenny (00:54:21):\nThe other thing I've heard a lot about Grammarly, and Yuri was on the podcast and who led growth for a long time at Grammarly, is just how scrappy the business has been and the founders have been from the beginning, the fact that they've been profitable from the beginning. That feels like one of the threads through all of the successful consumer subscription companies, is super scrappy, not raising money for a long time. Is there anything there that you found to be really interesting or helpful for other folks that are maybe building the space?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:54:46):\nWhen you're a team that kind of starts out of Ukraine and you're not thinking that there's any chance that you're going to raise money and why would you do that, I mean it really... Back to our previous conversation of what happens when growth goes negative, it really forces you to focus on the important things. And so, like many of the early engineers who are still here because the company has done so well over the years, they think in like, \"How is this work going to translate into revenue?\" They think about the impact on the business from even very deep technical work that they're doing because I think they were brought up in this culture where the business doesn't really invest ahead of its profitability because it was a bootstrap business from day one. So that enforces everyone to think about their projects and their prioritization and how is what they're doing over the next two months going to actually turn into more revenue and keep the company growing and sustaining. So I think that culture is prevalent and help Grammarly get to where it is.\n\n(00:56:00):\nNow, I just want to be really honest that in moments that we're in like today, that can also be detrimental because the business gets to a certain size, you start getting to law of large numbers. You need to start thinking about are there other products? Are there other use cases? Are there other channels of growth? How do you invest ahead of some of that growth and start to diversify? Because at the scale and size that we are and aspire to be, we're going to have to do many more things and service many more different types of customers. And as you mentioned, we're going to have to pull off the motion of B2C to B, kind of get that product-led sales motion going. So all of those things are happening. And thankfully the business is as strong as it is where we can invest ahead now in those things while still maintaining profitability and a really strong business.\n\nLenny (00:56:57):\nThat's amazing that they're still team members and maybe I think you said engineers from the beginning, 12 years later. I think that says a lot about the business. And before we started recording, they're based in Ukraine and you were saying that they're going to Zooms, there's bombs going off, they have to go into bomb shelters and then jump on a meeting. It's incredible that team continues to operate and the business continues to do this well in spite of all that.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:57:22):\nYeah, the team in Ukraine at Grammarly is... I mean, it's something else. It's a really fantastic team. When you speak to many of them, I think actually the work provides sometimes a very useful distraction, but they obviously feel a lot of pride in the business. They built a lot of this business. There aren't yet many businesses of this size that kind of come from Ukraine. I think that that team is incredible and continues to deliver a ton of impact to the company even in the circumstances that they're in. I know for the founders, a lot of why they want Grammarly to succeed and be the generational company that it can be is for Ukraine, and especially in this moment and it's awesome to see how that motivates them and 15 years on the same project is not nothing. That's some serious resilience. And so I think even in moments like that, using them as a way to motivate and strive for something greater I think says a lot about the founders and the team in Ukraine.\n\nLenny (00:58:40):\nAbsolutely. Hopefully there's a happy resolution soon there. I don't know if you know this, I was actually born in Ukraine.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:58:47):\nOh wow.\n\nLenny (00:58:48):\nI know Odessa.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:58:49):\nOh, nice.\n\nLenny (00:58:49):\nI don't want to talk about that much, but it's true. And I just realized we both have skys in our last name. Lovinsky and Rachitsky.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:58:56):\nSo for what it's worth, my dad was born in Ukraine. He is from Kiev. My mom was from Lithuania, so yeah, I also have some Ukrainian background here.\n\nLenny (00:59:05):\nAll right, so Ukrainian episode.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:59:07):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:59:08):\nLet me zoom out a little bit and get to the final couple questions. So thinking about your career broadly, I'm just curious if there's any general advice you share with people to help them have a more successful career. Anything that just generally you find is really important to do well or mistakes they make. And this is a big broad question, but anything come to mind of like, \"Here's something you should really try to do more of or less of?\"\n\nNoam Lovinsky (00:59:37):\nLook, when you're thinking about career opportunities and what job to take, it's really, really hard to sniff out really well in a high degree of certainty like success. I think that having a good nose for people and the sort of people that you can be successful with is something that you can develop. What I found is I always try to prioritize putting myself in positions that are going to cause a lot of growth and learning. And growth and learning can be very painful. And you kind of got to be okay with that and go into that because on the other side of that pain I think is the promised land.\n\n(01:00:21):\nAnd that's just served me really well, is I can't necessarily predict with high degree of certainty that this thing's going to hit, but I can get a sense of the people around me and I certainly can find situations that are going to stretch me, that are going to force me to do things that I haven't done where I'm going to grow and learn significantly. And over sort of the arc of my career, I feel like that's served me well. So that's usually what I tell people, is focus on on that if you can.\n\nLenny (01:00:53):\nI love that advice. I've used this quote a number of times on this podcast, but something I always come back to is this line, \"The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek.\" I'm curious if there's something you have found about when the pain is too much, that you shouldn't pursue that. A lot of people get into these places where their mental health gets hit, their physical health is hit, they're just doing work they should not, it's too much. Is there anything there that you find it's just like, \"Okay, maybe this is too much of discomfort\"?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:01:24):\nI mean, I think about a couple of things. I think in any situation you should be able to lean on one or two things that you're really strong at. That can be the foundation that keeps you going while you learn the other things. So just be wary of situations that are too net new.\n\n(01:01:44):\nThere should be one or two important things as part of that job going into where you're like, \"I got this. I know how to do this portion of it.\" So as an example, if you've never inherited a very large team and you work through how that works, but the product area that you're working on is one you're very familiar with what's necessary to be good in that product, whether it's really good sense of design or really good sense of analytical thinking, recommendation systems, what have you, there should be a couple of those things where you're like, \"I got this. These things are going to be a stretch, but these things, I feel like I've got a handle on how to do this. I can always get better, but I feel like they're in my wheelhouse.\" And I think that tends to allow you to balance the pain with the areas that you already know and manage through in a more balanced and healthy way.\n\nLenny (01:02:48):\nIt reminds me of that chart I think from flow of you want it to be challenging but not too challenging, and that's where you end up being most successful. Is there anything else, Noam, you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:03:05):\nYeah, I just think that maybe going back to where we first started, Lenny, work on the things that make you happy, that fill you up. Life is short. We're all very lucky to be in this moment. There's no reason to spend time on things that don't give you energy. There's so much to do out there. I think that's the main thing I would focus on.\n\nLenny (01:03:29):\nAmazing. And even though there will be things that you have to do, I think it's important to try to find as much of that as you can because not everyone can just like, \"Nah, I'm not going to do this work thing. I'm just going to go on a walk.\" But I think that's such an important point. And we've talked about this actually a bunch on recent podcasts of just doing this energy audit where you pay attention to what gives you energy and what doesn't and try to do more and more [inaudible 01:03:54]-\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:03:53):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (01:03:55):\n... willing to do that again. With that, we reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:03:59):\nYeah, I'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:04:00):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:04:06):\nI'm going to cheat on this one and I'm only going to give you one. I'm only going to give you one because I don't want to cloud with any other. I recommend Build by Tony Fidel. Other than it being a good book, one of the main reasons I recommend it is that my wife wrote it. So she wrote it together with Tony. And I got to see that experience. She's a fantastic writer and Tony has a lot to learn from, so I recommend that book. I think that the part of it that was particularly inspiring to me to hear even more of the details that are in the book is just how many times he met failure before he made discoveries that are now driving so many of the things that we do. It's just a good reminder to keep at it and do the thing that really gives you that energy because eventually you can make that incredible discovery.\n\nLenny (01:05:00):\nNext question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:05:06):\nI really like For All Mankind, if you've seen that on Apple TV. And then I just finished the last season of Fargo. Every single season of that series I think is fantastic.\n\nLenny (01:05:19):\nAmazing. For All Mankind though, last season, not as amazing a consensus that I agree with, but worth watching.\n\n(01:05:26):\nNext question. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:05:32):\nI generally like interview questions that allow us to kind of do some work together, so I'm a little bit less on the behavioral \"tell me about a time when\" sort of stuff and more on the \"Let's work a product problem together.\" It could be anything from like, \"Let's design an alarm clock for children.\" Or lately I've been using one. \"Given where technology is at, if we were to rebuild email, how might we do that?\" I just feel like getting into it and getting into the details and really watching each other exercise our craft I think is really important. I have a whole podcast one time, if you're ready, about how most people don't know how to do leadership recruiting. And I feel like as I've advanced in my career, the interviews for some reason get easier and actually I can evaluate less about who I am as a product leader and whatnot. But yeah, those are the sorts of interview questions that I typically like.\n\nLenny (01:06:30):\nAmazing. Is there favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:06:36):\nIt's not recent, but I was a very early user of Arc and I really love Arc.\n\nLenny (01:06:43):\nYour window right now is inside Arc. I also love Arc. We had Josh on the podcast.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:06:48):\nNice.\n\nLenny (01:06:49):\nJust watching the onboarding experience of Arc alone as a product person is worth your time.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:06:53):\nTotally. I love the animation when you download something. I mean just like all of the little things. And if Josh is listening, we would like to get Grammarly to work better with Arc, so please hit me up because I think there's a few things that the Arc browser is doing that make it hard to get Grammarly to work either on the client or in the browser.\n\nLenny (01:07:10):\nTwo more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with friends or family either in work or in life that you find useful?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:07:18):\nGosh, for those that know me, this is going to share so much of my personality. I think the first thing that comes to mind is, we are meant to struggle. I just feel like through struggle is how we get better, how good things happen, how bonds form, and so I don't shy away from that kind of life experience.\n\nLenny (01:07:39):\nI'm going to guess that you're Jewish. I'm also Jewish. That feels like a very Jewish thing to say. I love it.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:07:43):\nHow would you guess, Lenny? It's literally written on my face. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:07:48):\nPerfect. Last question. As the chief product officer at Grammarly, I'm curious what word you most often misspell?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:07:57):\nThe.\n\nLenny (01:08:00):\nYou do T-E-H?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:08:01):\nT-E-H. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:08:04):\nOh, man. Well, I find I misspell every word.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:08:04):\nOh, that's funny.\n\nLenny (01:08:06):\nI'm a terrible speller. I'm thankful for my... Oh, sorry. Go ahead.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:08:09):\nI was about to say I have a product for you that can help with your spelling if you want.\n\nLenny (01:08:13):\nI am an active Grammarly user. Not only that. I use every product you've worked on, I realize.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:08:17):\nOh, nice.\n\nLenny (01:08:17):\nObviously, Meta and mostly Instagram of the Meta products. And obviously Grammarly now and YouTube. I have a YouTube channel. Check it out. Subscribe and follow. And Thumbtack. My wife is a big Thumbtack user. We found many pros on Thumbtack from all kinds of parts of the world.\n\n(01:08:35):\nNoam, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:08:42):\nYeah. I'm pretty much @noaml everywhere online, so Twitter is probably the easiest. My DMs are open. And then how people can be useful to me is please use Grammarly, provide any feedback that you might have. And honestly, if I can be helpful in almost any way, feel free to reach out. I often will take those conversations and build those connections, and that is always very helpful for me as well.\n\nLenny (01:09:05):\nNo, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:09:08):\nOf course. Have a good one, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:09:09):\nBye everyone.\n\nNoam Lovinsky (01:09:10):\nBye.\n\nLenny (01:09:12):\nThank you so much for listening.

Because in the end, if you're synthetically viral and people get to the product and it sucks, that's it. Slack wasn't even viral, there was no synthetic virality. Slack couldn't even connect to organizations for the longest time. You could be working on the third floor, and someone using Slack on the fourth floor and you would have no clue, there's no way to share it with them. But what happens when you went to lunch? People are like, \"We got Slack and this is amazing.\" And people on the third floor are like, \"Holy shit, when can we get it?\" Boom, boom, boom. This is the bedrock of virality. Build a great product that solves a sharp problem.\n\nLenny (00:00:37):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Oji Udezue. Oji has helped build and grow products at Microsoft. He worked on Windows, outlook, Hotmail and inner Explorer, at Atlassian where he was head of product for all their communication tools, at Calendly, where he was chief product officer, at Twitter where he was head of product for creation and conversation. He's currently chief product officer at Typeform, which I am a happy customer of. Oji has one of the broadest and most interesting careers in product, and he's also one of the most thoughtful humans I've met.

It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:14):\nIt's my pleasure. You've been a PM and a product leader in so many amazing and also just very different companies, all with very different approaches to product and growth. And I think you have this very rare broad perspective on what works in product and growth across a lot of different ways of doing it. And so I have a bunch of questions for you. I hope you came ready for that.\n\nOji Udezue (00:03:34):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny (00:03:35):\nOkay.\n\nOji Udezue (00:03:36):\nYes, sir.\n\nLenny (00:03:37):\nI love it. Okay, so I want to start with frameworks. You've written and shared a bunch of really interesting frameworks for how to think about product and growth, and so I just want to dig into a couple of them. And one of them is around how to find big B2B SaaS ideas and it's around finding the right workflow. Could you just share this framework and also just how founders and also investors can use this idea to find big ideas?\n\nOji Udezue (00:04:01):\nThank you. So I think you're referring to where do you fish to find a unicorn.\n\nLenny (00:04:05):\nThat's it.\n\nOji Udezue (00:04:06):\nAnd the thing behind that is people can find that on Substack and the Medium, my writings. But the premise is that there's a lot of risk in building startups, and the last decade of product management and startups has really focused on the method of building software and companies. We talk about the lean approach, we talk about fail fast, [inaudible 00:04:28] and so on and so forth. And I think that that was a necessary phase for us because a lot of innovation was just the ideas of founders unvalidated by customers, and we needed this inflection point in our discipline. People need to understand though that customer science is not the solution to everything otherwise OpenAI will never have done anything. It's also innovation. And so the problem space and the solutions to the problems space is still a big driver of success in building software companies.\n\n(00:05:03):\nWhat problem are you really solving? And if you believe that the problem space is key, so what problems will predict success? In B2B SaaS especially, which is much easier to circumscribe is where I start to think about, look, how do you tell from the beginning? Because an investor as well as an operator. Now to segment this space, I think of two dimensions. One is how many departments in the company does the workflow you're trying to solve apply to? Is it just a few or is it all of them? And the second is how intense or how frequent is the workflow executed? Is it daily? Is it weekly? Is it three times a week? And so on and so forth. Now if you draw a nice quadrant of these two things, then you can start to have some predictive power. Things that are useful in every department I call every one workflows, like things like collaboration, like Slack, email, calendaring, workflows, social knowledge and Notion and so on and so forth.\n\n(00:06:04):\nAnd then things that apply to single departments, I call niche and that's what I call niche. And then the intensity is about frequency. A month is not infrequent, daily is super frequent. If you divide the market or the enterprise into frequency and into how broad the workflow is, you can actually have predictive power. And what I found by looking at the biggest company is public and private in each quadrant was that every one frequent workflows intuitively are the most profitable to work on, but also the hardest to get into because they're dominated by Microsoft and Google and very, very large companies. For example, one of my friends is the CEO of Coda. And so this is interesting, because he's in that space, for him to think about.\n\n(00:06:58):\nAnd then the place where B2B SaaS really thrives is niche workflows that are highly frequent. High ni is what I call it, high frequency niche. And then there are the other two quadrants that are a bit more challenging. And then you have to figure out how to navigate your way into one of the other two. If you are in one of the top two quadrants, high ni and high everyone and you solve a really important problem, workflow problem, you can probably turn into a billion-dollar company. If you do the other two, there's some challenges that you have to go through. And the framework talks about how you should navigate those places into success. And I think it's very important because if this is true, and by the way, like I said, I did some validation on it, founders can start to, before they invest years, start to think about what probability of success is. And if you're an investor like me or VC, you can start to think about how you deploy your money.\n\nLenny (00:07:57):\nWhat are examples of companies in each of those quadrants? If you can frame this and I don't know if you have this in your head already.\n\nOji Udezue (00:08:03):\nHigh frequency everyone workflows tend to be things that are done by the doorman to the CEO. So it's email, it's collaboration, it is writing, it is math, all the basic things. At Atlassian, we spend a lot of time thinking about this. So Word, we've had word processing forever in the workspace. Things like Notion and Confluence are huge as sort of evolution of that, Slack, email. Companies in that space, Google, Microsoft, Atlassian, et cetera. And the high ni, which is high frequency niche, you have things like Jira, you have things like tools for recruiters, you have martech, you have sales tech.\n\n(00:08:49):\nAnd we know the companies behind them, Atlassian, Salesforce, so on and so forth. And then in the low frequency everyone, you have things like maybe form tools. And actually, they're not that many of them, low frequency everyone or even expense. Actually, the best expensing. Not everyone does it all the time, but everyone essentially has to do some of it, mostly, at least a lot of people. And then there's a low frequency niche, which is particular department. So planning, which is done by FPNA, but done infrequently, things like that.\n\nLenny (00:09:30):\nHow frequent is frequent in your experience? Does it have to be once a week at least? What do you think is that minimum bar?\n\nOji Udezue (00:09:39):\nFrequent is every day really or multiple times a week. Infrequent starts to be like two times a week, once a month. And of course there's a big interregnum in the middle of that.\n\nLenny (00:09:51):\nIt's interesting that there are examples of companies that succeeded in those lower quadrants of infrequent, say the expensing use case. Do you have a sense of what it takes to win there? Because I imagine most startups are in that area, and I imagine founders are like, what can we do to win still?\n\nOji Udezue (00:10:05):\nWell, this isn't a static framework in the sense that companies are not destined to be one of these things. The essence of strategy is to navigate from the curve of travel is essentially go from the lower to the higher. Atlassian is trying to go from high niche to high everyone with Confluence and with all the tools that they have. People below are trying to get into the high frequency niche by focusing on their core customer. So what it looks like in say low frequency everyone workflows, something like that is, well, if some people are using it infrequently, but they must use it, well that's a good thing. But then maybe you provide a module that is used by the finance department every day, and so suddenly you're moving into the high frequency everyone workflow. So it's about finding a part of the organization that considers this mission-critical and then solving their problems beyond the problems for everyone for example, in that quadrant.\n\nLenny (00:11:08):\nIs there an example that comes to mind of either at Calendly or Typeform or Atlassian where you pushed it further up the frequency direction or the everyone direction?\n\nOji Udezue (00:11:17):\nFor example, at Typeform, now this is real for me, Typeform technically is low frequency niche or low frequency everyone, depending on how easy it is to use and how it surrounds the customer. And one of the things that I'm trying to do as part of product strategy is to move it into high frequency niche, high ni, which is a very productive place to be. So for marketers, for salespeople, I want to make sure that they think of us first. And because we are particularly good at customer facing interactions, if they think that we are the way to win new business and to make money, then a portion of our audience, not every single one of them will consider us high ni. And I think expanding that foothold is the way to navigate a business like that. You can see that with Qualtrics, you can see that with SurveyMonkey. Lots of companies are thinking about how to further unbundle that market for a very, very specific kind of customer. And that is what they're trying to do. They're trying to hit the high ni, even for that more generic workflow.\n\nLenny (00:12:27):\nThat's an awesome example. You also have this framework that I think you call the zone of benefit, which is around how much better does your solution have to be than the status quo? A lot of people are like, \"Hey, look at this product, it's better than what you have now.\" And usually people are like, \"Ah, whatever. It's good enough.\" And you've had some insights on just how much better it needs to be for people to care. Can you share that?\n\nOji Udezue (00:12:45):\nHonestly, the reason I like being a product manager is on any given day, I'm drawing from anthropology, sociology, behavioral economics, leadership, communication skills. I'm trained, I have a master's in engineering, so I'm an engineer as well. I've done marketing and sales, so really pulling from so many things. And the reason I talk about the zone of benefit is ultimately what we're trying to do is impedance match technology to humans. That's it. If you really think about it, that's one essence of what we're trying to do. So the zone of benefit works as a framework because people will not pay for things that don't either really shrink the workflow that they're doing or doesn't give them superpower. So the same amount of time, but twice as much output. But the most important thing is that it has to be noticeable.\n\n(00:13:39):\nIf you do something 20% better, often people just around you, just as a human, people don't notice. And so for a product to make a difference, it has to be at least two, three more X for people to say, \"You know what? This is offering enough value for me to maybe make a switch in cost,\" and so on and so forth. And it really comes down to look, economic theory tells us that people work for leisure, they work enough to afford their leisure. It's sort of broad, and I know some people don't necessarily do that. Especially in the tech industry, people just love to work. But that is really it, when you think about eight billion people on the planet. And there's a lot of benefit really hones in on the fact that if you're going to help me work less, make about the same amount of money, then for me to notice you, you have to accelerate me by three times for me to care.\n\nLenny (00:14:36):\nOkay, awesome. So three times. So the idea there is you should feel like this is three times more productive in the thing that I'm trying to do or saves me three times, I don't know, I do it three times faster.\n\nOji Udezue (00:14:44):\nYeah, that's when people actually feel it and they feel it enough where they part with money.\n\nLenny (00:14:49):\nAwesome. And I think what's cool about this is it helps you identify the ICP for your product if you're working a startup or even a new product within an existing product to figure out who exactly is going to most benefit from this. Is that part of this?\n\nOji Udezue (00:15:02):\nYes, yes. Your best customers aren't price sensitive for what you're shooting for because they get it. They fundamentally understand it. So yes, when you're shooting for ICPs, now every startup has marketing problems getting an audience problem. But once you start getting a decent audience, over 100 people or more, you should start to notice the people who are like, \"You know what? This, I really care about this.\" And that starts to tell you a little bit about who's your target audience.\n\nLenny (00:15:33):\nWould you be up for sharing the ICP of some of the companies you worked at? Just to give people a sense of what would be a good ICP.\n\nOji Udezue (00:15:40):\nI think for Atlassian, it's really kind of obvious. It's developers mostly. But it's tech teams writ large because the fundamental of an R and D team is building stuff. And Jira helps the engineers who actually build stuff to track what they do and to give visibility to it so that they can be valuable to the organization. So that is incontroversial. So the ICP is really clear and have been clear for Atlassian for a very long time. Calendly is this weird company where people don't see all the value. People think it's just casual scheduling. But really the people who care about scheduling the most, and I don't mean calendaring. Calendaring is very different from scheduling.\n\n(00:16:25):\nThe people who care about scheduling the most are salespeople because it's the lifeblood of them earning money and marketers, because it's the lifeblood of them maybe learning about their customer. Recruiters, because it's the lifeblood of them attracting and scheduling the people that they need to do their job. So Calendly's ICPs were people who were scheduling with people who were not in the organization for some business reason. Typeform is marketers mostly because Typeform exists to make the web talkative, to make it more human. And with Typeform, you can brand that conversation and actually make it conversational because one question at a time, the beautiful design. And so marketers feel like we help their websites talk to each other. Product people think we help their web apps talk to people they care about, UX people feel the same way. So those are some, I think the interesting thing is Twitter.\n\nLenny (00:17:27):\nI was going to ask what the ICP for Twitter might be, still.\n\nOji Udezue (00:17:33):\nSo Twitter is actually more fun in terms of ICP because first of all, I'll talk about the things that's not obvious about Twitter. 30% of Twitter's customer base were unseen, they were media organizations, people like the NFL, the NBA, HBO, who wanted their content to reach more people, to be in conversational spaces. And they were essentially business customers and not seen in the conversation pool, it's not obvious. But we interacted with them all the time and we rev shared ads for their videos, because we're making content all the time. And so Twitter was a way to extend the monetization of that content, that inventory that already had. But when you go to the consumer side of Twitter, who was the ICP?\n\n(00:18:25):\nWell, actually Twitter understood, and this is sort of reflected in what Elon Musk is doing these days, that he doesn't seem to understand. And if you ask anyone who was at Twitter, you'll see the understanding in their eyes and the fact that he doesn't understand, because Twitter's ICP is bifurcated. On one side, it is the most accomplished people in the world, the people who have something to say. This is why there's neuro Twitter, there's weather Twitter, there is cancer Twitter, and so on and so forth. In fact, if something breaks, some new innovation happens in the world, it probably breaks on Twitter before it breaks anywhere else, because these are people in informal communities following each other and sharing their results.\n\n(00:19:10):\nSo basically there's this big circle of experts. We break down into celebrities, we break down into luminaries, leaders and so on and so forth. That's the ICP. Now how does Twitter work? These people attract the other 90% who listen to these people, but also they need to create their own informal communities around the things they're passionate about and have this mimetic relationship with the luminaries and the experts. And that is sort of the planet Twitter, experts on one side, humans who need to connect with the things they're passionate about, the people who are like them, that is the ICP of Twitter, the people who have something to say in those two categories.\n\nLenny (00:19:58):\nAre you happy you're not working on Twitter anymore?\n\nOji Udezue (00:20:00):\nI am ecstatic, I'm ecstatic. It seems like such a shitshow, no shade on anything or anyone purposely. But look, what's happening is evident. So I don't think I have much to say about that.\n\nLenny (00:20:18):\nYeah, what a wild ride over there. Zooming out on the frameworks question, when I asked you ahead of our chat about what frameworks you love and anything you think would be interesting to share, you had a really interesting response and so I'd love for you to just share your perspective on frameworks broadly.\n\nOji Udezue (00:20:34):\nYeah. Look, I'm two things simultaneously. One is actually, I like frameworks. The way that I try to express them is mental models because the essence of a framework and a mental model is that it is a shortcut. It packages some dense thinking into a way for you to approach a problem or to approach an opinion and so on and so forth. So I do collect them. But I think that what's important, I feel in product management, is to have the ability to understand the fundamentals or the empirical relationship that constructs a framework in the first place. In math, you would call it being able to derive the equation. And the reason that's important is because there's so much uncertainty in what we do. Product management isn't a science. In fact, programming isn't even a science really, because if it was, we'd treat it differently. So the art of building, say a software company that is profitable is not scientific.\n\n(00:21:36):\nThere's a lot of uncertainty, a lot of unknowns, there's timing issues. So I guess while I love mental models, while I love frameworks, what I want people who listen to me and maybe listen to you to understand is you have to go deeper. Because as situations change, as an investor and advisor to startups, I advise differently if you are just starting, if you're in the middle, and if you're scaling. In the book that I'm writing on product, I actually make that distinction a lot in the book, which stage are you? Because then the thing that applies to you is different. If you understand the fundamentals, you'll be able to use frameworks in a much more productive way because you'll adapt it to your stage, you'll adapt it to the problem. And I think that's really important. I see lots of people using frameworks very blindly, and I think that's harmful to them and harmful to their businesses.\n\nLenny (00:22:31):\nWhat a great segue to where I wanted to take us next, which is around the book that you're writing, which is my understanding is it's product management for product led growth. And I'm on your wait list to find out when it's out, and I saw that the other day you asked people for their advice on what to call the book. Do you have any favorites at this point of what you might title it?\n\nOji Udezue (00:22:50):\nWell first of all, there are two things happening with the book. One is I believe PLG is, I have maybe a different definition of PLG, but I think the way that we are basically adapting products to the consumer or to the business professional and using the product itself to sell the value proposition is really key to transitioning from what we used to do 20 years ago to today. Basically, I think even enterprise companies will tend towards a consumer type product management over the next decade than the other way around, that's my bet. And so let's call that PLG, just writ large. And also I think product management is set for growth. So obviously that's good for you, Lenny, because everyone needs to know how to do this.\n\n(00:23:39):\nIt's an integrative art within building software and software is seeding the world, the book, I want to get very practical. What matters about doing those two things well, and the best titles coming up are, my original title was Building Rocket Ships. So it's like how do you think through all the different things you need to build a really successful software company? Think about the practice, think about the business, meld those two things together. So a lot of people love that title. Well, there's a huge variation in submissions. So I think we're going to do that one more time and offer more options before we nail down the title of the book, so still TBD.\n\nLenny (00:24:22):\nCool, all right. I'm excited to see where you land. So let's just spend some time on PLG. I feel like this is your bread and butter as a product leader. You've worked at some of the most successful PLG companies and I think you have some of the most unique perspectives on what works and doesn't work. And I saw you shared a preview of what you're going to be sharing the book, and so there's a few things there that I thought were really interesting that I haven't seen other places when it comes to PLG. So I was just going to dig into it-\n\nOji Udezue (00:24:45):\nYay.\n\nLenny (00:24:49):\nAbsolutely. The first is this framing that you had for where to start and how to focus with your PLG problem. And you described it as starting with a sharp problem. Can you talk about what that means?\n\nOji Udezue (00:24:59):\nYeah, so I'm trying to connect dots. The sharp problem is a little bit of that whole quadrant framework, which is what problem are you going to work on? I think that problems have predictive power of success if you actually solve the problem. And this is different from, I have an idea, yeah. I think that a lot of innovation can come from inspiration, but the best inspiration comes from understanding customers and their problems. So my advice to founders is pick a problem that is materially felt by your customers, pain points that steal their time, their energy, their money, their focus, the inability to afford their leisure. If you can solve those kinds of problems, and look, I know that it's broad, because it requires insight. The best founders often are people who felt a problem, understand it, understand that it's really difficult, and understand that there may be like five, 10, 20 billion people who feel it and they don't want to solve that problem versus I feel a problem, but only 100,000 people care. In which case, maybe it's not that intense anyway, unless you can charge them thousands and thousands of dollars.\n\n(00:26:22):\nSo pick those kinds of problems. If you have the narrative in your head that if you really solve this, people will pony up. That's what I ask people to find. Too many of us just have a sharp idea. Look, I've built a startup on a non-sharp problem, and I knew how it felt. Well, I also know working in companies that are solving sharp problems how it feels, it's a huge tailwind to do that. In fact, when you work on sharp problems, it's hard to fail because you can make mistakes and the customer's obsession will carry you, but if you work on something that doesn't have a sharp problem, mistakes can kill you because essentially you're having to pay a lot for marketing, you're having to pay a lot for word of mouth. People, when they get poor, they don't care about it, like recessions.\n\nLenny (00:27:15):\nComing back to something you mentioned earlier about just how much pain it needs to be for people to care or how much pain it needs to solve versus the status quo, I think is a really important element of this. I think most founders like, no, I need to solve a problem. But usually it's not painful enough or it's not solving it enough, given either an example of something that you've tried or you've seen of just like that was a sharpish problem but not sharp enough and people didn't care, either a company worked or a startup you advised of just like, okay, it wasn't sharp enough.\n\nOji Udezue (00:27:46):\nI don't want to create enemies because I know a lot of founders. But here's one, here's one. I don't know if you remember during the pandemic, this venture studio by I think one of the ex founders of Evernote created mmhmm camera, remember that?\n\nLenny (00:28:04):\nOh yeah, absolutely. Yeah, great video.\n\nOji Udezue (00:28:07):\nIt was fun, but I don't think it was a sharp problem. It was fun, but yeah, it didn't change the world of your Zoom camera. It didn't change the world of your collaboration. And so I think that's one example of a non-sharp problem, for example, for most people.\n\nLenny (00:28:31):\nWhat are signs that it's sharp enough, just like in your experience? I know you talked about it steals your time, energy, money focused. What are flags that this is sharp enough in your experience?\n\nOji Udezue (00:28:43):\nI think there are two ways to think about it. If you are in the trenches as a founder, the easiest way to map out a sharp problem is draw the current approximate average workflow for your target customer, at least what you think is a target, and then draw the workflow after they've used your software and see how much shorter it is, yes or no. And then try to measure those lines. If you draw them as horizontal lines, try to measure those lines and see if it's much shorter. If it's 2X shorter, 3X shorter, so let's say pre-customer, that is the best way to hone in on it. Post customer, you should talk to the people who are most enthusiastic and derive their workflow and their workflow change and try to measure that. I think that's how you figure out if it's a sharp problem or not.\n\n(00:29:37):\nThe other thing that we talk about in startup super early stage world is, I call it the whites of their eyes. When you take a problem and you share it with someone who it's going to affect their workflow, and I use the word workflow a ton because I don't use specs anymore or use cases, I think workflows are the unit of productivity. When you see people's eyes get big and they expose more whites to you, you're probably onto something. It's not enough, that's not a workflow thing, that's an excitement thing. But people often react that way when you're solving a really sharp problem for them. And then people spontaneously bring up money, it's like when can I pay? When can I... Those kinds of things give you an indication.\n\nLenny (00:30:23):\nTwo other versions of the showing more whites of your eyes, which I love. Two other versions of that I've heard is one is you see their pupils dilate and they're just like, \"Whoa, I need this now.\" And then the other is someone described it as, you see this nod of as you're talking, they're just like, \"Oh, I get it. I get this.\" And then they're like, \"Okay, we need this in our company.\"\n\nOji Udezue (00:30:46):\nI'm a little over those ones because sometimes it's just excitement and just noise. And so the things I said previously about workflow compression or capability inflation, I think those are more reliable, which is all about customer research and customer conversations. That's what I would focus on. Yeah, I'm saying all this from mistakes I've made, basically. So I feel like this is scar tissue, which is what I'm trying to pour into the book.\n\nLenny (00:31:18):\nSpeaking of talking to customers, another one of your big bullet points in the book is around continuous customer discovery, and I'm curious what you found to be successful in actually doing that. A lot of people talk about it when you keep talking to customers, get feedback constantly. What actually works in your experience?\n\nOji Udezue (00:31:34):\nYeah, I feel like all of park management is about discovery these days. Everyone talks about it, and I want to make a distinction. I think discovery is when you use customer conversations to understand a very specific thing that you want to optimize further workflow that you want to optimize further. And then you call the people who are most likely to be affected and you do use various research strategies to talk to them. There's a version of that also that is what I call continuous conversations, which is a Calendly and a Typeform, which we'll do more and more of. You should organize it so that your PMs, your designers, your engineering managers and your PMMs are constantly talking to customers by default. Meaning that customer conversations show up on their calendar every week automagically, without them getting involved. And then they're trained on how to have the conversation, because the death of customer discovery is friction. If you ask individuals to do customer discovery, they will not do customer discovery.\n\n(00:32:49):\nThis is the thing that dies in an innovative company because it's very difficult to actually talk to the right customer, not talk to any customer, talk list of the right customer continuously. But there's a third thing that I like to talk about, which is customer listening. In fact, I'm going to talk about this at industry in October, the PM Conference. Customer listening is different. It's not really discovery. It is the scarfing up of customer signals that are happening constantly anyway. So people are talking on social, people are talking on app stores and G2 crowd. If you have a instrumented churn survey, people are talking. If you have NPS, people are not only giving you the scores where they're putting in the verbatims. If you have a bug report, which we had at Atlassian, people are filing bugs, developers love to file bugs, so of course we have that for that audience. And then if you go to Zendesk and customer support, people are either talking about one thing all the time or a range of things, and you can see the frequency distribution.\n\n(00:34:01):\nAnd of course in Salesforce, you have closed one. These are all things happening no matter what you do. Whether you're listening or not, you're getting these signals. One of the big, hairy, audacious goals of product management is being able to process these signals efficiently. We did it in a certain way at Calendly, which I drew a rig together through workflows and Slack, and then having individuals triage those things. And if you can do that hard and at industry, I'll talk a little bit about how to do it. It's not exactly discovery. It is what matters. Our job is to meld customer delight with business ambition. And it feels essential beyond discovery that you are listening and you're understanding what matters from a customer delight perspective. And I don't think many of us do this really well. I've tried to do it everywhere I've gone, Twitter, Atlassian, Calendly, now at Typeform. But it still feels like something that the industry can get better at.\n\nLenny (00:35:08):\nThis touches on advice that Teresa Torres teaches around continuous customer discovery. And she actually had a really good tactic, that I'll share here that stuck with me, about how to actually do this. So the way she recommends companies do this is have a little popup on your site asking visitors like we'd love to talk to you and get your feedback on our product. And it just links them to a Calendly to book a meeting, and that's how it shows up on the calendar.\n\nOji Udezue (00:35:30):\nYeah, that's what we did at Calendly. But I will say, so a couple of caveats, we did that in the community. We had community at calendly.com and we understood that that was a self-selected group. But it was still important to talk to them because they were still representative. And of course you should do it in a product. The challenge of that approach is always is it the right customer? And the pro/con of that is talking to one customer is useless, talking to 100 is super useful. And so the challenge is are you targeting the right person?\n\n(00:36:09):\nSo some intelligence upfront and who to show it to and why you're showing it to them, so that they can come is interesting. Very particularly effective by the way for growth, because if people don't activate or churn, they don't want to talk to you. But if you can present that thing in their activation or conversion journey, they might actually talk to you. And so that's really key. So I 100% agree with Teresa, that's exactly what you should do for not even, I wouldn't even call it discoveries for listening, and some of it can be discovery. Yeah, I think that's exactly what you should do.\n\nLenny (00:36:45):\nAs you're talking I'm realizing I'm using most of the products you help build. I'm on Twitter a lot. I use Calendly a lot. I use Typeform as my default survey tool.\n\nOji Udezue (00:36:55):\nI saw that, my team is really excited that you're using Typeform.\n\nLenny (00:36:59):\nYou've impacted my life in so many ways, Oji.\n\nOji Udezue (00:37:02):\nI think you owe me money, Lenny-\n\nLenny (00:37:04):\nWhat do you need? How much? Give me your Venmo QR code, it's on [inaudible 00:37:09].\n\n(00:37:11):\nYou fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined.

And something that I talk a lot about on this podcast is just the power of onboarding and how impactful it's to retention and so much of the eventual success of your product and how customers use it. And so I'd love to hear just your advice on what you think is really important, I guess why onboarding is so important in success and PLG. And also just what tactics have you found to be really effective?\n\nOji Udezue (00:38:59):\nLet me talk about a few fundamentals. Onboarding is a substitute for sales and all these account management teams for millions of customers. The task is how do you make it approximate a human and how friendly a human is and how approachable a human is? Because if you can do that, then you can process thousands and thousands of customers very quickly. Onboarding is an exercise in understanding the mindset of a buyer, of an evaluator. It's nothing more than that. Meaning that the province of understanding is social psychology, it's not really product, it's biopsychology. And guess who knows a lot about this stuff, it's people in the offline industry. The people who stock shelves, the people who provide inventory online and so on and so forth. They are extraordinarily good at this. So the reason I say this is to divert people who are [inaudible 00:40:00] to really find where to source their inspiration from for onboarding, first of all.\n\n(00:40:06):\nIf you think about this as intentful in that way, which is people come not knowing anything about you and in a progressively developed confidence that you are the tool of choice, you then have to break it down into how does that journey go through a mind, the average mind anyway, and how do you assist each part? One is value proposition, understanding, one is trying to see if it's simple enough and provides enough value. One is kicking tires and one is making the choice that this is something I'm going to go forward with. How does your onboarding support hit all of these things? Now I think there are two parts of onboarding. One is mandatory, the setup, it has to be spare. I try not to make it more than three screens, but it's about how do you say what this does and provide the essential setup that your customer needs to be successful?\n\n(00:41:05):\nAt Calendly, for example, we asked them about connecting their calendar and setting some defaults. Is it 9:00 to 5:00 or whatever that is? Those two things set up all the future success. And if we made it optional, more people would fail. So it's information and the essential setup, and it should be as short as possible. Then there's a whole other set of things that should be optional because they're not necessary for everyone to be successful, but they're beneficial if people are curious. And also, it can be what we call a random access, so people can get back to it any time they want, if they're feeling help. And so if you divide onboarding into those two things and then figure out what to put in one and what to put in the other, I think you can be quite successful. And this is just the tip of the iceberg that I get into in the book.\n\nLenny (00:41:56):\nAre there any examples of really big onboarding wins, things that really helped with conversion or activation that come to mind?\n\nOji Udezue (00:42:01):\nWell, I think keep it short is one big win. The fewer things, the better, that are essential, that everyone has to go through. It's unclear if all those clickthroughs go here, go here, and all those things work-\n\nLenny (00:42:16):\nThe wizards, yeah.\n\nOji Udezue (00:42:18):\nYeah. The wizards have had, in my experience, limited benefit. So much as just directing people to the one thing that they need to do post mandatory onboarding. Having examples, not 10, one or two of what good looks like is particularly powerful because it's mimetic. People see, oh, okay, this is exactly what I'm shooting for, is very powerful. In terms of trial and conversion, letting people understand and being very clear about where they are in the trial cycle, whether you want them to pay for it now or they need to pay for it later, after seven days. Having them understand that really clearly so they know where they are versus they feel like they're completely at sea, I think is very important for conversion.\n\n(00:43:07):\nI think there are a few things like that, but I also want to mention that it's different for every product. Depending on where you are in the quadrant and the amount of augmentation and problem solving and how sharp the problem is, you might want to adjust your approach. And this is the kind of thing that there's some fundamentals, but it's not necessarily this one size fits all. In fact, at Typeform, we're trying to maybe invent a new twist on freemium just because of some of the things we're seeing for our particular customers. And so yeah, these are for me, some new learning as well as I go through each different product.\n\nLenny (00:43:49):\nAlong these lines of onboarding activation and getting a user activated is really important. And I'm curious, do you have an example of what an activation milestone was at Calendly or Twitter or a Typeform? Just to give people a sense of like here's a good example of an activated user milestone.\n\nOji Udezue (00:44:03):\nI think this goes back to people, the Pendos and the Amplitudes of this world. You have to think through your aha journey. Like at Calendly and also at Typeform we have three thresholds of increasing activation. And we just try to make sure that people go through each one as many people as possible. And frankly, we try to figure the drop-off between the increasing definitions of activation. So at Calendly we want to make sure you've created your first meeting. But then if you've created five within a week, that's really much more powerful. At Typeform, it's really about have you published the form and have you gotten responses? And have you gone to look at what the responses mean in the insights page, for example.\n\n(00:44:52):\nAt Twitter it is are you following anyone or are you being followed? Because that verb, follow, is the way you start to construct your informal community. Remember what I said is Twitter is for people who want informal community around a topic that is not... Facebook is about who do you know, Twitter is about who do you want to know? Who's passionate about what you're passionate about? And so if you haven't set up your follow graph at all, you're not going to really activate. It's not going to be compelling for you.\n\nLenny (00:45:23):\nAwesome, those are great examples. It's funny hearing that Twitter activation milestone out of context sounds, so creepy. Have you followed anyone or is anyone following you?\n\nOji Udezue (00:45:31):\nYeah, because a lot of people go in and then they tweet into the void or they don't feel like they have a voice. But that's not the most important thing. Most important thing is are you getting content that you are interested in that makes you want to come back and see more of it and follow is a huge part of doing that.\n\nLenny (00:45:47):\nYeah. Just on the point of Twitter, I don't know if this goes anywhere, but it's crazy how it keeps going no matter how much destruction is happening all around, employees-\n\nOji Udezue (00:45:58):\nOh, you want me to talk about that? Because I want to talk about this.\n\nLenny (00:45:58):\nPlease, let's do it.\n\nOji Udezue (00:46:04):\nSo one of the things they, I don't want to say they, one of the things I learned early on is network effects.\n\nLenny (00:46:11):\nYeah.\n\nOji Udezue (00:46:12):\nNetwork effects, let me define it. Network effects is when you create value for passive members by other people joining the network. So I am by myself, I have done nothing. I'm at home, chilling, but one person joins the network and immediately I gain benefit, okay. So think about Facebook. If there are eight billion people on Facebook, it means that all of a sudden I can reach everyone on the planet. And so the more people on Facebook, the more it's valuable to me regardless of my effort. That's network effect. If I'm into Word, word processor, Microsoft Word, and the more people who use that file format, it means that the more Word documents I can read.\n\n(00:47:05):\nAnd so I did nothing, so by increasing the people adoption of Word, I gain benefit. Network effect, that's what it is. So Twitter and then this is the mental model of critical mass, network effect is about critical mass. You hit a critical mass and sometimes that's not mathematically defined, and then you've hit network effect because people want to come because people are already there. So Twitter has hit critical mass and lots of your favorite social networks. Network effects is a feature by itself, and it's the most powerful feature. A good way to illustrate the power of network effects is Twitter did not die because Threads came about, that's the power of network effect. In fact, the last telegram was sent in 2016, over 100 years after it was invented because of network effects. It had to be manually closed down.\n\n(00:48:03):\nI believe Friendster is still alive, so we have to be really clear that it's really hard to kill a network effects business. Now how do you actually accomplish it if you were to accomplish it? Well, the revenue side of any social network is vulnerable to attack. So for example, if advertisers stop being on Twitter, for example, they're not gone because again, network effects affects them. They want to go where the eyeballs are. But if for some reason they disappeared, while the people will continue to come, the ability to have money to improve the network will disappear. And that is a negative spiral. What is very, very hard to kill business, it's hard to kill software that's reached network effect, although you can kill businesses that have reached network effect.\n\nLenny (00:48:56):\nThat's a really important and interesting insight. I think what's even especially interesting about Twitter is Elon and the team have removed every other benefit of Twitter, like the brand, gone, employees, 80% gone. Every part of it is being cut off, except for the network effects, and so it's a really cool case study. Dan Hockenmaier tweeted this, was a previous guest, of just like it's a good case study of what is just the power of just network effects.\n\nOji Udezue (00:49:19):\nThat's right. I did a really interesting course at Berkeley Business School, asked about technology companies and so on, and this is a perfect case study on network effect. The best I've ever seen. It is incredible.\n\nLenny (00:49:36):\nYeah, it's wild Threads isn't able to get there quickly, unlike what it felt like initially.\n\nOji Udezue (00:49:43):\nThreads will prosper, I believe. And again, it'll just be another click for advertisers who understand the Facebook marketplace versus Twitter ad marketplace is much harder to access. And so I think the way Threads wins is the revenue spiral versus the pure activity spiral.\n\nLenny (00:50:02):\nInteresting. Where essentially they find ways to, even with lower base, generate revenue, which drives advertisers, drives more investment.\n\nOji Udezue (00:50:10):\nCorrect, correct, correct.\n\nLenny (00:50:11):\nAwesome. All right. That'll be fun story to watch. Kind of along those same lines, I want to chat about virality a little bit. You worked on some of those viral products out there in B2C, I guess Twitter is an example, but also in B2B, which is really rare and interesting. And I know there's no silver bullet for increasing virality, but everyone's always wondering, how do I increase the virality of my product? So I'm curious, anything you could share, any tactics that you've seen work to increase the virality, especially of a B2B product?\n\nOji Udezue (00:50:36):\nWell, as is my style, I want people to understand what virality is in the first place because I think people have misconceptions about it. People think virality is some Hotmails tag at the bottom that says, we'll get a free account. Virality is really when the word of mouth of a product is high quality. That's really the essence of it. Let me rephrase that. It's when customers market your product. And that is incredibly powerful, but also that's incredibly actionable, if that makes sense. There are products who try to be viral just for what I call synthetic virality that fail. Because in the end, if you're synthetically viral and people get to the product and it sucks, that's it. That's the end. Even Hotmail, for example, people talk about the viral tag. I don't know, you know what I'm talking about? Because I-\n\nLenny (00:51:32):\nAbsolutely, at the bottom, yes [inaudible 00:51:34].\n\nOji Udezue (00:51:35):\nWell remember, it wasn't just that. It was one of the first webmail things. And webmail was revolutionary because you didn't have to have a POP3 client and lose your email across multiple devices. It solved a lot of really good problems for customers at the time for email. And so when they arrived from the free account, it was like, holy crap, this is amazing. And so let's do that. Uber doesn't have any weird viral traps, but it compresses the workflow of getting a cab so much that it's viral, if that makes sense. In fact, it was this time where Austin kicked them out for and other apps came in and filled the void, and then it came back after the year and just crushed everybody. There was no campaign, it was just viral by itself. So that's what virality is. So then the question is how do you increase it?\n\n(00:52:30):\nWell look, fundamentally build a great product that solves a sharp problem and build it really well. If you do this, this is the bedrock of virality. If you don't do this, there's no viral tactic that will work in a sustained way. It will fizzle. But if you do this, you can lay on synthetic virality strategies for referral, strategies for coming back into the app and creating an account. Remember before Calendly, there was Acuity scheduling, there was other things. The difference was Calendly was so well-made, so simple for schedulers, so respectful of schedulers' time, not just the creator's time that the virality worked. It did not work for others who sucked. Xted AI and other places, they weren't that good. You have to be good to be viral.\n\nLenny (00:53:33):\nThat is such an important insight, that everyone looks at Calendly like of course you're sharing calendars with everyone, it's going to go viral. That's like what a cool trick. But your point is so interesting that there's previous versions of that, but the product itself wasn't great. The experience wasn't great. It was too complicated, it didn't work, and that's what made it so viral.\n\nOji Udezue (00:53:52):\nYeah, there may be several things I think affect virality. But I think that this is the nugget that people need to take away, that is the foundation of bedrock of all of them. Customer support actually affects virality. If you have fanatical customer support, people will love it. Viral tactics like the page that says, oh, get an account, and so on. All these signing documents, Calendly and so on and so forth. Network effects as in Calendly, you have these green dots. If you and a person have, Calendly tells you when you're free, all network effects, really high quality execution, synthetic virality all contribute to net virality. But the fundamental is exactly what we just discussed.\n\nLenny (00:54:38):\nJust got to get it all right. No big deal.\n\nOji Udezue (00:54:42):\nBuild the best product possible, honestly, if you want to be viral. Slack wasn't even viral, there was no synthetic virality. Slack couldn't even connect to organizations for the longest time. Why? You could be working on the third floor and so on, using Slack on the fourth floor, and you would have no clue. There's no way to share it with them. But what happens when you went to lunch? People are like, \"We got Slack and this is amazing.\" And people on the third floor are like, \"Holy shit, when can we get it?\" Boom, boom, boom. Great product first is virality.\n\nLenny (00:55:14):\nSeth Godin has this phrase they always come back to, if you want to make your product remarkable, something people want to remark about, and that's basically the core of word of mouth.\n\nOji Udezue (00:55:23):\nYes, yes, yes.\n\nLenny (00:55:24):\nI was watching a talk you did on this kind of topic and you had this great phrase that you sort of touched on, but I think it's so good, and I just want to make sure we highlight it, which is that virality is customer augmented marketing.\n\nOji Udezue (00:55:36):\nYeah, I think it is the thing that I started with first. It's when your marketing is essentially done by your customers because what it does, it affords you the ability to spend less on marketing. And you can either uplevel your marketing execution or save money that you can put in the product. Atlassian spends maybe like 10, 20 percentage points less on marketing than the equivalent competitors because it's viral and also because it's network effects at this point as well, say Jira. And so it's customer augmented marketing. Your customers are either forcing other people to adopt it or shaming them into adopting it or FOMOing them into adopting it. So yes, virality is essentially customer oriented marketing, which gives you options.\n\nLenny (00:56:28):\nI love that phrase, I'm going to use it now. I have just a few more questions before we get to a very exciting lightning round, and these are kind of random two topics that I wanted to chat on. One is this concept that you call forest time. It's a post you wrote about the importance of forest time. Can you just describe what that is and why it's so important, and then also just how to do this?\n\nOji Udezue (00:56:49):\nI operate, I'm an operator right now, meaning that I'm building things, I work for a company. But I also advise and invest, which is different. When I'm advising, I'm looking from above, from outside, I have a bird's eye view and I'm able to say, \"You know what? This will work. This won't work. What have you done? Can I look at the results?\" And then cycle the advice based on what you're seeing and what I'm seeing. When I'm operating, I'm building a team, I'm hiring, I'm managing all the things, Alina, shout out that hates sometimes. And that's what I'm doing. When you are operating, you have the tug of war. It is so intense that you don't have the attention to have a bird's eye view constantly.\n\n(00:57:39):\nAnd so forest time is the idea that you make time within your week, within your month to see the forest for the trees. Most of the time when you're operating, you're seeing the tree, which is the problem in front of you. But sometimes you need to see the forest, so you can figure out it as an alternate path, different from the one that you are currently on your campaign. And so it's time to elevate, to get some bird's eye view, to see the entire landscape and see the alternative paths through the current problems that you're escaping. And I think that it has to be very intentional. And intentionality there is, I have published a workflow, a document that helps you make that step to make that elevation.\n\n(00:58:25):\nLike what are the issues? What are alternative ways to solve this potentially that I'm not seeing? Et cetera. And what I try to do is I try to create that forest time for my executive team as well because it's not just me that suffers from this, it's most everybody. In fact, it's most PMs because PMs are so influential that the spoke of the wheel of product creation and product development that we often, it's a sine wave. You are discovering and shaping problems and then you are commanding and captaining execution. And it's endless and they're endless meetings. And so you need to create time for forest time, for elevation. If you don't, you'll become less effective over time. It's just attrition.\n\nLenny (00:59:14):\nAnd then just to make it even more concrete for people, what are examples of forest time? Is it taking time off? Is it advising on the side? Is it-\n\nOji Udezue (00:59:20):\nIt is taking a day off at the end of a month, a full day or two days. And instead of just playing golf, although that's fine, it is doing a workflow, worksheet to survey the forest specifically. And sometimes managers are like, \"Wait, you're giving people a day off when they should be working harder and harder?\" And I think it's completely worth it. It's not about working harder, it's working smarter. It's about seeing more options than you see. And so I'm very happy to give that time to product managers, to product executives or design executives or engineering executives.\n\n(01:00:01):\nBecause I think that if they do it properly, then we'll have better execution in the long run. Let's put it this way, in product development, we aim for maybe like 10% of the time and then we execute and build for the other side. It's not just, there's more stuff we do. If your aim is off, then you are spending one, $2 million incorrectly of people's time. And so forest time should improve your aim. That's the entire point, because your aim is a precursor to a huge amount of investment. And so I think it's well worth it.\n\nLenny (01:00:36):\nI love this. So specifically what you do with your team is once a month, you give them a day to do this kind of worksheet that you put together?\n\nOji Udezue (01:00:45):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:00:45):\nAnd then that worksheet is in this post that you wrote, that you point to. Is that right?\n\nOji Udezue (01:00:49):\nCorrect, correct.\n\nLenny (01:00:50):\nAmazing. Okay, great. This is very practical advice. I love it. Okay, one last question before a very exciting lightning round. You worked at Bridgewater Associates, which I didn't know until I started digging into your past. That sounds creepy. And Bridgewater Associates famous for what? Ray Dalio's hedge fund, author of Principals and all these other incredible books, and it's a very unique working environment. So I just wanted to ask about your experience there, specifically one of the craziest things there is just this thing called dots I think it's called, where people just call out mistakes that people make at the company and it's public. Is that how it actually was? Any memories of that?\n\nOji Udezue (01:01:27):\nYeah, yeah. I was a senior management, what's called an SMA, which is the management layer right under Ray's team. And we were the priests of the Church of Bridgewater. Bridgewater did things like record, this is public knowledge, I'm not saying anything-\n\nLenny (01:01:50):\nYeah, he writes about-\n\nOji Udezue (01:01:51):\n... before every meeting. Eventually we created a dot collector, which allows you to rate people in real time. So I'm just having a conversation with you and before the meeting closes, in front of each other, I pull up my laptop and I rate you and rate the interaction. And in theory, the idea is that if you constantly rate people across hundreds of interactions, then you build a picture of them that is fairly accurate, statistically accurate, that will transcend maybe emotional relationship as wisdom of the crowd idea. So that's a theory. In practice, it is emotionally exhausting. And like you said, the little creepy, even the recording.\n\n(01:02:38):\nSo I think there were things about Bridgewater that I understood intellectually in terms of the purpose that Ray had designed, but didn't quite work. It's like the way I think about this is the theory of the principles are really good. The practice and the execution can be quite off and not very human or not very empathetic. But I will say this, Bridgewater taught me things that I don't think any other organization in the world thought taught me. One example is Bridgewater thinks of people in three dimensions, their skills, their attributes, and their values. Most organizations think about people in terms of just their skills. But it makes sense that people have attributes and values, that people are timid, people are bold, people like to jump in, people like to stand back.\n\n(01:03:38):\nAll these other things, we think about personality and proclivity. Bridgewater tries to establish and measure them and also tries to write job descriptions that say, this is the kind of attributes we're looking for, not just the skills we're looking for. And then of course values. Are you a thief or are you a principled? And so on and so forth. Now that idea of looking at talent or people in general, both in your professional life and in your personal life, is a huge addition to me as a professional from Bridgewater. So I'm saying that there were things I didn't enjoy about Bridgewater, but things that I learned that I've learned nowhere else as well.\n\nLenny (01:04:18):\nDid you take that to what you do today? Thinking of people in those three different ways and-\n\nOji Udezue (01:04:23):\n100%. in my professional life, in my personal life, when I interview people, I am cognizant of those three things and I try to extract those three things, because I think it improves your success. Famously, all the weird skill-based interviewing at Google was only 50/50 predictive. And the reason is Google did not consider the other two things, I believe. Bridgewater was willing to endure 80% attrition to arrive at the best people. Now I don't think it works for them because some of their system was not empathetic of humans, like expecting humans to be computers. But I thought that was a very important insight.\n\nLenny (01:05:08):\nAwesome. Oji, is there anything else that you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nOji Udezue (01:05:14):\nIn the history of product development, we have basically started to create abstraction to guide our work versus the Wild, Wild West. So the engineers came up with agile and peer programming and all these things. The designers have come up with design thinking, design sprints, and combined with research to talk about how to do discovery of various complexity. And the question is the product abstractions, because there's code, there's product in this business. So the product and business layer, what is our abstraction? What is our crucible for organizing our work?\n\n(01:05:52):\nWe don't even have one. We don't have a name for it. And so the idea of a part system is that there's an abstraction above agile and design thinking that we have to pay attention to build solid organizations and to execute well at the product and the business layer. This is a co-creative framework with me and Ezinne. And the idea here is how do you construct a good product system? And literally, you could boil it down into a checklist of the systems you need to build a really good cohesive R and D organization. So I think that's the tee up. I'm going to have to leave you thirsty because someone else is probably going to go deep into it.\n\nLenny (01:06:35):\nAmazing. And that's your wife that you mentioned who you are co-creating this framework with and who we're going to have on the podcast in the future.\n\nOji Udezue (01:06:40):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (01:06:41):\nWhat is it like being married to another product leader? Would you recommend?\n\nOji Udezue (01:06:45):\n100%, you can have really productive conversations and you can redesign other company's applications in one conversation in the evening.\n\nLenny (01:06:57):\nAmazing. Well, that was almost the lightning round question, but I moved it up earlier. And so with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nOji Udezue (01:07:06):\nYeah, I'm ready. Let's do it.\n\nLenny (01:07:07):\nOkay, great. Let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nOji Udezue (01:07:13):\nThere's one business book that I recommend, I think it's called The Halo Effect. It's basically a book that lets you call on all these business books that tell you all kinds of stupid shit. It is how to deconstruct what is important in a business and self-help book and what is not important and what is just circumstantial storytelling with random facts and form-fitting evidence. It's called The Halo Effect. Read it. Why do you need to read it? Because garbage in, garbage Out.\n\n(01:07:45):\nPeople were amazed at the Outlier Effect, Malcolm Gladwell, and then people have been tearing it down for 15 years now. But everyone ingested it and thought it was the most important thing. But how do you know what's important to take away from them and what's not? The Halo Effect will help you. And then the other thing is, I read for pleasure because I read a lot for work. And so science fiction is the thing. There's lots to recommend, but I would say that people should either read Dune, Frank Herbert or Foundation by Asimov. If you haven't read those two things and you're a science fiction person, you really should. The world building is incredible. I understand Tolkien and fantasy, but the science fiction side of it is those two books.\n\nLenny (01:08:32):\nThere's also a TV series of Foundation now, which I can say recommend absolutely. But it's a beautiful show.\n\nOji Udezue (01:08:39):\nYeah, no. I haven't watched Foundation yet. I just felt super weird watching it after reading it. And I could only make it through three quarters of Dune. Well one, but I will make it through them. I don't expect them... The books are glorious. If you love prose, the books are, man, crazy. But I will get through them eventually.\n\nLenny (01:09:04):\nI've not actually read Dune, but the movie was incredible. I played the video game Dune where you're just mining spice all day and it's just stuck in my brain forever. Okay, next question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?\n\nOji Udezue (01:09:18):\nI try to ask two. I feel like it's going to give people a cheat sheet when I interview them. But I try to ask two questions. So I'm not a person who does favorites, so it's hard for me to pick favorites. But I ask people to introduce themselves and I think it tells me a lot about them, how they tell about themselves, what they say about themselves and the content of it. I ask people about the things they think they're truly great at and then I ask people the things they think they need to learn. The latter too is about their professional skill, their craft. I think it tells me a lot about how they communicate, it tells me a lot about how thoughtful they are. It tells me a lot about what they're proud of and what they lead into. And those kinds of things are very important to me.\n\nLenny (01:10:10):\nWhat is a favorite product you recently discovered that you love?\n\nOji Udezue (01:10:13):\nI have been optimizing my workspace a lot. So I'm on a kick right now where I use Windows. I was in the Windows PM and I still have my Windows box. But a lot of people, we use Mac at work and I've used Mac for the last few years. So even though I switched between them, I've spent a lot more time on Mac and my Windows experience is completely optimized. It is perfect. But Mac, I'm like the Windowing sucks, there's all these gaps I see. So I've been trying to figure out how to dial in my Mac experience.\n\n(01:10:49):\nI hate the activity monitor, sucks. What's a replacement? The sound. It doesn't support sound through HDMI or sound through... I don't know, just some weird setup. So I've been optimizing that. One particular product that I like in the context of that is Unlocks. It's one man product that allows me to just look at my phone and log into my Mac when I walk up and then locks it when I walk away. And it'll actually detect my proximity. So it'll start the login process while I get close. I think that's incredible and I feel like it improves my productivity.\n\nLenny (01:11:26):\nVery cool. Sounds like a lot of haterade for Macs over here.\n\nOji Udezue (01:11:30):\nWell, for someone who uses it a lot, no, I think pros and cons. I'm no longer paid by Microsoft, so there are things I don't like. But there are also things that the Mac isn't perfect either.\n\nLenny (01:11:42):\nYeah, indeed. What is a favorite life motto that you repeat to yourself or share with other people, either in work or in life that you find valuable?\n\nOji Udezue (01:11:52):\nI've taken to saying that there's more knowledge outside my head than inside it. And this is a plea for curiosity. I have three main things that are my North Star personally. Obviously when I say personally, I mean everything professionally. Which is originality, curiosity, and wisdom. And so this thing about there's more knowledge outside my head than inside my head is a plea for curiosity, it's a plea for skepticism. It's a plea to be humble about what you know, no matter how old you are, about the world around you, and always be listening for more. Even when you know something, let other people speak because they might add 10% more to the 90% you know. And so being an active listener is very important.\n\nLenny (01:12:48):\nBeautiful. Last question, you are from Nigeria. What is a Nigerian food that you think people need to find and get ASAP?\n\nOji Udezue (01:12:57):\nI'll recommend two, depending on how familiar you are. So if you've never had fried plantain with beef stew-\n\nLenny (01:13:06):\nOh man, that sounds great.\n\nOji Udezue (01:13:08):\n... then you should stop what you're doing, stop work, whatever you're doing, find your next Nigerian friend and go get some, okay? This is the food that most Nigerians will basically trade years of life to have access to, okay. So that's what I would say. And then the second thing is if you want to be in the in club in Nija, as we call it, you got to try pepper soup.\n\nLenny (01:13:48):\nPepper soup.\n\nOji Udezue (01:13:48):\nNow, if you all are not into spicy stuff, I'm sorry, the door is close to you. But pepper soup is really... And it is amazing. It'll make you sweat, but it's delicious and you should give it a shot.\n\nLenny (01:14:05):\nOji, I think we've solved many people's sharp problems. I really appreciate you making time being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nOji Udezue (01:14:16):\nI publish on Substack when I have time, you should check it out. It's usually all about things that are beneath the surface. What's behind the thing. I believe that's how you'll find it. I'm on Twitter as well, so you can follow me because I will talk about products. How you can be useful to me is go follow me on Twitter, sign up for updates on the book. If you do, I will draw from that audience to help name the book, to help design the cover for the book. The book is intended to have a freemium because I want this book to be available to people in Africa and India, across the world. So there'll be a free version of it and there'll be premium versions with more tools, more help, and maybe even interviews with luminaries that you care and love as well. And so hopefully that will fund the free side of it as well. So come in, become part of the party, maybe join a pre-read, an early draft read. That is the best way you can help. So this is a call to all PMs and people of goodwill.\n\nLenny (01:15:29):\nAmazing. What a great answer to that question. I'm going to go get some pepper soup and some plantain beef meals. Thank you so much for being here, and I'm going to go get some food.\n\nOji Udezue (01:15:41):\nAll right. Thank you, Lenny. It was super enjoyable and love hanging out and God speed.\n\nLenny (01:15:48):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:15:51):\nThank you so much for listening.

What have you learned about how to garner trust and win over skeptics?\n\nPaige Costello (00:00:07):\nThe thing I would say is bring the insight. Know thy customer. Know thy market. Know thy competitors. Know thy numbers. Know thy product.\n\nLenny (00:00:15):\nI'm curious, what you find most holds back new PMs?\n\nPaige Costello (00:00:19):\nYour brain is so accustomed to having a scarcity mindset as opposed to creating alternative options or seeing a different path. Effectively, there's this notion of, \"How might the opposite be true?\" The moment I challenged myself and said, \"How might the opposite be true?\" my shoulders dropped. I felt more relaxed. I was like, \"Oh, yeah, I can do both. It will be fine.\"\n\nLenny (00:00:45):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Paige Costello. Paige is a product lead at Asana overseeing teams responsible for the core product experience of Asana. Before Asana, she was Director of Product at Intercom, and prior to that, she was a group product manager at Intuit where she spent five and a half years. In our wide-ranging conversation, we dig into strategies for building trust with people who are more experienced than you or older than you, we talk about coaching product managers, including why leading by example is often the most effective strategy, we talk about Asana's product development process and how it's evolved over the years as the company has scaled, plus some of Paige's product and career missteps, and what she's learned from those moments. To prep for this interview, I got input from some of Paige's colleagues and former colleagues, and everyone I talked to loved Paige. You'll soon see why. Enjoy this episode with Paige Costello after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:47):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you're using the same data sets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage. Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high-quality data from real humans, and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave browser.\n\n(00:02:29):\nIf you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google. It's only going to become harder to afford these challenges. The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring, and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's Podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:04):\nThis episode is brought to you by Attio, a new type of CRM that's powerful, flexible, and built around your data.

Great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:08):\nSo you don't know this, and I've been telling you this, but I asked a bunch of people that you worked with and maybe currently work with for questions, suggestions of things to ask you. So this is going to be really fun.\n\nPaige Costello (00:04:19):\nWonderful. Now, I want to know who you talked to, but we'll find out.\n\nLenny (00:04:23):\nI'll tell you right now. Big thank you to Jackie Bavaro, Yasmin who's on your team, and Montgomery and Steve Morin who is currently at Asana.\n\nPaige Costello (00:04:32):\nOoh, fun.\n\nLenny (00:04:33):\nSo thank you to all of those folks for giving me a bunch of great questions, suggestions.\n\nPaige Costello (00:04:37):\nLooking forward to it.\n\nLenny (00:04:38):\nMaybe just to settle a context, can you just talk about... At Asana, what do you work with? What is your team? What do you work on, and what is your team responsible for broadly?\n\nPaige Costello (00:04:45):\nYeah. Absolutely. So I lead the product organization that's responsible for our desktop, web, and mobile apps at Asana. The teams are composed of all the people in San Francisco and New York who are focused on creating clarity for individuals, teams, and organizations. Effectively, our goal is to help teams work together more efficiently and drive the outcomes they're going for. So you can think about the feature sets if you're an Asana user like goals, portfolios, projects, tasks, reporting, all of that. But really, we want to help people answer the question at work, \"Who is doing what by when, and why?\" So that notion of clarity of purpose, clarity of plan, progress, and responsibility are often so painful in people's work lives. When there is certainty there and clarity there, people can be much more efficient in getting the work done. So that's where my focus is every day. I'm a product leader for that group.\n\nLenny (00:05:44):\nCool. So, basically, like the core. When people think of Asana, it's all of that stuff is what it sounds like.\n\nPaige Costello (00:05:49):\nYeah, yeah. There's another group that's focused on our process management, but a lot of the core work in project management, core is in my group, and then we have a growth and enterprise scale team.\n\nLenny (00:06:01):\nYou've been at Asana for about four years now, right?\n\nPaige Costello (00:06:03):\nYes, four years this summer.\n\nLenny (00:06:04):\nCool. So something I'm always curious about companies that are at this scale is just the evolution they've gone through in terms of how they develop product, and so I'm curious, just in the time you've been there, how has the product development process at Asana changed, and maybe even simpler, what are some of the bigger changes that have been made to the way product is built at Asana over the years?\n\nPaige Costello (00:06:26):\nI would talk a little bit about how we set strategy and our planning process, and how that's changed in this time as well as how we actually ship product has changed in this time. On the planning front, we have really changed what altitudes we're planning at, the time horizon we're planning at. Some of the inputs have gotten a lot more precise and opinionated. So, for example, we have always had pillar plans and team plans, but maybe we didn't have an intermediary layer of an area perspective. Well, what's an area perspective? Well, as your organization grows, we've had to reorganize to create more agency and accountability close to teams that are focused on specific target customers and problems. So if you think about the way Asana is organized, we've got our R&D, the pillar structure, the areas within them, and then the working teams.\n\nLenny (00:07:23):\nIt might actually help if you even describe what is a pillar, what is an area in product development.\n\nPaige Costello (00:07:27):\nYeah. Absolutely. So when I said I'm responsible for that core product pillar, that's one pillar, but then there's also the adoption and enterprise scale pillar and the workflow pillar. Within each of those, there are subgroups, and we call those areas. Each of those areas has a very specific target customer and problem space they're solving for. We've often also dialed up the clarity of the metric at that level. So while we have an R&D set of metrics, we have pillar metrics, we have area metrics, and then at the team level, there's often one or two that they're really driving forward. So you can think of it as a nested structure around our product strategy as well as how we measure success.\n\n(00:08:14):\nWhen I joined, we didn't have areas. We were organized around projects and around locations, and then we worked to make sure that the thinking was more durable and problem-focused so that our roadmaps were not about features, but were instead about what was most meaningful to tackle for our business growth. So that's a big thing that has changed is the altitude of planning and how that nests. Another thing that has changed is the time horizon. So, before, we planned annually primarily. Now, we plan every six months, but for a rolling 12 months. So we have higher confidence in the immediate half, lower confidence in the following half, but we just plan every 12 months, every six months because it gives our business more confidence in what's coming and a better opportunity to align our go-to-market and product planning.\n\nLenny (00:09:10):\nAmazing. So I just actually was talking to one of the heads of product at Shopify, and they went through a similar transition where they used to plan yearly, and now they plan for the next six months. So it's interesting that I'm hearing this more and more, and you're saying that every six months, you revisit the plan for the next year. So it's an interesting hybrid of those two.\n\nPaige Costello (00:09:30):\nYeah. Absolutely. I think the more you try to do things in a joined up way where you have a single target customer with sales and marketing, and you want to make sure that the impact of your releases hit their mark, the more it's important to reflect on it frequently and to be able to pivot quickly because our strategy, even when we think we have a two-year vision, something will change, and then we say, \"Wow, we made so much faster progress on this than we thought, and we actually believe that there's a new opportunity or a new technology that we should be leveraging. Let's go bigger on that.\" So it reduces the feeling of churn and thrash. It makes us all more principled, and it helps us just make sure we're making the best use of our teams.\n\nLenny (00:10:20):\nI like that it also admits you're not going to actually have a yearly plan, like everyone plans for year, and then halfway through, they're like, \"No. Let's start rethinking everything again.\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:10:30):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:10:30):\nSo I like that you're upfront about that.\n\nPaige Costello (00:10:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:10:31):\nOkay, and then within the plan, do you have quarterly plans and sprints? Is there anything more fine-grained with a detailed roadmap just while we're on the topic?\n\nPaige Costello (00:10:38):\nYeah, not really. I mean, teams know approximately when are they expecting to do the work, but if you ask too much for a particular quarter, a particular week, or date, you will make strange choices about scope. So, really, we align on what success looks like, and the teams do their best job to ship as quickly as possibly, as iteratively as possibly, and we really encourage prototyping. So we added into our product process a notion that we might pivot or cut from stuff that we put on our roadmap because it felt like once it was on the roadmap, it had to be done, and that's just not smart.\n\nLenny (00:11:20):\nGot it. So, essentially, there's a six-month roughly detailed plan of what each team is going to work on?\n\nPaige Costello (00:11:25):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:11:25):\nGot it. Interesting.\n\nPaige Costello (00:11:26):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:11:26):\nMaybe just a couple more things just to make them super concrete for folks that might be listening. What's an example of an area? What's an actual team that would be an area? Then, the other question I have just while I'm saying questions is, are there some metrics you could share of just what some of these teams might be gold on just as examples of how you think about metrics?\n\nPaige Costello (00:11:45):\nThe area that came to mind when you asked about one of our areas is something called Coordinate, and their job is effectively making sure that the slice of Asana that helps teams work together is working effectively. So that's projects, and tasks, and the data that you might put into tasks, and all of the back and forth that is required when people use Asana for their core working team. Some of the metrics that they care about are like org paying weekly active users as well as really thinking about healthy project use. So we make sure that we understand what does good look like and what is a dynamic that we want to be creating in terms of people getting real value from using the product, and we build that into our metrics to have as a guardrail to ensure that we're not driving one metric at the expense of people really getting what they need out of Asana.\n\nLenny (00:12:41):\nJust a couple more questions along these lines.\n\nPaige Costello (00:12:44):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:12:44):\nI'm nerd-sniped about process.\n\nPaige Costello (00:12:46):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:12:46):\nI think you use a process called the Double Diamond Process at Asana. Okay. Cool.\n\nPaige Costello (00:12:49):\nWe do.\n\nLenny (00:12:50):\nI've seen images of this in various places, but I don't know of any company that's actually using it as the process. Can you just describe what the Double Diamond Process is and how you use it?\n\nPaige Costello (00:13:00):\nSo you might be familiar with lean startup concepts and Double Diamond as it relates to going broad, and then going narrow. So you go broad when you ask like, \"What customer should I solve for?\" and then you pick one, and then that's the narrowing. Then, you go broad, and you say, \"What are the problems this customer has?\" and you narrow, and you say, \"This is the problem they have.\" Then, you go broad, and you say, \"What solution should we do to this?\" and then you go narrow, and you say, \"This is the solution that we should start with.\" That process of going broad, and going narrow, and going broad, and going narrow forces people to get out of their opinion-driven lens because so often, we need to be curious quantitatively and qualitatively about what we're doing and why, and be more systematic and rigorous about getting there. It doesn't take long, but it just breaks the frame.\n\n(00:13:56):\nThe Double Diamond Process that Asana effectively... Each of our typical reviews or artifacts sit at different inflection points on the Double Diamond. So we actually ask people to do a kickoff where they collect different information at different scale depending on the size of the problem and the ambiguity they're solving. Some people have already done enough customer selection and research that they're starting with, \"What are the possible solutions to this problem?\" and then they're bringing the spec, and that's the narrowing alongside design, et cetera. But it's really mapping our artifacts against this notion to make sure that the product thinking has that quality of decision-making. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:14:44):\nThe way you described it is it was very customer-target-oriented. Is that that the actual framework? Is it around who to build this for, and then what to build, or is it more... It is. Okay. You're not ahead?\n\nPaige Costello (00:14:44):\nIt is. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:14:44):\nOkay.\n\nPaige Costello (00:14:56):\nIt's really important because then you also know what success looks like because if you pick your success metrics as using a feature, that's it. You're teaching to the test. It's not actually driving the outcome. So while our planning process is around effectively defining category and how we win, and making sure that customers receive certain benefits from using work management, the through line to the individual project that a team might be leading is they need to know who they're solving for and what it means to have that problem solved. So it always starts with enough customer insight such that we can creatively do what they're trying to do. I mean, really inventing on behalf of customers.\n\nLenny (00:15:44):\nCan you maybe repeat if there's terms for each of those phases?\n\nPaige Costello (00:15:49):\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\nLenny (00:15:49):\nThen, is there an example of a feature or product that went through this that you could share? If nothing comes to mind, that's okay.\n\nPaige Costello (00:15:55):\nThe inflection points are the kickoff, which is that going broad, and then customer and direction selection. So this is both the target as well as of the 10,000-foot views of how you might pursue solving this problem. Which path are you broadly going to take? Then, going broad within that path on different concepts, and then there's a design concept review. Then, the products spec. Then, the full experience review or design crit of the end-to-end experience and launch. So that launch review is often just, \"Hey, here's the thing. Here's what we said. Here are the fast-follows.\" Most of the time, by that time, it's already been dogfooding internally for some time, and it's more of a formal, \"Do we have the right metrics in place? Are we ready to ship?\"\n\nLenny (00:16:52):\nAwesome. Do these reviews happen in person, on Zoom, or asynchronous?\n\nPaige Costello (00:16:56):\nIt depends. So it depends on the complexity of the work, and it depends how much we want to talk about it. A lot of our crits happen in person on the design side. A lot of spec reviews are more asynchronous, and then we'll say, \"Depending on the number of questions people have, we call a meeting.\" Otherwise, we do mostly async, but it's a mix. It really depends on the complexity and ambiguity of the solution and how much people have questions about asynchronously beforehand.\n\nLenny (00:17:27):\nI'm going to take a tangent with my questions here and talk about work from home policy at Asana. This is something that I've been wondering more and more about how it's changing because it feels like there's been a shift back to the office. So what is the current policy at Asana, and what's changed maybe over the past couple years?\n\nPaige Costello (00:17:42):\nWell, we were fully remote during the pandemic, and then we came back to the office in an office-centric hybrid format. So we're in the office Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and then work from home mostly on Wednesdays and Fridays. That dynamic has been designed from the start. We wanted to make sure that we took advantage of what's great about working together as teams, and so it's been the standard. So I would say what's unique about maybe Asana is we knew we would do that from the very beginning instead of hemming and hawing about would we be a remote workplace or not, and what would that mean, and how would we come together, and how would we budget for it. We're like, \"No, this is going to be an office-centric hybrid,\" because we wanted to create spaces for people to work together and move quickly.\n\n(00:18:37):\nIt's been interesting watching people get back into the swing of things. Even though we knew, it didn't mean that on day one, people were great at being in the office. People were taking standups sitting down. Whereas before, you would walk through our office, and you could hear people at standup because there were standup chants, and people would be out on the floor. Now, people are more likely to do their standup in a room, and we're trying the next level of standing up during a standup, but it's... I'm sure it's a shared experience for other people who are working in offices to get used to using the whiteboards again, to get used to standing up during your meetings. It's bizarre that we could lose a muscle that we had that was so innate so quickly, and I think even in the last month, I would say, and it's in June of 2023, there's more vibrancy in the office, more conversation, more casual... someone eating alone at the cafeteria, and someone sitting down next to them. So it didn't happen overnight.\n\nLenny (00:19:45):\nI've been seeing a lot of tweets of founders just being like, \"Work from home has failed. It's time to go back at the office.\" I'm curious if that ends up rolling into more and more companies, or if it's just a few founders here and there.\n\nPaige Costello (00:19:56):\nI think it's a real thing for mental health. I do think that having social casual relationships as well as more opportunities to talk strategy with people you're not forced into a meeting room with has been super beneficial. I can say that just today, I was having lunch and sat down with my head of data science, and we had an impromptu chat about how we review our experiments and how to evaluate whether we had ROI on learning, not just the metrics. It was one of those things where if we had to schedule it, it might not have happened, and if it did happen, it would have been a couple weeks from now.\n\nLenny (00:20:36):\nIt feels like just coming into the office once or twice... or sorry, being at home once or twice a week is not that different from how things used to be where there was a day of no meetings and a lot of people stayed from home. So it feels like it's almost reverting back to that.\n\nPaige Costello (00:20:47):\nExactly, and people are better at it than they used to be.\n\nLenny (00:20:47):\nRight.\n\nPaige Costello (00:20:50):\nSo I would say our remote days are more impactful than the days we're together where we're getting into the swing of things.\n\nLenny (00:20:56):\nYeah. I feel like as a PM, the only day I was productive and getting real deep work done was the No-Meeting Wednesday. It was at Airbnb.\n\nPaige Costello (00:21:04):\nYes. I would encourage you to know your chronotype and to lock that time where you have the most head space to do that work. So, for me, it's mornings.\n\nLenny (00:21:12):\nSay more on chronotype. What is that?\n\nPaige Costello (00:21:15):\nI'm a morning person, and so I try to make sure that I don't have any meetings before 10:00, sometimes before 11:00, and that's when I do my hardest task for the day.\n\nLenny (00:21:26):\nI also just thought about standups while I was at Airbnb and how not only how much energy they brought, but almost too much energy sometimes where there's like another team doing a standup, and they're just laughing and clapping, and we're just like, \"Shh, we're trying to work over here.\" I feel like we need more of that again.\n\nPaige Costello (00:21:42):\nTotally. Yep, yep.\n\nLenny (00:21:45):\nOkay. So, moving in a slightly different direction, something I heard about you is that you're often the youngest person in the room, and you often lead people with decades more experience than you. I want to ask, what have you learned about how to garner trust and win over skeptics, especially when they're maybe more experienced or older, and especially in other functions, I don't know, execs or designers, engineers, what have you figured out there?\n\nPaige Costello (00:22:13):\nThe thing I would say is bring the insight. Know thy customer. Know thy market. Know thy competitors. Know thy numbers. Know thy product. If you can be the person in the room who has watched customers use the product and has a point of view about why one tool is significantly better or worse in a given dimension, and you can do that with confidence and clarity, and you don't need to know the other person's functional domain, and you don't need the expertise in what they're experts at, you can bring insight that makes people curious, and trust you, and just immediately believe that there's an opportunity that you're not advocating for that just is true. But I think that's a really tricky and unique thing is not to pretend like you have more experience than you do, but to be willing to ask great questions, and then be curious enough that you're bringing insight to every meeting that people may or may not have, but you're always willing to share.\n\nLenny (00:23:21):\nThat's such a good answer because it's like there's not a trick to it. It's just do the work, spend the time to become the person that has answers that people value and obviously, that will respect you, value your opinion, want to hear from you.\n\nPaige Costello (00:23:34):\nYeah. Yeah. Our former board member, Anne Raimondi, and now our head of business wrote an article on First Round that was really great about the trust equation, and it really resonated with me. I don't know if you've heard about it, but she said that trust is equal to credibility plus reliability, plus authenticity, divided by or over perception of self-interest. I think when you're met by someone who doesn't know you, doesn't know your work, your job is to create credibility, and that's where I said bringing the insight is where you can really tip the scales here. Reliability, this is all about your say-do ratio. Authenticity is just being vulnerable, being yourself, and then making sure that people know that you're not in it for some other outcome or cause that perception of self-interest really can change whether people... how much they trust you.\n\nLenny (00:24:46):\nIn terms of knowing the insight and knowing thy customer, putting the time, I imagine, is a big element of that. Is that how you do that, or is there anything else along those lines that's just like, \"Here's how I get really good at this?\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:24:59):\nWhen you take a new role, become best friends with a researcher, and spend time watching customers use the product firsthand because what they maybe report on or are trying to do a study about might be very different from what you observe, but you really just need that front row seat with customers, and so asking, \"How do I actually set up time with customers? How do I compensate them? How do I read the tickets?\" Whatever. It's amazing how little you have to do to quickly catch up to understanding who the organization is solving for well and poorly, and how people really use your product versus how your teams use your product, especially in organizations where there are heavy dogfooding cultures. It's really risky to become less sensitive to the needs and behaviors of customers because people think they are their customer, and it also becomes very navel-gazey. So I think the more you get out and break up how people are having conversations about what we should do and why, and what we shouldn't do and why, and it's not about your opinion, it's about asking questions, and then bringing insight can really change the nature of the conversation and build trust.\n\nLenny (00:26:18):\nI love that. In terms of confidence, you talked about the importance of communicating these things confidently. Is there anything you've learned about how to be more confident? The managing part of it is like having the answer, but is there anything there that you maybe coach your PMs around or other folks of just like, \"Here's how you communicate confidence?\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:26:36):\nIt's a great question. I think being brave and courageous in little moments is just what you have to do. You have to show up, and say it before you're ready to say it, and ask for forgiveness, and be vulnerable. I think when you're vulnerable, people actually trust you more than if you come with all of this armor and say, \"I know this, and this is how we're going to do it.\" So real confidence is often conveyed by being willing to ask the question or to say, \"I don't know what you mean by that. Can you say that again?\" It's also just how you communicate, looking people in the eye, your body position, your body language.\n\n(00:27:22):\nSo much of this, I think people forget about because it's really easy to be in a meeting, and looking at your computer, and going through Slack messages. So one of the best things you can do is if you're in a meeting, be in that meeting. Continually scan the faces of everyone in the room, see if someone has a question, pause at the beginning, and welcome people, and chit-chat while people land, and then close asking questions like, \"Did I get all of that? Is there anything you would've expected to cover that we missed?\" It's really about being open, and that conveys confidence more than being assertive and advocating 100% of the time.\n\nLenny (00:28:03):\nThis episode is brought to you by Round.

One thing specifically that came up is that you're very big on leading and teaching by example, not just, \"Here's how you do this thing.\" So, if that's true, I'm curious where that came from for you and why you think that ends up being a lot more successful than like, \"In a meeting, you should do X, Y, Z,\" versus doing it, and then letting them see.\n\nPaige Costello (00:29:34):\nI think the main thing is repetition. We're all students of repetition. If you see something done a few times, you're more likely to remember it and internalize it, and so it's also something that... a way that I learn, and so I think that's probably part of it. I remember hearing about a framework called the three Es: experience, exposure, and education. I think it was helpful for me to hear that as a way of growing your career or being more purposeful about your growth because I think when people are earlier in their careers, they tend to think, \"Education, education, education,\" and then they started to think, \"Experience, experience. How do I get the experience of being a manager? I need to read about it, and then be a manager.\" It's very linear.\n\n(00:30:29):\nExposure was such an important one where I thought like, \"Okay. So you're not in the driver's seat, but you're in the car, and you hear what's happening, and you're evaluating how this is... what the impact is.\" This goes back to being really present and analytical, and being a learner because if you can be a learner, not just in an education or experience context, but in an exposure context, you can really grow so much more quickly and in so many more directions than you will get from just what does your day entail from what work is directly required of you.\n\nLenny (00:31:12):\nIs there an example of that happening either to you or you saw a manager leader do this, and you're like, \"Oh, I get it now,\" or you doing that and it helped?\n\nPaige Costello (00:31:18):\nSo I'll give two examples. I mean, the way I run my meetings are the kind of meetings I want to be a part of. So I try to make sure that I start with a clear agenda, and I move quickly, but give time for conversation and that it's not fully just sharing information, but debating where appropriate. I think knowing how to manage the conversation and courteously pausing people who are going on too long or taking the group in a different direction than was intended, and just think about the experience of everyone there, and create the experience that you hope that they're creating in the rooms that you're not a part of.\n\n(00:32:08):\nAn example that I have in terms of experience is sometimes the experience is you doing the thing and getting that experience firsthand. Other times, you need an education, you need a mentor, you need a coach who will tell you what they're saying or give you advice. I was in a really high-stakes product review at Intuit, and at the end of it, everyone else had left, and the leader of the business unit as she was leaving the room said, \"Always answer the question that they should have asked.\" \"Always answer the question they should have asked.\"\n\n(00:32:49):\nI was pretty surprised by that advice because it was very profound in the moment because I think when you're a student and you are accustomed... If you're an achiever, you like to get As. You're probably going to hear a question and answer it. You're like, \"One-to-one, one-to-one, one-to-one.\" But what I learned from that was that there's actually another altitude, another point of strategy when you're in a meeting or in a conversation to make sure that you're covering the more important point, the bigger picture, the alternative that the person asking the question maybe didn't see or consider. So I think the mix of experience, exposure, and education really helps you make sure that you're consciously moving forward on each of those fronts or finding people who can help you there.\n\nLenny (00:33:43):\nI love that piece of advice, and it makes me want to ask, are there other pieces of advice that have been really impactful to you, or are there common pieces of advice you give to your team that just is a recurring theme of advice that maybe people even make fun of like, \"Oh, Paige is always saying this?\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:33:59):\nThere are a few ways to think about advice, and my advice often meets some mark when it's for a particular person in a particular time in their career. So I would say advice I love giving to people who are early in their career is don't self-select because I think it's really easy to say, \"I don't have the experience,\" or, \"I'm not X, Y, Z enough,\" and not apply. So I really push people not to self-select, and I try to remind myself where that's appropriate to do the same thing. Other advice I often give is just think big, ship small. \"Think big, ship small.\" What's the smallest thing you can do to do that thing? But let's not, because we're trying to ship all the time and in small chunks, start thinking in small ways because it's really easy to get a little too incremental, a little too wrapped around the axle around optimizing a metric and miss the bigger picture, and so think big ship small is another piece of product advice I give.\n\n(00:35:02):\nThe last piece of advice that I would say that I like is more of a way of thinking. So this is a little abstract, but when employees join Asana, they get a book called The 15 Commitments of a Conscious Leader. It's led by the Conscious Leadership Group. They also get two-day training on some language and tools for how to effectively work with other people, and it's a really... For me at least, it was transformational because I learned some vocabulary and methods that I could share with my peers. One of the things that you learn is to be above or below the line, and something that is this concept of like, \"Where are you? Are you above the line? Are you below the line?\" If you're above the line, you're committed to learning. You're open and curious. Things are funny here, more playful. If you're below the line, you're committed to winning. You're committed to being right. Things are more black and white.\n\n(00:36:10):\nAll of us have days where we're having a conversation and we're really in that below line space where it's like, \"No, it just is this way. There's no two ways around it.\" That concept of understanding your personal head space, and then being mindful of how you're operating when you're in that place really was great advice for me and also recognizing where other people were when it related to decisions we were making or context. It also helped me think about rejecting false trade-offs and challenging like... Effectively, there's this notion of how might the opposite be true, and that's a piece of advice that I give myself like this morning.\n\n(00:36:55):\nI think it was yesterday, actually. I was like, \"How am I going to do tomorrow? Tomorrow, I have to deliver the clarity pillar brief to the area leads and make sure they understand our stack ranked metrics, and they need to know exactly what our strategic priorities are and why, and they need nudges, and they need to be able to translate our voice of business and usability lists into those plans. I need to establish a perspective and make sure this is all written down and they really understand it, and I have a great conversation with them where I get open questions and they feel like they can really challenge my thinking. I also am having a podcast with Lenny in the afternoon. Ugh.\" Right?\n\n(00:37:37):\nAt first, it was like, \"This is just too much. I should try to move or cancel one of these.\" Then, I asked myself, \"How might the opposite be true?\" I was like, \"I can do both.\" It was just enough to pop the balloon because sometimes your brain is so accustomed to having a scarcity mindset as opposed to creating alternative options or seeing a different path. The moment I challenged myself and said, \"How might the opposite be true?\" my shoulders dropped. I felt more relaxed. I was like, \"Oh, yeah, I can do both. It will be fine. We'll have a great conversation. I'm ready to show up, and be curious, and really engage with you on the topics that you've found interesting, and we'll just do that. So, \"How might the opposite be true?\" has been a really helpful piece of advice or line of questioning that I use with myself to make sure that I'm not taking myself away.\n\nLenny (00:38:43):\nWow. What a fruitful question that ended up being. That was amazing. How does clarity pillars strategy go? Are people into it? Is it working?\n\nPaige Costello (00:38:52):\nYeah. I'm pumped. It's a really interesting time to be a product leader, especially with all of the tech transform... Truly, the technological transformation on LLMs is astonishing, the pace of development, the ability of our teams to just ship quickly and ship really intelligent things. We're not in an operational \"figure it out\" land. We're not in a place where we're trying to decide how to do a better job and get it out to customers. We really have lots of interesting paths forward and are trying to make sure that we're on the cutting edge while really looking at like, \"What does it mean to serve the companies and organizations that we want to serve with new ways of serving them?\" So it was a really fun conversation, and I also had to be honest with people and say, \"This is a 70% cut. 30% of this is missing or incorrect, and that's why I'm coming to you early.\" So I think it went really well, and it's the start of our 12-month rolling planning conversation.\n\nLenny (00:40:05):\nLet me pull on this AI thread because it's clearly top of mind for a lot of people.\n\nPaige Costello (00:40:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:40:09):\nHow do you think about splitting up investment in AI exploration within the product team? Are you like, \"Hey, team. Everyone should be thinking about AI as part of their product,\" or is it there's a team where they're going to think about AI and LLM integrations and, \"Everyone else, keep doing what you're doing?\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:40:24):\nWe've had an ML team for quite some time, making sure that we have test prioritization models and notification prioritization models, and are making our product less work for people to use. But when it came to the massive leap forward in LLMs recently, we staffed a team to really prototype quickly, and discover what was possible, and just apply hypotheses outside of the typical norms of how we work. So they went straight to prototyping instead of going through that Double Diamond I was explaining earlier. What that meant was that we were really quickly able to say, \"Wow, this is just so much better than we imagined and would never have prioritized it because we thought it would take so much longer.\" Then, in other cases, \"That sounded good in theory.\"\n\n(00:41:18):\nSo skipping a lot of that to just really try it on for a size has been key, and then what we're doing is giving the teams with the most expertise in the customer problems. For example, status and progress reporting, the keys to that car and saying like, \"Here's the starter. Here's the hypothesis. Here's how far we got with it. It's dogfooding. What do you want to do?\" So we're able to nudge people without wasting time and build the skills locally within the teams that then move those experiences forward.\n\nLenny (00:41:50):\nI want to come back to the coaching topic. I had a few questions there that I moved off of, but I feel like that's a rich area of exploration. You mentioned Intuit. You worked at Intuit. Intuit is famous for having a really good APM program and really good training for product managers. What did you take away from that experience that you bring with you to coaching or even I think there's an APM program at Asana, too?\n\nPaige Costello (00:42:15):\nIntuit had excellent training programs, the APM program and their manager training. So, on the PM front, the biggest thing that they taught was around customer centricity, and it really started with the founding of the company. For anyone who works at Intuit or has worked at Intuit, they know that there's this story about Scott Cook watching his wife balancing her checkbook at the kitchen table, and staring at it, and saying, \"There's got to be a better way, a software.\" So it was very typical for the product training at Intuit to be all about like, \"How do you actually watch customers using your product or just doing the things they do, collecting the artifacts, knowing the workarounds, and using that experience to build opportunities for surprise and insight that then you can capitalize and create products around?\" They also are very specific about how they define durable advantage and think about, overall, the product process from a place of customer insight through to the market landscape. So the PM program there was absolutely super thoughtful, especially for taking someone who has never PMed into being a super skilled PM.\n\n(00:43:37):\nThey also have a wonderful manager training program, and I think the biggest thing that I took away from their manager training was really on the feedback slide. So delivering feedback is something that I think everyone benefits from, but for managers, it's so much more critical because if you don't do it, and you don't say what you mean, and you don't do it in a way that it can be internalized and acted upon, you really don't set up your teammates, your teams for growth or success in their careers. So their program for helping you think about like, \"Okay. I'm going to convey this feedback as situation, behavior, impact. The situation is on Tuesday in that meeting at 3:00. Behavior, you interrupted me while I was saying this thing. Impact, made me feel like you weren't listening to me or made me feel like your voice was more important than mine, or impact, blah, blah, blah.\"\n\n(00:44:35):\nIt doesn't matter what the impact is because the way you've set it up is it's a subjective observation. It's not what the camera recorded, it's what you experienced. Therefore, it is true and valuable feedback, and it gets the conversation started such that you can then talk about next steps. That format and framing really helped me understand that delivering feedback isn't about being right or about getting the right information to the other person. It's about sharing the impact of different decisions that they're making. So, especially if you have to give feedback about, God forbid, what someone wears to the office, or how do you feel their work is, or how they're communicating or their body language, having an enough support where you can be really clear about what you're intending and the spirit behind that, but that it's formalized enough that people can really engage with it has been enormously helpful, and I still use it today.\n\nLenny (00:45:35):\nIt's interesting how some of the most impactful training is such soft skills.\n\nPaige Costello (00:45:41):\nSo basic.\n\nLenny (00:45:43):\nBasic. Yeah.\n\nPaige Costello (00:45:43):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:45:44):\nIt's just how to give someone some feedback, but it's like, \"Know how to prioritize, how to do a meeting, how to give a presentation.\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:45:48):\nNo. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:45:50):\nIt's like, \"Here's how you give feedbacks.\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:45:52):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:45:53):\nSo you've worked with a lot of early product managers. I'm curious what you find most holds back new PMs and help them being successful in their career, and even on the flip side, what most helps new PMs be successful in terms of skills or behaviors, habits, things like that?\n\nPaige Costello (00:46:11):\nI would say this illusion that you have to be all-knowing and super confident sets you up to be in a place of advocacy instead of inquiry. So PMs who are newer in their careers or who are in a different space than they're accustomed to working really want to be pro really fast. What pro means is trying to cut that straight path, and that can reduce information and conversation that makes you smarter. So some of the challenges that some PMs face are feeling like they need to be the expert, they need to be the smartest person in the room, or God forbid, they think they're the smartest person in the room.\n\n(00:46:56):\nThen, what happens is they're really doing that customer, or product discovery, or spec in a little dark room. Then, they show up, and they say, \"This is it. This is right. I know it's right, and let's do this as quickly as possible.\" Everyone else says, \"Wait. What? I don't know. I have a question,\" or they don't, and they still have a question, which is even worse. So I would say something that really holds PMs back is not being collaborative from a place of true curiosity like performative collaboration where they're not in a room or want to do a review, but ultimately, they don't really want the questions or the feedback.\n\n(00:47:40):\nI think trying to make sure that you can be in a place of curiosity and openness because that will make your experience more successful is really important. Other people aren't always going to be right, but if you're present for it, you can ask clarifying questions. You can ask the question behind the question. You can hear the feedback, and then say, \"Was that something that I must do, that I should do, or that I should consider?\" You can actually develop a conversation that will move your relationship forward, and so I would say that's something that I think holds PMs back.\n\n(00:48:17):\nPMs tend to be so ambitious and career-centric. There are so many good things about that, but I would say don't let the sound of your wheels drive you crazy. If you're present in your job, and you actually have fun with it and solve the problems, people will come out of the woodwork, say, \"You're great, and tell your boss you should be promoted.\" You don't need to ask for a promotion. Your outcomes should speak for themselves. Yes, you should have sponsors and people who advocate for you, but a lot of that just comes from that raw connection to the work and to your team.\n\nLenny (00:48:55):\nEveryone I talked to about you is like, \"Oh my god, I love Paige.\" I could see why, but I want to ask you a question. I imagine you've made some mistakes either with a product or your career. I'd love to hear a story of something that went wrong and what you learned from that experience. This might be the last question, depending where you take it.\n\nPaige Costello (00:49:16):\nI would say that all of the advice I've given so far is directly related to things I've learned the hard way. So, especially as an IC moving into a management role, you aren't supposed to have all the answers. You need to ask better questions. You need to be thoughtful about direction and agency. So I would say one of the missteps here is knowing how to give guidance or direction in a way that doesn't feel like micromanagement because what you're trying to do is to teach a repeatable pattern instead of giving a precise instruction that can be used once, and then disposed of.\n\n(00:49:57):\nSo I think that's a pretty common manager path issue, but I think the faster you learn it, and observe it, and use techniques to manage it, the better. So, for example, I would go to my meetings with a stack of Post-Its, and I would write what I wish I was saying on Post-Its and see if someone else would say it first. Then, if by the end of the meeting, I had decided that I still had a Post-It or two that was worthwhile, I would say them. But you've got to police yourself because no one else will do it because no matter how accessible you think you are, other people know that you're the boss. They're not going to necessarily speak over you or challenge you directly.\n\n(00:50:42):\nAnother challenge I had is I'm a very optimistic person, and I like to look on the bright side. I'm very positive, and I think depending on the culture you're working with or depending on your team, sometimes they need to hear what's really bad, and they need you to be really real, and they need you to tell them like it is. Something I realized was that I had an experience where I didn't realize that people didn't think I was being authentic because they thought something was bad, and I wasn't talking about it, but it wasn't because I didn't think it was bad or didn't see. It was just because my nature was to say, \"Well, I'm not going to talk about bad things because we're doing the things we need to do.\" As long as the plan is good, I wasn't really highlighting all the problems I saw or really pushing on those head on with my team, and so they felt like they didn't know what I was seeing or if we were saying the same things. That was really an interesting experience. Yeah, there were just so many. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:51:49):\nWith that second lesson, is there something you've changed in the way you lead and operate where you now found a way to communicate, \"Here's wrong,\" in a way that's still maybe optimistic and productive?\n\nPaige Costello (00:52:00):\nI try to be more real with myself and others. I try to show up and say like, \"Hey, this is incomplete.\" For example, even the thing I did this morning, the clarity brief. I said, \"This is 70% finish. The 30% that I don't believe is there yet are these three things. I don't feel confident in this piece of it, and hopefully, we'll have more clarity by next week.\" So that's an example of just being as real with the small things as with the big things so that people can balance their perspective of you and your work, and the organization and the environment you're creating.\n\nLenny (00:52:40):\nI'm curious how you think about your career going forward. How far out do you think where you want to be, and how do you plan out the future of Paige's career?\n\nPaige Costello (00:52:50):\nI try to be really intentional about staying as much as leaving a role. When I think about my career as a whole, I try to think about skills or experiences I want to have as opposed to roles, or companies, or specific problems. So something that I think about is... Effectively, I evaluate whether I'm in a healthy role and in a good setup by asking myself about my learning curve like, \"Is the steepness of my learning curve doing me a favor here?\" because sometimes you might love the organization, love the problem, and feel like you're just not learning, or learning fast enough, or being challenged.\n\n(00:53:39):\nThat's something that I think is really important. So thinking about the learning curve, thinking about whether the environment is positively impacting your ability to grow your career and make an impact. So, environmentally, you might have not enough staffing or tooling, or have someone in the management team who is toxic, or have a peer who is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That stuff matters, and I think people don't talk about it or take it seriously enough that your environment should include people who are advocating for you, and it should just be a place where you feel you've got the right ingredients to set you up to do the good work.\n\n(00:54:24):\nThen, the third piece is really around just the problem, the problem your product is solving. Is it fun? Is it interesting? I often like to think about passions are made, not found because I think people... We do this with nine-year-olds. We say, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" They look cross-eyed, and they say, \"An astronaut. Just getting a vet. I don't know.\" There's this moment of panic, and I would say that being comfortable, saying like, \"Go try different things, and see if the problem is interesting to you and if the problem is fun or interesting to you.\" It doesn't mean it has to be sexy. It doesn't mean the company needs to have a brand name. It just has to be something that you're curious about so that you do a better job at your job. So I would say learning curve environment and problem are things that I use to assess like, \"Am I still on the right path, or should I consider an alternative?\" But when I think about my own career, I really think about skills and experiences as opposed to roles. So I would say that that's more my frame of reference because otherwise, I think I am living in the future and not enough trying to make the most out of the career I'm living right now.\n\nLenny (00:55:44):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nPaige Costello (00:55:49):\nYeah. Let's do it.\n\nLenny (00:55:51):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nPaige Costello (00:55:54):\nMy go-to book recommendation for other PMs is inspired by Marty Cagan. I think it's a classic. The other books that I have enjoyed and recommended lately are The Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood and The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.\n\nLenny (00:56:11):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nPaige Costello (00:56:14):\nOoh, I'm very much enjoying The Diplomat right now, and then TV show or movie. Let's see. I just watched the Fire of Love documentary, which is about a couple who study volcanoes, and that was a great change of pace.\n\nLenny (00:56:32):\nI saw the trailer for that. I think I got to watch that, and I finished The Diplomat. It's awesome. It ends really well.\n\nPaige Costello (00:56:37):\nI'm not done. Don't spoil it.\n\nLenny (00:56:39):\nBut it's just good. I'm just saying it's good. That's not spoiling.\n\nPaige Costello (00:56:39):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:56:45):\nOkay. Next question. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\n\nPaige Costello (00:56:49):\nThe good news is I can tell you this and still keep asking it because the answer has always come up differently. So I like to ask, \"Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it? Yada, yada.\" Effectively, the question gets that, \"When the product failed,\" When something about the team didn't work,\" just things that go wrong because that's what happens when you're doing this work, and evaluating people's mindset, and the way they talk about it, and the way they relate to evaluating the situation. I think it's a great question. Really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well.\n\nLenny (00:57:34):\nWhat is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nPaige Costello (00:57:37):\nI've been playing a lot with Poe.com lately. Yeah, just an opportunity to learn more about LLM capabilities in a firsthand way. It's been fun to create little bots. I'm playing with making a page bot. I can't say that the page bot could have had this conversation yet, but maybe next year at this time, you can have a conversation with the other me.\n\nLenny (00:58:07):\nThat's what the page bot would say if this was the page bot talking right now.\n\nPaige Costello (00:58:10):\nI would say though that the advice, bits and bobs, I gave you earlier are absolutely things that I've been thinking about feeding, but I think the page bot would probably say, \"Ship it.\"\n\nLenny (00:58:25):\nPoe. It's the Quora founder's LLM chat bot?\n\nPaige Costello (00:58:30):\nYeah, and so you can try the different models. So you can do four, and you play five, and Claude, and a few others. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:58:38):\nThere's also a lennybot.com for folks that haven't seen this. Actually, there's a whole post on my newsletter of how it was built, and you get a lennybot.com. It is trained on all of my newsletter posts, and I think... not yet podcasts, but someday it will have podcasts.\n\nPaige Costello (00:58:55):\nOoh.\n\nLenny (00:58:55):\nBy the way, someone listening to this, we're looking for someone to maintain this bot and evolve it. So if you're really into this stuff and have done this sort of thing, please DM me on Twitter. I'm looking for someone to take over lennybot.com, make it more... Moving on. Enough about me. Next question. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute?\n\nPaige Costello (00:59:18):\nOne of the biggest ones is just, once again, being real about how many reviews and approvals it takes for something to get done and who's actually responsible for reviewing and approving work. So we got really aggressive about, functionally, who is in charge and at what level for a given review, and pushed to say to actually have limits on the number of people per meeting, on the number of sub-task reviews for a given body of work. What this did is it created a lot more agency and pace within given working teams. So what we did was we said, \"We actually don't care. We don't want a daisy chain of approvals. We just want one person with whom the buck can stop with them, and they can be responsible for how the work moves forward such that the knowledge is known and we could have connected the dots more effectively than we do or did.\" So that's the logic there, and it really changed the pace and quality of our work.\n\nLenny (01:00:25):\nI love that. Is there any more you could share, a number? What is the maximum? Is there anything that other people maybe can take as a-\n\nPaige Costello (01:00:31):\nYeah. So no more than three reviews on a given piece of work where people are blocking one approver. If a meeting has more than 10 people on it, we ask the person hosting the meeting to kick out the other people and write better decision notes.\n\nLenny (01:00:49):\nThe three reviews is three meetings looking at the product as it's coming together, basically?\n\nPaige Costello (01:00:54):\nThe three reviews are three people who are assigned a task to look at something, but only one person is blocking whether it moves to the next stage.\n\nLenny (01:01:03):\nGot it. Informed people? Stakeholders?\n\nPaige Costello (01:01:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:01:06):\nDecision-makers? Okay. Great. Final question. You work at Asana. What is your favorite Asana pro tip?\n\nPaige Costello (01:01:12):\nI use Asana to run all my meetings and assign pre-reads. So I use the multi-assign feature in subtasks all the time where I make a task with a due date that says, \"Read this thing by this date,\" and then I assign it to a team or a set of individuals like that really quickly. Then, when I'm in the meeting, I take notes live in a task, and then highlight parts of those notes, and convert them into subtasks so that none of the action items get lost.\n\nLenny (01:01:46):\nWow. You need to make a video or blog post about this. Not only is it using Asana to build Asana, it's using Asana to run teams within Asana.\n\nPaige Costello (01:01:46):\nYeah. It definitely does that, but-\n\nLenny (01:01:57):\nAsana all the way down.\n\nPaige Costello (01:01:58):\nPeople know who's responsible for what they want.\n\nLenny (01:02:01):\nAmazing. Paige, you are awesome. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nPaige Costello (01:02:10):\nYou can find me on LinkedIn and Twitter, Paige Costello, and on Twitter, @paigenow. Listeners, well, I'd love to hear how you think AI is going to shape the future of software for knowledge workers, but in particular, if you and your team use Asana, I'd love to know where you'd like to see AI playing a bigger role to drive efficiency alignment for your team. So, as you know, we offer a ton of goal management, work management pieces that help teams and orgs do their work together, and I'd love to hear from you about where you see the opportunity.\n\nLenny (01:02:49):\nAwesome. Paige, again, thank you so much for being here.\n\nPaige Costello (01:02:53):\nMy pleasure. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (01:02:55):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:02:57):\nThank you so much for listening.
