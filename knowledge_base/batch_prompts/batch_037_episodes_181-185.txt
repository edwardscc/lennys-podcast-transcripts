And so we hired a couple of college interns and we brought them in and we were like, people are going to push this magical one button in the Anchor app and they're going to say, I want to distribute my podcast, and your job is going to be to do all that same manual stuff manually, but to them it's going to feel magical and it happened automatically. I still don't know how many people know this. I think people think that we had some secret backdoor deal with Apple for distribution, but we just had college students making Apple podcast accounts and then submitting hundreds of thousands of podcasts through these accounts, and I think that was a really big part of why we got so much hosting market share so quickly because it was such an insane benefit over the other platforms which otherwise had been commoditized at that point.\n\nLenny (00:00:48):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard win experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Maya Prohovnik. Maya is Spotify's head of product for podcasting where she oversees product design and engineering teams responsible for building the tools and experiences for podcasters and their listeners. Maya was also employee number one at Anchor, which Spotify acquired five years ago, which became the core of Spotify's podcasting hosting platform, which now powers over 75% of all new podcasts created in the world. In our conversation, we dig into why Maya is obsessed with dogfooding and why she encourages everyone on her team to create their own podcast. She's got four podcasts of her own, which are all very highly rated and people love. We dig into how she stays productive and organized in a very hectic senior leadership role, what she's done to allow for Anchor to continue to operate like a startup within a larger organization.\n\nLenny (00:01:44):\nAlso, a bunch of really fun early Anchor stories, including how interns uploaded podcasts to Apple and Spotify manually before they could automate that. Plus, how to find a balance between using your gut and using data to make decisions. Also, public speaking tips, so much more. Maya is amazing and I'm really excited for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Maya Prohovnik after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors. A trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life.\n\nLenny (00:02:33):\nThis has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted private supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey.

You and I have been trying to get together for almost a year now.\n\nLenny (00:04:42):\nOh, man. But it all worked out and it's going to be very worth it.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:04:45):\nYou had a kid. I took parental leave.\n\nLenny (00:04:47):\nOh, right. That is true. Man, overlapping kid journeys. I also have been just really looking forward to this chat partly because you're amazing and partly because it just feels very meta to have the head of product of Spotify podcasting on the podcast, and I imagine many people are listening to this on Spotify, so there's this, I don't know, turtles all the way down situation happening.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:05:08):\nI totally agree. I was thinking the same thing when I was preparing for it where it's like so much of what we have to talk about is so meta, and then we also have you and I know each other because you've been sending me feedback about the podcast experience on Spotify, so lots of circular stuff there.\n\nLenny (00:05:22):\nSpeaking of Spotify and podcasting, clearly you've done an incredible job building podcasting on Spotify. From what I've read, it's the number one podcasting platform now. Is there a stat you could share by just the percentage of the market share essentially of Spotify podcasting?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:05:37):\nI think we are now officially over a third of global market share of podcast listening, which is pretty insane.\n\nLenny (00:05:43):\nThat is insane.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:05:44):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:05:44):\nAlso, I think on the hosting side, it's an even bigger number. Is there a stat you can share by just maybe new podcasts that are launched and how many are hosted on Spotify?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:05:53):\nYeah, I think at this point it's more than 75% of all new shows on Spotify are hosted with Spotify for podcasters, which used to be Anchor. When we were acquired by Spotify, I think Anchor had already gotten to 40% of all new podcasts or something crazy. So, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:06:09):\nInsane. Okay, so for these reasons, I want to spend the time that we have together unpacking how you operate as a product leader and essentially what you've learned about product org leadership growth and all those things. How's that sound?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:06:22):\nThat sounds perfect. My favorite topics.\n\nLenny (00:06:24):\nOkay, let's do it. So as the first question I asked a PM who actually works for you, Wilma Chu, what to ask you, and the first thing that came to mind for her was this idea of dogfooding and how important dogfooding is to your way of operating as a product leader. As an example, you have three of your own podcasts on Spotify and I checked them out and they're all very highly rated, so they're not just like bullshit podcasts, they're real people actually listen and enjoy them. So my question to you is just why is dogfooding so important to you? How do you actually operationalize it? And then also maybe just talk about these podcasts that you have.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:06:58):\nSure. Well, I can talk about them forever, so be careful because I'll take up the whole hour with that. But I actually have four podcasts. There's two that I don't update as much anymore. So my first ever podcast was about Stephen King books. I'm a big Stephen King super fan. So, when I joined Anchor, and we weren't even fully podcasts yet, if you recall, we were something else audio, we were trying to avoid being podcasts for a while and then we decided to just be podcasts. But when I got into audio and trying to help audio creators, the first thing I did was make my own podcast because I was like, I know nothing about production or what it feels to even be a creator in that way.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:07:35):\nAnd so I started my Stephen King podcast because that is the number one thing that I just love to talk about every day, which is one of my tips for podcasters. If you're trying to figure out what to make a show about, it's what can you talk about for? So I did that one for a while actually. I spent a ton of time editing it. I spent a ton of time on SEO and marketing it, and it got to the point, I think at its peak I was getting 5,000 listeners in a episode, which now seems small for a podcast, I know.\n\nLenny (00:07:59):\nNo, that's very legit.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:08:01):\nYeah, for a test podcast that I was just doing to learn how to do my job, I was so excited to get that audience and I fell off because, well, mostly I had a kid, I joined Spotify. My life's really busy and that level of production is so hard to do if it's not your full-time job, but I still get emails all the time from people who are like, please bring it back. I never found another great Stephen King because I really got deep into the books and the connection between the books. So that was one of them. The second one I did, still going today. So my husband and I have this Big Brother podcast, the show Big Brother, it's terrible.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:08:33):\nI would not recommend listening to my podcast unless you are a Big Brother super fan, and I actually started that one because I wanted to get the other end of the spectrum where something we were really focused on with Anchor at the time was first time creators really growing the pie of podcasters and specifically we had this theory that podcast creation of the future would be mobile first and we had this really high-powered mobile app, and so I was like, I'm going to make a podcast that's fully mobile, not highly edited, not worry about making something that sounds like a traditional podcast. And I really leaned into all the Anchor features. So it's fully recorded on my phone. I do almost no editing, but I think the thing that's kept us going, because it's been six or seven years now we've been doing the show, it's really the community, the people who call in.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:09:15):\nI have no idea who these people are. I have no idea how they found this terrible show, but they love it. They call in every week. And that I think is one of the many things I've learned from dogfooding, a podcast creation app is that community piece is so important. If you don't know if anyone's listening, if you don't know what they like about it, if you don't know if they're coming back, it's so hard to keep investing the time. And then I made a show, my least known podcast, because it only got like 25 listeners for episode, it's about my favorite book of all time called Children of Time. It's actually a trilogy. And the reason it got almost no listeners is because there were tons of spoilers in the podcast and the book is like 800 pages long. So we were like, do not listen if you haven't read the book.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:09:53):\nSo, it was very niche, but I think it's a really good podcast if you've read Children of Time. And then my last one I just started doing a couple of years ago is about parenting. So I have a son who's two and a half now and we have been documenting our journey as parents all the way from, we went through IVF, so starting with sort of fertility, I have a really fun episode about childbirth if people are interested in that sort of thing. And then ever since then it's just been episodes about the transition to parenthood, which has not been particularly easy for us, and now my son's a toddler, so lots of fun things happening there. You're not there yet, but you will be and then you can listen to my toddler episodes.\n\nLenny (00:10:27):\nYeah. I got to listen to the next... A few months ahead to learn from what you've learned.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:10:31):\nYes, I think that's a good tactic.\n\nLenny (00:10:33):\nBefore we talk about dogfooding, have you ever considered going full-time on this stuff? This is always an option for people and clearly you've done great. At least two podcasts are killing it.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:10:44):\nI have not. And I think it's so funny because with my parenting podcast too, and even my terrible Big Brother podcast, I get compliments all the time and people are like, \"I love listening to this.\" And my husband also is a really funny and a really good podcaster, but I don't know why I don't think of myself as a creator. I think to me it still feels like this exercise where it's like I'm making my podcast, but I'm really doing it so that I can learn about our product and get in the mindset of a creator. So I think the problem is I'm just too much of a product person. It's a means to an end for me instead of the end itself. But that is an interesting question because I know most people who podcasts, their ultimate goal is obviously to be able to do it full-time and that is interesting that I haven't thought about it.\n\nLenny (00:11:31):\nYou have a good backup plan of things if anything goes off the rails.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:11:34):\nI guess so, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:11:35):\nAwesome. Okay. Just coming back to this idea of dogfooding, where does that come from for you? What have you learned about just how to execute that?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:11:40):\nIt's just always been my natural state. I've had a handful of different product jobs and I guess they've all been tangentially related to helping creators or creative people. And so I think for me it's like I don't know how you can build those tools if you don't understand that mindset. I'm not surprised that it came to Wilma's mind when you asked her what to ask me because I am constantly yelling at my product team who do not have podcasts and being like, I really don't think that you can build the right things. If they talk to users all the time, they see the data, but all of them, once they finally start doing their podcast, they're like, I get it. Something clicked and now I feel like I really understand what they need. And I guess building tools for creators is similar to building a B2B product where you really have to understand business, it's their livelihood.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:12:25):\nAnd so I think if you're just looking at a list of feature requests, you're not necessarily going to prioritize it in the same way as if you deeply feel those problems. And I think for me, I don't know if I mentioned this to you, but when I first got into tech, I started in customer support, that was how I got into product, and so I think I just am a very user focused product person. I think there's different schools of thought for product and for me it's always been about making people happy, making their experience better, solving real problems in their lives. And so for me, becoming one of the users, I think it's made it so much easier for me to advocate for that being a pretty big chunk of the roadmap.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:13:04):\nI think if you don't have that, especially coming from someone in leadership, it's so easy to just fall into that trap of like, well, we're working on the next big strategic thing, which is two years away, and then in the meantime your users are getting no value and then they're just going somewhere else. So I don't know. I think it's really important to me. It makes sense to me and also, I'm not sure how else I would do product. I've never really not done it that way. It\n\nLenny (00:13:25):\nReminds me of Airbnb Brian was a huge advocate on the host side of the product is like, you need to be a host, but many people couldn't because they didn't have a place that could be hosted. Is there anything you've learned about just how to make this a thing that actually works effectively, a way to operationalize this for people listening, they're like, \"Oh, I should start encouraging my team to do?\"\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:13:42):\nI'm constantly reminding our team to do this. And then I think that also comes from the other people who are doing it. So we really elevate the people on our team who have their own podcasts, we help them tell their stories internally. Whenever we do an offsite or any team activity, we'll always incorporate podcast creation or some way of making sure everyone on the team is using the tools. I don't know, I think a lot of it just comes from, I'm so vocal about this stuff. The other night I was recording a podcast and I DMed one of the engineers on our team and told him about this tiny little iOS bug and he was like, why are you DMing me about this at nine o'clock at night? I think I was also supposed to be on vacation, I can't remember.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:14:20):\nBut then he got the bug fix the next day. And so I do think making that something that's really top of mind for the team that we do need to fix problems, that these things matter, I don't know. I always listen to the podcast that my team makes, so it's like I know they're going to get at least one listener. And then I think also I try, I think because I understand a big part of building tools for podcasters is understanding all the barriers to entry. It's actually a really difficult thing trying to get someone to put their voice out there, share their story, it's a really emotional journey. And so I feel like I've tried to turn some of the things that I've learned about podcasting into, I've never written it down, maybe I should, but I have a playbook that I'll tell people when they're considering making their own podcast.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:15:02):\nSo it's just things like don't try and record by yourself, find a friend. That's a much easier way to get into it or don't follow a script because then you're going to feel really awkward and uncomfortable and not feel good about it afterwards. Or don't just record a test thing for 30 seconds and publish it because you have to make yourself feel the pain that we're trying to understand in our users.\n\nLenny (00:15:24):\nWhat's cool about that that could turn into just onboarding education, basically your experience of making a podcast informs how to help new podcasters become successful.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:15:31):\nTotally, yeah. And also this is less about dogfooding, but one of my favorite things is I'm always just trying to convince everyone I meet to start a podcast, that's just become my annoying thing. And so if I'm interviewing someone for a job or if I'm at a party and mingling with people, it's like somehow the conversation always turns to their passions and then I'm like, you should make a podcast about it. And then they're like, well, I can't. And then I work my way through all the reasons they say they can't do it, and then they go start a podcast. So I'm like one person at a time.\n\nLenny (00:16:00):\nI see how you're growing the platform now.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:16:02):\nYes, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:16:04):\nVery unscalable, hands to hand combat at parties. I get it. Okay. One thing you mentioned about being maybe the only listen of your coworkers podcast reminds me there's this platform where you could find Spotify music that has never ever been played once and you could be their first play and just go through.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:16:22):\nThat is so cool.\n\nLenny (00:16:24):\nIt's very touching, right?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:16:25):\nYes. I haven't seen that and now I'm like, how can we productize that for podcasters? That's such a cool thing.\n\nLenny (00:16:31):\nAnyway, another area that I've heard you're really strong at and came up with Wilma and a few other people I talked to is you find a really good balance between being very data-driven and also very gut driven, and this is something a lot of product leaders try to get better at. And so I'm curious just what have you learned about try to find that balance and also is there an example of something where you went against the data and went with your gut and it worked out.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:16:58):\nIf you remember the old days of the internet, I feel like there was really this different way of thinking about product development where it was so much more about what felt good and what made you feel something as a user in that product. And so it's like we used to be a lot more playful I think with software. I think we used to put a lot more emphasis on things like delightful animations or fun little Easter eggs, and I am not sure when or where that got lost, but it feels like product management as a role has gotten formalized and become a little bit more scientific, I'm generalizing, but I think a lot of product managers can be so focused on using the right frameworks and making sure that they have the right roadmap and all of this stuff.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:17:37):\nAnd then it's like you find yourself in this cycle where you're just building things to build them and not really thinking about the connection to the end user. I think data is amazing and I'm like, we have such an incredible insights team at Spotify, both my insights team and then the broader one. I think we are so lucky and we have so much knowledge about our users and different cohorts and what people need and what they're missing, and so I think that's extremely valuable. I think where people get into trouble is when they think that they can rely solely on the data. And so what I spend a lot of time talking to my team about is how we can balance that. So thinking about, I guess a couple general things I would say are there are right and wrong times I think for both for your gut and for data. And then there are lots of different kinds of data and different ways to use that data.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:18:21):\nSo I think when you're in the trap of just being like, well, this is the process we always have with insights and we're just going to run this every time we have a feature, I don't think you're going to have a great time. I think if you think of it as part of the creative process as a PM where you're like, I have a hypothesis, I have some data that is helping me understand that hypothesis in the first place or form it in the first place, then I'm going to do some user research and try a couple of things and see what works for people. Then I'm going to make sure that we have success metrics and that we know what we're looking for when we launch, then we're going to follow, et cetera. So I think there's different times and places for all the different types of data collection that you can do.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:18:58):\nThe other thing I would say is something that I have had to learn as a leader, especially as part of a larger organization, when we were a startup Anchor was like 20 people when we got acquired by Spotify. And by the way, Spotify is my first big tech company, so I've always been at startups, so I've learned a lot about that. But when I was leading product at a startup, it's like we're a small team, we're really focused on moving quickly. There isn't a whole lot of stopping to ask what data is supporting this or it's just like we talked to some users and we're like, great, that's a problem. We're just going to go and fix it. And I think at Spotify there's obviously at places like Spotify, I mean, large organizations, there's obviously a lot more people that you need to coordinate.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:19:38):\nThere's a lot of people you have to influence that aren't on your immediate team. And so I think something that I've had to learn is that being gut driven isn't the same as just saying to people, I told you or I believe this, so you have to do it. There really is an art I think to balancing that. And I think that what I try to do is always still as objectively as possible explain why my gut is feeling that way. So it's like you can refer back to your years of experience or other things that you've done that have been similar. You can talk about your experience as a user testing this stuff. You can bring in stories and anecdotes from users to help back it up. And so I have found that that works obviously a lot better.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:20:18):\nAnd I think that in the times that either I have done this or I've seen other leaders do it, where they're just like, well, we're just going to do it this way even if you guys don't agree or if the data says something different, those projects are always immediately doomed from the beginning. They're never going to work. You can't drag all these people through something that they don't believe in. So I think I would think of your gut actually as a type of data and I think it's a totally valid one and it's just I think you need to be clear that that's what you're working with, but then it should be taken as seriously as any other data point. So I try and think of it that way where it's like this should all ideally work together. And obviously the more data you have and the more types of data you have, the more convincing you're going to be and the more right you're going to be.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:20:56):\nSo I think it all helps. There were so many of these in the early days of Anchor because I don't even know, I don't think we had a data scientist until we were part of Spotify, so I think it was just engineers running queries. But there were a couple times where we had to move Anchor from 1.0 to 2.0 and then from 2.0 to 3.0, we did these big, I don't like to call them pivots, but sort of evolutions let's say, of our product or our strategy terminology also very important when you're trying to convince people of things. So when I was thinking about those big transitions for us as a team, I think both times we had these big moments with our teams where we had to get everyone on board with making these big changes. So with Anchor 1.0, I don't know if you remember, but it was actually similar to what Clubhouse I think just rebranded to more voice messaging and short form and more about connections between people.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:21:50):\nAnd that was the first thing we ever launched and people loved it. People were very excited about it, the data was all good. We had extremely retained users. We anecdotally, we were hearing all this stuff from users all the time that they were staying up all night to use the app, people were meeting each other and falling in love and getting married on our platform, all of these really kind of magical things and we were seeing the user base was growing consistently. But I think we had this feeling, and when I say, I mean, mostly Mike and I at the time, Mike was our CEO, that it just wasn't ever going to be big enough. And so we had this really interesting moment where the users were all telling us, there's no problem. We love this product. They were using it every day, they were coming back. It was slowly growing and we were just like, this just isn't going to get us to where we need to be, our original goal had been we wanted to democratize audio.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:22:42):\nWe wanted to make it something where anyone could easily tell their story, and we were like, if we keep digging ourselves into this niche that a small number of people really, really love, that's great, but that's not really the mission that we sent out set out to solve. And so the 1.0 to 2.0 transition was I think actually pretty painful because for all of those people who had been invested in 1.0, 2.0 didn't work for them. 2.0 was much more about content creation and making more of a radio station, and it was less about telling your personal story and close relationships and more about projecting and using different tools. Anyway, so we made that call I think pretty much just on gut and it was like, this is a business decision. This is where we think the next phase needs to be.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:23:25):\nWhen we built Anchor 2.0, it was a lot more like the tools that we wanted to use, even though it wasn't what the user base was asking for. So I think that's one example of sometimes it's that whole users don't always know what to ask for, they don't always know what problems they need you to solve for them. And so I think you really have to be able to hear what's behind it or really even if the data is looking okay, think about if it's heading to where you need it to go.\n\nLenny (00:23:51):\nBefore you move on, that's actually such an interesting story because it's so hard to have a product that's working that people love and decide to change it completely. Many founders are probably stuck in this where they're just like, hey, this is working and we're feeling some fit. Is there anything else you learned from that? Because that's a really interesting insight and it worked out in your case clearly.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:24:15):\nIt absolutely worked out. I mean, I think it was a terrifying transition. Us at the time, it took us a few months to build a whole new app, it takes longer now, but the whole time we were building it, we were like, we weren't sure if it was a mistake and we would go back and forth and we would feel guilty when we were talking to our users about what they wanted us to be working on. But I think it was one of those things where as soon as we launched 2.0, our numbers started shooting up and we started seeing more kinds of people were using it and people were suddenly using it in the way that we had always imagined as a replacement for the old school, very difficult to make traditional podcasts.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:24:50):\nI don't know. I guess the lesson is you have to be able to tell the signal through the noise, and even if you've got lots of vocal users asking for something, we used to have this rule, the 80/20 rule, where it's like you can't just build for that 20, I don't think we made this up by the way. I think this is a common thing, but we'd always refer to it and say, we want to be building for the 80%, and even though the 20% are going to be more vocal, that's just going to get you deeper into that hole of that problem of you're not really building for everyone. And I think particularly when you're trying to build a creative platform, you're trying to democratize something and your target user is everyone on the planet. I think you really have to be willing to kill your darlings and let things go when they're not getting where you need them to be.\n\nLenny (00:25:35):\nThat's probably the most common cases. Something is working, but it's not working incredibly well. What do we do? And so that's really interesting. I feel like the first thing you said there is really important of just we had a much bigger mission and vision, and even though this is working, this is never going to get there. There's no path to building a massive business.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:25:52):\nI do think that's so important, and I give a lot of credit to Mike and our co-founders. I think they really knew what they wanted to do when they started the company and they were very firm on that and never varied that throughout the years throughout the acquisition. And so I do think not everyone's goal is to build a massive multi-billion dollar world changing business, that's okay if that's not your goal, but if that is your goal, you have to stick to it and it's really hard, but you have to keep pivoting to get to where you want to be.\n\nLenny (00:26:21):\nKill your darlings. I love that phrase, I use it all the time. I think you had a second example. I have a couple other questions of Anchor, but did you want to share another example?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:26:28):\nSure, I can just quickly, my second example was, so we actually had to do it again. So we went from Anchor 1.0 to 2.0, we were like, that was totally the right call. And then Anchor 2.0, we were still in this phase where we would always joke about it because people would be like, \"Oh, it's kind of like making a podcast.\" And we would be like, it's not a podcast because we're trying to be bigger than podcasts. Because we were at the time, 2015, there were still so few people podcasting, it was still so hard to do. And so we originally were really stuck on this idea that podcasting was going to be limiting and that we wanted to be the next thing. In the early days of Anchor, we had all this nautical terminology, so we would call them waves and I don't remember what else, but we had cute nautical terms for everything we were trying to resist podcast and podcaster and those things.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:27:11):\nAnd when we launched Anchor 2.0, we started getting all of this really great traction and the number one feature requests that we got from people is they were like, great, I love using these tools and then I want to export it as a podcast and publish it and get people listening that way. And we resisted it for probably, I don't know, six months or something and we were like, absolutely not, that's not what we're doing. And I think that one was such an interesting lesson because we had just learned that we did the right thing by not listening to our users. So for a while we dug in and we were like, that's not the direction we're going in, they don't know what they actually want. And then when we decided, I think we started with like, oh, we'll do a little test and let people export us podcasts and see what happens.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:27:48):\nAnd when we look back at our data, that's the moment when we saw the beginning of that hockey stick growth where it's like we had been growing, we had been doing well, and then you zoom out and you're like, okay, that was very clearly the thing we were missing. Yet again, we had to stop what we were doing, we rebuilt the entire app, we built it around RSS and podcasting and being able to export. And we actually did some really cool things to make it really easy for people to publish their podcast everywhere. So I think that was really the moment that it took off. And I think it's so interesting putting those two things together because it was the opposite thing the second time that we had to give up on a piece of what we had thought was so inherently true about our business.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:28:28):\nAnd so I don't know what lesson to tell people to take away from that other than I think you have to just stay, especially in a startup mentality, you have to stay willing to be flexible and take in new information and new data points as your product matures and as your user base changes, there's going to be new things that you learn that are going to change how you think about it. And I think again, the one thing that was unwavering for us was our mission and everything else was mutable for us where we were like, whatever we need to do to get there will work. And I do think looking back, it's astonishing how brave we were that we kept finding some product market fit and being like, nope, that's not enough. And then moving to the next thing. And I think that obviously worked out really well for us and meant that we were able to do what we set out to do and really democratize the medium and make things a lot easier for a lot more people.\n\nLenny (00:29:15):\nI think another lesson there is just try stuff. Like you said, you tried this export thing, let's just see what happens. No, we don't think this is where we need to go, but let's just try it and maybe it'll work. And clearly that became the core of the product and platform.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:29:27):\nTotally. And also, you never know which of those tiny product changes are going to end up being this existential moment for your business. You really have to keep your eyes open and be ready for that to happen anytime, especially when you're still trying to figure out where your place is going to be.\n\nLenny (00:29:42):\nYou mentioned there was this feature that made it easy to distribute your podcast, and this touches on a question that actually asked Mike Mignano, the CEO of anchor what to ask you. And he's like, ask her about the story of how you made that actually possible to distribute the podcast to platforms, and it ended up being a very unscalable solution.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:30:00):\nOne of our principles from the very early days of Anchor was build things that don't scale, where we were like, we're a ridiculously tiny team. We're trying to do this really big thing. We had raised very little money, and so we were always just trying to figure out how can we hack into whatever growth we're trying to make happen. So when it turned out that people wanted to distribute their podcasts everywhere, it's gotten a little bit easier. But at the time, I'm sure you remember what podcast distribution was like, where it's like there's all of these different podcast platforms you have to manually distribute to all of them. Apple Podcasts in particular can be really difficult for people who aren't tech-savvy because there's this whole, you have to prove that you own your RSS feed, you have to know what an RSS feed is.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:30:44):\nYou have to sometimes deal with 301 redirects. There's just all this stuff that's deeply technical in a way that we were just like it doesn't need to be. And so one of the steps there was to submit your podcast to Apple Podcasts, you had to have an Apple ID, and there are a lot of people in the world who don't have iPhones, and so we're building for everybody. So we were like, how can we reduce that friction? We were obsessed with reducing friction, this was our constant battle. And so we had this idea, we hired a couple of college interns and we brought them in and we were like, people are going to push this magical one button in the Anchor app and they're going to say, I want to distribute my podcast, and your job is going to be to do all that same manual stuff manually, but to them it's going to feel magical and it happened automatically. I still don't know how many people know this.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:31:27):\nI think people think that we had some secret backdoor deal with Apple for distribution, but we just had college students making Apple podcast accounts and then submitting hundreds of thousands of podcasts through these accounts. And that resulted in lots of interesting technical and relationship situations. It was a really interesting thing, and eventually that didn't scale, eventually we stopped doing that, obviously, but I think that is such a cool example of the importance of how you're packaging what you're offering to people where if we had said you request distribution and we'll have one of our team members get back to you in three days and let you know when you're on Apple Podcasts, that doesn't feel very magical or it's really saving you any time. If all you see as a user is you're hitting a button and then 24 hours later you're somehow magically on Apple Podcasts, that was so much easier than manual distribution was at the time.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:32:20):\nAnd I think that was a really big part of why we got so much hosting market share so quickly because it was such an insane benefit over the other platforms which otherwise had been commoditized at that point. So, it's funny now to think back on that, but I think it's also related to we were so good at being willing to humor what seemed like stupid ideas and try them. And so that is something that I definitely recommend to product people is let yourself have the silly ideas we always talked about yes and when someone has an idea, how can you build on it and think about how it might work instead of saying, no, that can't work because, and so we had a number of those things where it was like nobody understood how we were doing things so differently, and it was just because we weren't afraid to do the silly unscalable thing for a while.\n\nLenny (00:33:08):\nI love that story. Touches on two things, one is I was just doing an interview around how to drive word to mouth growth and make that a big driver of your growth. And the main message there is just make something remarkable and knock people's socks off that they're just like, oh wow, this is crazy, I'm going to share it with my friend. And that's such a good example of that where everyone's like, wow, that was easy, I'm going to tell all my other friends that are launching podcasts. The other is, I wonder just how much of tech is built off of college interns, the beginnings of companies or how important college interns are to technology and innovation. It feels like there's always an intern story.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:33:42):\nYeah, I know. I think they must be. And for the record, we paid them very well, these were not unpaid interns, just to be clear. But no, I think it is amazing, and I think it was also such a cool opportunity. One of those interns actually is still a PM on my team today. She ended up converting a full-time after she graduated. And I remember I had a lot of cool college internships and it's such a cool way to get exposure to industries that you otherwise wouldn't get to. So I would definitely recommend that college kids start with, it's okay if your first job is like a repetitive, not very exciting thing. If you do a good job, it will lead to something very exciting maybe.\n\nLenny (00:34:15):\nI love that. Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team for Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn and Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn ads you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated two to 5x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms.\n\nLenny (00:35:14):\nAudiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply. So we've been talking about Anchor and I think what's really interesting about Anchor is it's one of the very rare success stories of an acquisition working out incredibly well. It was a small startup now powering two thirds of all new podcasts. It's pretty insane. So I want to spend a little time on just what worked in making that possible. So let me ask first around the integration piece, just how you integrated successfully, and then I want to talk about just operationalizing and making it continue running successfully.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:36:03):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (00:36:04):\nYeah. So on the first piece, just what did you do right to integrate Anchor into Spotify to make it effective and continue working?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:36:10):\nI think it's a combination of luck and hard work because Spotify is genuinely an amazing company. I mean, you've met now a bunch of people who I work with at Spotify, including my boss, Gustav. It's an incredible company. They're Swedish. So just their mindset about everything in the first place is amazing. But also, I have been so impressed that they are the type of company that can still move quickly and make really big strategic decisions and strategic shifts. It never feels like they're slowing down. And so I think our way of working worked with them. And then I think the other thing that we had to our benefit was they really saw the same vision that we had. So it was like they also wanted to change podcasting and make it more democratized and make it more two-way and bring it into the future.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:36:53):\nAnd it was so interesting because when we started talking to them, both of us had this chicken or egg marketplace problem where we had this critical mass of creators. They had a critical mass at that point of consumers, but if you don't have both on the same place, then you're still stuck with the limitations of RSS feeds. And so I think we were both coming at the acquisition with the same frustration just from two different angles. And so both of us really saw that benefit in joining up. And so I think one of the big ways we were lucky is that what I've seen happen in a lot of acquisitions is you have an idea of what you're getting acquired for and you get excited and really attached to that vision, and then when that vision doesn't end up fitting into the company strategy, there's nowhere else to go.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:37:34):\nAnd I think in a lot of ways Anchor did really well fit into Spotify's culture and their roadmap, but there were many things that changed around that initial vision. And I think we were really good at making sure that we stayed valuable to Spotify. That was one of our goals when we got acquired where we were like, we're tiny startup people, and we're like, we're not going to get lost in this big sea. When we came in, it was like we were very vocal about everything that we were doing, we did lots of internal marketing and made sure people were excited. We built a lot of really strong relationships. We made sure that every team at Spotify knew about us and what we were doing. We were constantly asking how we could help other teams. And when the strategy shifted, which it has dozens of times since we've gotten acquired almost five years ago, not like we just blindly followed, but we were always willing to get excited about whatever the next thing was and willing to be helpful and figure out how to make that work.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:38:30):\nAnd I think it actually goes back to the sticking to the mission in the first place where Spotify and we want podcasting to be able to be a huge business for the industry. We think it's been held back by a lot of things for a long time. And so we've had various hypotheses about how we can get there and we try things and if something doesn't work, we go onto the next thing. But that goal hasn't really changed.\n\nLenny (00:38:55):\nThat makes a lot of sense. And I love the idea of just staying excited about what is happening. I think a lot of founders join and they're like, \"Oh, it's so annoying to work in this big company.\" \"Oh man, we have this original plan, it's just not happening.\" And I think even if you're probably not, even if you're not excited, I think it's effective to communicate that you're excited and be on board and then shift things in what direction you think maybe needs to go instead.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:39:19):\nTotally, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:39:20):\nOkay. And then in terms of operating within Spotify, from what I understand, your team is still very startupy and there's this really fast moving mentality. What have you learned and how do you do that? How do you make that happen within a larger company?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:39:34):\nWe've definitely slowed down a little, I will say. I'm always joking about when we first got acquired, I remember we had to do this spreadsheet outlining our roadmap and estimate are things like small, extra large, whatever, and Spotify's definition of small with something like a quarter. And I was like, we've never built anything that took more than three months. And now it's like now we build lots of things to take more than three months. But the first thing that comes to mind, so when we were a startup, one of the first things we did when we were only a few people, we decided what our core values were going to be. And I think they maybe very trivially have changed over the years, but we essentially still have the same four core values that we decided on seven or eight years ago now. And when we got acquired, we had a conversation with our team where we said, we're going to of course embrace Spotify's culture and Spotify's core values, but we're not going to forget who we are as a team.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:40:28):\nAnd I think part of what really... And one of our core values by the way, is move fast. So that's something that's very deep within our DNA. But I think one of the things that helped with that is Daniel Eck, when we got acquired, came and talked to our team, which was so cool and so motivational. And one of the things he said to us was, we had a reputation at the time for moving very quickly, even compared to other startups. We were shipping a new feature every two weeks, it was insane. And Daniel said to us, not only do I want you to not move slower, that's part of why we're acquiring you so that you can move quickly. But he said, I also want you to help me teach the rest of Spotify how to move more quickly, and I found that so motivating.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:41:04):\nBecause I think I definitely had that feeling going from startup to larger organization where I had this fear that it was just going to be bureaucracy and things moving so slowly. And I really loved that. That was one of his goals was that he was like, I want to make sure Spotify also grew really quickly and he was trying to figure out how to help them keep moving as quickly as they used to. And so I think that's something that I really took to heart and that I've continued to remind my team of even to this day where I think of that as part of my job here to help people think about how we can move quickly and what really matters. And I think at any large organization, there's obviously a lot more complexities, there's a lot more stakeholders.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:41:42):\nSo to some extent it's necessary to slow down and be thoughtful. But I think the things that I always try to push people on is the unnecessary things that slow you down. So I think that's what we spend a lot of time on, both within our team and when we're collaborating with other teams at Spotify because we work with basically everyone at this point. So I think that was really cool that he gave us that mission when we joined.\n\nLenny (00:42:03):\nOn that note, is there anything that has been a real challenge or become really annoying? Just real talk about the flip side of that. Everyone's always like, \"Oh, it's all working out great.\" Is there anything you could share that's just like, \"Oh wow, that was really hard and we overcame it, or a real challenge that we didn't expect?\"\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:42:19):\nI think that the downside of Daniel's advice, so one of the things he said to us, he was literally say no to all the meetings. You're going to get invited to all these off sites and meetings and everyone's going to want to meet you guys and they're going to want you to come to all of these events and whatever. And he was like, just keep being Anchor. Just keep doing what you're doing for at least the next year. Don't worry about what Spotify's doing. And on the one hand, of course, we loved that as startup people we're like, cool, we're going to get to stay us within this larger organization. But the downside that we didn't really realize until a year later was that we weren't really able to build relationships. We had some culture problems where our team started to feel like because they weren't part of Spotify, they had some existential, they didn't feel attached to the work that we were doing.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:43:03):\nAnd so for a year we operated on our own. We moved really quickly, we were able to get a lot done, but then I think our next phase had to be really deeply incorporating into Spotify. And so we stopped calling our team Anchor internally, we started collaborating more with other teams. And I think that is the necessary trade-off is the more deeply you're embedded, the slower things are going to go. But I think that has been really amazing for making sure that our team actually felt like a part of the larger mission that Spotify was doing. And the one other thing I'll say that I found pretty striking. So, Spotify, as you know, did a lot of podcast acquisitions soon after the Anchor one. And so I got to know a lot of the other founders and early employees who have been acquired by Spotify and something that I've found with them and just with other acquired founders who I've talked to since, I don't know, I feel like people don't talk about this enough publicly.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:43:59):\nMaybe people are somewhere and I just haven't seen it. I think that people who get acquired, especially founders, actually go through a relatively deep depression and existential crisis after getting acquired. And I never would've thought, when you're talking to people about getting acquired, it sounds like such an obvious positive. Like you said, it's like this amazing positive exit and it was objectively so good for our team and for us and for our users, and I think for the industry. And I personally did not expect to go through that. Because I was like of course you want an exit, that's what you're working towards that whole time that you're a startup. And I've talked to a lot of these founders and I think it is a process I think that everyone has to go through because either you decide I'm going to stay here and I'm going to do this for a long time and I can make this work for me.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:44:44):\nOr you're like, I'm just a startup founder and this doesn't really work for me and I'm going to go do my next thing. And so I think to some extent some of the things we were talking about, I think do help shake out whether people actually want to make those investments and figure out how to make things work at a big company. But I think the other thing that I've found is just I think there isn't enough support for that transition. And I think that for me, I've definitely landed on the side of, I love working at Spotify. I now am so excited to be part of a large organization and building things at this scale, but I really would've loved to been able to talk to someone about it or understand that there were other people going through that kind of thing.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:45:25):\nSo I don't know if you want an example of how it's not all rainbows and sunshine, I definitely think there were some dark times there and I've since learned everyone goes through that just because I think just by definition, all the reasons that you start a company, that means your personality is someone who wants to be having that direct impact and having your own ownership and being able to make things move quickly, and that is just so different once you join a large organization.\n\nLenny (00:45:54):\nYeah, and those are amazing examples. I think what's interesting with startup life is eventually if things work out well, you'll either end up working for a larger company, that's a likely scenario if things tip go great or you're running a public company, which is also extremely painful and stressful.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:46:11):\nYes, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:46:12):\nYeah. So, the paths are hard no matter what you end up doing, as much as you love that startup time. I actually went through the same thing when we sold our company to Airbnb. I was just like, man, I had this life goal of starting a company and now I've done it and now what do I do? And it was just like, huh, okay, I guess I got to figure it out.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:46:29):\nRight? It's like, who am I? And I think the thing that I think for me, and it sounds similar to you, I think I didn't realize how much value I put in the actual day-to-day of survival that comes with being part of a startup. That becomes almost your reason for being is like, I got to make this work and I got to keep the team motivated. And you're just going, going, going, and then when everything is suddenly stable, you're like, wait, what is my job now?\n\nLenny (00:46:57):\nI saw a tweet actually recently, I forget who tweeted this, that CEOs that exit and go on vacation end up being more stressed and less healthy than running a really high stress, high growth company.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:47:08):\nThat is wild. I get it though.\n\nLenny (00:47:10):\nYeah. Although I will say when I joined Airbnb and was just the PM of our team working on one thing, it was like, this is really cool. I don't have to worry about everything all the time, there's a really nice relief to that. But yeah, there's a life existential question of just like, wow, we did the thing. What am I? What else? There's usually not a goal beyond that.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:47:31):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (00:47:32):\nWhat was it for you? Was it that, was it the feeling of I had this thing that I was running and now I don't?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:47:37):\nI think it was a little bit the fear of being like a cog in a wheel, which is not actually how I feel now that I work at Spotify. And I think the other was like we were doing great, we already were killing it at podcast hosting. And also it was just so fun. I really valued that small company, everyone knows each other. We're doing really hard work, but we're also having so much fun. And I think it felt like I couldn't translate that to a large organization where I was like, okay, now I have to do things how they do. And then I think what actually ended up happening is I actually love how Spotify runs their company and I'm still able to run my team the way that works for me. And so I think it just goes back to knowing what you care about, being really solidly attached to your own core values and being able to take that with you.\n\nLenny (00:48:25):\nI think we're both examples of people that were startup people and then realized it's not so bad working at a big company. I stayed at Airbnb for seven years. I was like, no, no way, I'm going to be here for more than a year and a half or a year or two. How long have you been at Spotify? At this point?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:48:37):\nI'm going on five years. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:48:41):\nNo, I think this is just a example of it's you think you're not going to enjoy working at a larger company, but oftentimes it's actually pretty great for a lot of different reasons.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:48:48):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:48:49):\nShifting in a slightly different direction, just thinking about leadership and what you've learned to lead teams, lead large orgs, build products, is there any just, I don't know, frameworks or tools that you found to be effective?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:49:05):\nThe big one for me is Radical Candor. And I know my team watching this is going to laugh at me because I talk about this every day. They're tired of hearing it, but have you read it?\n\nLenny (00:49:15):\nI have. I love it.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:49:17):\nYeah. It's my all time favorite book. And I think it really shifted for me, honestly how I relate to people in general. But I think especially with managing, giving feedback, being able to collaborate and push back in a direct way, direct and constructive way on peers and that sort of thing. So I make all of my managers on my team read it. We talk about it constantly in our team, and I think that the general concepts for anyone who's not familiar is you need to care personally and challenge directly. And if you're only doing one of those things, you're not giving feedback in an effective way. And the book just talks so much about the importance of feedback and how feedback is a gift, which I have now come to completely agree with. It's like anytime I've given someone effective feedback, it's always well received, even if it's tough to hear, people want to get better and they want to know how they can improve.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:50:07):\nAnd so I think anytime that you can give them specific feedback in a way that makes it clear that you care about them and want them to be able to reach their goals, I think it makes them stronger, it makes your relationship stronger. And I also think the one other big thing I took away from Radical Candor was when it comes to people not underperforming, it really reframed how I think about that because people are not generally inherently bad or lazy or ineffective, it's almost always because the role they're in is the wrong fit. And so being able to approach the conversation in that way means that you can come at it and in a caring way that lets them know you actually want them to be successful.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:50:47):\nAnd what I found is when you have the conversation in that way, they're much more receptive to it. And then you're able to either actually resolve the issues or you're able to help them figure out what the right fit is for them, which I think as a manager, it's so inspiring to me because that means that you get to keep mentoring them beyond. You're not just saying, this isn't working, I'm giving up on you, see you later. You're saying, I'm committed to helping you throughout your whole career and let's help you find the next step, even if that isn't on my team or at this company.\n\nLenny (00:51:16):\nAwesome. Yeah, I love that book. And you talked about the two. There's this grid that-\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:51:21):\nThe quadrants?\n\nLenny (00:51:22):\nYeah, it talks about. And just to reinforce what you just said, the core is that when you want to give people direct feedback, but you want to make it clear you care deeply about them. And I love that she talks about if you do one of these wrong, here's what happens. If you challenge directly, but it doesn't feel like you care deeply, you're just an asshole and they're just like, yeah, God, you get really defensive. I should get her on this podcast. How cool would that be?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:51:43):\nOh my God, that would be my, she's my... If I could meet one tech celebrity, it would be her.\n\nLenny (00:51:48):\nOkay. I'm going to work on it. If you're listening and you're Kim Scott, let me know, I will try to get to her. Anything else in that bucket of frameworks or tools, things that you find really helpful leadership?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:51:58):\nThe only other one, I'm not a huge framework person. I think this goes back to my gut thing, but the one other thing that I refer to often is I love the Eisenhower Matrix, which is also known as the four Ds. So it's do, defer, delegate, delete, you have also quadrants. Maybe my brain just works in quadrants. I don't know. But I totally subscribe to that and that's how I do everything, where I write everything down at the end of every day, I go through and I either do delegate, defer, delete, and it really helps you clear a lot of stuff out of your brain.\n\nLenny (00:52:27):\nInteresting. So you don't even use it as a grid necessarily, it's more make a decision on all the things on your plate?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:52:34):\nYeah, I do. I just tried using the grid view and it didn't work for me for some reason. So I just use a to-do list, and then I don't let myself finish working until I've gone through anything I didn't get through that day, and then I know what I have to do the next day.\n\nLenny (00:52:46):\nSo that touches on another area I wanted to touch on, which is productivity. I hear you're very good at being productive and making the use of your time. I guess one, where do you think that comes from? And then two, just any other tips, tactics, tools you find to be really effective in staying productive?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:53:01):\nYeah, where does that come from? I think I am OCD. I think I'm an overachiever. I don't know, it's really important to me. I think when my team says that I'm very productive, the feedback I hear from them is they're impressed that they send me a doc and then I always read it. I think that's more about prioritizing my team and making sure that they're unblocked, which I take very seriously. I don't know other tips that I would give people. I write everything down because I think I'm one of those people I remember things best when they're written down and then I obsessively put things on my to-do list. Anything that anyone asks me to do goes on there, and then I have that method for organizing it later in the day.\n\nLenny (00:53:38):\nDo you have an app for this or do you write it on paper?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:53:40):\nI use Todoist. I think you can use any, but it's the one that works best for me. I love using paper, but then if I don't have it with me, then I can't remember anything I have to do, so I've had to go digital.\n\nLenny (00:53:51):\nAwesome. So it sounds like a big part of your process is just getting things out of your head and writing it down somewhere.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:53:56):\nYes. I think that's huge. And I also think if you're in any sort of job, I think most PMs have this where it's so much of your job is actually deep thinking and problem solving. I just cannot get that done if I'm running through my to-do list in my head. So I think that was a big unlock for me when I realized that I just needed to, anytime I'm stressed, honestly, if I just sit and make a list of all the things I have to do, I'm like, oh, it's four things, I can get those done, it's okay.\n\nLenny (00:54:18):\nMan, that tool of just making a list when you're stressed about, all the things you got to do, just making a list of it on paper, I find it so helpful.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:54:27):\nIt works every time.\n\nLenny (00:54:28):\nHave you read Getting Things Done by David Allen?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:54:31):\nIt's on my list. I haven't read it.\n\nLenny (00:54:32):\nOkay. That book totally transformed how I think about productivity, and you already doing a lot of what he recommends. It's like this very old book. And now he's just, I don't know, he's a public speaker dude that just goes around consulting. But this one, it has very simple approaches to being productive and it really changed the way I operate. And you're already doing a lot of it, so I don't know how much value you get out of it.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:54:53):\nI'll read it. I love this stuff.\n\nLenny (00:54:55):\nA core concept is this idea of mind like water where you don't want to have anything in your head, you want to get it all out. And then there's these systems for how to process all the things you're getting out.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:55:04):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (00:55:05):\nMaybe we'll get David Allen this. We got a whole list.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:55:07):\nI know we have a whole hit list.\n\nLenny (00:55:10):\nMaybe it's just a final question. You're good at so many things, another thing you're really good at is public speaking. I was watching the last Spotify launch event and I was just like, holy moly, she's incredibly good at speaking and it's something I want to get better at and something I think a 100% of people want to get better at. So, I'm just curious, what have you learned about being an effective public speaker? Anything that you could recommend to people if they're trying to get better at this?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:55:32):\nWell, first of all, thank you for saying I'm awesome at so many things. This is my favorite podcast I've ever been on, you're just complimenting me the whole time, so I'll take it.\n\nLenny (00:55:39):\nTrue.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:55:41):\nI think with public speaking, for me, the first thing that I had to do was decide that I didn't hate public speaking because I think it's human nature. It makes sense that we do not want to be in front of a crowd and we don't want to be performing. And it's just an unnatural thing that humans, I think make ourselves do. I remember actually when I was in high school, I had to give a presentation and I had so much anxiety I couldn't sleep the night before. And I remember I was getting ready for school that morning and I was like, I'm just not going to hate public speaking. I just can't get through my life feeling this way. And so I just got up there and I had fun with it, and it felt so much better to not feel worried about it.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:56:18):\nSo I think ever since then I've been okay at it. And then I have gotten lots of opportunities to do big scary public speaking things for Spotify, and so I think I've had to get even better. I think my tips would be my biggest one is probably reframing. Everyone has this anxiety before they have to perform or they go on stage. Reframing that anxiety to understand that the thing your body is doing is surging you with adrenaline to help you. And so letting that feeling wash over you instead of fighting it, I think has been so effective for me because otherwise, it can feel like a panic attack. And so I think you have to be like, cool, my body's getting ready. We're excited, we're going to go do this on stage. That has been really helpful. I practice a million times anytime I have to do public speaking.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:57:03):\nSo I think everybody has different memorization tactics, different ways of doing speaker notes that work for them. And so I think part of it is you have to do a bunch of public speaking to see what works for you. So some people work best with no notes. I almost read complete sentences a good, I can enunciate things while I'm reading, so that works best for me. Some people like bullets and then they go a little bit off the script. But I think once you figure out what method of speaker notes works for you, I rehearse probably at least 10 times all the way through once the speaker notes are final. And you can practice your exact delivery. You can practice where you're going to put jokes in. You can figure out what doesn't feel natural or where you're going to trip it up, and then you can change the words that you're using.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:57:42):\nAnd so I like to get to the point where I can remember ad-lib at least half of the notes that I have in there, and that way I know I'm going to feel confident coming off script. I make a lot of eye contact with the audience, which I think makes them think that I'm not reading speaker notes. So I think that's really important. If you can stand it, which I can't, record yourself or watch yourself in a mirror, it messes me up more. But I think for a lot of people, that can be really helpful to figure out where your issues are. I think the biggest thing for me honestly, is that the unfair advantage I have is if you really give a shit about what you're talking about, you are going to be such a better presenter because people are going to be able to tell that you care.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:58:20):\nAnd so I think even at a larger Spotify event where it's like I'm reading off a teleprompter and I'm reading, I'm marketing, but I'm helping write those words and then the way that I'm saying them matters because I'm talking to podcasters and I'm like, my mission in life is to make things better for you, not everyone gets that benefit, I guess. Sometimes you have to do public speaking about things that you're not very passionate about, but I certainly think that helps. And I think leaning into that, so when you can, telling personal stories, letting the audience get to know you, I like to work some humor into my presentations. I think that can really help as well.\n\nLenny (00:58:55):\nThat is awesome advice. I especially love letting the stress wash over you, because most of has this challenge. Your body's just doing all this shit that's just going to stress the shit out of you. And so the idea of just embracing it, just flowing with it.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:59:10):\nYes, it's a superpower. It's like, that's so cool, that adrenaline works that way.\n\nLenny (00:59:14):\nYeah. Okay. I'm going to try that one.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:59:16):\nAlso, if you're nervous, you can put your hands above your head that'll help the blood, I don't know, it helps it go into your head or something. I don't remember.\n\nLenny (00:59:23):\nThere's this whole power post thing that apparently has-\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:59:26):\nYes, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:59:26):\nI think it's been disproven. People are like, no, there's no data that shows that. But the blood thing that's really interesting versus psychological benefits.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:59:34):\nI think there is a real physiological thing that happens.\n\nLenny (00:59:36):\nThat's cool. Okay. Amazing. Okay. Maybe as an actual last question, what's happening in the future of the Spotify podcasting platform? Anything you want to share about where things are going?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (00:59:45):\nA lot of the things that I talked about at Stream on for anyone who saw that this year, I think are still very much our strategy. So I think for us in general, Spotify is really focused on making sure that we can... We have a massive audience, we have more than 500 million monthly active listeners. We want to help podcast creators reach that global audience, and so it's really important to us. I always tell my team the biggest problem that I want to solve for podcasters is discovery and audience growth, and I really think we can be the ones to do it, so I'm really excited about that. So discovery, monetization. We're really focused on making sure that creators of all shapes and sizes can make a living off of their work.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:00:24):\nAnd then I think in general, we're working on so many cool things at Spotify to make podcasts a more interactive format, something that allows you to get to know your audience and connect with your fan base. We talked about a couple features this past year. I definitely can't say anything specific, but what I can say is there is lots of really cool stuff coming next year that I'm very excited about. And I would say for anyone who wants to learn more, definitely sign up for Spotify for podcasters. It works whether you're hosted with Spotify or not, and you can start to get a sense of some of those features that we're opening up to everybody, but there's lots more cool stuff to come.\n\nLenny (01:00:58):\nAmazing, mysterious, and exciting. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:01:05):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:01:06):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:01:09):\nChildren of Time, and I guess I would say It by Stephen King. I recommend a lot of Stephen King books, but that's my all time favorite.\n\nLenny (01:01:16):\nVery on brand with your podcasts. Makes sense. What is a recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:01:23):\nTV show, I'll just say, I guess Pokerface was the last one that really blew my mind. Movies, I mean, Barbie was so good, and then I'll just give you a lesser known one. I just watched this crazy movie from the '80s that was made the same year Home Alone was, this just got featured on a podcast, so I think everybody's talking about it now, but it's a horror movie about a kid who's home alone, and then he has to fight Santa Claus in a home invasion situation. It is so good, it has a bunch of different names, but if you look up either Game Over or it's like Code Père Noël or something, it's an old French horror movie, so good.\n\nLenny (01:01:59):\nInteresting that the other Home Alone is the one that did well in this one.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:02:02):\nWell, there was apparently a whole legal thing over it.\n\nLenny (01:02:05):\nOh, wow. They didn't have Macaulay Culkin. That's their missing piece. What is a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates when you're interviewing?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:02:14):\nI have one. It is, if you could make a podcast about anything, what would it be? And it is the best. Honestly, you should ask people that even if you don't work in work in podcasting, because it tells you so much about candidates, and one thing that I feel very strongly is that the most important thing is that you're hiring passionate people, not people who are passionate necessarily about the thing that you're doing, but about anything. If they can't think of anything, that's a red flag for me.\n\nLenny (01:02:33):\nThat's awesome. It's like a variation of the question of Teach me something or tell me about something that you've learned recently. Really interesting tweak on that question and very appropriate. What is a favorite product or something awesome you've discovered recently that you really like digital or physical?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:02:49):\nOkay. Very unsexy answer, but I love 1-800-CONTACTS.\n\nLenny (01:02:53):\nOkay.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:02:54):\nI'm so impressed with their product team. If you need new contacts, even if you need a new prescription, you can do the whole thing online in five minutes, and it's so well-thought-out and so thoughtful. I love them. And then the one other one I'll give a shout-out to, since becoming a parent, Love Every, do you subscribe to them?\n\nLenny (01:03:09):\nAbsolutely. I don't know anyone that doesn't have them.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:03:12):\nI know. It's so good.\n\nLenny (01:03:12):\nThey've cracked it.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:03:14):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:03:15):\nYeah. We are missing some of the toys, and so we're trying to find where they went because he's ready for the rattle.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:03:25):\nYes. Awesome.\n\nLenny (01:03:25):\nYeah. I love everybody's amazing and their ads are really great. Oh, man.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:03:27):\nYes. They're so good.\n\nLenny (01:03:29):\nWhat is a favorite life motto that you come back to often share with folks? Anything there?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:03:36):\n\"Only a fool wishes time away.\" Even if you're having a bad day, even if you're doing something boring or you're stressed, you have to do public speaking, that's still your life and you should enjoy it.\n\nLenny (01:03:47):\nI love that. There's this phrase of just like, I'm just killing time right now, and I always think about that, just like, oh, but you don't have that much time. Maybe you shouldn't try to kill yourself.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:03:57):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:03:58):\nEven though sometimes things are boring, it reminds me of another quote of just, \"Most of the world's problems are caused by our inability to sit in a room for 10 minutes quietly.\"\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:04:07):\nYes. Also, if you're bored, have a baby because you'll never be bored again.\n\nLenny (01:04:11):\nYeah. Yep, indeed. Speaking of parenting, what is a valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught you?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:04:18):\nMy mom always told me that my generosity would be rewarded, so anytime that I was nice or thought of someone else before me, she always made sure that I got some little reward or got to go out for ice cream or something, I think that really worked on me.\n\nLenny (01:04:34):\nI love that. Final question, I saw somewhere that you raised bait backyard chickens. Is that true?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:04:40):\nI'm so happy you asked about my chickens'.\n\nLenny (01:04:43):\nI love that reaction. So maybe just why did you decide to do that and any tips for someone that may want to explore it?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:04:48):\nOh my God. Well, we should have started with this because I can talk about this for an hour and a half, but I love my chickens. I have eight of them, we've got one rooster and seven hens. I think that all of us should be a little bit closer to nature, to the, I was going to say, the food that we're eating, I'm not going to eat my chickens, but they make eggs for me. But I just think there is something very lacking in our modern lives, that connection to nature. When I feel stressed at work and I go outside and I hang out with my chickens, I pet them, and I give them treats and we talk to each other. It's like nothing makes me happier and feel more grounded than hanging out with my chickens. So I think everyone should have chickens. I would say they're pretty low maintenance, so if you're thinking about it, I would recommend it. And if you get chickens, my favorite thing that I did for them, I got this monthly subscription box for chickens I think it's called Coop Crate.\n\nLenny (01:05:40):\nLove Every for Chickens.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:05:41):\nYes, it's Love Every for Chickens and every month they send me chicken treats, but also fun little things for crazy chicken people, so it's clothes or a sticker, something funny.I'm very into the whole chicken thing, so, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:05:55):\nOh my God. Maybe just a tactical question, how much space do you need in your yard for chickens?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:06:00):\nNot that much, so we let them free-range. We have a pretty big yard, but I think their actual, so there's their little coop, and then they've got a run that's fenced in. The run is maybe like, I don't know, five feet by eight feet or something, but you can go a lot smaller. If you go to Home Depot, they actually sell pre-made coops and runs. I think if you have a decent sized backyard, they'll be fine. I've known people with pretty small yards, and you just let your chickens out and they're happy and they'll find worms in a few yards.\n\nLenny (01:06:27):\nOh man. All right. A new project to look into.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:06:29):\nPlease get chickens, do it.\n\nLenny (01:06:31):\nOkay. Maya, we've talked about chickens, dogfooding, gut level decisions, Radical Candor, so many things. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:06:43):\nI'm on threads, I guess, and I'm on LinkedIn. I'm Maya Fish on most social media, and then I'm on LinkedIn, and then, what was the second one? How can people be useful to me?\n\nLenny (01:06:53):\nExactly.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:06:55):\nListen to your podcast on Spotify, and then send me your feedback. I would love to know either as a podcast creator or as a podcast listener. Always happy to hear what Spotify can be doing more of or better to help you out.\n\nLenny (01:07:06):\nAmazing. Maya, thank you so much for being here.\n\nMaya Prohovnik (01:07:08):\nThank you so much.\n\nLenny (01:07:09):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Unconventional product lessons from Binance, N26, Google, more | Mayur Kamat (CPO at N26)\n\n## Transcript\n\nMayur Kamat (00:00:00):\nMy, probably, most spectacular failure was, I was the first PM on Hangouts. We had thousands of people working for me. We had entire power of Google. We had Larry literally sitting with us saying we can do anything we want Chrome to do and we still didn't manage to build a great messaging product. The main learnings from that is, don't take on projects that are going to be six months, a year, because you just generally don't have control over the macro. The challenge with being a product manager is, everybody thinks they can do the job. Anybody who uses the product thinks they have ideas, so at some point in time, you're like, \"What is my discipline? What is my science?\" The moment you build experimentation, you've now made it scientific.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):\nA lot of new people in their career are like, \"Oh, I just want to think about strategy. I'm going to think about the big picture.\"\n\nMayur Kamat (00:00:45):\nStrategy is a little bit overrated for product. For most product managers, your strategy should be, \"How fast can I go from hypothesis to data?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):\nToday, my guest is Mayur Kamat. Mayur is Chief Product Officer at N26, one of the most successful fintech startups in the world and which, in my research, came in amongst the top five companies in the world who are hiring and producing the best product managers. Prior to N26, Mayur was Global Head of Product at Binance, VP of product at Agoda, which is over a $100 billion dollar company based in Thailand, and a PM at Google and Microsoft. In our wide-ranging conversation, Mayur shares what he's learned about hiring and developing great product managers, what he learned from his time working at Binance, which, as you'll soon hear, was one of the wildest and most unique ways of working, what he learned from the failure of Google's early attempts at Hangouts, where he was the first PM. Also, the pros and cons of working in Asia versus Europe versus the US, and why you should be starting your career on the West Coast of the US. Also, why comp early in your career does not matter and so much more.\n\n(00:01:47):\nThis episode is so full of golden nuggets and advice for product people throughout every stage of their career. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. Also, if you become an annual subscriber of my newsletter, you get a year free of a bunch of amazing products, including Superhuman, Notion, Linear Perplexity, Granola and more. Check it out at lennysnewsletter.com and click Bundle. With that, I bring you Mayur Kamat.\n\n(00:02:14):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand, so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom.\n\n(00:02:45):\nWorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth Zero and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workOS.com to learn more. That's workOS. com.\n\n(00:03:33):\nMany of you are building AI products, which is why I am very excited to chat with Brandon Foo, Founder and CEO of Paragon. Hey, Brandon.\n\nBrandon Foo (00:03:41):\nHey, Lenny. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):\nIntegrations have become a big deal for AI products. Why is that?\n\nBrandon Foo (00:03:48):\nIntegrations are mission-critical for AI for two reasons. First, AI products need contacts from their customer's business data such as Google Drive files, Slack messages or CRM records. Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:07):\nWhere does Paragon fit into all this?\n\nBrandon Foo (00:04:09):\nThese integrations are a pain to build. That's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months across every use case from rag data ingestion to agentic actions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:23):\nI know from firsthand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.\n\nBrandon Foo (00:04:27):\nExactly. We believe product teams should focus engineering efforts on competitive advantages, not integrations. That's why companies like You.com, AI21 and hundreds of others use Paragon to accelerate their integration strategy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):\nIf you want to avoid wasting months of engineering on integrations that your customers need, check out Paragon at useparagon.com/Lenny.\n\n(00:04:49):\nMayur, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:04:56):\nThank you. This is super exciting. Thank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:00):\nI want to start with your time at Binance. You've worked at Google, you worked at Microsoft, you worked at a company called Agoda. Now, you're at N26. I imagine Binance was the most unique place that you've worked at, and I've also never heard much about what it's like to work at a company like Binance. I was just looking them up on Wikipedia. I saw they started in China, they moved to Japan, they moved to Malta. Now, they have no official headquarters. What was it just like working at Binance? How was it most unique from other places you've worked?\n\nMayur Kamat (00:05:31):\nYeah. Maybe just a background for Binance, because I think a lot of people have heard it, some in positive connotations, some not so much. The scale of Binance is pretty mind-boggling. Just to give the history, they started in 2017 as a crypto exchange, when there were other crypto exchange on the market for years, like Coinbase. Within six months, they became number one. That's unprecedented. That's like launching a search engine today, and then, six months later, beating Google. Then they went within five years to at a peak valuation of somewhere like $400 billion or so with 2000 employees. That's zero to $400 billion in five years. It's at a scale that's never been done before. Google couldn't do it, Facebook, none of the names that you hear. It's remarkable. When I was there as the head of product, my top line KPI was the trading volume, and my monthly KPI was in trillions of dollars.\n\n(00:06:35):\nJust the scale was mind-boggling. We had teams of 10, 20 people running multi-billion dollar profit businesses. That brings in with it, first, how did they do that to that scale, and two, what kind of culture requires to keep that running? Both are very fascinating. I think we could spend a lot of time talking about it, but the truly interesting thing, the first one is, you can't do this by having a traditional log structure. CZ, the founder and CEO at one point had 55 direct reports, and his direct reports had about the similar ones. For a large portion of the history of the company, there was just one level between the individual employees and the CEO. That leads to an extreme level of decision-making and execution. You cannot have one-on-ones when you have 55 direct reports, so there's a culture of one-to-many and doing that as often as possible.\n\n(00:07:33):\nThe leadership team, for example, met every day, and because the leadership team was spread across the world, we met at 11:00 PM when I was in Singapore every day. That includes the weekends, holidays. The leadership team was there, 11:00 PM every single day, which meant that none of the decisions were blocked for more than 24 hours. Most of them, we made it on chat even within those 24 hours, but if there was something big, it was escalated, decided. We executed largely based on this concept that I now take with me. I call it running products via daily meeting. We would pick a owner for something really urgent at the nightly leadership call. Then that owner would be expected to have all hands on deck for however long that problem is every single day and then report the updates on the daily call. Some of these were really massive topics, like how do we get 15 financial licenses in 15 countries in the next three months? It wouldn't be at a scale that was-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:43):\nYou've got 24 hours.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:08:45):\nYes, and people did it. It's extremely interesting to see that when you have really smart people, you give them really hard problems, you have no constraints on what can you need to solve them, whether it's money, people, except time. Time is always at a premium. People can move mountains in a small amount of time. That extreme ownership culture, I think, probably was the most fascinating part of working at Binance that I've now tried to take. There's some good parts of it in terms of attention to detail, being able to pick certain areas and own it, irrespective of what your title is and how many people report to you. There are certain downsides in terms of the amount of randomization that it can cost teams, especially if it's not super well-thought through. I'm trying to see what are the great parts of that that I can bring to different roles, but that concept of daily meeting, if there's something super urgent, how can you own it directly and run it yourself, where you are in the details so your team knows that they need to be in the details, and then be able to execute that. That's probably the most fascinating. There's several war stories. I was there for two years and the amount of interesting stories that happened during that time is a lot, but then, maybe I can follow up later if you have specific questions there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:13):\nI would love to hear a war story. This is definitely as interesting as I was expecting it to be. Just what I'm hearing so far is just things that worked well for them to operate at this insane pace and scale is the entire leadership team meeting every single day, 11:00 PM your time. Hopefully, at better times for other folks around the world.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:10:31):\nThere's some people in Sydney, Australia, so it was 1:00 AM for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):\nGood grief. This idea of a flat structure, yeah, it's interesting, because I imagine that's not necessarily great for other reasons and then this idea of being in the details. Let me ask about that, actually. What does that actually look like? I think a lot of people, a lot of leaders are like, \"Oh, yeah. I'm in the details, we should be in the details.\" What does that actually look like in real life at Binance?\n\nMayur Kamat (00:10:55):\nLet me give an example. One of the areas, when I joined, one of the biggest product problem we had was, crypto before was fairly unregulated, so you could just sign up with an email address or even just a wallet and start trading. There was almost zero friction. Then it suddenly became regulated, where you would almost have a full KYC flow like a bank. That just meant that the conversion rate dropped from, let's say, 100% to 2%. Now we had to solve this problem. This was the daily meeting level problem. It's okay if you're operating in one country. You can do it easily. If you're operating in 200 countries where there's not even a standard for what a document acceptance criteria might look like, now you have a significantly larger problem. You cannot say, \"Let's work with the KYC vendor and do the onboarding.\"\n\n(00:11:49):\nWe had to, literally have this, the top 50 countries, the top 10 document types, this spreadsheet of basically 500 cells, the conversion rate at each level. Then we are looking at, okay, a passport in Kazakhstan has very low level of conversion. What can we do about that? Do we need a new vendor? Do we need better imaging technology? Do we need a new SDK from a vendor? Then we go cell by cell based on, let's say if I was running a typical product team, I would say, okay, let's just look at maybe the top 90 percentile of our users, but this was Binance and then CZ is like, \"No user left behind. Even that one user in Congo is important because this is financial inclusion for them.\" Then all of those 500 sales matter, no matter how low their impact to the conversion rate is.\n\n(00:12:45):\nThat's a little bit of Binance flavor there. It's extreme customer focus and it doesn't really matter. Customers are not a number. It's a person at the end of the screen and we care about them, so you would need to know, you would get questions like, why is the driver's license acceptance rate in Kenya falling suddenly? When you have, and that's just one piece of the problem in a large product with 80 different products. You, of course, cannot do it for every single product, but the concept of, what is the most leveraged decision you could be working on right now? If it is for your growth, it's the onboarding, then you'd better know exact every single screen of the flow, why is there a drop-off and what are your teams doing for it? That level of detail, and you just do it on different products at different parts of your journey.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:43):\nI imagine there's people listening where they're like, there's the team responsible for the onboarding flow and the KYC flow of their product and it's so hard. They're like, oh, there's all these problems with our flow. Imagine that for 100 different versions of the flow across 100 different countries. Good God.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:14:01):\nAnd documents. It gets very tricky. It gets very tricky, but we also had resources. At one point in time we said, we had a team of 20 people working on KYC and we said, \"For the next three months, we want 500.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:16):\nWhich has its own downsides, too.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:14:18):\nHas its downside, but if you're running in this extreme mode and you're less, not as worried about just the team's stress and personal development aspects of it, you're just purely looking at the execution of the product, there's a surprising amount of power that comes with it. This was probably the second time in my career where I had that, wow, you can do this because in other companies it would take years to do it. The first one was, this is going back at Google. I remember I joined Google. It was my first day at onboarding and I was the product manager for Gmail for mobile, for sync. I was in my onboarding meeting when they pulled me out and said, \"Hey, we have an issue. The service is down and Wall Street Journal is writing an article that Google, Microsoft, Apple not working together causing the service to go down, so we need you in this war room right now.\"\n\n(00:15:17):\nIt was a bug in iOS 4. This is a long time ago, which caused every single user to pull their entire Gmail inbox, re-sync the whole inbox. A bug on the Apple side is going to take two, three weeks to fix, and it was causing 1000x load to our servers. I remember Connie Wurz, who was the Head of Infrastructure at Google, and he's like, \"Sure.\" He flipped a button and there were 1000x servers that showed up for the next two weeks. I was like, \"Wow, that is scale,\" right? This was my second time feeling that wow moment where like, oh, we just put 500 people in and solve the problem. It's less about having the 500 people and being able to maneuver them that quickly. I don't think I've been able to do that at any other company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:06):\nTo close the loop on some of these radical ways of working, this idea of 50 reports per person and this idea of caring about a person in Congo not being able to sign up, do you think that's a good idea? Do you take those in the way you work now or is it just, in this particular situation it's important? Other places, maybe not.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:16:26):\nThere are several preconditions. One is you're growing really fast. The growth for the employees comes just from seeing problems at scale that are growing every day that it needs less of a manager's attention to figure out what you need to grow. The best way to grow in general is that you work at a very fast-growing company. If that's true, two, your people are extremely well compensated, so they care about the KPIs more than they care about what's the next stage in my career and how do I get promoted? Our bonus structure went from 0% to 500%, so a lot of people didn't really care getting a 10%, 20% pay. They just want to do incredible work because they know they would be taken care of. Three, it's a mission driven company, still believe at the end of the day that you're doing this just beyond the KPI.\n\n(00:17:24):\nAt Binance, there was a very strong belief that 80% of the world doesn't have access to financial tools. They don't even have an access to currency that they can trust. When we look at, live in Europe or in US and we think about crypto, it's largely about speculation or bitcoin. For most of the world, they just need access to a US dollar, stable coin and just knowing that my currency is not getting deinflated because of things beyond my control. Everyone having come from these, a lot of our employees were across all these countries, they had a very strong mission belief that what we are doing will truly empower billions of people. There's a power in that. A lot of people go through, \"Hey, I'm going to move mountains because it's not just about the money, it's just not about my career. It's about doing something that will change the world.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:19):\nLet's follow this thread on accelerating your career, and talk about where you're at today, N26. As you know, I've been doing a bunch of research on which companies hire and produce the best product managers. I've done a couple passes at this, and N26 has come up in the top five of both ways of approaching this, essentially which companies alumnis go on to do the best in their career. N26 is way up there. I want to come at this from a couple directions. One is what N26 as a company does to hire and incubate the best people, but also just you personally, what your advice is to people and how you help them become great PMs. Let's actually start in that second bucket. What is the most common and most impactful career advice that you share with product managers that you manage, that you find most helps them move ahead in their career and get unstuck in their career?\n\nMayur Kamat (00:19:12):\nI think the number one thing I shared before, the best thing you can do is find companies that are growing fast because it compounds your learning at a much faster interval. Just the basic compound interest formula, even if your interest rate is low, if you're compounding daily versus compounding yearly, after two years, you will be at a whole different stage at the end point. Companies that are growing fast just lets you get that learning much, much quicker. I remember joining Microsoft first in my career. Some of the products I worked on during my internship had not shipped till I left Microsoft three, four years later. That's a very, very low rate of compounding. Microsoft's a whole different company now 20 years later, thankfully. Then you contrast that something like Binance where every day or every hour, every minute you're shipping something and then learning from it.\n\n(00:20:04):\nThe faster you can compound your learning, the faster you will grow. The second piece generally is, you need to optimize for what you're great at. Now having two kids, I'm fairly in the fact that your strengths get defined very, very early, right? I'm looking at my nine-year-old and twelve-year-old, and they have a whole different set of strengths. If you're 25 years old early in your career, it's very hard at that point to say, \"Oh, here are all my weaknesses and I need to improve on those.\" A lot of the career feedback typically tends to be around, \"Hey, here are the things you need to be better at. Why don't you do more of that stuff, right?\" Formally in the camp that you need to know what you're great at, what are your superpowers, and you need to find jobs where success is determined by how much of that superpowers you get to use.\n\n(00:20:58):\nEarly in your career, you can't get away with the fact that there's some stuff you're not going to be great at and you just have to manage around it. If you get higher up in your career, then it gets easier because you can build a team that complements your strengths, but again, if you're early in your career, find places that, if you're a great creative person, if you can look at a product and think of 100 things you can do better, you are always about what's the next best thing and how quickly can I implement it, you need to be working in teams that have a high experimentation culture. You need to be working in growth teams in large companies. If you work in a FinTech company on a compliance side project or launching a new business vertical, you're going to struggle, right?\n\n(00:21:46):\nOn the same time, if you have extreme management structured thinking, you have great stakeholder management, you have high EQ, you should work in teams where there is a large amount of complex people management and process management. You would struggle in a growth team where the expectation is you're doing things really quickly. I would look at first very introspectively, what are my true strengths? What do I, and then look at jobs where that has a much higher profile of winning. Thirdly, largely I would say do not optimize for compensation, especially early in your career. If you're truly on a track to become an executive someday or found your own company and make it successful, you will find that the compensation is so much backloaded that you would make 90% of your compensation in the last five years of your career, so optimizing for 10%, 20% early in your career.\n\n(00:22:48):\nIf you have two jobs, I would rank in your first 15 years of your career, I would say do not look at the compensation. Then the last one, this was strange. I never thought about this longer, but now I think this is probably the most interesting advice I can give people is determine very early in your career if you truly want to be a C-level someday, you want to be an executive someday, because it's almost like if you're ambitious and successful, you enter product management. You are in top of your, it's almost an expectation of you that you would become that and you'd never really challenge or question yourself, is this the thing that needs me, that I need to do to get there? Is there something I'm going to truly enjoy? Not just the destination but the process to get there.\n\n(00:23:38):\nA lot of people think that and they make suboptimal decisions based on that. There's incredible careers you can build and incredible lives that you can live by just being great at what you do, doing more of that stuff. You end your career maybe as a director, maybe as a group product manager, but throughout the stuff, you have built a holistic life that doesn't revolve around your work and gives incredible meaning to you, or you can be saying, you know what? Work is a huge part of my identity. Somebody asks me what wakes me up in the morning and what gives me that energy? It's my work. I can't separate my identity from your work. Then maybe you should pursue that C-level path because it'll truly be fulfilling and you would be able to make those challenges and sacrifices that are going to be asked of you to make that.\n\n(00:24:30):\nIf you can calibrate that early and have that true conversation with yourself like, \"Yes, I want to go down that path and I want to do,\" you would make different career choices. In that path, I would definitely say don't look at compensation. There are two jobs. Look at the three things. Is it going to give me high compounding of learning? Is it high overlap with my strengths, and am I going to have a lot of fun doing it? If you have fun doing it, then it becomes a virtuous cycle and you do more of it and you're great at it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:59):\nOn the question of decide if you want to be a CPO, essentially-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):\nDo you want... Decide if you want to be a CPO essentially, is the, the implication there is, if you do, that's a big sacrifice, you're going to be stressed. Work-life balance is worse. Is that kind of the core question?\n\nMayur Kamat (00:25:00):\nNo, no, no, absolutely not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):\nOkay.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:25:00):\nAbsolutely not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):\nOkay.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:25:16):\nIt's like, if you truly enjoy your work and what you're doing, it won't feel like a sacrifice. When you're constantly, when you look at a new product, you're walking down the street, you see a new product, you're on the app store, you see a new product, and you're like, \"Oh, this is cool. Oh, look how they're doing the onboarding. Oh, look how the app store entry looks.\" If that truly fills you up, it fills your cup, every moment you're looking at why things can be better, how you can be better, how a certain thing... You would, the sacrifice will not feel like sacrifices. It'll not feel like you're working long hours. You'll not feel, hey, when you're talking to PMs and giving them some guidances, when you're building things, when you're recruiting new people, all that stuff, it fills your cup, it doesn't drain it. Then you would have incredible fun on the journey. So, it's less about that your sacrifices or work-life balance.\n\n(00:26:10):\nThe moment you start having those conversations, you are probably not on that track. You should not be on that track because the moment the word work-life balance comes, I think Jeff Bezos has this thing that he hates the word because it means there are opposite things that need to be balanced, right? It needs to be work-life awesomeness or something like that, where every moment is awesome whether you're working or you're living. But for some people, that comes naturally because that's how they're wired. And those people should absolutely pursue it because it would be incredibly fulfilling, and the things that are challenging would also feel not as onerous. Whereas for everything else, it would feel like a sacrifice, could feel like something you need to balance. And then you would, again, even if you're great at it, you're not going to have fun doing it, and at some point you will not be great at it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:01):\nFor folks that are PMs today, there's almost an implication their career is heading towards CPO eventually. That's kind of the ladder they're on. What are the, say, top three most common other options you've seen, other paths you've seen of folks that you manage, so that people can think about, \"Okay, I don't need to maybe just keep climbing this ladder. There's these other directions I can go.\"\n\nMayur Kamat (00:27:23):\nI mean the number one, and that's I think back to your original question on N26, if you work in incredibly high growth companies, especially FinTech where there's a higher, people end up being founders because it's probably a whole different kind of track we can go down on, the founding your own company is probably the most kind of obvious/exciting alternate path. The only thing I ask there is, again, the same question, what you're good at and what you love doing. The challenges with founding a company is a large portion of running a company has nothing to do with building a great product, especially as the company gets bigger. I've worked for founders now for 17 of my 20-year career, right. So, even at Google and stuff, Nikhil was my boss at Google, used to be a founder, and the CEOs now, the thing they tell me when they hire me is, \"I wish I had your job,\" because that's what I used to do. That's what I have loved doing, and now I spend 90% of my time doing stuff that is not the stuff that I truly enjoy.\n\n(00:28:37):\nBut folks enjoy building stuff as a PM, there's a lot of things you don't have control over, and you feel like, \"Hey, that's stopping me from growing. That's what's topping me from truly enjoying.\" Founding is a great path. You have that control now, you own the decision-making. There's rarely times you can say, \"Hey, this did not work because of that person.\" Right? If you're constantly hitting that, then founding is a great path for you because then you have the ball control for better or worse.\n\n(00:29:08):\nThe other is just, I mean, it's less about being a CPO and just growing your breadth and your depth instead of just the ladder, right? So you are incredibly, either getting specialized in a specific domain where there is now enough value for you to separate yourself from the pack, whether it's, like in FinTech, now we have folks who are onboarding experts with KYC. We have people who are fraud experts, [inaudible 00:29:37] who have really great understanding of how card schemes work and how MasterCards work and where can we get the right incentives for the user. The folks who are experts on customer loyalty and retention. You build that domain expertise and then you realize that everyone needs that, right? And that could be an incredible way to specialize. So, you may lead growth at certain team even though you're not a CPO, right? So, that's kind of the second way of doing it.\n\n(00:30:05):\nAnd the third one, again, just not to knock it out, is you realize that work is not going to be my big part of my identity. My identity is, who am I as a parent? Who am I as a community member? Who am I as a son to my parents? Who am I as an artist or a contributor? And that's what my death is going to be, a well-rounded person. And a job is great, I'm great at it, but I'm going to do it as much as it's needed. And the value and meaning, the top part of the Maslow's pyramid comes from everything but work. And then< you just lead kind of a balanced life because then work is a certain portion of it and the rest kind of fills the picture.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:51):\nSo, just to summarize these four really good pieces of advice for how to essentially keep your career going and get unstuck and accelerated, is work at companies that are really high growth because your learnings will compound, and also the network you build, you didn't even mention that, that becomes really valuable because especially if the company does well, sometimes companies grow really well and there's extra benefits there, but even if they aren't, you still earn a lot.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:31:16):\nAbsolutely. Well, let's say N26, one of the reasons why they have so many founders is the fact that it was a category defining, like we were the first kind of mobile bank, right? So, a lot of the problems we saw in early days, nobody else saw them, right? So, every product manager had to solve it for the very first time in history. And that kind of is a whole different level of kind of trial by fire. Same thing with [inaudible 00:31:44]. They both started about the same time. Those are the companies that show up in the top rankings because you did this before anybody could do it, and you learn by literally moving mountains. I think two is also the fact that you see, we have this whole PayPal mafia. When you see this early success, everyone sees it together. So, when they go, they have that network, as you said, built-in.\n\n(00:32:10):\nThese are, maybe it's a product manager who starts a company, but maybe there is a business development manager who has also started this company and now you can collaborate and have partnerships. So, that success, a mutual success, which a lot of early startup see, that creates kind of a more denser network than you working at a large company where not all of you see the success at the same time. And 3Ls comes down to the founders as well. They're incredibly mission-driven founders. I always find it super admiring now when I look back at Valentine and Max here at N26, or I look at CZ. They have reached from a whatever metric you can define of success, whether it's the size of the company, whether it's the personal network, beyond whatever anybody would think success means, right? And then, to wake up every day and to do this hours and hours single day, every single day, you are driven by a whole.\n\n(00:33:14):\nThese are the voyagers of, these are the folks who would go explore new planets in the future or the folks who sailed out on the seas in 1600s to discover new land. That being access to these people directly is extremely, extremely empowering. You not just learn from it, but you get inspired by it. If you have an X definition of success, now your definition of success is 10x, you automatically push the boundaries more. So, I think those two things are, or those three things, early start, category defining companies, mutual success and creation of dense networks, and just being inspired by incredibly, incredibly successful and talented people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:59):\nYou pointed out this really interesting insight that I forgot to mention with the list of companies that seem to hire and create the strongest PMs. There's a lot of FinTech representation there, and I think you touched on why that might be the case because all these problems are extremely complicated and never been solved and they're solving at scale.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:34:17):\nHere's the thing about FinTech, which is probably the most interesting is, FinTech, you have two customers. You have your usual customers and you have your regulator, and you need to keep both of them happy. And usually, what makes one happy, it makes the other one less happy, right? So, you are constantly dealing with trade-offs. In most PMs, in most companies you have some trade-offs, but they're not existential. Whereas in FinTech, every trade-off is existential. When you found a company, every trade-off is existential. You may not exist as a business if you make a wrong decision. In FinTech, a lot of the PMs see that day in day out, and that probably kind of conditions them to a whole different level of juggling balls than you would be a PM at other company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:00):\nYeah, that's such a good point. Just really good stakeholder management influence dealing with all these trade-offs. I think that's a really good point. I'm going to come back to the strength stuff because that's really important and I've been meaning to come back to it. So, just to reflect back, the four things you pointed out are really what you want to look for to accelerate your career. Companies that are growing really fast, working on things that you're good at, and finding a role that leverages your strengths versus things that you're not good at. Not optimizing for comp really is such a good point there. Your point essentially is you'll make most of your comp later, probably the 50%. The second half of your career, you probably make, I don't know, 10 times more than you make the first part of your career.\n\n(00:35:37):\nAnd so, optimize for the future cop, not today's comp. And then this idea of making sure, ask yourself, do you want to be CPO? Do you want to go down the C-suite route or do you want to maybe probably plan to start a company, something else? And that informs the role you're in. Coming back to the strength stuff, how do people figure out their strengths? Do you have any advice for someone sitting around, they're like, \"What am I actually good at? I don't know.\"\n\nMayur Kamat (00:36:00):\nSo, there's several ways to do it. I remember I read this book, this was, I don't think it shaped my understanding of it because I was already operating in that mode, but it used to be called Now Discover Your Strengths. I think now it's called Strength Finder 2.0. It's still 20 years old now, but there's a lot more newer ways to do it. There are two things I have done and they're both kind of, I'm not sure how accessible they are, but I'll give you the examples. So, at a Agoda, we used to pay a psychologist $5,000 for every single PM we interview, right? So, after you finish your PM rounds, we would send you to this psych assessment. It would be a six-hour psych assessment and they would tell me what your strengths are, not just that it would be an IQ component.\n\n(00:36:51):\nSo, we would know what percentile you are, and not just like an IQ score like Einstein or not, but IQ score across different, across pattern recognition or structured thinking, across numerical ability, verbal ability, right? So, a lot of people say they hire the smartest people. At Agoda, we literally hired the smartest people because we paid the psychologist a lot of money to tell whether they're smart or not. But other than that, they also give you your strengths and weaknesses. It used to be called, I know the company still around, it's called Q4, and it's called Q4 because they had this four quadrants on two axes, one is on dominance and one is on warmth, right? So, you want people who are high dominance, high warmth in the 4 quadrant, and that as you can realize, if you also want smart people, to find those who land in that quadrant is literally looking through a needle through a haystack.\n\n(00:37:43):\nBut when I, I almost didn't do it. I was like, this is like I've been doing products for 15 years, this is insulting that I need to go do a six hour... The only reason I did it at that time was my son was four and a half years old and I was teaching him, because you're going to go to kindergarten, I was starting do some math with him, and then in six months he knew all the math that I knew. He was solving quadratic equations and stuff. And we thought, oh, we have a genius in the house. We got to get him tested. So, we were testing him, and that's the only reason I took this test because I thought it would be interesting to understand what this process looks like. But then when I got the results, I was like, it was so spot on.\n\n(00:38:26):\nIt was incredibly spot on in saying areas where I would do well, areas where I would struggle and need help. So, that's one way to do it. It's super extreme. A little bit a year, two years ago, we had the [inaudible 00:38:40]. CZ is good friends with Ray Dalio. So, we had Ray Dalio come to our executive offsite, and he walked us through how he and his company does strengths assessment. So he has a, that one is lot more accessible. I think it costs like $50. You can go to, I think you search for Ray Dalio's strengths, there's a website that you can go and... The way it works, slightly differently for executives because you do it, so those are your components, tells you how good you think you are, and then it has your leadership team vote you on certain different aspects. So, there's a two layer assessment, how good you think you are and how good everybody else think you are.\n\n(00:39:19):\nAnd then, the overlap is where your true strengths are. And as a CEO, I can say, \"Oh, Mayur is great at design. Everybody else knows that Mayur is great at design. We should give design problems to Mayur.\" Right? So, that's another way of kind of... So, there's a scientific way of doing this and it's gotten a lot better since I read that book long time ago. Again, if you're truly, truly curious, it doesn't take that long and now it's a lot more accessible. That's one way to do it. And it kind of separates in terms of execution, in terms of structured thinking, innovation and design, creativity, stakeholder management, EQ. You get a little bit of a more scientific picture on what your strengths are. But this is also a simpler way.\n\n(00:40:06):\nAs a PM, you do pretty much a large portion. Everybody does the same few things, right? You think you're designing the roadmap, you are coming up with what you think is the product strategy. There's a lot of time around just managing engineers, making sure they do stuff. There's stakeholder management, marketing, compliance, whatever. There's launch and just tracking data analytics. So, this part is true for most PMs. Some jobs require more of one versus the other. And you just know when you do these things, which ones one you're truly great at and you have a lot of fun doing, right? Maybe you just don't like Jira and the ticket tracking and just following people on that, and that's the worst part of your job. Stay away from more structured complex stakeholder management jobs. Or you find that, hey, you do really well at that and somebody ask you, \"Hey, what are the 15 things we're going to do next week to improve a conversion?\"\n\n(00:41:06):\nThat's where you kind of have a hard time, you just sit down, spend hours thinking about it, then maybe that's not your strength. And so over time, you kind of build this self calibration on areas that you have fun doing and areas where you don't have. And then, when you look at the next job, just try and gauge, are they hiring me because I did really well at some of the stuff that I didn't love doing? And if that's what they're hiring you for, probably you're not going to have a lot of fun or high acceleration if you go there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:41):\nThere's so much there. There's I think an important point that I'll add, and I'm curious if you agree. A lot of new people or new people in their career, like, \"Oh, I just want to think about strategy. I'm going to think about the big picture. I don't want to just sit there and optimize the roadmap and be in Jira.\" But it's actually, that's your job when you're just starting out. You need to earn the right to contribute to the vision, to the strategy.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:42:04):\nThere's one of the, and as a pre-conversation we talk about contrary and view, product strategy by definition seems like a... This is going to be controversial.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:16):\nGreat.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:42:17):\nNot really... Those two words feel very at odds with each other for me. A product, you have hypotheses and if you can test it, you don't need a strategy. Right? If I say, \"Hey, if I build this and I know this will add this much users and this time with this conversion rate, this customer acquisition cost and this LTV,\" that's your hypothesis and you could test it in the market very quickly. And if it works, you have your strategy. Keep doing more of it. Strategy is always keep doing more of it or don't do it, right? That's all that is to strategy. The key part is just figuring out which one goes in which bucket. And if you're really executing fast enough in a kind of structured, experimentation-driven manner, your strategy becomes a largely solved problem. So, for most, and that's a challenge.\n\n(00:43:14):\nA lot of people think strategy is about looking at Porter's [inaudible 00:43:18] forces, a lot of slides, we're looking at some data and slicing it and saying, \"We need to go here or there.\" All of it is largely in some sort of package intuition. And the challenge with that is, usually you go with the loudest voice in the room. And if you're a junior in your career, it's a very frustrating exercise because you think you know the strategy better. But it's all it is. It's a sense of package intuition, and then the guy with the loudest, biggest title or the loudest voice is going to go do it. It was very early in my career, Jonathan Rosenberg, he was the head of, he was the CPO at Google.\n\n(00:43:59):\nAll the PMs reported to him. He was not called the CPO back then. And he had this one thing he would say all the time that, \"Come to me with data. If you come to me with ideas, we'll go with mine.\" Right? That was the saying. You can come with any ideas, we're just going to do what I think, but unless you come with strong sense of proof to override me. So again, strategy is a little bit overrated for product. For market expansions, for investments, for licenses, compliance, there's several areas where it makes sense and it's kind of useful. But for most product managers, your strategy should be, how fast can I go from hypothesis to data, right? The faster you can go there, the easier your strategy gets.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:48):\nThat is certainly a hot take. So the idea here, I'm curious how you operationalize this with folks at N26. Is it just like, \"I don't need to see a whole strategy for the year. Just give me, here's the plan, here's what we're going to test, here's our hypothesis?\" Are you actually, what do you tell your PM team?\n\nMayur Kamat (00:45:05):\nWe use this tool. I'm going to give a shout-out to Statsig because they're awesome. Vijay used to run the experimentation at Facebook and has this tool. There's several of those. But if you're running proper experiments, I just look at the Statsig dashboards, right? And I'm looking at experiments, I'm looking at what metrics they're moving, I'm looking at the P-value, I'm looking at how quickly can they get to statistical significance. And I'm like, \"Oh, this is working. Let's do more of these.\" Right? So, now there's some areas where you can't do it, like in compliance, in legal aspects, in Europe, especially pricing. In US, you can run pricing tests. In Europe, it's a little bit different. So, those areas, you would need to have a lot more kind of deeper thinking, understanding of your cohorts. You're coming up with more structured reason for why you should do it, but you can't really test and know within a couple of days or a couple of weeks at max whether this was a good idea or not.\n\n(00:46:10):\nThose, if there are either irreversible decisions or they're just extremely time-consuming to find out, then do some pre-work. We look at largely, find a lot of companies that really look at data without looking at cohorts that make completely bad decisions, right, because if you look at your dashboard as a mixture of users over 10 years, 20 years, even six months, and they all behave differently. If you look at a cohort level development of certain users, you generally end up making better decisions. But even over there, it's still lot more, there's a lot of noise between the moment you start tracking it than moment you start making decisions based on it. The world has changed in that meantime. By now, this was kind of a very foreign concept when I brought this in. I'm like, oh, the conversions down now, even though the product's done really well because Bitcoin has crashed, right?\n\n(00:47:06):\nNobody wants to go sign up for an Exchange account. So, if you just measure pre and post, you would think that you have done something wrong in the product. If you measure it as an experiment, you would know that, yeah, between the variant and control, it's still doing great, even though overall conversion is down. So largely, the more you kind of, one of the first thing kind of doing when I take on a role, the company already doesn't have an experimentation culture. That's largely why they hire me in the first place, right?\n\n(00:47:35):\nSo, for now, the first thing is to say, how can we bring it in? First, the kind of right culture, the right incentives and the right tools. And then, once it's set up, it gets a lot of fun. Get a lot of fun for the PMs because you have democratized performance for the product managers. And the second thing, which I tell my PMs now, which is truly kind of empowering if you think about it, the challenge with being a product manager is everybody thinks they can do their job, right? You go to... The CFO might have an idea, the head of kind of accounting has an idea. Anybody who uses the product thinks they have ideas, right?\n\n(00:48:17):\nSo, at some point in time, you're like, what is my discipline? What is my science? Nobody goes to the accounting guy and says, \"Hey, I have a great idea for how to cook our books.\" Nobody does that because there's a science behind it. There's a science for financial forecasting. Even in technology, a lot of the times people just don't go and say, \"Hey, just dump this thing and let's use this code that the AI code generator has used.\" Right? There's a little bit of science there.\n\n(00:48:43):\nWhereas in product, you largely find that it's a combination of data and ideas and stuff, and anybody thinks they can... The moment you build experimentation, you'll now make it scientific, right? Now, somebody comes up with an idea, say, that's a bad idea. Here, this is why it's a bad idea, because we have done this experiment six times and it has failed across this user groups at this exact level of impact created. So, it kind of gives the PMs the kind of, hey, I'm not just a general purpose technician, I'm a specialist now. And it's extremely empowering once we can, it takes a long time to move the team in that direction. But once you get it there, the PMs just, it's a natural kind of dopamine hit every time you run an experiment and see more metrics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:33):\nI'm a huge fan of experimentation. I think most guests on this podcast are on your side of the debate. I feel like we could do a whole podcast episode on just how to create a culture of experimentation, how to change culture. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, and I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co founder of Vanta joining me for this very short conversation.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:49:55):\nGreat to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:57):\nVanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:00):\n... show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?\n\nSpeaker 1 (00:50:05):\nSure. So we started Vanta in 2018, focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names like Atlassian, Ramp, and LangChain start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:35):\nThat is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.\n\nSpeaker 1 (00:50:43):\nThat is very much our experience, but before the company. And to some extent during it, but the idea is with automation with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company, so you don't have to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:59):\nWe appreciate you for doing that and you have a special discount for listeners, they can get a thousand dollars off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny. That's V-A-N-T-A .com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.\n\nSpeaker 1 (00:51:13):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:14):\nI want to come back to the question of what N26 has done well to create and hire great PMs. So you've spent a bunch of time on here's career advice that I often give and what has helps people most in their career. Just to kind of close this thread, is there anything N26 did or is doing that either from the hiring perspective or from training? I know you haven't been there from the beginning, just like as a business, as a company that they've done really well that other companies may want to copy.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:51:44):\nSome of it is just the hiring philosophy. One of the advantages you get for being a big fish in a small pond is you get to have your pick of the cream of the crop. So in Europe here where we don't have the same level of unicorn or decacorn density you have in the Bay Area being one of the first ones or the few ones, you do get a little bit of that branding working in your favor. So some portion of that is just the input. If you're taking really smart people, very chance at N26 they will stay smart. Two is again, the level of problems that they work on are harder. Just the print tech angle we mentioned and now with this whole experimentation driven kind of change that we made in the last year or so, there's also a new kind of tool kit that they get, especially if they're going for larger big growth company as the next step of the career.\n\n(00:52:48):\nAll the people companies I talk to, the amount of companies that are truly world-class at experimentation is so low that if you work in one of these companies and you build this tool set, you can build a whole career on this. You can go to any other company and say, \"This is what I'm going to bring to the table.\" Because there's no growth without, as I said, without compounding wins faster. Nothing compounds wins faster than experiments and there's no company out in the world that says we don't want to grow. So that is an incredible kind of brand that you can build alongside with it. Then the third piece is just the scale. One of the other interesting aspects of banking is what I call a hundred percent product. It's actually more than a hundred percent, they're more bank accounts than human beings because a lot of people have more than one bank account.\n\n(00:53:38):\nSo you never run out of target addressable market. It's as big as it can get, which means that there's no upper bound on how much... Because at some point if you're, I don't know, building in kind of an AI code generator, your market is capped that maybe developers or people want to be developers. Or you're building, I don't know, AWS, it's a massive market, but it's still like all the company that need online hosting. They look at banking everybody needs and the fact that it's oldest or the second oldest, depending on how risky you are or not... Or profession known to man. It is a self-hedged product. When things get tough on one side of our business, the interest rates, let's say, go high, spending goes down, but we make money on deposits. When interest rates go down, spending increases, so we make more your money on interchange, [inaudible 00:54:36] investments. So it's a very self-hedged business that lets you go through the troughs and the peaks better than most companies.\n\n(00:54:45):\nAnd that understanding that how do you build naturally hedged products is probably another kind of reason why... It just influences how you make decisions and how do you kind of scale your core product portfolio. Just one example, for about a year and a half ago, we were largely year bank with a card and we were the first mobile bank and that was a big enough market. But in the last year or so, we have just fleshed out that product portfolio. We have a big lending portfolio now. We launched savings last year. We invested heavily in savings because the interest rates were high, was a super amazing tool to attract new users by offering high interest rates.\n\n(00:55:28):\nBut as the interest rates are going down now, which is investing heavily in lending because now you can get loans for lower prices, which was super hard to get last year. So being able to build products that complement the macro also gives you that kind of additional balancing act that you don't get in typical single focus companies. So I think it's a combination of few of those things, being able to get great talent, being able to train them now more so especially around experimentation and just see how we can build a product portfolio that complements each other but also naturally hedges against each other, just gives you a better, well-balanced way to operate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:13):\nI think this explains something really interesting. As you were talking, I realized that a lot of these companies that produce the best PMs are to your point, non-US based, but incredibly successful in their location. And so it draws in the most talented people in that region. So I know Intercom I think technically is... So Intercom was number one on this list of companies that produce the best PMs. Intercom, Palantir, Revolut, and then N26, Chime, Stripe, Dropbox were kind of at the top. And four of those essentially, or three of those are non... Intercom I think was Ireland for a lot of their team is based in Ireland. Then Revolut is the UK and then you guys. So it's interesting, that explains some really interesting insights of just be the best, be the big fish in a small pond, draw in the best talent and then work on really hard problems and be really successful. There you go. There's a formula.\n\nMayur Kamat (00:57:03):\nYes, yes. It's very simple when you put it that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:08):\nOh, man. Okay. You interestingly have worked in a lot of different places. I want to spend a little time here. So you've worked in Europe, you've worked in Asia, you worked in the US obviously. For someone that is maybe thinking about moving out of the US or maybe moving to the US, what have you found are the big trade-offs?\n\nMayur Kamat (00:57:26):\nYeah, so I would say early career you want to be in intensely talents dense areas for all the reasons that we mentioned before. Finding the high growth companies, finding the networks that will make you successful. For general tech, there's no better place than West coast of the US. Everybody doesn't have the option, especially now with the immigration policies and so forth. I mean things were always hard. They seem extremely harder now. So you may not have that option, but if you do have that option, I would encourage everyone, there's no better place than West Coast to start your career. There's some exceptions, like for crypto, I would say Dubai is very strong, very great, has a really high density there. But again, it's a very industry specific. Bangalore, if you're Indian, has managed to recreate some of the magic of Silicon Valley, not at the same scale, but getting better. If you're in finance, maybe there is London, Singapore, and Asia has now at least not as much new innovation, but each of the big companies has a presence there.\n\n(00:58:40):\nSo at least secondary talent densities there, those would be our options if US is not available early in your career. And in some ways it helps define you, right? If you work at Microsoft or Google or OpenAI or some of these companies that become brands later, it's something you can take with you when going... The second part of your question is if you decide to move, having that experience and that brand and that kind of achievements there can help you find great opportunities elsewhere. I mean, I've been a little bit privileged that some of these opportunities I found me like N26 here in Europe or Binance before in Asia where I wasn't really in that super talent dense area in the first place. But luck's not a great strategy. So if you're planning for it, I would say build your early career in the US. Honestly, when we moved to Thailand 2018, at that point, I didn't think I was making a great professional decision.\n\n(00:59:51):\nWe were just struggling in the US with both me and my wife working. Both our kids in Seattle were tiny. My daughter had asthma at that time and she was just constantly sick. And it was a struggle for us to kind of manage both work and life. And when I talked to Agoda, I had never heard of the company and the only reason I ended up taking the job was like, hey, Bangkok's a hot place. My daughter might not have asthma there and we might have some help in the house. So we could probably balance some of the things that are really not adding value to our life right now. And that was the hypothesis there that I can do a lot more on work because I was literally not able to focus as much on it, everything else that was happening. And as I said, everything on an experimentation that we just hit a home run on all the hypothesis. My daughter, the heat cured her asthma.\n\n(01:00:52):\nJust having a support structure allowed us just as a family to spend a lot more time with each other and allowed me a lot more time to work and be on my career when I'm not doing dishes and not doing laundry and not throwing out the trash and not mowing the lawn. There's just so much hours that show up in the day that you could be doing things that you're great at and add to your career. And then Agoda just turned out to be almost like a bootcamp for understanding how an experimentation based product culture might work. Because before that I worked at Google, I worked at startups. My [inaudible 01:01:31] claim to fame was building big stuff and Agoda just taught me a lot of the growth comes with incredibly small things done faster. So it's part of Booking Holdings. So if you heard of Booking.com, it's a $170 billion company. And what's interesting is that 10 years ago it was a $10 billion company which sold flights, hotels, and cars. 10 years later it still sells flights, hotels, and cars, it's a $ 170 billion company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:01):\nOh, wow.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:02:02):\nIt's an incredible growth story. And that tells you you really don't need from a strategy perspective to do something completely different if you can truly compound your growth by optimizing every single thing really, really well. So there are the pros that come with, as I said, when you move, most of the time you're building products that are global, especially if you're based in the US. Very few times you're building product that just work in the US. Now, that's not true for a lot of the countries. Like in India, a lot of products are only designed for Indian market, a lot of products in China only designed for Chinese market, but from the US you're designing product for the world and a lot of the times you don't experience the same constraints or you don't empathize with the user at the same level because you just haven't lived that user's life.\n\n(01:02:57):\nSo in terms of just being able to calibrate yourself on what a global product might look like, being able to live in different places and understanding some of these constraints first hand, definitely a pro. As I said, especially if you have built that early reputation, you get to work at some of the best companies when you go abroad. And so there's a hit to compensation, at least initially for sure. Nobody pays anywhere close, especially here in Europe. But as I said before, don't optimize for compensation early in your career or even middle part of your career. So if you follow that advice, it'll not matter because you will have kind of something unique to offer. Even if you come back to the US later having worked in different... Having understanding, especially if you're in FinTech where the actual laws are different in different countries and that one you truly do not appreciate working in the US. Even at Google and stuff, when we would launch products, I would be like, oh, the lawyers, they're just making life difficult.\n\n(01:04:07):\nBut the many of now have a true appreciation of how different the world truly is. It just makes you a better stakeholder when you talk to the legal team, when you talk to compliance team, when you talk to marketing. So I think those are all the pros. The compensation could be the con. The other big con is that today, if you're in Silicon Valley, I spent 15 years in Seattle, I worked at four companies, I could change jobs and stay in Seattle because there's enough companies there. You're not going to run a ceiling at some point, in Bay Area, there's no ceiling, right? You can keep growing. The challenge now is that if I'm in Bangkok and I'm working at Agoda, at some point I need to find a new job or because let's say I'm at the CPO level, I want to be CEO now. Agoda already has a CEO, so I need to find, be a CEO somewhere else. Guess what? That company is not going to be in Bangkok. Now I have to move and move my whole family to Singapore, which I did. Then you hit somewhere over there or then you hit another ceiling, now you need to move back or go somewhere else with Thailand, which I did. And then you're like, oh, maybe there's a great opportunity in Europe which would give you a whole different scale. Then you need to move to Spain, which I did. So at some point your family's like, what's happening? It turned out to be what turned out to be one step to go from A to B is now just a every year journey.\n\n(01:05:34):\nSo that's something to calibrate, especially later in your career that it's extremely hard if you like the job and don't like the location or vice versa, 'cause they usually come as a package deal now. We see this in Bangkok now where there's not that many great tech companies, and if you're at Agoda and you're doing really well, but it's just one company, you just don't have options. And especially if you love Bangkok, which is a great city, probably my vote for the best place to live in the world, that's a struggle. You love the city, but if you need to move your career ahead, you need to go somewhere else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:16):\nSo interesting. I feel like Thailand is very popular right now with White Lotus.I think White Lotus had the most views of any show or some crazy... It was very popular. I feel like there's a lot of tourism coming to Thailand more than they've had.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:06:31):\nYes, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:32):\nYeah. I want to come back to one piece of advice that we were chatting about before we started recording that I think might be helpful to people, which is, and this is kind in a different direction, but I want to make sure we touch on it, is Shreyas Doshi's point about leverage. I know this is something that you think a lot about. He has this really good advice and we'll point to the episode if people want to dig deeper around finding the highest leverage opportunities for you to work on as a PM. Can you just share that advice for folks that haven't heard this before?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:07:00):\nThis is true for no matter what level of career you are in, but you have a finite amount of time and largely you have more problems than you have time to solve them. The question is which ones you work on. And this becomes even harder, let's say you're a CPO now because all of them are important, otherwise they will not come to you in the first place. The question is, which one do you work on? And the principle is simple. You work on problems that have a 10X positive or a negative impact. I mean the number can be 10, 5, 300, depending on finance it would be a hundred, some companies might be three. And in most FinTech companies one of two problems, it's a growth problem or a compliance problem because both of them can have a negative or positive 10X impact and that's what you focus on. That's what you spend bulk of your time. What was interesting for me, my first executive roles, that was Google, I was a product manager.\n\n(01:08:01):\nI joined what was White Pages back then as a VP of product. I was my first kind of... And White Pages, Alex Allgood, Seattle, founding legend, three companies, all unicorns now. Incredible, very good personal friend and mentor. What was truly interesting when I joined it, they're like, \"Okay, this is your desk, this is the product area. So we had two offices, this is when everybody worked in office five days a week.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, where does Alex sit?\" And he's like, \"Oh, he's sitting with accounting.\" And I'm like, I didn't think about it because I thought his office is near accounting. Then I find out he doesn't have office, he has a floating desk. So all the other desks were fixed, but he had a movable desk and he would move his desk to one of the departments, which I think had the highest leverage opportunity. And he would sit there at that desk when that department till that either problem was solved or the opportunity was realized, and then he would literally move his desk and then go to product or tech or finance.\n\n(01:09:08):\nAnd that was his way of... You could literally visualize him working on the highest leverage problem by his desk moving. And then that combines that with what we talked before about details and a little bit, I think I didn't mention it about the humility that you need to have to be working in the detail. A lot of the times, especially later in your career, you're like, hey, this is beyond me. This is below me. Why do I need to do that? I have so many PMs or data analysts or somebody should do it. Why would I do it? And that was kind of again, just a quick story there. I remember we were trying to figure out our growth channels and we found out that, hey, we are kind of really tapping out on paid, on social, on referrals, but SEO was something we just hadn't worked on for a while. We're building a caller ID app and what we wanted to do was when somebody types a phone number in Google, we want to be the first link to say, hey, is this a spam call or not?\n\n(01:10:10):\nOr whose number it is. And if we could then we could get them to download our app. That was the hypothesis. So I present at the executive team meeting to Alex, like, \"Hey, I have a team. I want to hire a product manager focused purely on SEO and because I think that's one of our highest leverage areas right now.\" And Alex is like, \"Hey, the whole White Pages, I built based on SEO. People who type people's name and the first thing used to be a White Pages link. I'm one of the best people in the world to work on SEO.\" I'm like, \"Yeah. So?\" He's like, \"Let me run this product.\" I'm like, \"Okay, what do you mean?\" He's like, \"No, no, I will be the product manager for this for however long you need it.\" I'm like, \"How's [inaudible 01:10:54]?\"\n\n(01:10:54):\n\"They don't worry about it. Just tell me about the engineers.\" So again, he moved his desk to where that product team sat, and for the next three months he was the product manager on that scrum. So he would come to my product team meetings, give us update on what's happening with the SEO scrum, and then an hour later I would be in the leadership meeting giving my update to him, and truly he was operating it saying, this is high leverage area for the company, high leverage for my yards. It should be high leverage for me. I'm the best person to do it. I'm going to be in the details and do it. CZ, same at Binance, there were a lot of products that he would just sit on himself. There were very few people at Binance who would say no to CZ, but one of my lead PMs who worked on the products that CZ worked on, he would tell them no all the time.\n\n(01:11:41):\nThey would just baffle all the other executives, how is he saying no to CZ and none of us are doing it? Hey, that was his product area that CZ was working on, and there was that mutual respect there that, hey, we know this thing and he is going to say no to me because probably not a good idea. So that humility and attention to detail is required to work on the high leverage problems. A lot of the high leverage problems are not, as I said, not strategy decisions. They're not language markets to go after and stuff. A lot of them are like, why is this thing not working as well as it needs to be? And a lot of time the devil is in the details and you need to be over there. I think combining that, knowing what is high leverage or not, and two, both having the humility and the patience to be able to go dig deeper and solve that.\n\n(01:12:34):\nSome of them are quick ones. Like if I'm looking today at, let's say how many of our signed up users convert into a long-term monthly daily active user, that could be something I focus on for a month. Because we're running a lot of experiments on early onboarding screens, early rewards, early incentives, early loyalty program, and at some point it might be like, oh, the team's got it. I've given all my... What I could do there. It's functioning. We have great PMs. I trust their execution on this. Let me just go focus on some of the compliance challenges that we have or fraud issues that we have in France.\n\n(01:13:13):\nThose kind of being able to kind of... The only way that works for me is I keep a very three calendar because you cannot do this without that. If you have hundreds of meetings, hundreds of one-on-ones daily standards, a lot of recurring meetings, you just can't find time to go work on high leverage problems. So that would be my kind of other stuff is you should have plenty of open spaces on your calendar. A full calendar is a badge of shame, not a badge of honor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:47):\nThese are awesome stories. Just the metaphor of the moving desk is so good. That's the epitome of a... Like what you're describing is what people now call founder mode, where the founder just goes in the details working on the problem. Brian Chesky actually did this at Airbnb while I was there. He took on a new product and was like mini CEO, essentially. I don't know if he'd called himself the product manager 'cause I don't think he loved product managers. He kind of famously got rid of product managers, which he didn't actually... But yeah, he did that very much and he sat with the team, kind of created a whole space for the team that he was in. These are awesome stories and really good example of a founder using their power to unblock and finding the highest leverage opportunities.\n\n(01:14:29):\nTo kind of start to close off our conversation, I'm going to take you to a couple recurring themes on this podcast, recurring segments on this podcast. First, we're going to visit AI Corner and in AI Corner I ask, what's a way that you have found to use AI in AI tool, a bunch of AI tools in your work to work more efficiently to work to create better quality work?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:14:55):\nI still haven't found a game changer for me personally. Something that I use right now and I'm a little bit not-\n\nMayur Kamat (01:15:00):\nHe was like, now I am a little bit not sure that am I not doing something right, what the other people are, or I'm a little bit too jaded for it.\n\n(01:15:10):\nSo we have Gemini across the work. So for meeting notes and stuff, works great, especially for folks who don't make it. We use a tool called Writer for our copywriting and UX teams, especially because we are operating in Europe across several languages. So being able to generate that very quickly, especially for illustrations and in-app messages and stuff that's been a, several tools now. But Writer just has, the copywriting market is really well done over there.\n\n(01:15:43):\nIf you ask me across N26. But even when we did this at Binance or at Agoda, there are three areas where AI is complete game changer. One is on coding. Again, you can use whatever latest tool for prototyping or not most value, especially for the companies I have worked at, which are fairly large companies, very large code bases.\n\n(01:16:09):\nHaving some sort of co-pilot that's integrated with your repositories. Rough data, maybe somewhere between 18 to 25% productivity boost for a developer, which is fairly massive, right? So that's one category, game changer. Customer support, game changer. Whether we should do it at scale or not, that's a different kind of more ethical/human question to ask there. But for solving the bottom 70 percentile problems, \"Why is my card declined? Why is there a hold on my account? What happened to the replacement card I shipped? Why is it not arrived?\" Basic questions, AI automating now almost 60, 70% of that. Customers getting that real feedback. Game changer.\n\n(01:16:58):\nAnd the last one is just on fraud and being able to just understand patterns better on real customers versus not. At Binance, we had this product where users could exchange crypto with each other. I could pay you Bitcoin and get Thai bath in return, huge amount of fraud.\n\n(01:17:18):\nAnd they're using AI just to understand language patterns of fraudsters versus not fraudsters. Massive. So again, as a company level, there is an incredible set of advancements across these three areas: developer productivity, customer support, and fraud. But for me personally, I'm like, what would I use that suddenly makes me a better CPO? I'm still struggling a little bit over there, but I don't think we need something at that level because largely what still remains the domain of humans is decision making and taking the brunt of the impact of what decisions you make because I would love to blame AI for some of my bad decisions. That's not why [inaudible 01:18:10].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:10):\nYou can still do that. You can still do that even if it's not.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:18:13):\nYes, yes. But again, hopeful to, generally not a big fan of ... The thing I call a little bit jaded. You have tools now that you write few things and they make a long essay for it. And then you have tools that compress long essays into few words. You could have just said few words in the first place and save the whole round trip. It's like a reverse zip. I remember when we had zip and it was a game changer, but there was a big file you needed to send over a slow network, so you compressed it and sent it and then expanded it. We're doing the reverse now. We have a small thing, we make it big and then send it over and somebody's making it small. But on these three areas, if you're at all skilled companies, if you don't have a great tool for developing productivity, you're not looking at essential basic LLM bots for deflecting customer service and you're not looking at patterns on user transactions or user communications or detect fraud, that's the first area I would focus on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:14):\nOkay, I'm going to take us to another recurring segment on the podcast. It's called Fail Corner. And the idea here is folks like you come on this podcast, there's all these wins, killing it, CPO, this and that, and just moving into Thailand, it worked out incredibly, what a win all the time. In reality, that's not how things go. So the question to you here is just what's the story of a failure in your career when things didn't go well and it was a big deal for you, and then what you learned from that experience, how that actually impacted you?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:19:44):\nYeah, so from the product side, my probably most spectacular failure was I was the first PM on Hangouts. And if you ask Nikhil, he'll probably say he was my boss then. It was an effort the size I've never seen before or after in my career. We had thousands of people working for me. We had entire power of Google. We had Larry literally sitting with us saying we can do anything we want Chrome to do. And we still didn't manage to build a great messaging product.\n\n(01:20:18):\nSo when I look at pure product-sense, product decision-making was, there's several reasons now I'd had luxury of 15 years to analyze that on solving for the wrong audience, solving for the wrong DNA of the company. I have this premise that certain companies can never succeed at certain type of products like Microsoft with mobile or Google with social or Facebook with enterprise, it is just the DNA of the founder actively acts against you succeeding there.\n\n(01:20:54):\nI would've said Google with enterprise as well. But then Sundar came and Larry was no longer the CEO and that's when the enterprise took off. They literally had to change the CEO to win in certain segments, but more, and then again, I worked in Nagoda during COVID, so travel company during COVID, Binance during its probably most tumultuous area of compliance and government scrutiny. There's a lot of missteps there around externalities. I think one of the main kind of learnings from that is just don't take on projects that are going to be six months, a year, because you just generally don't have control over the macro. Things just move way more faster. And that's probably cemented my kind of now product philosophy of just doing small things very quickly, spending most of the times doing that. You still launch big products, but even over there we try and get early signals as soon as possible. But because in Nagoda, like one of the big projects we launched was we wanted to control the payments infrastructure for all the hotels and we thought if we had that device in the hotel's desk, so not only for bookings made online, but for everything that happens at the hotel, if we control that infrastructure, not only would we make money, but we had a touch point with the users that went beyond booking the travel.\n\n(01:22:29):\nTravel as you know, is not a high frequency activity. You book once, then you book six months later and most of the time people would not come to Nagoda, they would just go to Google and go to some other website. So we wanted that touch point that stayed with them and thought payments would be a great avenue to do that because that's something you do every day. And again, we did it in the Nagoda style.\n\n(01:22:51):\nSo we did an experiment. We started very small and literally went to the mall and bought these $50 Android devices where we ran our software that people could just scan the credit card by a camera and charge it. It was incredible. We had thousands of hotels use it. And then COVID hits and then there's literally nobody going to hotels anymore. But it took us like six, nine months because of the licenses, and so to launch it. And in hindsight probably, I mean you couldn't have thought about COVID with that sense, but still the amount of time it took to launch the product was something we could have done better. So learnings for most of it is don't take too long to launch, don't take too long to validate your hypothesis.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:40):\nThe Hangout story is amazing. It's like a classic product. People now make fun of just Google, why can't you get this right? And it's been changed. Names have changed a hundred times. Interestingly, Meet ended up being really good, Google Meet.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:23:52):\nThat's the last thing I did when I left Google.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:54):\nOh, Okay.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:23:57):\nAfter we built the Hangouts, they're like, \"Okay, this is not going anywhere. We are going to start this new product called Allo.\" Which also didn't work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:05):\nOne of the many names,.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:24:08):\nBut then I said, you know what? We should still, because I used to work for Android Enterprise team before, I'm like, what if we just made it an enterprise product? Let me at least write the spec for it on, hey, what would we do differently for, I still called it Hangouts by Enterprise. They rebranded it later. But that was my salvaging moment for, but from the sense, I mean the Hangouts team invented WebRTC. Now every single communication in the world happens on WebRTC. So if you think from the cultural and technological impact that the Hangouts team had is insane. Like this tool we are using every single meeting product, every single WhatsApp, voice calling, video calling, every Zoom, everything runs on WebRTC. From a technology side, I think that was a pretty massive win that the team came up with that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:04):\nThat's the power of having Chrome having a browser, also, just introducing technologies.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:25:09):\nYeah. Yes, absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:12):\nFinal question before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to leave listeners with or maybe a point you want to double down on just to kind of leave a little last little nugget before we get to the lightning round?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:25:24):\nI mean, just summarize, it depends on the audience. A lot of the folks who probably listen to it or coming it from a perspective of like, \"Hey, how does this help me be better at my job tomorrow than I was today?\" And for them I would say, again, if you're truly working in areas where you think you're optimizing your strengths and having fun, just keep doing it and just keep that as your kind of north star, as you look at new pieces. When you talk to new companies, try and evaluate the overlap of superpowers. What is your superpower? What is the company's superpower? Will they feed each other?\n\n(01:26:01):\nIf you get a very strong resonance there, I think that would be a great career step irrespective of whether it's in Bangkok or Spain or however the compensation is going to be, because truly you'll find that you grow much faster because it's a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy at that point. But just keep looking for overlapping superpowers all the time and not just in professional life, even the concepts beyond maybe even for relationships and stuff like folks who are extremely complementing strengths and whose superpowers feed each other make for great life partners. So there's maybe that analogy can be extended beyond your career.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:51):\nWow, that's a powerful point right there. Well, what a cool way to end that. Well, with that Mayur, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:27:01):\nYeah, let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:02):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:27:06):\nThe one that I read most recently, so I generally don't read a lot of books because I read a lot of content like, small content.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:13):\nTweets.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:27:14):\nAnd tweets and then Substacks and Discords and WhatsApp messages, and so book takes a mind share shift for me to go read a book. The one I read most recently, which I thought was pretty amazing and a lot of overlap with what I said today, The Five Kinds Of Wealth. That one was very well articulated, especially the last point I made very early. One of the potential paths is you just do well on your job and then you find meaning elsewhere. This book is probably an incredible structured way of thinking around it. What is your wealth in terms of your health, your physical health, your mental health, your relationship health, your community and your wealth that you're generating financial wealth is and how do you think holistically? Because at the end of the day, you are what you optimize for. If you optimize for financial wealth, you'll become wealthy, but you might not be wealthy in a full spectrum manner.\n\n(01:28:16):\nThe Strengths Finder 2.0, I said very early on. It's still an interesting book to just think about how you would think about your strengths, but again, if you don't want to read the book, I would just do one of these kind of online quizzes for it. But The Five Kinds of Wealth then Strength Finder 2.0 would be maybe what I would suggest.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:35):\nThe first book by Sahil Bloom friend of the podcast willing to tell this stuff. I forgot to mention the story briefly about the Strength Finder stuff. So I actually, when I was leaving Airbnb and looking for my next thing and even thinking about leaving, I took a strengths test and I was working with executive coach and I saw the results and she's like, \"What do you see in these results? What are these results telling you?\" I'm like, I don't know. She's like, this tells me you should start your own company and work on your own. All the strengths that are popping up here are things that you as a founder need and that really helped me.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:29:07):\nWhat's your one person data point on that? Was it a good one?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:11):\nWas it is a good decision, you mean?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:29:13):\nYes, relying on that strength test to make a career.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:17):\nThe best. So great. I am such a huge fan of Strengths Finder and any kind of strengths test and interestingly, people may be afraid of taking them because they'd be like, here's what I suck at. It always makes you feel good. It's like, here's the stuff you're good at and it's not like, here's what you're bad at. It's just, here's the stuff you're best at and it's always positive. It's never like you suck at this stuff. It's just not your strength. So it was a huge win for me. I highly recommend it.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:29:40):\nAwesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:40):\nEspecially if you're trying to make a career move. So yeah, fully aligned. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:29:48):\nThe one I saw that kind of TV shows usually I watch to kind of give it down time, so usually I watch just periodic shows, the House or Big Bang Theory and stuff. The one that I saw recently that kind of shook me a little bit was Adolescence. Again, it's a tough topic around teenage mental health and violence in schools and just the way it was shot. I would see the first episode, even if it's not your genre because it's shot in a single camera motion and the whole episode for an hour, there's no cut. Camera just keeps moving and it just makes bizarre, you feel a little different than watching it. Irrespective of this topic, which is also pretty intense. Just visually you feel different, and if you're motion sick like me, you really feel different.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:41):\nThat's wonderful. It sounds like what a ...\n\nMayur Kamat (01:30:45):\nI would watch that. I need to watch The White Lotus because everybody keeps bringing it every time I tell them I'm from Thailand and I haven't seen it yet, so I'm behind on my mean culture a little bit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:58):\nYeah, you are. It's like you, no one else has not seen it. I think you're the only person left.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:31:01):\nYes, I'm the only one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:04):\nOkay. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:31:08):\nSo products, so I spend most of my time using banking and trading products, and I would give a plug here. If you're in Europe, try N26 or even revenue, incredible product. If you're in the US, Robin Hood, just the motion design they have done and the onboarding is just a joy to use, whether you use it for banking or trading or just for their card. I just find the product design and motion, especially as you touch and swipe and try to be done. Anything that Nikita Beard launches. So I just downloaded Bible study or Bible chat yesterday.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:46):\nI saw a tweet about that. It's like in the top 10 of all social apps and it's like bible study.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:31:52):\nYeah, it's top ten. And I can tell why I have got three messages right now to treat my anxiety by reading Bible today, and one of the time I was feeling slightly anxious, so maybe there's some magic there.\n\n(01:32:03):\nBut the one app that I would just for personal, I used to write in Hindi. I used to write poems growing up as a kid, and that was just now this app Suno.com. I can make songs from them and they're incredible songs, at least I think so. Nobody else thinks it so far, but just the fact that you can write something and now you have a song is just magical. The first time that AI, I saw a use case, I said, it's nothing so far that makes me a better CPO right now, but as an artist or at least the bathroom artist, it's just incredible that you can think of something, put it down there and you can actually see what would a professional singer and a band and a musician if they were to compose it, what it would look like. So that's probably the most wild I have been by technology, the recent times, the Suno.com. They're onboarding flow sucks and their growth product is, if I were the PM on Suno, I would do things a lot differently, but their core tech is magical.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:15):\nI'm a huge fan. One of my favorite things to do at Suno, I think it's Suno.ai also, is just ask it to make a song in the style of a sea shanty. It's so fun. And they give you a few options, so you could be like, here's this version, that version.\n\nMayur Kamat (01:33:28):\nYes, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:29):\nOkay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:33:35):\nOne, I kind of relates to the things we talked about is there's no right or wrong decision. There's just low and fast decisions. Now, there are some extreme caveats to that around you're doing something that might kill your user like healthcare or military or even compliance, which can kill your company. Don't use it. But everywhere else in generally goes back to the strategy thing we talked about as well. A lot of the times if it's you make a wrong decision, if you make it fast enough, you would know it was wrong and you would correct it and you would still do it faster than thinking months for the right decision. So for anything that's reversible, anything that's not going to get you in jail or kill your company, no right or wrong decisions, just slow or fast decisions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:19):\nFinal question. You've lived in a bunch of places. You've lived in Spain, Thailand, Mumbai, Seattle, I think Texas, even for some period for school?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:34:29):\nYeah. College, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:30):\nOkay. There's probably other places. Which has the best food?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:34:34):\nBangkok, no question. Barcelona comes closer for some, but Bangkok, you can have a three Michelin star, one of the top five restaurants in the world, spend $500 a meal or you can have a $1 street food, stir-fried pork and rice with basil. Incredible. Just the spectrum of entire, from the cheapest food you can think of, the most expensive food you can think of in that same one kilometer walkable area, having thousands of these, literally there's the density of food. No one comes closer. Barcelona has incredible restaurant. The best restaurant in the world is like a block away from here. It's called Disputar. Takes like two years to get on the wait list there, but that's on one end of the spectrum, Barcelona, that probably comes close second. But that cheap, get down 2:00 A.M. walk down and have an incredible meal for a dollar. nothing comes closer to it than Bangkok.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):\nThis episode's a great ad for Thailand. Let's go. You definitely got to watch White Lotus. Mayur, this was awesome. We covered so much ground. I feel like I got to know you so well. We covered so many-\n\nMayur Kamat (01:35:50):\nThank you so much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:51):\n... perspectives in all this. Yeah, we're not done yet. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe check out if there's roles at N26 and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMayur Kamat (01:36:02):\nFind me, this is one of the things being old is I was one of the first users of LinkedIn, so linkedin.com/mayur.

I'll probably get in trouble for talking about Fight Club. The first rule is you don't talk about Fight Club. But it's 30 minutes every week, and it's just for myself, my engineering, and my design leader; and we get together, and we know that we're going there to have a conflict.\n\n(00:00:18):\nI think often when there's difficult conversations, or those conflicts come up, you can put them off until they become much bigger. Or if somebody is conflict adverse, they can try to avoid having it at all. But by having a specific slot of time in your week for something like that, then you're sort of in that mindset. You know you're going in there to solve a hard problem. You know that there's going to be a disagreement. And it makes it much better. I think the relationship we all have is so much better because we get on top of these things early.\n\nLenny (00:00:51):\nToday, my guest is Megan Cook. Megan is head of product for Jira, which is used by 75% of Fortune 500 companies, 125,000 customers globally, and is by far the most popular project management tool in the world.\n\n(00:01:06):\nMegan has been at Atlassian for just under 11 years. Prior to Atlassian, Megan was an analyst, a developer, and an agile coach.\n\n(00:01:15):\nIn our conversation, we discuss what Atlassian has done so right in being able to offer 15 different product lines, which many companies dream of, how they continue to stay ahead of the market in spite of the many competitors in the space, why Megan considers play so essential to building great teams and great products, a bunch of tactical advice for getting buy-in for your ideas, tips for being a successful PM in a remote environment. Also, a great story of failure, and so much more; including surfing tips.

I am a big fan of your podcast, and I am excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:02):\nI have a lot of things I want to chat about. I've heard about many things that you're extremely good at as a leader, as a product leader, and so I'm just going to poke around a bunch of different areas. I wanted to start with something that I hear you're just a big advocate of and really good at, which is creating space for play on teams and also just creating a lot of psychological safety, something that you find really important that helps your teams be as successful as they are.\n\n(00:04:29):\nCan you just talk about why this is important to you, why creating play and psychological safety are so important to you, and then just how you do this, maybe an example or two of how you actually apply this on your teams?\n\nMegan Cook (00:04:40):\nYeah, absolutely. I think especially recently in the tech industry, it almost feels like we're going through a bit of a wake-up call at the moment. We were in this time of plenty, and everyone was hiring like crazy, and then COVID hit and suddenly people's behaviors had to really change. People couldn't travel; they had to work from home. There's a whole bunch of industries that got highly impacted by that, and it created this time of high ambiguity.\n\n(00:05:08):\nBefore that, or to the start of that, I was noticing within my team just some little indicators where people weren't all comfortable to speak up when we'd had really open discussions with the most junior person, where the most senior person were happy to talk about anything. There was more anonymity in feedback. Every time things were coming to leadership to give feedback on, it was just sort of painfully polished. And I think once it gets to that level, that's a really bad time to give feedback, because it probably means that a whole ton of work has gone into it, and you might waste a whole bunch of work if you have to correct direction or make significant changes.\n\n(00:05:53):\nAnd so, I was looking at my team and thinking, \"Yeah, something doesn't feel quite right here.\" And then I went to this leadership outside, and one of the speakers there was Ben Crowe. He's an expert in having the right mindset. So he works with Olympic gold medalists, and Ash Barty is another one, who's a tennis player. She's the number one tennis player in the entire world. So these athletes who have to really perform under a lot of pressure, in front of a lot of people. And he talked about how to be in that state of flow, where everything is going really well and new ideas are coming and you're making progress, you've got great momentum. And he talked about how to be in that flow state. There needs to be this sense of play and that things are fun. Your mind's open to new ideas, you feel really present. You're not stressing out and thinking about a ton of other different things.\n\n(00:06:52):\nAnd it's funny because when I thought about play where my mind went to the opposite of play is work. We often hear work and play as opposites together, but his point was actually that the opposite of play is fear. And I realized I think that's what I was seeing a lot of in my team and that's why the ideas were getting more incremental. So took that decision and went, okay, we need to look at psychological safety in that team or we're never going to get to some of these bigger, bolder, more innovative ideas. And so brought my group, product managers together, and we sat around and discussed it and all together came up with some ideas that we've implemented since then, which has had a really good impact. So I'll give you a couple.\n\nLenny (00:07:40):\nYeah, please.\n\nMegan Cook (00:07:40):\nOne of the first ones was my team of PMs is big enough now where not everyone necessarily gets to know everyone else, and when you don't have that relationship, it can feel a little scary. You don't have that trust that you understand how people are going to respond to you and you're not sure about reaching out. So we divided the team into these smaller groups for peer feedback groups and the idea is that they meet every two weeks or so, somebody brings something that's in a pretty rough draft that they want to get reviewed and then everyone's expected to give feedback. And because we've got people in there who are different leadership levels, it's a really good opportunity to model the kind of feedback that's helpful and the culture there is one of everyone lifting that person up to make their work stronger.\n\n(00:08:28):\nSo people can get in there, they can show that you can show work that's really in the early stages and feel comfortable with that. They can see that getting feedback can actually be really positive and they can see how all of these people together, they can rely on them and forge those relationships so they can rely on more people to help them out.\n\nLenny (00:08:47):\nThis is so interesting and it's such a good idea and it's such a simple and good idea and I'm surprised I haven't heard of people doing this before. Basically you pair up PMs, IC PMs and maybe managers too, to give each other feedback. And is the feedback on one-pagers and PRDs and strategy docs and things like that? What sort of documents are they giving feedback on?\n\nMegan Cook (00:09:11):\nSo really, it can be anything. It can be here's a new experience, [inaudible 00:09:15] launching, here's a new strategy. I've taken my own strategies in there and gotten excellent feedback, surprising feedback from the team. Can be a new experiment that people think of running and anything to do with the craft.\n\nLenny (00:09:29):\nAnd I think as you kind of implied, one of the powers of this approach is it's a small team, so it's less stressful and there's no... You're not in the room often too. I guess you are sometimes as you just said, but usually it's like peers and they could be a little more open and less worried about looking back.\n\nMegan Cook (00:09:46):\nYeah, absolutely. And I think a lot of it is just building that muscle. You might go through an experience once every quarter or once every six months and that can feel really stressful, but if you're doing it again and again, you get used to it. You get used to what to expect, you get a bit more practice, it can feel much more comfortable.\n\nLenny (00:10:04):\nThat's awesome. So it's just simple and powerful idea. It's kind of like everyone's always suggesting getting a mentor, getting a coach as a PM and those are hard to find. And this is just a little informal. It's almost like a little peer group board of directors for your work. We talk about that on the podcast sometimes. So anyway, that's awesome. Really good idea and something anyone can do.\n\nMegan Cook (00:10:24):\nYeah, thank you.\n\nLenny (00:10:26):\nGreat. Okay, you have a second idea?\n\nMegan Cook (00:10:29):\nYeah. One of the other things we do is we get everyone together just like every six months. So all of the product managers get together in the same place and the idea is to have a bit of an onsite. Now we start off with just doing something fun because everybody... As you might know, Atlassian is a remote organization, so everybody works remote all the time. They can work from anywhere. And so people often, they're not used to necessarily being all together in the same place. It can take a little while to warm up. And then after that we talk about strategy. We do workshops on different elements of craft boosting that craft together. And so a similar kind of thing. People get to build relationships together. They get to see all these different ideas bouncing around which can help uplift their own ideas and help them be more innovative.\n\n(00:11:23):\nIn this last one, I actually had some senior leaders from all over the organization come and share their stories of failure. So just to get everyone used to that idea that it's okay to fail and actually if the learnings are really good, maybe it should even be celebrated and it's not something to be scared of. And taking the big swing isn't a bad thing. It can be a really powerful way to learn as well.\n\nLenny (00:11:50):\nI love that. We've been talking about failure a lot on this podcast, so we're super aligned with the power of that. And so just to be clear, so what you do there, is it the entire product team of Atlassian or is it just your team in this every six month?\n\nMegan Cook (00:12:04):\nIt's just my team and then we pull in other product managers that we work closely with as well.\n\nLenny (00:12:09):\nAnd then you fly them all to Australia, I imagine?\n\nMegan Cook (00:12:13):\nYeah, all to Sydney\n\nLenny (00:12:15):\nTo Sydney. Amazing. Okay. And I think, so the key there is it's not just like go meet each other, it's training almost on different skill sets, helping people level up in say craft or I don't know, communication or writing or something like that. And then who teaches these things? Is it like individual team members or you bring someone in?\n\nMegan Cook (00:12:36):\nWe have a real mix actually. So yeah, we'll bring in outside experts or we'll get... There's a lot of knowledge and a lot of skill within the team itself. So you'll have different product managers who have different strengths. We have totally different teams. So someone on a growth team, for example, might want to teach everyone about how to create great hypotheses or we'll get someone external from the team, but internal to Atlassian who has those skills who can come in.\n\nLenny (00:13:04):\nI love that also gives those PMs a chance to, one, learn the skill better themselves because they're teaching it, and also just teach and present in public speaking and all that stuff. There's all these other benefits to doing that sort of thing.\n\nMegan Cook (00:13:16):\nYeah, absolutely. And I think as a product leader, it's really important to model the behavior you want to see from your teams, whether that's getting out there teaching, presenting, explaining different concepts, explaining the business or just being vulnerable and talking about when things haven't worked out.\n\nLenny (00:13:34):\nWhen we started this question, you talked about how there was kind of the shift at Atlassian where things started to feel more formal and people started to feel less open to sharing, being criticized in meetings. Just in case people might feel that might be happening in their company, do you remember roughly what size that started to happen at or signs of like, \"I'm noticing people are sharing less or being more worried about talking in big meetings\"?\n\nMegan Cook (00:14:00):\nProbably when we got into really different streams of work that were happening where people didn't have as much of a reason to interact with each other. So I think that was probably around, even around 15 we started to see a little bit of that.\n\nLenny (00:14:19):\n15 product managers?\n\nMegan Cook (00:14:20):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:14:21):\nGot it. Cool. That's a good stat.\n\nMegan Cook (00:14:24):\nYeah, you know what, I'll give one more thing that we do. So we've just started trying something new called the $10 game for priorities. And so that's where I think people might have played the $10 game for your priorities when it comes to a strategy or something like that. We started trying it out with your individual priorities. So you and your manager might come in and you can list out all of your priorities and then show you through just dividing up $10 where you're spending all of your time. And I've done this with people and we've sort of gotten down to like, \"I'm putting 10 cents here this week.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, what is that? 20 minutes, 30 minutes spending. I didn't think that's actually moving right.\" And so it's been great to see where people are overloaded and alignment on do my priorities stack up, but also am I spending the time on the most important things that could be moving the business forward?\n\nLenny (00:15:24):\nAwesome. Okay. So you mentioned that y'all are remote. Has it been remote from the beginning?\n\nMegan Cook (00:15:31):\nNo, not from the beginning. Actually when COVID hit, I think that was the big one.\n\nLenny (00:15:35):\nOkay, okay, got it. That makes sense. So a lot of companies are moving to remote work, trying to figure out how to work remotely. It seems like it's working really well for Atlassian, at least from what I can see. Is there any advice or any big lessons or tips or tricks you've learned that you could share for how to be effective working remotely, especially as a product manager? It feels like as a PM, the job has gotten so much harder having to be remote, and so yeah, I'm curious if you just have any advice you could share for people trying to make this work for their company or for themselves?\n\nMegan Cook (00:16:04):\nYeah, absolutely. It's a really good question because it's not easy and we definitely went through a whole bunch of pitfalls at the beginning, but we're really firm believers that you don't need to be in the office to build world-class products. So we call our product team anywhere, and this means that anyone Atlassian can choose where they want to work every day. We think it's a bit more human, that flexibility shouldn't be a perk, that it fundamentally can change people's lives depending on what else they have on outside of work. And so we think less about where do you work and we think more about how to be productive and effective in your work.\n\n(00:16:44):\nTo your point, we started doing this right when COVID hit, so it's been about three years and actually we just released a guide with our key learnings from that. It's all about a thousand days of remote work, which folks can go and find on our Work Life blog under research@atlassian.com if they want to dive in there more. But I can give you a couple of tips from that and what we found from some of our research.\n\nLenny (00:17:10):\nYeah. And we'll link to that doc in the show notes.\n\nMegan Cook (00:17:12):\nOkay, great. The first one is just making time for connection. So that human connection is definitely built in person, but what we found is that it doesn't have to be something that happens every single day. So we found the connection and productivity, they both get boosted by about 30% when you bring people together but intentionally, and it lasts them months. So we found that you can do it on average like three times a year. And so that's why my PM team are getting together every six months. But in addition to that, we get the entire team together every other six months. So we end up all getting together every four times a year.\n\n(00:17:53):\nSo every other six months, what we do is we get all of the engineers, designers, everybody who's working together. We book out entire floors in the office and then for an entire week we're just there. And for some of it we're just working together as you normally would, but at desks and just having those little water cooler type conversations. It builds the relationships again. Other times we're doing workshops, an important piece of work where it's easier to do when you're all in person and sometimes we're just having fun together. We call that a bit of a festival.\n\nLenny (00:18:27):\nYou mentioned that you measured some kind of productivity improvement. Do you happen to know how they measure that because that is really interesting?\n\nMegan Cook (00:18:35):\nOh, that's a good question. I don't, but I can get that for you.\n\nLenny (00:18:40):\nThat'd be cool to know. So I think we'll keep this in the podcast episode and then if there's anything in the show notes that we link to that talks about how they measure that, that'd be really interesting because that's just a cool stat to have anyway, for all kinds of other things. I'm curious how they measure that.\n\nMegan Cook (00:18:54):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nLenny (00:18:56):\nOkay, cool. Any other tips?\n\nMegan Cook (00:18:58):\nI think the second one is to be really intentional. I mentioned that we went through a few stumbling blocks at the start. One of those was immediately, everyone sort of filled up everybody's calendar with all of these meetings straight away. It was almost as if Lenny, if you and I were working together, I used to be able to just poke my head around my monitor and ask you something. And people were afraid that now that I can't do that, how do I get those answers? So I need more time with everybody and that definitely does not help productivity at all.\n\n(00:19:33):\nAnd so as PMs, we need time for creative work. We need that deep work time, and that doesn't happen when you've got all of these meetings with 30 minutes in between each of them. You need three to four hours to get that going, to get into that flow state. So my leadership team and I, we actually sync up our calendars, so we end up having these long stretches twice a week all at the same time. And so we all get a chance to do this deep work. It means we get less time for meetings, but it also means that if something comes up that's unexpected that we all need to work on together, then we've got that time there so we can be a bit more relaxed about it. We know we can get to it.\n\nLenny (00:20:14):\nWhat time of the day is that meeting?\n\nMegan Cook (00:20:16):\nThey're both at different times. So the first one's taking up one afternoon and the second one's taking up all of the time in the morning. Depending on what kind of person you are, one is going to see you better than the others. So we just went for one each.\n\nLenny (00:20:28):\nI actually had the same thing just personally where I had these deep worked blocked times on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The title of the invite was, \"If you book time during this, I'll slap you.\" And it really worked well. But I think you're talking about this other missing piece of remote work for PMs where you can't just walk by and ask an engineer, \"Hey, how's it going?\" Or ask a designer, \"Oh, where are you at? Let me just take a peek at what you're working on.\" That stuff I think is really hard to replicate. And if your suggestion is block out this time for your leadership team to be able to check in with each other, is the idea there it's deep work time and don't bother anyone on the team or is it you can also just ping your end manager and like, \"Hey, how's it going?\"\n\nMegan Cook (00:21:09):\nThe idea is that it's deep work time and it's your time to be protected to do that work. What I found that works really well, I think in the manager and report kind of relationship, so I have these really quick punchy one-on-ones with my reports every week. And then I make sure that I've got space in my calendar because something will come up where even if we had a longer one-on-one that might not cover it. They might just need an hour to run through something, there might be a really difficult strategy problem they've run into. And so they'll know that they can ping me for more time and I'll have that flex in my calendar for that.\n\nLenny (00:21:49):\nAwesome. Any other tips along those lines?\n\nMegan Cook (00:21:52):\nWell, you probably noticed about blocking a bunch of deep work time is that you don't have as much time for meetings. So that meeting time becomes really precious. And what we do there is... I personally hate having status updates as a meeting. So I make it really clear that if we're having a meeting, this is to solve a problem. And if it's just a status update, that's fine, then I can read that asynchronously at a time that works for me. And so can everybody else in the team if they want to do that. Actually we use our own tool for this, which makes it really easy. So it's called Atlas and it lets you or the team put in status updates for a goal or a project regularly and then it'll bundle it all up into an email so you can quickly get across everything that you're interested in, which has been really helpful.\n\n(00:22:40):\nAnd then that just makes the documentation rigorous as well. So you document things and we use Confluence, but all of our decisions, strategies, kickoffs for projects, that's all really well documented piny starters. Or even if you're a year down the line and you're thinking, \"Why didn't we come to that decision in the first place? What were our assumptions? What were our hypotheses?\" It's easy to go back and take a look at that and be able to reflect.\n\n(00:23:11):\nI think the last thing is I work with people who are in the US, they're in Europe, they're all over the world. It's really hard to find a time that works for an Aussie, an American and a European to get together. Someone's waking up at 3:00 AM or something. So what's become a big part of how we work is actually audio and video recordings. I actually had someone reporting to me for a while who was in France and what we would do was record videos back and forth and they're quick. You can just use colloquial language, they're really casual, you don't have to wonder about someone's tone that comes across. So that's becoming almost like a completely new document type for us and it's been really important in remote work. You can put at the top of a document and explain the document, which is really nice. It's a big part of why we bought Loom.\n\nLenny (00:24:06):\nI was just going to say that. It all makes sense.\n\nMegan Cook (00:24:09):\nYeah, because it was just becoming such a big part of our life and it's just massively helpful.\n\nLenny (00:24:16):\nKind of along the same lines, being fully remote, it is harder to get buy-in on things you're working on I imagine. And something I hear you're great at is getting buy-in, especially getting buy-in on ideas and projects from executives. So I think things that make it extra challenging at Atlassian, there's two CEOs which I didn't know until recently. You're also all very remote and so maybe those two reasons make it extra hard. Plus it's just generally hard to get buy-in on projects that you're working on. What advice do you share with product leaders, PMs that come to you asking for advice on how to get better at getting buy-in for your ideas?\n\nMegan Cook (00:24:56):\nYeah, this can be really hard to get right. I watch a lot of people struggle with this, and you're right, being fully remote can make it a bit more challenging. And then I think also you've got your cross-functional partners that you're working with as this tight-knit team and how do you form that relationship? But I'll start with just general buy-in.\n\n(00:25:17):\nMost of the time when people come to me and they want to ask how to get by-in, they've got a date in mind, they've got a particular meeting and they have this idea where they're going to crop this perfect proposal, they're going to present it, everyone's going to give them thumbs up and they win. And that's the wrong attitude I think even to start with to getting buy-in. It's more of a journey.\n\n(00:25:40):\nI'll give you an example where I was looking at how do people start their day in Jira and how do people get started in Jira? And we had this idea of we could craft more templates so that we could give people a better way to start with very different use cases when they came into the product. And this could change everything from even just the front homepage where they started all the way to what's happening in product. It would create this really nice flow.\n\n(00:26:12):\nJira is also a platform as well as just Jira software the product. There's actually four different products built on top of it. So when you want to go and change something like that, you're actually changing it for all of these different products. It's not just the one. And so what was really important there was partnering with a whole bunch of different stakeholders. So every product that this could potentially negatively or positively impact, we went to very early with the idea and the proposal and we got their feedback and then we came to them and again and again as we developed it further. So as we got designs, as we got more data, as we tested things out with users, we kept coming back and we take their feedback on board.\n\n(00:26:54):\nAnd so I think creating those partnerships is really important. And also the same can be true at the executive level. So often you go into these meetings where you're giving a proposal and you're trying to get that final yes on the decision. You've got a lot of people in there with a lot of different angles that they can look at that problem and so much good experience to draw on. So your CTO is going to have a totally different way of looking at something and different concerns from your chief marketing officer to your head of design. They're all going to look at things differently and be thinking about it differently. And so if you know that you're going to be having a big impact in someone's space and you want to hear from them, it's good to set that meeting up early when you've got some clarity but it's not fully fleshed out and so that you can fold in some of their concerns because they'll have this much broader view. And that also creates people who will be an advocate for you once you get into that room, that final meeting.\n\n(00:27:50):\nSo I think all of those in the lead up, there's a lot of lead up work to getting buy-in that makes sure that you have a good time in that meeting.\n\nLenny (00:28:00):\nJust to maybe summarize so far, which you've shared, one is just... Basically it's lieu people in early, especially the person that it's going to impact most.\n\nMegan Cook (00:28:08):\nI think in addition to that is having that mindset of being open to not necessarily coming up with the right solution, it's more about solving for the problem or the opportunity. So you want to be clear about your hypotheses and what are your facts and what are the principles you're using to make a decision and just be open to not necessarily ending up with the solution you thought would be best.\n\nLenny (00:28:34):\nI imagine most people think they are always in that state, \"I am very open to feedback. I am totally open-minded, but really they're not.\" Is there anything that you think would either convince someone you're actually not as open-minded as you seem or any advice for how to come across as more open-minded? Or is there anything that you see... I see this all the time. People think they're listening, but they're not. You should change.\n\nMegan Cook (00:28:56):\nI think one way to force yourself into that situation is to be clear about the hypotheses you have and the facts. So I think often people can present as, \"This is absolutely the case. This is what I know, and this is obviously the correct response to the situation.\" Where most of the time you've got a good set of data, you've got a good understanding with your knowledge of the space, but what is actually going to happen is a hypothesis. There's always going to be something you don't know and oftentimes you don't know until you ship it. That is absolutely the best test of whether or not what you thought was going to happen will actually happen.\n\n(00:29:41):\nAnd so I think when you come to the meeting going, okay, here's the top-back so we actually know, and here's the hypotheses and here's my plan to prove or disprove them, then you're exposing your idea for people to go, oh, here's more that I know about that hypotheses, or here's some data that you don't have or here's another way to think about it. I think people can feel like they're not going to be credible. That you have to come in, you have to come in confident, you have to come in knowing exactly what that solution is going to be. But I usually find that if you come in there open and you're exposed, you're thinking and where you could use some help on perspectives, that actually that builds more credibility because everyone knows that you are not going to have all the answers and you're not going to be able to see the future. And so that can really help in building people's trust in you and that you know what you're doing.\n\nLenny (00:30:34):\nIs there an example of that that comes to mind to make it even more real of either someone on your team doing that or you doing that? Because I think it's still going to be hard for people to realize, \"Hey, I'm not actually paying attention to anyone and I just want to convince them this idea is right. This is what we're doing. Just come on, get out of my way. Give me the okay.\"\n\nMegan Cook (00:30:51):\nAn example from my past is there was this potential acquisition that we could have made, and I was really, really keen on it because it would mean adding a whole bunch of much needed capability really quickly to the product. And I just loved that momentum and I didn't see any other way that we could do this. I'd looked at a bunch of other options about building it in-house and it just didn't seem possible. And there were a few people that I needed to convince, my boss, but also the head of engineering for the area. And when I took it to them, what I learned was the head of engineering was able to pull a bunch of people from other areas within the company to come and bolster this effort and who had all of the knowledge that we needed. So what seemed like the impossible task, he actually had this extra knowledge to make possible.\n\n(00:31:45):\nAnd in the end, acquisition or not, that doesn't really matter. It's more about being able to get that value back to our customers. That's what we're solving for. And so it was really about coming back, not falling in love with that solution and that other company, it was just taking a step back and going, \"Okay, well, really it's just what are we here to do? What's the real goal at the end of the day?\"\n\nLenny (00:32:11):\nAwesome. Okay. Is there anything else you wanted to share along these lines before I move on to a different topic?\n\nMegan Cook (00:32:16):\nThe other thing I would say is that setting up the meeting when you finally get there can be really important as well. I often see people go in there and they've got a big document or a presentation or something and they just launch into it. They're really excited. But actually you want to take a step back and you want to be really clear on what are you looking for from that group. You can ask for the decision, you can ask for feedback, you can ask for... You can expose where you're not quite sure about something and you want them to be thinking about that angle in particular and helping test that hypothesis with what they know. And so setting that early, you can put that in people's heads as they read through your document or listen to the rest of the proposal.\n\n(00:33:02):\nThen I find it's really useful to have a narrative that just encompasses everything that you're going to talk about. So just really brief, what's the current situation, what has changed and what are the implications that you now want to... We mean we have a problem to solve and an opportunity that we can go after.\n\n(00:33:21):\nAnd the last thing is just making sure you've got your data. There's executives, there's people in the meeting. They're usually across a whole ton of stuff just hearing about... Maybe they've got 10 proposals a day and they're across all different areas in the business, and so they're not going to have the detail that you do. So being really thoughtful about what you bring, what are the key points that are going to help them understand the situation as clearly as possible. But then really knowing your data so that you can dive in more detail where they need it. And that also helps build your credibility and builds people's confidence in the plan to go ahead.\n\nLenny (00:34:05):\nWould you mind just quickly summarizing these pieces of advice and then I was going to move on to another area of strength of yours that I hear?\n\nMegan Cook (00:34:13):\nYeah, sure. So the first one is to find people who are affected negatively or positively or might have a really good point of view and partner with them as you develop the solution or the response to the current situation. And the second one is to come at it with this mindset of being open, of being really key on what is the core problem or the value that you want to deliver, and just being open to how you get there and things that you don't know which might adjust along the way. And the last one is just setting up the meeting walls. So coming in, making sure that it's very clear what you need. Do you need a decision or something like that? And making sure that you've got very good supporting data to build that credibility with your audience.\n\nLenny (00:35:03):\nLove it. This is where the term or the cliche of product managers asking, \"But what problem are we trying to solve,\" comes from. But it comes from a really important place of always focusing on let's all align on here's the problem we're solving. Because oftentimes as you chatted about, the biggest disagreements come from people just thinking they're solving different problems. And on that note, I have a Swag Store now, lennyswag.com, and we have stickers on there, a bunch of cliche PM terms including, \"But what problem are we trying to solve?\" And so I think that's... But it's rooted in, that's actually a really important question to ask. Sometimes you get annoying.\n\nMegan Cook (00:35:38):\nYeah, that's such a good sticker to have front and center.\n\nLenny (00:35:42):\nJust need that as a big sign. Maybe the sticker needs to be bigger.\n\nMegan Cook (00:35:44):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:35:48):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth.

Get started today.\n\n(00:36:45):\nOkay, something else that I hear you're incredibly good at, and it's actually related to all of these things we've been talking about, is the way someone described you is you're really good at fighting the good fight, which essentially is just doing the things that need to be done that aren't necessarily popular or that people are prioritizing right now. I hear that you led to a big investment in CSAT at Atlassian because you just felt like this was the right way of doing it. And there's a few other projects that came out of just like, \"I'm just going to do the thing that needs to be done.\" Can you just talk about why that's important to you, what impact that sort of had, and then just how you actually successfully do that? Obviously it ties into this skill of getting buy-in on stuff.\n\nMegan Cook (00:37:24):\nI think that's a really good example actually, the CSAT example, because sometimes you can get caught up in let's add value, add value, add value to the product, but if the customer aren't satisfied with what you built, or in our case we found that one of the core reasons was the usability, it wasn't where it needed to be. Then we can't access that value anyway. It doesn't matter. And sometimes it can be hard to get investment for things like that because it's not like the shiny, exciting new thing. It's no, I want to work on the features we already have and improve those. So it was about two years ago, our chief experience officer, he cared really deeply about improving our CSAT scores and asked me to look into it. And this-\n\nLenny (00:38:12):\nBriefly explain CSAT real quick. Some people may not be familiar with that term.\n\nMegan Cook (00:38:17):\nOh yeah, yeah, absolutely. Of course. CSAT means customer satisfaction. So for us, we actually have a survey so that we can measure CSAT and it just asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with the product and then different aspects so we can see for different tasks that they need to perform or different aspects of it, like the reliability or the speed or the usability. How do customers feel about that?\n\nLenny (00:38:48):\nWe actually had a podcast episode recently Judd, where we talking about NPS and how much there's data showing it's not actually a great predictor of anything, and he's a big fan of CSAT instead. So you could almost think of it as little replacement for NPS in a lot of cases. And I'm sorry, pushed you off track. Keep going.\n\nMegan Cook (00:39:05):\nYeah, no worries. So he cared really deeply about this, asked me to look into it. Even though this request was coming from the top, that doesn't mean that it gets any sort of funding. So we went through a couple of different steps to see what was worth investing in here. First of all, I mentioned we had that survey and so we had really rich feedback. So it's not just a rating, what we get, we get people talking about why they gave that rating and that can really help us zero in on what are the key aspects that's bringing this down. And we also had great conversations with our customers. It was the kinds of conversations that are really rich and really helpful, but so painful to listen to and go through because you're seeing somebody really struggle with something that you thought was going to bring them so much value.\n\n(00:39:58):\nAnd then we had a look at, well, what is this going to impact? And so logically it's what we found was that usability was one of the key reasons, like I said. And logically, if your product is hard to use in places, if some of the core actions are hard for people to do, then a new user to that product or a new customer is going to have a longer ramp up time. You've got a harder time showing them that there's value. And even for an existing customer that's using your product really well, when they bring on a new user, that user might have a really hard time getting up to speed and using it and it just completely slows them down. So from a business point of view, it can impact your new customer acquisition as well as your ability to expand. So there was some good revenue connections in there as well.\n\n(00:40:52):\nWhat I also found was that we have a lot of dependencies. So we've got all of these platform teams and a lot of the improvements that would be really good to make to sort out this problem depended on many, many teams around Atlassian. And they all had different goals and other products that they had to serve too. I don't know if you've ever tried to align three or four different roadmaps so that the timing is just right to get some improvement through, but it's basically impossible. There was no way that was going to happen. But we did find that they were really passionate about this area and improving usability. So we worked together to find a low cost way for those teams to help us make the changes that we need to, but they didn't have to bear the brunt of all the development costs.\n\n(00:41:39):\nSo each of those teams flipped forward, we call them a shepherd, so that as our developers came in and made changes in the code base that this shepherd would make sure that they weren't causing any issues and we're doing reviews and reviews of designs and things like that. And so getting that buy-in, finding the data to support the reason why this was important. And then we constructed the roadmap so that we found this sort of a low cost, very cheap way to have some impactful change early on. I think that was really, really important. And so we put together just some of the designs for what the experiences were going to look like.\n\n(00:42:24):\nSo our head of design, Charlie Sutton at the moment has this great mantra of show don't tell. And in this case, it was just at the core of getting people excited because you could show the initial experience, you could show the pain, you could bring in a video of the customer trying to use it and what they thought of it. And that just really brought that emotional aspect to it. It helped get people on board on the issue, the new experience, which is just far and away molds better, might cut out like 20 clicks or whatever. And so all that worked together to get the investment that we needed.\n\n(00:43:04):\nI think the last thing that was useful there actually is that we started pretty small too. So I think if you have a hypothesis and you can start small, you can get that investment more easily, you can show success, you can always build on that in the future to get more and more. But in this case, we got about 40 people to come and join onto this. And then as we shipped things, we just made sure that it kept being quite small. And so we got that momentum really quickly. We kept with regular updates, we kept up the excitement about what the team was doing.\n\n(00:43:38):\nAt one stage, the team picked out something that was pretty impactful throughout the whole thing. So that was dark mode. That took a lot of coordination around the whole company to make that thing happen. But it was well overdue, we loved it. And then the feedback that we got as well really helps with that. Actually just yesterday, I saw some feedback on one of the changes we'd made recently, and this customer said it was the best quality of life improvement they've seen in a long time, which just the way that's phrased even, that gets you excited about the impact that you're having on that person.\n\nLenny (00:44:20):\nAnd this was the CSAT work or the dark mode?\n\nMegan Cook (00:44:24):\nThis was CSAT work. This was improving one of the processes.\n\nLenny (00:44:28):\nOkay, cool. That's amazing. There's a lot of stuff I love about this story. One is just the power of just empowering yourself to do things that you believe need to be done. There's a lot of PMs and just people in general that just assume they don't have any power and the square peg they're in is just all they're going to be able to do and nobody's going to allow them to do things that they believe are important and no one else agrees with. So I think there's just a lot of power in just understanding that you have more power and leverage and agency than you probably think you do, but then you also have to do it well. So I took a bunch of notes as you were talking of the things that I think are core to getting stuff like this done, just a scrappy project that you're kind of doing on your own without a lot of buy-in from the top initially.\n\n(00:45:14):\nSo I want to stay small. Two is make it visual and visceral so you can like, \"Oh wow, I could see this being amazing,\" and getting people excited as you go. Making it really easy for people I think is a really interesting takeaway there. Just like, \"We did all the work for you already for these other teams, it's going to be so easy. It's not going to be a lot of work for you.\" And then showed the data like, \"Here's what we've gotten from CSAT so far, here's the impact you'll probably get from it. Here's how much work it'll take.\" Show actual data. And then keep it scrappy. It feels like a lot of this is just like stay small, keep it scrappy, don't ask for a lot of resources initially and just kind of show momentum.\n\nMegan Cook (00:45:50):\nI think that's really important. When you keep it scrappy and small in the beginning, it doesn't feel like it's as big of a bet, but that gives you the opportunity to really prove that the direction that you're going in could pay off. And so it's sort of like this little inroad to getting more investment.\n\nLenny (00:46:07):\nAwesome. Okay. I want to move to a different topic around Atlassian as a company, but is there anything else you wanted to share along those lines before we do that?\n\nMegan Cook (00:46:15):\nNo, let's go for it.\n\nLenny (00:46:17):\nOkay. One of the most interesting things about Atlassian to me is it's a great example of a company that's been able to launch new product lines. This is the dream of every software company business in general is you start with one product that gets to a certain point and then you hit some kind of plateau, and then you add an additional business product line, and then you add more and more. Somewhere around Atlassian's 15 products. Is that an accurate number?\n\nMegan Cook (00:46:43):\nYeah, that's right. Yeah, we are up to 15. Yes.\n\nLenny (00:46:45):\nJesus Christ. Amazing. So this is very rare and the dream of many companies. And so I'm just curious what it is you think Atlassian has done so right to have so many successful individual products?\n\nMegan Cook (00:46:59):\nYou know what, it's not like we added the first product and got it just right way off the bat. So yeah, 15, we've had a lot of shots at this, so I might talk about two examples. I think the first one, if I think about Jira software, it started just as a really humble bug tracker. That was it. There wasn't as much to it, and then it sort of weathered these massive changes in how people build software. So it launched in 2003. And if I remember correctly, just to date this, the mobile phone that was most popular at the time was the Nokia 6100. I don't know if you ever had one of those.\n\nLenny (00:47:41):\nI don't remember what that specific one was, but I'm picturing a Nokia phone. It's like a little small brick.\n\nMegan Cook (00:47:47):\nYeah, it was my mother-in-law's favorite phone. It took us forever to get her off that onto something better. But there's a lot that's changed since that time. There's been agile, there's been cloud. And what we saw recently was more in the expansion of software teams. So they used to be extremely developer centric. And I think most people when they think about Jira software, they think, oh, that must be, well, 80% developers that are using it. But actually it's more like 50% or maybe just shy of 50% are developers. And the rest is this huge mix of support in operations, in sales and marketing, finance, design, HR, legal, just this massive mix of everybody, all the roles you could think of in a company basically that get in there and make work happen.\n\n(00:48:36):\nAnd so what we saw years ago was, well, software teams aren't just developers anymore. And we saw this in our teams as well, but we saw that these other teams, the finance, the marketing teams, even design teams were sort of cobbling together their own solutions. So Jira software is incredibly flexible, which is a massive pro of it. That these teams were seeing software teams get more effective at the way they were getting work done and collaborating better. And they wanted that same benefit and they started using Jira, but we hadn't set it up well for them at all. So it was quite difficult for them to do that. But the positive was that there was this really good signal from our users that they were looking for more from us, and we knew that your marketing team is going to work differently from your developer team. That's how it should be. And so we started Jira work management to be more focused on all of these other use cases outside of the software team that our users were asking us to go ahead and solve.\n\n(00:49:36):\nSo that was a really great way to discover the need for a new product. Were these really strong signals from within our customers in that same area of business that we're really well set up to help them learn.\n\nLenny (00:49:50):\nWhat was that process like from noticing, \"Hey, designers are using Jira and they're not having a good time. PMs are using Jira, researchers, and here's the issues they're running.\" So just that insight of like, \"Oh, interesting. There might be an opportunity here to launching.\" I don't know the first version. I don't know if you're actually involved in this, but whatever you can share would be awesome. Where there design partners they all chose and like let's work with Salesforce and Microsoft and make sure they love it? How long was that process? Because I think that's the prop people are so curious about just how do we validate and discover and then actually launch something that's going to work.\n\nMegan Cook (00:50:28):\nYeah, I was just as close to that one, but I can give you a second example.\n\nLenny (00:50:33):\nOh, great.\n\nMegan Cook (00:50:35):\nYeah, for sure. The second example actually came from our product internal innovation program and that we let anyone pitch an idea for new product in the company if they want to. So we had this wonderful product manager, Tammy Carson, who saw a demand for a solution for product managers to build their roadmaps a bit better before ideas get committed. So as you know, this is fuzzy area before you actually start building something as a product manager where you're looking at lots of opportunities and ideas and you're prioritizing them. And it's not really confirmed real work yet. And nobody wanted to put that in Jira because once it was in Jira, then everyone just expected it to happen. And so this is where Jira product discovery came from.\n\n(00:51:24):\nAnd in the past we'd tried things like this before in new products at Atlassian and they've been successful, but it'd been really hard because large parts of the company process and those checks were optimizing for the success of the bigger products like Jira software. And so we changed that to create really small groups with stage gates that we call wonder, explore, make, impact, and then getting to scale. And that meant to assess those bets at every stage. And the idea was to iterate really quickly, either to it not working out and proving that it couldn't be a business or iterate really quickly to yes it could and we should invest more in this. And so with each stage there would be a little bit of investment.\n\n(00:52:12):\nSo you say that for a stage of wonder might just be the person with the idea. And then explore, you might add on a couple more people, like three people to go and really have a look at, here's a prototype, here are some customers that'd be interested in it and could help us think about this some more and put together what the roadmap looks like. And then when you get to make that's when you get a full team, but a full team is going to be 12 people or so, it's still not huge. And I think that's really important because at each stage you're getting validation, you're getting more customers who are interested and invested in helping you develop what that solution looks like.\n\n(00:52:56):\nYou asked about whether we went and partnered with a partner company like Salesforce for something like this, for a new product. In this case it was just really partnering heavily with our customers where we saw that interest coming through in our other products like Jira software and building something that really works for them before expanding it to more and more customers and finding that product market fit and then upping the investment. And so we've had a couple of new products recently that have gone through that sort of stage rollout. So there's Jira Product Discovery, there's Atlas that I mentioned before, and I think Compass is the latest one.\n\nLenny (00:53:36):\nSo what I'm hearing here is essentially there's this step-by-step gated process that you put new product ideas through and they make it one step at a time. And I imagine there's a leader that can decide, \"No, this one's not working out. Let's end it at the explorer phase and invest in other ideas.\" I imagine\n\nMegan Cook (00:53:56):\nYeah, that's right. It might be someone who's looking after that particular market. At each one of those stages, there's that check on whether or not we continue to go ahead.\n\nLenny (00:54:08):\nAnd the stages are wonder. I like that a lot. That's a great name. Explore, make, and then what were the other ones?\n\nMegan Cook (00:54:16):\nImpact and scale.\n\nLenny (00:54:18):\nGot it. So impact is like is it showing any impact? We made it, is it working? And then scale. Got it. That makes sense. Just like let's go for it.\n\nMegan Cook (00:54:25):\nYeah. Impact could be I can be self-sufficient in the revenue that I'm generating, and scale is just really launching it to take off.\n\nLenny (00:54:35):\nLaunch it. Yeah, it goes on the website. Okay. So wonder is like a PM and an engineer maybe at Hackathon where we have an idea. Explore is they maybe get a little bit of resourcing and they start exploring the idea, build the prototype, maybe find a design partner too, to think about this. Is that roughly right?\n\nMegan Cook (00:54:52):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:54:52):\nOkay.\n\nMegan Cook (00:54:52):\nMake sure you've got a clear roadmap. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:54:54):\nOkay, got it. And then make, is that where they expand it to a few more customers and make it more fully featured?\n\nMegan Cook (00:55:04):\nYeah. Make is where you'd actually build it. So the prototype-\n\nLenny (00:55:09):\nOkay, got it.\n\nMegan Cook (00:55:10):\n... could be pretty simple, could be a bit cobbled together, make is actually building the product and see if you can get more and more customers.\n\nLenny (00:55:14):\nGot it.\n\nMegan Cook (00:55:15):\nThat's where you'd start to make it with those customers.\n\nLenny (00:55:19):\nThis is really interesting because again, I think Atlassian is one of the very few companies that has done this so well. And I don't know, this number is absurd. I've never heard of another company that's 15 successful products. I don't know how successful they're, but they're out there and people seem to be... They're being promoted. I guess is there any other advice to share along the lines of if someone is thinking about launching a second product, anything you would suggest they do or think about they may not be thinking about?\n\nMegan Cook (00:55:42):\nI think my advice is skied towards the Atlassian case, which is where you're in a 12,000 strong employee company and how do you seed something that you want to run as more with more of a startup kind of mindset. So when you get to this size, you've got quarterly planning and business reviews and all of these different process and you don't necessarily want to put your seed startup through that. It's not quite ready for that kind of thing. So I think the key things here that make it really successful is starting really small with the idea and the solution to be proved and don't add too many people, don't feel pressured to add too many people. I think it's easy to get really excited about the potential and just want to throw four or five teams at it, but that can... We were talking about this stat. That can make things run slower and so you want to protect them.\n\n(00:56:39):\nAnd the second thing is just give them freedom to move really fast and solve those problems in a different way. So there are different expectations. They don't necessarily need to be a part of that process that I was talking about before. This team should just be running hard to prove whether or not the idea's going to work and whether there's product market fit.\n\n(00:56:59):\nAnd for different approaches. If I want to add something to Jira software, but we're talking millions and millions of users there, that thing has to be resilient. It's got to scale. There are all these things that users inherently expect from something like that. But for something small like this, we are proving product market fit. You don't need to think about that initially. So you've got to hold this to a different standard, otherwise you're just going to slow them down way too much.\n\n(00:57:25):\nAnd actually we found that by letting them tackle problems a little differently, we found innovative way of looking at things that we can pull back into our other products. So for example, if you look at Jira Product Discovery, and just the way that it gives more of a spreadsheet kind of view of a list of ideas and things like that, some of the experience there is definitely something that we'll be pulling into Jira software.\n\nLenny (00:58:00):\nYou mentioned that over the years, Jira has weathered many storms. From my perspective, it feels like it continues to weather many storms incredibly well. One, because there's just endless startups always coming at Jira trying to become the new project management tool that everyone uses. And two, it just feels like people are always dissing on Jira like, \"Jira sucks, I want to use something else.\" On the other hand, it continues to dominate. Many people love it. I'm curious what you believe Atlassian generally has done and your team has done to keep Jira ahead of everyone. And I know you're probably going to say, \"We listen to customers better than anyone.\" So if that's a big part of the answer, definitely share that. But I'm curious, is there anything else people may not be recognizing of just why Jira has been so successful for so long?\n\nMegan Cook (00:58:46):\nYeah. I think the number of startups that enter this space, just so it shows how important the problem is that we solve and that problem of teamwork and collaboration. We've got more than 125,000 customers around the world who start their day in Jira, millions of users and the kinds of companies that use it. I just love hearing about what they do with it. They really blow me away. Like NASA landing the Mars rover or Canva building this design platform for 40 million people, it's just massive.\n\nLenny (00:59:23):\nI don't think you can beat that Mars rover story array. That's a good one. I think when you follow it up with the Canvas story, that one's less interesting now, but it's also amazing. Okay. Sorry. Keep going.\n\nMegan Cook (00:59:33):\nSo like you said, they are integral to our success. We do obsess over them. We think if we do right by them, then we're going to be going in the right direction. I don't think we've ever had this sense of arrogance of just... No matter how big we are, we've always got this healthy dose of paranoia that we need to keep working on improving things and being better. So to your point about customer feedback, that is a big part of it. We bake in these rituals just to make it super easy for everyone to do that. So the whole company gets an email every week and it's just got a random selection of feedback from our customers. It's got how they rate us and just a quote as well. And so everyone's sort of getting this dose of feedback all the time.\n\n(01:00:24):\nWe have regular share outs of all of the research that everyone gets. We get in-product feedback. We make it super easy to talk to our customers through social media or LinkedIn or X now. And then we also have a whole community space where customers can have longer conversations with us about different ideas that we're coming up with or feedback that they have for us. So I think that is all massively important for keeping Jira ahead of the pack.\n\n(01:00:58):\nI think how we stay ahead in other areas is just that the culture is super, super open to innovation, kind of invites innovation. So we have these hackathons, we call them shepherd. The whole company stops and everyone can play with new ideas or technologies. It's a competition. So the best ideas get visibility. It can get people working with other people that they wouldn't normally. And also the visibility of the ideas helps generate more ideas all over the place.\n\n(01:01:31):\nLike I said before, innovation can come from anywhere. So anyone can pitch new ideas or products. And when we see new technologies emerging that we think are going to be really foundational and interesting, we'll carve off a team to go and look at that. So I think we've had an AI team central to Atlassian for a long time, but with the advent of ChatGPT, there's sort of this huge move forward. There's this leak that's happening. And so in my team, I just carved off a small team to go and explore that and see what interesting things that we could do there.\n\n(01:02:09):\nI think we don't shy away from tackling subsets of the market that we're seeing that need a bit more love, like the Jira Product Discovery story that we were just talking about a second ago. And we also use our products a lot and that helps us find all of those little problems and makes it really real. We get really excited about the different things that the whole team is working on. We send lots of feedback to each other. I think that's also a really important part of it.\n\n(01:02:42):\nAnother area is when we look at how we're investing, there's always this pressure to invest in the core business, of course, but we also make sure that we invest in seeding future businesses. And like we're talking about, they might not always work out. So we had then the Compass and the Atlas example of ones that have worked out, but we also see things through Atlassian inventions. So if there are interesting ideas or technologies, these might support the products later on, that's something that we'll go and seed out there in the market. And that's led to a few acquisitions there as well, which has been really useful.\n\n(01:03:21):\nAnd the last thing is I think I am just really impressed at the way that we stay agile to move towards these different shifts that come up. It always surprises me just how agile we can be. For example, in 2020 we decided to double down on our mission to deliver a world-class cloud experience. And it was like hundreds of people just moved around in Atlassian to make that happen, which was in a very short period of time, which was impressive. And we're not shy about killing things off with their [inaudible 01:03:55]. So I'll give you another example of one of those products that was going through that we ended up killing off. So we had a whiteboard product that we thought would be its own product, sort of like a Jira Product Discovery. And when we came to one of those gates with the team, we realized actually this is more a really useful document type. And so now you'll see that it's a feature in Confluence. It was very quick to make that decision.\n\nLenny (01:04:28):\nI have this new segment, not that new anymore, called Failure Corner. I'm curious if you have any interesting story of a big failure in your career. And if you do, what you learned from that experience?\n\nMegan Cook (01:04:41):\nI think I'll give you a bit of a different one because I think this one is harder to spot and I think that's really interesting. It's something that I think about all the time though. So I missed a really big opportunity to move Atlassian forward back in the day. And I, like I said, think about it every time I review a new idea or look at an opportunity that we're thinking about.\n\n(01:05:06):\nSo I was on this team and I was improving the way that our products help developers get their work done. And so typically we saw them start in Jira software. They'd pick up a piece of work and then they'd switch tools. They'd create a brand, they'd start writing code. And we noticed that they would forget to come back and update the status of their work and this could create a lot of confusion in the team. Another developer could pick up that work thinking it wasn't started and then there was a lot of wasted time. Or if you're trying to track metrics like how long does it take for a piece of work to get started through to done? That'll totally ski things. So this was causing a lot of problems.\n\n(01:05:42):\nBut we didn't want to make developers come back into the tool that was obviously something that was getting in the way of their work. So we decided to build automation so they didn't have to leave their ID or the command line to do that. They can just keep working. So an example is Jira would detect that a new command had been created and then it could automatically move your piece of work to in progress because there's code being written against it. And there were a whole bunch of these examples that parties integrated into it and I made the decision to put into Jira as a user was editing their workflow and we shipped it and it performed just fine. People discovered it, they used it, and seemed to give a lot of value. People liked it, which doesn't really sound like a fail. I don't think that...\n\n(01:06:33):\nWhere I dropped the ball was more about what I should have realized about that feature. So automation, it's super useful. It can be used by a whole slew of people who aren't just developers. It could be used in every single product. It's more than just moving things to a new status. And so I should have realized that we could have built this amazing service that every product could have moved themselves forward with. And years later, Atlassian actually acquired a company that did exactly that, this advanced automation. And it's in every product now. And so you can imagine how much it costs to acquire a company. That was a really extensive mistake on my part. So when I see a new idea, I'm always asking myself, \"How do we push this further? Is there something there that we can 10X? Can we apply it more broadly to more types of users, more products? Is there some bigger opportunity that we can really take advantage of?\"\n\nLenny (01:07:31):\nThat's an awesome story. So the lesson there is just think bigger with the products. You almost need to wait for it to first be successful for you just to be like, \"Oh, but can we do something more with this?\" Do you think you should have been thinking about that as you were building it or would that have been too early?\n\nMegan Cook (01:07:47):\nNo, I think I should have caught that as we were building it, because even when I think about the experience, so it was a really good proving ground for it for sure. But even when I think about the experience, just where that experience was designed and product limited its functionality, which is a real shame.\n\nLenny (01:08:07):\nI guess the takeaway there is just if you're committing to some idea, ask yourself what would it look like if this was 10 times bigger? If this was a bigger deal, can this apply to other things we're doing? Is that right?\n\nMegan Cook (01:08:21):\nYeah. Where could this go in three years, five years? And should that change the way that you think about it now?\n\nLenny (01:08:29):\nGreat advice. Megan, is there anything else that you wanted to share or is there anything you wanted to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nMegan Cook (01:08:39):\nI'll leave you with something. And it's just this practice that I've found really useful for my squad that we've implemented pretty recently, and especially with remote work and all of that. So like I said, we have limited time together, but what we put into place is something we called Fight Club. I'll probably get in trouble for talking about Fight Club. The first rule is you don't talk about fight club.\n\nLenny (01:09:05):\nEveryone knows that.\n\nMegan Cook (01:09:08):\nIt's 30 minutes every week. And it's just for myself, my engineering and my design leader, and we get together and we know that we're going in there to have a conflict. I think often when there's difficult conversations or those conflicts come up, you can put them off until they become much bigger. Or if somebody is conflict adverse, they can try to avoid having it at all. But by having a specific sort of time in your week for something like that, then you're sort of in that mindset. You know you're going in there to solve a hard problem. You know that there's going to be a disagreement and it makes it much better. And I think the relationship we all have is so much better because we get on top of these things early.\n\nLenny (01:09:53):\nThis is super cool. It's like couples therapy or something where you're just like, \"What issues do we have? Let's work through them right now.\" I love that. I love that. And it makes it okay to bring up things that are bothering you and things that you think need to change. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nMegan Cook (01:10:12):\nYes, can't wait. Let's do it.\n\nLenny (01:10:14):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nMegan Cook (01:10:19):\nLook, I have a habit of sending books to everyone who reports to me every year just on a skill they're working on. So I've got a huge list that I actually send out, but the one that I send out the most to new PMs especially is just inspired by Marty Cagan. It holds up really well. It was recommended to me by my first boss, and it's just got a bunch of great tips in there, just great foundational knowledge.\n\n(01:10:49):\nMore recently, what I've been sending out for my managers is Scaling People by Claire Hughes Johnson. I think that just came out within the last year actually, but it's just got an incredible amount of really useful tactical things, templates, all sorts of things that you can put into practice.\n\nLenny (01:11:11):\nGreat choices. We have both in the bookshelf behind me. Both of them have been on the podcast. I wish I could see the whole list of books that you recommend to people. If you don't have this written out anywhere, you should publish some kind of blog or newsletter post of here's the skill and here's the book you recommend.\n\nMegan Cook (01:11:26):\nOh, that's a great idea. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Thanks.\n\nLenny (01:11:29):\nRight, you have a homework assignment. Okay, next question. What is the favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nMegan Cook (01:11:35):\nI am so late to TV, but Foundation is the one that I've been binging lately, and I think it's just this huge world. And I'm not usually one that gets super into sci-fi, but the way that it brings forward some of these ideas for what new technologies could mean... If you haven't seen it, and this is really spoiling it, one of the main characters or three of the main characters are actually clones of this emperor who rules the universe and decided to clone himself at three different stages of his life so that those people could continue rolling. And I think even that idea just invites the idea of what if we stretched out human life? What are the impact? How do things advance when you've got that same mindset and same people continue on? It's super compelling.\n\nLenny (01:12:28):\nFoundation, the show got ruined for me by reading the books many, many years ago, is one of my favorite sci-fi trilogy of all time. And then I was so excited for the show and has nothing to do with the books, basically. It's like the storyline is completely different, the core idea is the same as the only real. So I just got tired of it and stopped. But if you haven't read the books, I think you would love it. It's beautiful.\n\nMegan Cook (01:12:50):\nAre the books better?\n\nLenny (01:12:53):\nYeah, the books are better. The books are always better, I think is a good rule of thumb.\n\nMegan Cook (01:13:00):\nYeah, that is a good rule. I'll probably pick that up.\n\nLenny (01:13:00):\nYeah. I was like a teenager when I read them, so I don't know. Maybe they suck, but I think people love them. Highly recommend the books if you liked the show especially. Next question, do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates?\n\nMegan Cook (01:13:12):\nI think it's an old one, but a great one on the subject of failure. I love to ask people about their biggest failure and I think it's a good way to get to know somebody because you can see how introspective they are, how much they think about what's happened and what they learned from it. It shows whether or not they can be vulnerable with you. You can see what they consider to be a big failure. Some people will list something that's not really a failure. And also you can see about whether they've got that growth mindset. So have they learned something from that? Have they applied it moving forward?\n\n(01:13:51):\nWeird rule that I've found is that a lot of the best hires that I've had has had big failure stories that they've worked through and learned from. And so I think that's great to see what they consider there, what the learnings are, but also in the solution you can also see how they tackle something like that. So are they the type of person who wants to go and forge something all by themselves? Are they the type of person who will pull together a community to figure something out? So you get that insight into their values and their approach from that question too, which is hugely useful.\n\nLenny (01:14:30):\nIs there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nMegan Cook (01:14:34):\nYeah. You might have to stop me from going on and on about this, but I recently got a smoker, a Traeger smoker for smoking meat. And just the unboxing experience was incredible. So you get this huge box, cardboard box, you open it up. If you reverse the cardboard box, it becomes like a play saloon that your kid can jump into and just mess around in which-\n\nLenny (01:15:02):\nWow, that's cool.\n\nMegan Cook (01:15:03):\n... rather than just throwing it out, it becomes something really cool and useful. The set of instructions has a six-pack of beer at the top, just helps you understand how far through you should be through your six-pack as you're constructing it. You get some tools with it. And they're really good actually. They're not the usual kind of throwaway tools that you get in something to put together something like this. In addition to that sort of playful delightfulness in there, as you build it, you discover things along the way. So I opened up the hopper where you put in your wood pellets and there was a baseball cap, a tray of baseball cap in there, which was unexpected and really cool. And then the whole experience of actually using it once you've set it up is amazing. So it's all connected to my phone. I can just head to the beach and have some brisket going and come home and it's beautifully done. It just works. It's integrated. It's got integrated recipes. Yeah, I love that. I like that one.\n\nLenny (01:16:12):\nAnd salt. That sounds so delightful. Such a great product experience. I'm going to have to get one I think. I think we're going to sell some Traeger smokers.\n\nMegan Cook (01:16:17):\nSure.\n\nLenny (01:16:22):\nNext question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends, either in work or in life?\n\nMegan Cook (01:16:28):\nIt's around maximizing joy. And what I mean by that is it's about finding what's important and leaning into it or finding what's annoying and turning it into something I enjoy. To give you a super small example is I'm terrible with keys. I will leave that thing all over the place. You'll find it in my cutlery drawer or whatever, and I'll never find it again. And I think an obvious solution to that could be to put a hook on the wall or something where you can just leave them and you go back to that and it's easy to find. But what gives me joy is not actually having to have keys at all. And so now I have a fingerprint reader on my front door and I feel a little bit like James Bond every time I enter my house and I can let people in if somebody needs to leave a package or something that's easy to do. So it was turning something annoying into something more joyful.\n\n(01:17:24):\nAnd I think the other thing there is just I really value keeping great relationships and increasing those relationships. And so I always make time for these amazing friends that I have that live in London, and we have this pact where every time either one of us goes to the others' continent, we'll go meet them there. So every time I go to Europe, which last year I was in Berlin, at one point in Amsterdam, and on the plane, they came over and we just hung out and had a great time. And so it's making sure that you make time for those important things.\n\nLenny (01:18:00):\nAlong the same lines, final question related to creating more joy. I noticed a beautiful surfboard behind you. For somebody that's trying to surf and maybe not being successful, what's one tip you could share with listeners to improve their success with surfing?\n\nMegan Cook (01:18:18):\nIsn't surfing the most humbling sport that you've ever tried?\n\nLenny (01:18:22):\nYeah, I've tried a few times and yeah, I would say so.\n\nMegan Cook (01:18:29):\nI think surfing's really interesting. I've never done a sport like it in that it's something that you have to really feel. So I find every time you learn and you think about surfing, you sort of feel it before you know how to do it. So even just being able to catch a wave, a green pace wave, you're paddling, you're paddling, you don't quite know where to be, you don't quite know how much to paddle for that wave, and you just have to sort of be successful a couple times before you get the feel for it. And it's the same with trying to find the right wave. When I looked at the ocean the first time to try and pick the wave and pick where to be, I couldn't even see the shape of it to find that right place. It took me just seeing a hundred waves to be able to do that.\n\n(01:19:15):\nSo my best tip for surfing is get out there, keep doing it, do it over and over and over again. You will get better. You'll start to see all of these things that you've never noticed before. And get some friends. Get some friends out there, get surfing accountability buddy to make sure that you're getting out there often.\n\nLenny (01:19:37):\nHe's the best buddy. Amazing. Megan, we've talked about play and safety and buy-in and fighting the good fight and adding new product lines, also surfing. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on some stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMegan Cook (01:19:55):\nThe best place to find me is on LinkedIn. I'm Megan Cook on LinkedIn. You can also find me if you're a customer in the Atlassian community, if you want to have a chat. And I'm also on social media, so on X, you can find me there as well. And be useful to me. Look, any feedback, absolutely any feedback on Jira software, always hungry for that. Also, really keen, if you want to just chat about how people's ways of working are evolving and shifting and changing, and how do you think that's going to turn out and how you see your goals for your team changing. I would love to talk about that. Please get in touch.\n\nLenny (01:20:37):\nAwesome. Megan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nMegan Cook (01:20:40):\nThank you, Lenny. It's been fun.\n\nLenny (01:20:42):\nSame. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:20:44):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# She turned 100+ rejections into a $42B company | Melanie Perkins\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nThere's a very famous story about Canva. Early on, you pitched over a hundred investors and over a hundred investors said no to you.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:00:06):\nIt was really clear in my mind that it was the future and I thought the investors were wrong, frankly. But investors also gave really helpful feedback and feedback. Often in the form of rejection, they would say, \"Oh, your market's not big enough,\" and I would say, \"It's going to be huge.\" And I'd add a new page in my pitch deck that said how big the market I believe was, and then they'd say, \"You're the same as some of other company.\" And I would say, \"Hey, now I've got a new slide in my pitch deck that shows all the players and the huge gap in the market that we believe we're going to fill.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):\nOne of your values, Crazy Big Goals. I love that as a value.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:00:35):\nThe thing that I love about a crazy big goal is that you feel completely inadequate before it. You want to work really hard to will it into existence. I really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want Right now? I have a wall in my house in my office, which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):\nI heard from one of your team members, Melissa Tan, there's a deck like this for every project you kick off. There's this big vision deck.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:00:59):\nSo we have this concept of chaos to clarity. Every idea starts in the chaos side, and then you have to work all the way to the other side, which is clarity. That very first step at the far end of chaos was quite an embarrassing step actually, because you don't have mastery at that point. You don't have all the answers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:14):\nA lot of people think of Canva as like design graphics for social media and marketing and things like that, but you also have spreadsheets, whiteboards, charts, AI coding tool.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:01:24):\nWas funny, looking back from really old decks. We were trying to do AI before AI was actually a thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:30):\nToday my guest is Melanie Perkins, CEO and co-founder of Canva. Melanie is on track to be the most successful female tech founder in history and one of the most successful founders, period. Canva is currently valued at over $42 billion, making over $3.3 billion in revenue a year. They've been profitable for eight years straight and are one of the hottest private tech companies in the world right now. But it wasn't always this way. Melanie was rejected by over 100 investors when she was trying to raise her first round. Their team spent two years rewriting their entire code base and were unable to ship any new features for over two years, something they expected to just take six months, and they even went through a big pivot early on from a yearbook publishing platform to the Canva that you know today, Melanie does not do a lot of podcasts. She shares stories that I've never heard before and lessons that I'm still thinking about.\n\n(00:02:21):\nThis is a really rare opportunity to learn from a legendary founder.

Stripe helps ambitious founders start companies and scale them from pre-seed to IPO and beyond. Used by 78% of the Forbes AI-50 Stripe provides financial infrastructure for payments, billing and software to platforms and marketplaces so they can monetize faster, experiment with pricing and grow revenue. With Stripe, businesses achieve massive global scale faster than they would otherwise. And at the beginning of that journey is where Stripe Startups comes in.

I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):\nI'm even more excited. It's such an honor to have you here. I am such a fan of yours. I'm such a fan of the company that you've built. Also just everyone I meet from Canva is just so nice and so awesome and so smart, and so clearly you've built something really special. I'm really excited to use this hour to learn as much as I can from you about how you did that. We were actually chatting ahead of this about what would make the best use of this hour. I asked you what you believe has been the biggest factor in the success of Canva. You described something called building a Column B company and Column B thinking, I've never heard of this before, so let us start there. What is building Column B company, what does that mean?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:05:35):\nReally great place to start. So I guess there's two ways of planning. The way that you can plan is you can dream of what is the perfect vision of the future, what future do you want to exist in, what would you like the world to look like? What would you like companies to look like? And then going from there, which is completely improbable, a completely crazy big dream, and then working hard to turn that into reality. And the alternate is, so just imagine you are building a castle on the hill and you're like, \"What would be the most magical, wonderful, mythical experience?\" And the other thing you can do is you can look at the bricks around you and you can say, \"What can I do with these bricks? How high can I stack them? What can I do?\" And I think most planning is often done by looking at the bricks and trying to stack them, and then you can create only so much. And so I guess the column B thinking is thinking about what is that magical wonderful future that you then want to invest years and decades of your life actually building? And so that's column A and column B in a nutshell.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:37):\nSo column A is the traditional just work from today's world. Column B is work from this dream reality and work backwards from how to achieve that.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:06:44):\nExactly that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:45):\nThis is exactly the way actually Brian Chesky thought. I worked at Airbnb for a long time and it was always just, \"Think about the world, the dream and then work backwards from that,\" so there's a lot clearly also worked out. So clearly this is an important lesson in the example of Canva, just what would've been column A for what Canva could have been and how did you think about the column B approach of what Canva in a dreamland could be?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:07:07):\nSo column A would've been nothing frankly, because the reality was when I was a university student with no company and no business or product or software experience, the reality would've been not very much. And so it was all column B, it was all thinking about the wild future that we wanted to create. Imagine what would be publishing in the future, what would communications look like in the future? And it seemed really impossible that it would stay on the desktop, it would stay really complicated. And it just seemed so apparent to me that in the future it was going to be completely different. Could I build that future? I had absolutely no idea, but the idea, it seemed completely likely, completely improbable that it wouldn't be the case that in the future, design would be online and collaborative and really simple. And so starting from that, we then took that concept and applied it to the school yearbook market in Australia with our first company Fusion Books. And then we applied it to Canva where we wanted to take it much, much bigger.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):\nLet's talk about just how to actually go about building a Column B company. Say a founder is listening to this and they're just like, \"Okay, I want to do this.\" What do they do? What are the steps? Where do you start?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:08:17):\nI really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want? What is the world that you want to live in? What is the future of transportation? What is the future of healthcare? What is the future that you want to live in and exist in? And for example, right now I have a wall in my house in my office, which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050. And so it's not necessarily that you can bring that into existence or you can will that into existence, but just to start to get clearer on what you would like that world to be like. Would you like it to be more inclusive? Would you like it? For me, one of the things I desperately want is everyone on this planet to have their basic human needs met.\n\n(00:08:56):\nWhat are those things that you believe are so important that you would love to see exist in that future? And I think an exercise we often do is what is wild success for X, or what is wild success for Y? And then equally, what is terrible failure for those things? And you can apply that just to abstract thinking in different industries. You can do that, apply that. We do that for the whole company for different areas of the company. And I think just taking that very long timescale of 10 years and getting a really crisp idea of what you want, of what you don't want, that's sort of the first step. And I think a lot of people don't spend quite enough time imagining that. And then the next part is you don't want to just have this crazy big dream and then do nothing about turning it into reality.\n\n(00:09:43):\nYou kind of want to have a ladder that goes all the way up to the moon, which is your crazy, wild vision. And then you want to have rungs that just work its way up step by step. And so you want to get that really clear picture of the future that you would like and then just take little step, after little step, after little step. And it doesn't matter how small that first step is or how seemingly inconsequential if it is working towards that future that you want to will into existence, then you'll keep on climbing up that ladder in the right direction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:10):\nI think a lot of people hearing this might feel like, \"I do this. Yeah, I have a vision. I know where I'm going. I have this big idea.\" What do you think they might be missing about just what this actually means and why they're probably not thinking big enough, they're not making the time to think this.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:10:23):\nI think it is easy to be discouraged by the two, because they're completely two complete odds. They're completely different ends of the spectrum. So one is dreaming about the future, not that you think you can will into existence, it's just the future that you want. And then the next part is taking the tiny step that might be extremely microscopic and it feels a little embarrassing to be like, \"I want a future that is,\" whatever it might be. And then to take such a microscopic step because I think you often have the future in one side or don't spend much time thinking about that. You're just thinking about the bricks before you. And so I think it's also naturally we all get distracted by day-to-day. It's your email, your Slack, the things that are kind of in your face, the reality that lives around you every day that kind of pulls you into this moment right now.\n\n(00:11:14):\nAnd so I think actually just making time to spend thinking about that is probably one of the most critical pieces. Just literally dreaming what is wild success in 10 years, what is terrible failure in 10 years is a really great place to start, is just spending some time there. And then even if that is so big and so vast and so wild, having that very first step is so important because then you take that little tiny first step and then the next step then that compounds for us, it's been compounding over a decade as we continue to work towards that same mission and vision.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:49):\nI want to hear how you operationalize this. I heard from one of your team members, Melissa Tan, that there's a deck like this for every project you kick off. There's this big vision deck. Talk about what that looks like, because I think that's where people are like, \"Okay, how do I actually do this?\" Talk about that deck.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:12:04):\nSo we have this concept of chaos to clarity and every idea starts in the chaos side, and then you have to work all the way to the other side, which is clarity. And so chaos can be an idea, it can be a problem, it can be a philosophy or a belief. And I've got a joke that I find funny. I'm not sure if you will, but how do you go from chaos to clarity? You add clarity. And so the idea is that each little step from chaos to clarity is the very first step might be literally writing it down. So rather than it being in your head, you've written it down, then the next step might be starting to create a pitch deck on it. And the next step might be starting to refine that, turning it into some designs, turning into a prototype. And then as it kind of goes from chaos to clarity, it starts to become more and more real and more and more people can see it. And so just taking those little incremental steps that adds clarity with every single step, then starts to help will it into existence rather than it being something that's completely amorphous and just stays in your head. So I think that's why visual communication for us is so important, is because otherwise, if it's just in your head, no one else can see it and you can't will it into existence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:13):\nThis makes me think about this concept of an ugly baby from the book, Creativity Inc., by I think Ed Catmull where he talks about how new ideas or this ugly baby that nobody wants to look at and deal with that I think he says they want to kill. I don't know why you would do that with an ugly baby. But there are these very soft, fragile things and it's really important to not kill them early and give them a chance to survive. And it's kind what I'm hearing here is have this big vision that many people are be like, \"No, wait. This is completely absurd.\" And I love this idea of, \"Okay, but here's one step we could take there to see if this could be a thing.\"\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:13:48):\nYeah, I completely agree. And I think that's the thing is that that very first step at the very far end of chaos, it's very embarrassing because you're like, \"I have this idea that is so big and so wild and how the hell would I do that? I have no idea.\" And so it's quite a embarrassing step, actually, because you don't have mastery at that point. You don't have all the answers. In fact, you have likely none of the answers, but you just have the idea that you think would be cool. And ideally you get the idea that it would be so cool that you want to work really hard to will that into existence. And so I think one of the really key parts is not only just having the idea but thinking it's so cool that you're going to work for years to will it into existence. Actually Melissa did a really amazing pitch deck recently about the vision of, I won't go into the details right here, but the vision of her space and I was really excited about it. And so I think that that's the great thing about a pitch deck, is that other people can see your thinking and your thinking actually gets clarified as well as you go through that process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):\nI talked to Melissa, I talked to a bunch of other people that work at Canva, that have worked at Canva, and something else I heard along these lines is this phrase, Crazy Big Goals, which I think is one of your values. Crazy Big Goals. I love that as a value. Why is that so important? How does that fit into this? And just talk about the power of having Crazy Big Goals.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:15:08):\nYeah, so right from the start of Canva, it was truly a crazy-big goal. We're like, \"We want to empower the world of design and take all these things that are super complicated and put them into one platform and make it accessible to the whole world. And we want to, rather than it be super expensive and unaffordable, we want to empower everyone everywhere in the world to design.\" So I mean, that was the epitome of a crazy big goal. And if we macro out even further, we've got this two-step plan, build one of the world's most valuable companies and do the most good we can do. So again, a rather crazy big goal. And I think the thing that I love about a crazy big goal is that you feel completely inadequate before it. Another crazy big goal. We'd love to see everyone's basic human needs met on the planet. Completely crazy big, that truly shouldn't be. It's kind of absolutely absurd that that's the case, but we can go into that later.\n\n(00:16:02):\nBut I think with a crazy big goal, then you want to work really hard to will it into existence. And so if you start with a reasonable goal or a realistic goal, then you kind of get to it and you're like, \"Oh cool, whatever.\" Or more importantly, if something happens, all the problems and roadblocks come along as they always do, then you're like, \"Okay, I won't bother with that.\" And then you can just go and choose another course. And so a crazy big goal is both crazy big, but it's also something that you think is incredibly important that you actually want to will into existence because it is so much work to will a crazy big goal into existence. So it better be one that you want to actually achieve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:45):\nIs there a crazy big goal that you set that comes to mind maybe as a good example of, \"This is what I'm talking about?\" Maybe a product you launched or feature back in the day?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:16:53):\nYeah, I mean so many things. So we have our mission to empower the world to design and we break it down into mission pillars. So empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device, obviously a mouthful. But then what we do is we take successive goals every year towards this mission. And so for designing anything, we started off with social media and presentations and docs and websites and whiteboards and video. And so every year we're just launching more and more things to fulfill that part of the mission of empowering everyone to design anything. And then equally in every language we started in English and then it was Spanish and then it was 20 languages and then a hundred languages and then hard languages like Arabic and Hebrew and Urdu and right to left languages. And now we're in a hundred plus languages now and now we're really doubling down on the localization experience to make it feel truly local in every market around the world.\n\n(00:17:47):\nAnd so you can see how having these very big, audacious goals that you then just take a step after step towards helps then will it into existence or on every device. We started off obviously just with a web platform and then we launched our iPad app and then iPhone and then Android and then we spent years investing in cross-platform. So we have the same feature set across every device. And so you can see how these big amorphous things that seem very outlandish, you can then just will into existence after continual investment for a decade and it compounds over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:20):\nI see how all this is starting to fade together. There's this big crazy ambitious vision and below there are the mission pillars that are feeding into this vision and then the Crazy Big Goals within each of those mission pillars to measure your progress towards all these components of the mission.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:18:32):\nExactly, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:34):\nOkay, so with all that in mind, there's also this kind of trade-off you have to make of just how ambitious you get because oftentimes sometimes maybe you never miss the goal, but many times people miss these very ambitious goals. How do you just find that balance between ambitious crazy but doable enough where people don't get discouraged?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:18:51):\nI think with a crazy big goal, the thing we have been really great at is achieving them. The timeframe that we achieve them on has not always been very reliable. We have certainly not been able to have pin dart. What's it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:07):\nBullseye?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:19:08):\nWe have not been very accurate with timing, but it's really interesting. I look back at a 2021 vision deck that we made obviously in 2021, but it was about 2026 and it was fascinating to see how much we'd actually been able to achieve from that vision deck and how many things were currently still in flight. And so by having that, I thought in 2021, some of those things may have happened a little quicker, but over the last five years they've really been coming into reality. And so we might think things are going to take six months and they take a year. We might think things are going to take six months and they take two years. This has been the case. We might think something's actually going to take our entire lifetime as some of those really truly Crazy Big Goals. And in fact, I don't even know if we can ever achieve them frankly. But they're such an important goal that even if you make a little step in their direction, they're worthwhile nonetheless.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):\nWhether you like him or not, Elon, this is similar to his, if you watch him, he sets these really ambitious goals and then often is far late on achieving them, but clearly it has worked out in achieving the crazy things that he's achieved. Something else I hear is you celebrate these goals in a really unique way. Talk about that.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:20:18):\nSo when we have these Crazy Big Goals, we also have couple them with really fun celebrations. And so we attempt to make the Crazy Big Goals happen in a moment in time. So then when we achieve them, we actually have a really fun moment because if you're just trying to plod towards the top of the mountain always and you never take a little moment to pat yourself on the back, it would feel a little arduous. And so over the years we had all sorts of fun little celebrations where we have smashed great plates and released doves and had a La Tomatina festival.\n\n(00:20:51):\nAll sorts of fun things just to take a moment with the team to celebrate that huge achievement. And so I think that you want to celebrate what you want to really focus on and what you want everyone to take that moment. So when you achieve that crazy big goal when we launch in Spanish, when we hit a hundred languages and then the so forth across the company, taking that moment to actually pat yourself on the back and pat the teams on the back and say, \"Hey, we did this thing. That thing that seemed really hard, we've now achieved.\" And the mission is often each of the different mission pillars, they're obviously a long area of investment that's going to take a long time to get to, but being able to celebrate each of the rungs on that on the way there I think is extraordinarily important. And then everyone works extraordinarily hard to bring them to life and then it gives everyone a little moment to feel proud of themselves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:43):\nIt'd be very motivating to get to just break a bunch of plates. I really like that. Celebration strategy.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:21:47):\nWe need to bring that one back. We haven't done that one in a while.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):\nThat's a good one. I just love how concrete you're making this. So it's set these Crazy Big Goals, confine the component of the goals, set numbers there and then figure out the kind of steps you take to achieve these things. All fail is very easy. On the flip side of that, this is a segue. People hear these stories, they hear your story, they see Canva over the years and it's just this up into the right huge success story, one of the most successful companies in history. I imagine there have been many periods where things weren't going so great and when maybe things didn't look like they would work out. So let me just ask you this over the course of building Canva, once it started to click and started to feel like it was going to be a thing, was there a point where it started to again feel like, \"Wow, maybe this may not work out. Maybe there's a huge setback that we may not get over?\"\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:22:35):\nI think it's just a constant evolution. Every time the company doubles in size, pretty much all your systems break, all the things that were working don't work. A little example, in the early days we'd stand up and everyone would present their goals, what they're working on every day, every week. And then it kind of moved every month and then it was just taking too long because we've got so many people. And then it was sort of like we'd started doing these things called season openers and season openers were really fun where we got the entire company together, we talked about the goals that we'd achieved. And it was so funny because ahead of season openers, everyone would launch everything because they wanted to do it ahead of the season opener. And then we'd also set the goals for the coming cycle for the coming season at that point in time.\n\n(00:23:17):\nBut then they started to become six hours long because we had so many people and so many teams. And so trying to find that right with the same philosophies of deep context for everyone with the same philosophies of the celebrations and the goals and trying to find that right flavor at every stage of scale is definitely hard. And so I think it's just a constant work in progress. Or back to your earlier point about timing of things, we were doing a front-end rewrite and we thought it would take about six months. It was really important because it was critical for cross-platform. It was critical for right to left. It was critical because we could only have five people working in our editor at any point in time because of the way the code base was structured and we thought it was going to take six months and then it took two years and it was two years of not shipping any product, two years of a product company not being able to ship product.\n\n(00:24:14):\nAnd that is such a core motivation for our team. He's shipping something, seeing great customer feedback and that kind of makes everyone feel happy and you've got momentum and it just felt like we're in a dark, dark tunnel that we could hardly see the end of the tunnel. And we didn't really know how long it was going to take because it just had to take as long as the tunnel was going to take. And it was a very hard time because other people would be launching this and that. And it was eventually we got out of that tunnel and it was extremely important that we did that work. We've now got two and a half thousand engineers and we're able to deliver amazing things that would've just been completely infeasible and simultaneous collaboration, so many things were baked into this. But yeah, it was not a fun period of time. A product company not shipping product is not really a recipe for fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:15):\nFor two years.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:25:16):\nFor two years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:17):\nI feel like every builder listening to this knows exactly what you've been through and maybe not on that scale in those stakes, but you start on something, \"Oh yeah, it'll take a few weeks,\" and then a year later you're still working on it.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:25:27):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):\nJust was the mood really, I don't know, sad internally? Two years, that's a long time not to ship anything. Just what was it like internally during that period?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:25:39):\nI think it was kind of everything internally. We made it into a bit of a game. We had this game board and I bought these little rubber ducky sort of bath toys and we had, so we all the little components represented as a bath toy on this board and there was all these stages of went launched in product. There was an emergency lane at the end of it was home and hosed. And we did these weekly stand ups where everyone would come in and talk where their bath toy was at and just, we tried to make it fun for the team. So it was partly fun and it was partly distressing as all of our investors were like, \"Hey, that thing.\" So I think it was both things at the same time. It was bonding let's say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:30):\nOkay. Speaking of investors, speaking of other hard times, there's a very famous story about Canva. Early on you pitched over a hundred investors and over a hundred investors said no to you when you were just starting Canva. I think that's important. The investors than any founder I've talked to actually tries to pitch. It's impressive you tried that hard and went for so many pitches and finally got someone to take a bet. Now you are something like a $40 billion company making 3.3 billion ARR. I think there's something like $240 million monthly active users, one of the hottest private companies in the world. Just how does this feel?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:27:06):\nI don't know. It was really clear in my mind that it was the future and I thought the investors were wrong, frankly. But investors also gave really helpful feedback and feedback often in the form of rejection. So they would say, \"Oh, your market's not big enough.\" And I would say, \"It's going to be huge.\" And I'd add a new page in my pitch deck that said how big the market I believe was. And then they'd say, \"You're the same as some other company,\" coupled with rejection, and I would say, \"Hey, now I've got a new slide in my pitch deck that shows all the players and the huge gap in the market that we believe we're going to fill.\" Or most investors just knew absolutely nothing about design or the industry that we're in. And so we then ended up with the first few slides saying, \"Here's the lay of the land today. Here's the problem that we're going to solve.\"\n\n(00:27:53):\nAnd so while it was extraordinarily frustrating, their feedback made us stronger and made our pitch deck stronger. And it was sort of from that chaos to clarity. At the start it was this idea and then through the copious amounts of rejection, the pitch deck got stronger and more refined. So then when people, the first time I remember I spoke to someone for hours and they eventually got it. They were really committed to understanding what we were trying to do, but then not everyone has six hours to understand a concept. And so being able to take all the gems of wisdom from that conversation and have that understood really clearly in a really short period of time and have all of the reasons that people were rejecting us pre-answered in that initial pitch deck was really important. And I think that's probably one of the reasons why when I look back at our 2012 pitch deck, it's so valid and really still captures what we're doing today. And so I think that rejection in some ways makes you stronger if you can persist through.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):\nWell, I think beyond that, I've never heard this part of the story. It's not just persisting, it's actually iterating and taking feedback that you're hearing to continue to evolve the pitch to a place where, \"Okay, I finally get what you're doing.\" That is such a cool part of the story. How much of that vision and product changed throughout that journey versus just the way you pitched it and convinced people?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:29:10):\nIt was pretty consistent, but the way we articulated it changed greatly. And so for example, I wouldn't, in the early days, articulate the problem very much. And I went into, \"Here's the cool solution.\" And so then the first few pages became very much more problem-based because if people don't understand the problem then they can't understand or care about your solution. And so there was a lot of refinement on the way it was articulated, but the actual vision itself I think was pretty consistent through.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:38):\nGuessing a lot of founders ask for your advice on raising money, getting started, having gone through so much rejection early on. What's your general advice to folks that are having a hard time fundraising?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:29:48):\nI mean, I can only go on my experience, but I think it's sort of the dark tunnel analogy. Or chaos to clarity, let's go with that one. It's a slightly friendlier analogy and I think just taking the rejection and turning into things that you can control. So I can control my pitch deck, I can control the number of people I'm speaking to and I just spoke to literally everyone. And I think that continuing to use it to refine it rather than taking it as a personal rejection, I think it's really important to think how can I improve? How can I help someone to understand it? Some people are never going to understand it. I remember pitching an investor that had the lean startup book behind them when I was pitching them and they were never going to like Canva. We were not the lean startup. That was not the way that we were approaching it whatsoever. So there's some people that are just going to never like you and that's okay. I think it's important to find some people that do what you're trying to say and trying to do and kind of finding your tribe, I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:47):\nAs an investor, this is really interesting to hear because it tells you there are companies like Canva there that everyone's turning down, a hundred investors passed on, that you might still be able to invest in.\n\n(00:30:58):\nTalking about your growth as a leader, say if you compare Melanie of today to Melanie of, I don't know, 12, 13 years ago when you were just starting Canva, what would you say is most different in terms of leadership?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:31:11):\nI don't really know. Probably if you ask other people around me, they'd probably be more observant. But it is funny because there's some things that I think that I need to change and then I realize you go into it the same as some other company. And sometimes we even try that for a while and then we try that out and we're like... It didn't really work for us. And it's kind of building a house that you want every brick in the house to match. And if you go and try and take some bricks from someone else's house and stick it in your house, it's probably going to not look very matched. And so trying to find things that are authentic to us and are authentic to everything that's come before it, is just that constant, constant thing. And then each scale of each stage of scale of the company rather than going, taking someone else's bricks and trying to stick that in your house, trying to build the thing that's authentic.\n\n(00:31:59):\nSo I think there's many things that are the same, but obviously the stage and scale and we're constantly having to give away hats. And so you kind of think about it in the very early days. We just a few of us, two of us in Fusion and then three of us in a little tiny group, and you kind of wear a hundred hats and then you have to be able to give away those hats to other people that can then do that way better than yourself. And so I'm sure there's been a few skills I guess I would've had to have developed over the last decade to be able to give away those hats. But yeah, I think there's a lot of things that we've had to do and double down on that was more authentic to the way we did it in the early days actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:37):\nI love that story. I think again, if anyone working at a company that has gone through a lot of growth has experienced that when people from other companies come in and, \"Here's how we did it at this company.\" Is there an example of some there that just like, \"Here's something that this company brought in and people from this company thought we should do and we try it and didn't work?\"\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:32:54):\nI won't go into specific examples, but so many times over. And I think that, I mean maybe that's probably, in answer your other question, we did things our way because that was the only way we knew. And there was many, many times over the years that we didn't have confidence in the way we were doing things and we were like, \"Oh, they've done it from a big company that's bigger than our company. Let's go do that.\" And that hasn't always worked out so well for us. And so yeah, I think confidence in how we take what is authentic to us and do it at the next level of scale is a constant work in progress. It feels like, as I was saying before, systems break and need to be reinvented but also reimagined for that next layer of scale rather than going to try to get something off the shelf from another company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:39):\nI imagine it also helped that you were in Australia away from the Bay Area and where all these other big companies are at, just being able to do it your own way.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:33:48):\nYeah, very much so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:50):\nDid you know that I have a whole team that helps me with my podcast and with my newsletter? I want everyone on that team to be super happy and thrive in the roles. JustWorks knows that your employees are more than just your employees, they're your people. My team is spread out across Colorado, Australia, Nepal, West Africa and San Francisco. My life would be so incredibly complicated to hire people internationally to pay people on time and in their local currencies and to answer their HR questions 24/7. But with JustWorks, it's super easy whether you're setting up your own automated payroll, offering premium benefits or hiring internationally. JustWorks offer simple software and 24 7 human support from small business experts for you and your people. They do your human resources so that you can do right by your people, JustWorks, for your people.\n\n(00:34:38):\nIs there anything else that is a good example of how you did something pretty different from how other companies operate? Anything else that comes to mind as a fun example?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:34:48):\nThe goal driven structure, I think the things that we were talking about before. So the mission, actually breaking that down into the mission pillars, breaking those mission pillars down into the goals that we're then pursuing and then celebrating those goals when we do achieve them, I think is a deeply underloved way of building a company. Often people have a mission that's kind of on the wall somewhere and then what they're actually doing and the way they actually make money and the way people actually spend their time is in a very, very different direction from that original mission. And I think the magic is when you can bring those two things together and so you can have your mission, you can have your mission pillars that actually are helping to achieve that. And I think there's a real authenticity in that for customers as well, is that you are actually doing the thing that you promised you do, and it all ladders up together. It's certainly not an easy way to run a company, but I think that when you do get that formula, I think that there's a lot of authenticity with what you're saying you're doing, you're actually doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:47):\nI want to come back to that. That's a whole really cool process. Do you have with closing the loop with customers, but something else I want to talk about while we're in this topic of growth over time. I saw you post something about how you had to realize they had to slow down and not just work, work, work like crazy. Talk about just that realization and why that ended up being so valuable.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:36:06):\nSo in the early days, I would just work seven days a week round the clock. In our very first company, we actually had printing presses because we were printing the yearbooks in my mom's house and then delivering them to schools around Australia. And in the early days of Canva, we certainly were working all weekend, all hours of the day. It was just constant. But when you've been doing this for a while, if you just keep working at that pace, I don't think it's good for anyone's health, mental health or anything else. So I think finding ways to continue, I still work extraordinarily hard, but to continue to have that balance in my day to day where I actually go to sleep, I find time to do things like going for walks or doing yoga, journaling I find extraordinarily helpful to make sure that I can always bring my best to everything that I'm doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:00):\nIt's easy to say that kind of stuff. It must be really hard to actually make time for that thing. Is there anything for those sorts of things, is there anything that you do that allows you to actually protect that time to actually do these things? Because as you said, there's a billion things that are just looking for your attention constantly.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:37:15):\nI feel like I've developed some healthy habits over the years. I don't have emails on my phone and so when I shut my laptop, I actually tune out and then if there's a real issue, I'll get an emergency call or page. But I think trying to delineate I think is really important. So when I'm working, I'm all in and then when I'm not working, I'm all out. And actually giving that mental space I think is really important. I've spoken to a lot of founders that haven't quite found that and then do struggle with it. So when they're working every weekend it feels like the right thing, but then sometimes you can miss the forest from the trees when you're just working harder and harder, but maybe you're actually working on the wrong thing. And so I think being able to step away a little just to be able to get perspective is actually really beneficial.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:04):\nI want to come back to this closing the loop process. Let's say that you have where you figure out what to build. A lot of your ideas come actually from the community. Talk about just that process and how many of your ideas actually came from your community.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:38:17):\nOh, it's one of my favorite things. We've been doing it for years now, and so we get more than a million requests from our community every year and we've got a whole incredible team that then tallies them, breaks them down, and then delivers them to all of our product teams and then those actually get closed. So this year we've closed more than 200 loops, but we know that each one of those things is going to be loved and needed by so many more people that don't bother to actually fill out the request form. So many things from gradient text, like little things like gradient text to really big things like our Sheets product. There's just been countless products. In the early days with our AI products, we didn't release them to teachers because we knew there was a lot of hesitancy for teachers using AI in the classroom.\n\n(00:39:03):\nAnd we got so many requests from teachers saying, \"Can I please use this MagicWrite in the classroom?\" And so with them we unlocked that and put on safety controls for teachers. And so it's just constant, actually. It's just part of our product process. I think there's two parts to product. One is building the future and towards the mission and the mission pillars as I was saying before. And the other is actually listening to our community and building what they want. And so I think that that's the two core pieces of product in my mind. And the closing the loop comes in so many different forms. There's the explicit asks, and then the other thing that we double down on all the time is user testing and watching people use it. And if people hesitate clicking a button or people don't quite understand how something works, it's amazing to me how you can find 10 random people on the internet and they can give such astute feedback that then is so representative for such a large number of people. I've personally run hundreds if not thousands of user tests myself and it's been deeply embedded in our product teams also.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):\nWow, that must be really stressful for someone looking at a test of Canva, trying to try something when you're in the room.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:40:08):\nIt's actually, we do it all online actually. I mean the ones I've run are typically online. So people are so much more frank I think when it's just them and their camera and they don't really... Yeah, they tell you really how it is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:24):\nIs there a tool or a kind of a process there that you find really helpful? I don't know if you want to name names of products or anything like that, but it's something that you find helpful or useful.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:40:31):\nYeah, we use a lot of UserTesting.com, find that super valuable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:36):\nAll right, go user testing. Okay. Something else that I know is really important to you and also really unique to Canva is something that's called the two-step plan. You mentioned this earlier, I want to definitely talk about this. What is the two-step plan? Why is this so important to you?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:40:50):\nYeah, so when you were asking about Crazy Big Goals, I think this is our most macro, most crazy biggest goal. Step one, build one of the world's most valuable companies and step two, do the most good we can do. And in our early days I thought I'd do step one and then step two and realize that actually step one can fuel step two and step two can fuel step one. And so that's been a really big part of Canva for some years now. In the early days we took the 1% pledge, which I think is an incredible program. Every single person, every single company should take that where you give 1% of time, money, equity and profitability. And I think that's a really easy thing to do in the early days that then can compound greatly over time. We also knew that Canva's equity was obviously going to be a really key part of it.\n\n(00:41:35):\nSo Cliff and I owned a little over 30% of Canva, and so we decided we were going to take 30% of Canva and use it to do the most good we can do. And we are doing that. So we're doing all of our donating through the Canva Foundation. We've just, over the last few years, we've donated $50 million to GiveDirectly, where they give money directly to people in Malawi who are in extreme poverty and then they can use that money on their family to go to school, to get healthcare, to start small businesses, to get a roof so they can sleep in without being wet. Just real truly basic human needs things. And we've just announced that we're going to be giving another a hundred million dollars over the next four years to people in extreme poverty. And it's just like when you go and sit with people and you hear about how they're spending, what's very microscopic amount at $550 doesn't buy us that much, but it's a life-changing amount of money for people in extreme poverty and it's truly transformational what it can do.\n\n(00:42:39):\nAnd you meet people and you hear their stories and it's truly the best money I could ever imagine spending. And that crazy big dream I was mentioning earlier of everyone having basic human needs met, it's so completely insane that isn't the case today. There's no specific reason why people don't have their basic human needs met on our planet, but we just haven't got to act together as humanity. And so that is a truly crazy, big dream. But back to the two-step plan. Step one, build one of the world's most valuable companies and step two do the most good we can do. And finding ways to do that at the same time I think is extraordinarily important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:17):\nThat's incredible. It makes me think about, not to mention Elon again, but Elon's three-step strategy plan and it's like build better cars versus this is like, \"Okay, solve all the problems of the world and make the world a better place.\" What a better master plan to compare. Something else about this that I love is a lot of companies have this, have something philanthropic going on with the company and it's like sitting in a doc on some page. It's part of their mission. It's not actually that big of a deal to them. What I hear from folks at Canva is something you talk about all the time. This is an actually core part of how you work and think and how you set goals and set vision and missions.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:43:53):\nYeah, I'm happy to hear that. I wouldn't do Canva if it wasn't going to have a positive impact on the world. For me, getting really rich is not a goal unto itself whatsoever. It's a means to an end and I've been very blessed to be able to do some work and that creates wealth that can then go and have people's basic human needs met. But they're working just as hard, but they don't have the opportunity. And even our education product, it's now used by a hundred million people each month and we are in most school districts and rolled out across countries and being able to bring quality education tools to every, and we give that away for free as well. Being able to help empower schools all around the world and we're going to be doubling down and doubling down into that product to bring quality education to all. I think it gives so much more meaning behind work. We've also, between our education product and our non-profit program where we also give away our paid product for free, we are giving away 1.5 billion of product a year now. And so the impact that that can have and the ripple effect of that I think is pretty great. And I think for all of us, it gives a lot more meaning to our work than, \"Get Rich.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:07):\nOkay. So speaking of product, coming back to that, you guys are launching something, maybe you've already launched it by the time this comes out, what I heard described as the biggest launching canvas history, no big deal, that's a high bar. Considering all the things you guys have launched, what are you launching? Why is it such a big deal?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:45:24):\nWe are extraordinarily excited about what we are launching. I guess the whole mission of Canva is to empower the world to design. And so what has been enabled by new technology with all of AI has been just really profound. Enabling people to take their idea and turn it into design a design and have as little friction between those two points. So we are doubling down radically on our video product and bring some incredible capabilities to our mobile and desktop platform. We are launching email, which has been one of our most hotly requested features from enterprise customers around the world and business customers around the world who want to be able to design with Canva's drag and drop ease and to be able to create an email. We are launching forms, we are launching, probably one of the most exciting things is the way we're embedding AI across the entire product suite.\n\n(00:46:12):\nAnd so you can actually use AI to design a presentation, a video, a email, a website. All of these things can actually now be done inside the core editor, inside the design tab, which is used by 170. It's used 170 million times a month. And then on our elements tab, which is used 900 million times a month, we are also embedding AI. So you can actually generate a video, you can generate a canvas code and you can generate photos all directly inside that platform. And then we're also launching comments as lots of our customers use Canvas to comment and collaborate. And now you can actually just tag at Canvas and you can collaborate. You can just say, \"Hey, can you make this title shorter? Can you do this? Can you do that?\" And it has all of the context of the design so in situ, you can actually just have a collaborator that can help get your work done. So we are pretty excited about all of this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:12):\nAmazing. Something I'm going to just let people know, I don't know if people know all this, how many products you all have now. I think a lot of people think of Canva as a design graphics for social media and marketing and things like that, but you also have spreadsheets, docs, whiteboards, charts, code, AI coding tool. And now what I'm hearing is email forums. There's probably a few other things I'm not thinking [inaudible 00:47:36]-\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:47:35):\nYeah, truly design anything. We're literally living up to that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:35):\nOh my god, it's happening.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:47:38):\n100 million people design a presentation in Canva each month now and it's pretty fascinating to see that when you speak to, I saw a tweet some time ago. They were talking about how it's a generational thing that a certain generation uses Microsoft, a certain generation uses Google. Gen Z, the way they design a presentation is in Canva, but it's not just generational for those with other generational ilk, but it is been fascinating to see that come to life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:11):\nThe email product, is that like a email client product or It's a design emails that you can then send through your products?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:48:17):\nIt is design emails, so you can design email, then you can take that code and you can pop it into any email platform that you use.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:24):\nHow do you think about products you're going to expand to, I know there's trade secrets here. You don't want to tell everyone where you're going next, but just how do you approach, here's where we're going next.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:48:31):\nSo our mission, empower world design, empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device, and just take those things very literally. So to literally design anything, to literally publish anywhere. And so we now print in 50 something countries around the world and you can get it printed and delivered to your house. And we plant it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:54):\nI actually did that, while you're on it.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:48:55):\nOh, awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:59):\nI wasn't planning this, but I had a print thing delivered to my house. It's so cool.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:49:02):\nOh, yeah. Exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):\nWe have to go to a print shop in this freaking graphic and well here's a button. Let's click that.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:49:07):\nExactly. Just click print and it pops up beautifully packaged to your door.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:10):\nI don't know how that works. Yeah, I don't know how you did that, but it worked. How cool.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:49:14):\nBut it's very cool. And so yeah, I guess literally bring these things to life. Oh, we're like launching 3D as well. So all of these things we will be bringing to life literally. And just picking off what is the most strategically important next thing to enable everyone to design anything, to enable everyone to publish anywhere. And we have been doing that for a decade and we'll continue to do that forever more using the latest technology to truly bring people's ideas to life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:40):\nOkay, so this is helpful. So if someone's like, \"Oh, will Canva come for my space?\" Are people designing thing that was design and also, what was it? Publish?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:49:49):\nPublishing anywhere.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:50):\nOkay. Publishing and designing. Okay. So if you're doing any designing or publishing, watch out.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:49:57):\nFrom a macro perspective, there was creativity tools and productivity tools. And what Canva really does is we're literally smack bang in the middle of that Venn diagram of creativity and productivity, rather than making our customers have to make a choice between those two suites.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:13):\nSomething I wasn't planning on asking about, but I think it's on everyone's minds. There's always this Figma and Adobe and then there's Canva and there's kind of a bunch of places we could go with this. One is just at the beginning of the journey where a lot of founders try to figure out their wedge and their specific niche. Just how did you think about that? \"Here's how we might have a chance to...\" I know Figma wasn't even around back then, I don't think. Just how did you approach your early wedge of users?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:50:38):\nOne of the most important things that we did was we didn't really worry about competitors at all. We actually just saw where is there a gap in the market that we can uniquely fill, and what can we solve a problem, a core problem that people currently have today? And so with our first company that was yearbooks in Australia and there wasn't great tools and these yearbook coordinators got thrown in to have to design something and they'd have no design experience. And we spoke to every single customer. We gave them an over the phone tutorial, we understood all of their pain points, we got continuous customer feedback, and then we tried to iterate and improve.\n\n(00:51:12):\nAnd then when we were thinking about Canva, a few years into that, actually one of the schools said, \"I love this product so much. Can I use it to design newsletters?\" And they had all sorts of other things that they wanted to use it for, and we kind of looked around and were like, \"Oh, there's still nothing on the market.\" This was a few years into it, that actually does the thing that we're doing, but for all these other things. And so it was much more like where is the gap in the market that people are currently having a pain point? And if you can solve that pain point really well and solve it in such a way that people actually want to pay for it because it is truly solving a real pain point that they have, I think that kind of sets it up for success rather than be a problem or a solution looking for a problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:53):\nSo what I'm hearing there is you didn't overthink, \"Here's my CP, here's the wedge and the strategy of how we expand into this large thing.\" It's like, \"Here's people with a problem that hasn't been solved in years that we keep seeing. Let's try to solve it.\"\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:52:04):\nExactly that. And if you take that problem centered approach that helps people to achieve something they actually want to do in the real life, you're probably going to be at a reasonably good spot, especially if it maps to a larger market. That's a particularly great thing. If it only solves one person's problem, that might not be a great company going forward. But if a few people have that same problem... But I think that again, back to that big ladder and that first rung, I think it's better to solve a small number of people's problem really well than trying to solve a large number of people's problem. Not very well at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):\nSomething I can't not ask about is just how you think about AI in your product. You mentioned how you integrated or all through the product, just you guys are doing really good stuff with AI. A lot of companies are struggling to find something really that works great. Do you have just a philosophy of, \"Here's how we integrate AI into Canva,\" where it ends up being really helpful and people love it?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:52:56):\nYour question is actually the answer at the same time. I think being able to integrate it into the product where it actually helps people to get their work done where it genuinely helps them to achieve their goals, and then being really open to listening to your community and hearing what they're loving, what they're struggling with and refining from there I think is really, really important. Just because AI is all the rage and investors really like AI doesn't necessarily mean it should be front and center, but if it can genuinely help your customers to achieve their goals. So the thing that I was mentioning before, enabling people to communicate their ideas and have little friction between those two points, AI is just kind of naturally a very critical part of that equation for us. In fact, it was funny looking back from really old decks. We were trying to do AI before AI was actually a thing because it really was critical to what we were trying to do even in our 2012 deck. You can kind of imagine how AI very much fit into the equation because of exactly what we're trying to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:57):\nI'm going to keep us on the AI thread and take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. So here's the question: what's a way you've found in your personal life and work life to use AI where it ends up being really helpful, something really interesting that people might find useful?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:54:11):\nSo many things. So AI is often the first. If I'm having an idea, it'll be a first place that I go and explore the idea. And now with Canva, and you can just tag Canva, I can say, \"Give me more ideas of this,\" and it's shockingly great because it has all of the context from the design. It's actually integrated deeply into your workflow. Another really fun thing I do is an AI walk and it's when I just put my ear pods in and then I go for a walk and I just say everything on my mind and I use that to then kind of filter out my thoughts and figure out what are the things I need to action. And it kind of helps again, get out of the weeds and think about things from a more macro perspective rather than from the things that might be in my Slack messages or in my email. It just gives you that sort of helpful vantage point I find. So yeah, so many things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:01):\nFor the Voice Note tool, is there a tool that you find useful for that?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:55:04):\nYeah, I might use Apple Notes or directly into Canva Docs, and then I actually just do the brain dump into Canva Docs and then just summarize them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:16):\nGot it. And so you just use native microphone-\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:55:19):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:19):\n... dictation sort of thing. Nothing fancy?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:55:20):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:20):\nOkay.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:55:21):\nYeah, I like it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:23):\nThis reminded me of, you mentioned earlier in our conversation you had this vision board that you said is for 2050. Is that right?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:55:30):\nYeah, that's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:31):\nCan you share something from that vision board?\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:55:35):\nI'll tell you why the vision board came about because it's only been in recent months. I did feel like as humanity, we are on a bit of a freight train and that freight training is, I think if we take a lot of visions for a lot of different companies and a lot of things that are happening and you just fast-forward 50 years or you do 2050 and you say, \"Are we in a safer world? Is the world the place that we want our kids to grow up in? Is this the humanity that we want?\" I didn't feel that the train that we are headed on always feels great. In fact, it scared me quite greatly for a whole host of reasons. And so I sat with that feeling for a little and then I kind of got to work on my 2050 walls and back to the chaos to clarity.\n\n(00:56:22):\nThe first thing was riding my 2050 wall and I've really been loving, I've got a whole on the 2050 wall, started with a lot of quotes. Everything good was once imagined and many other quotes were along those similar lines. And then rather than just being fearful of the things that I'm worried about for society and for humanity, I started to think what would the alternative be? What is that vision that I would love to see us have basic human needs for all global education being a basic human right that everyone experiences all the really important things that we want as humanity. And again, using vision and using imagination and just dreaming about the future. And I find it really fascinating in my day-to-day by literally having it beside me as I work every day, the little tiny decisions that can kind of help to angle towards that future that we want and can I help will any of that into existence? I honestly don't know.\n\n(00:57:24):\nBut I feel like just by starting to write it down some little brainstorm exercise with a number of other people and starting to just etch out, how do we get closer and closer to that. On my vision of the future, it's community. It's the whole of humanity trying to dream bigger and to dream bigger goals. And then us actually rising to that occasion in the world. We don't want, I think loneliness is rife, purpose is gone. What we teach people in schools is pointless. And in my vision for 2050, it's none of those things. Communities are bound to fall. We all have deep purpose. And that deep purpose springs from having bigger dreams that we collectively go out and achieve. Something that we're doing at our Canva world to a keynote in two weeks time, which I think is going to be after this is released, we've been asking people what is one goal you'd like to see the world achieved in our lifetime?\n\n(00:58:25):\nAnd then people literally writing it down I think is pretty powerful. And then people sharing that with other people I think is pretty powerful. And then us actually figuring out how the hell do we turn? That reality that we all deeply desperately want into existence, I think is genuinely one of the biggest questions of our time. But then again, rather than trying to tackle that entire thing by yourself, how do you take that first tiny step that starts to see that in your own life, in your own family, in your own community? And I think that's where we'll get purpose from and I think that is one of the key answers to loneliness is actually working towards something bigger than yourself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:02):\nWow. I really appreciate you sharing all that. I was thinking as you're talking, just considering how wildly successful Canva has been and just how ambitious that was when you started. I would not be at all surprised that this actually happens and that you achieve this very difficult vision.\n\nMelanie Perkins (00:59:18):\nIt's not something that I alone can achieve. I think it has to be obviously a global collective effort because there's zero chance I can go and achieve basic human needs for all. But I think that I'd like to change that. I'd like to help change the mood. I'd like to help change the way we're thinking about things. I genuinely think we need to move course a little and decide not what are all the things that we... what's the freight train we're currently on, but what is it that we actually want? What do we want our societies to look like? What do we want the world to look like? Is it good enough that there's people, hundreds of millions of people that can't eat? What the hell? It just literally makes no sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:03):\nA column B world, you might say.\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:00:06):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:07):\nMelanie, this was incredible. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:00:17):\nYou have been extremely extensive. I don't think I've got anything else to add, frankly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:20):\nThat's the goal. That's the goal. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Melanie, are you ready?\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:00:25):\nLet's go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:27):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:00:31):\nOne of the books I love is The Power of Moments, and it talks, am I supposed to be really fast and not tell you about it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):\nIt's all good.\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:00:39):\nOkay. Two books, the Power of Moments, and one of the books early on I read was Designing the Obvious, which I found very insightful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:48):\nI like they shifted to fast mode. You don't have to go superfast. All good. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Not Canva.\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:00:56):\nI love the Calm app. It is my daily companion. I use it to meditate. I use it to listen to music. I just find it very calming.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:05):\nOkay. First question. I usually ask about movies and TV shows. I hear you don't watch a lot because you're so busy and have so much going on. So I'm going to try it, new question I haven't asked before. I'm curious where this goes. So excluding Canva, what's a product you'd love to work on someday, whether it's like an existing other company like, \"Oh, I wish I could work on that thing,\" or just a new product you'd love to build maybe after the Canva chapter.\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:01:27):\nI feel like my Canva chapter's going to go on for a long time, so I don't know, because we've got-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:27):\nOn the side, on the side.\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:01:33):\n... decent plans side and we're pretty extensive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:33):\nOkay, maybe a company you'd love to fund. There we go.\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:01:36):\nI feel like there's a lot of opportunity to create global infrastructure that is truly empowering. And so as I look at my 2050 wall, I think there's a lot of things that are currently only exclusively available to a small number of people that should be available to everyone. And so the more that we can do to uplift the rising tide lifts all boats I think is a thing that's just so of such critical importance. And I think there is this weird belief that you can be fine and everyone else can be not fine and that's all cool. I don't think that's cool. I think everyone suffers in such a case. So I think more things that help everyone to rise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:21):\nMaybe along those lines, but maybe not, is there a life motto that you find yourself coming back to and work your own life?\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:02:28):\nThere's a few. I love the quote, happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony. I feel like that's a constant aspiration. And then I've just been so obsessed lately with the idea that everything is led by imagination. That imagination is the very first step of that creative process. So everything is good because once imagined is a quote you're going to be seeing from Canva all the time now because it is true that if you don't imagine it, you can't will it into existence. And in fact, everything great that we experience in life was first imagined.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:00):\nWow. There's so much power to that one thought nugget there is just, there's all these tools now that can make building so much easier. You can just build anything you want, just describe it. But so many people are just like, I'm in the same boat. I'm just stuck. \"What do I want?\" I don't even don't know what I need. What should I build? And that's exactly what you're talking about there. Okay. Last question. So I saw it somewhere that you were an aspiring figure skater in your early years in high school, you had to wake up at 4:30 A.M. to practice. Is there something you learned from that period of your life that was helpful in building Canva?\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:03:36):\nSo many things are quite directly applicable, falling down over and over again and getting up and trying again, the importance of hard work and determination. I think the falling down, it was quite literal in my figure skating in days, and maybe it was a little more metaphorical in today, but it is constant.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:57):\nYou're right. I wonder what that metaphor is for figure skating. I don't know. Anyway, Melanie, this was incredible. I am so thankful that you agreed to do this. Two final questions: where can folks find you if they want to maybe reach out, send you feedback on Canvas or join Canva, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:04:12):\nReally great questions. So you can find me on LinkedIn. That's where I post the most. And you can go to and I can get the URL to give us your wishes and we want to hear them and we literally listen to them. It doesn't just go into a suggestion box. And then how can they be helpful? Use Canva, spread Canva, teach Canva. We're doing a Canva World Tour through October, which is probably going to be updated when this is posted.\n\n(01:04:43):\nCome to our events. We do events all around the world and we'd love to see you and to hear from you. And if you are in a company, starting a company, try and do the 1% pledge. Try and figure out your own version of the two-step plan and try and build products and in every decision that you make that actually makes the world that you want to live in. I think there's this kind of belief sometimes that the world is created by other people, but we all have a very active hand in creating the world that we live in. And every decision that you make for investors, every company that you fund, is that contributing the world to the world that you want to live in? Or is it creating the freight train that none of us want to be on?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:27):\nI have to ask before I let you go. Are you going to have the rap dancers at the next Canva event?\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:05:33):\nYou'll have to wait and see.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:34):\nOkay. Melanie, thank you so much for being here.\n\nMelanie Perkins (01:05:38):\nThank you so much, Lenny, for having me and your great well-researched questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):\nThank you.

And 99% of the time I see that it's actually in the way that they're setting their goals and deploying their strategy. Because once you train those people, they have no context on what to work towards. So it's such a holistic approach when you actually go through these transformations, or try to set up a product organization, so you either need somebody in there to do it, or you've got to really be ready to move when somebody comes in to help you.\n\nLenny (00:31):\nThrough her speaking, consulting, interim CPO roles, and teaching at both Harvard Business School and online, Melissa Perri has seen more product orgs up close then possibly any human alive. In our chat, we cover the most common problems that product teams face, and how to overcome them, when to hire your first PM, how to hone your craft as a PM, signs you're doing a bad job as a PM, also how to structure your product teams and product development process, signs your team doesn't have a strategy and how to come up with one, also how to come up with a product vision, and so much more.\n\n(01:05):\nI loved chatting with Melissa, and I learned a ton. And I can't wait for you to hear this episode.\n\n(01:11):\nIf you're setting up your analytic stack but you're not using Amplitude, what are you doing?

I wanted to set a little context for folks that may not be familiar with you. How many PMs have you worked with and helped, would you say, over the course of your career?\n\nMelissa Perri (03:17):\nBetween teaching, consulting, and all of those different things, it's probably north of 4,000 at this point. I think we're approaching 5,000 now.\n\nLenny (03:28):\nOh my God. Okay. And then, how many companies would you say you've worked with?\n\nMelissa Perri (03:35):\nIf we're talking deep consulting since I started Produx Labs, we've done over 30 companies where we've been in there, did something with them, either transformation-wise or setting up their PM work or setting their strategy, helping with roadmaps. If we're talking training, we're into the multiple hundreds.\n\nLenny (03:54):\nOkay. Insane. Would you say that you're maybe in the top three, maybe top five people in the world that have worked with the most product managers, or have even met the most product managers?\n\nMelissa Perri (04:04):\nI know a lot of people who do what I do, so I think probably among them. Probably among them. But I haven't counted everybody else's.\n\nLenny (04:13):\nOkay. For all these reasons, I'm really excited to dig into a lot of the stuff that you've learned along this journey, and things that people can take away from your experience. What do you spend your time doing these days? I know there's a lot in your portfolio.\n\nMelissa Perri (04:25):\nWell, right now I would say my primary focus is on training in education in product management. So, I'm teaching at Harvard. I teach the second year MBAs in their elective program, product management, so they can choose whether or not they want to take that. But that's been really great. And then, I have had an online school since 2016 called Product Institute. So it's all a self-serve, online education place where we have multiple courses in product management.\n\n(04:51):\nWe have trained almost all of the Fortune 100 companies at this point through that with product management, which is great. But a lot of different growth stage companies coming in there too, and smaller companies as well. Been doing that for quite some time.\n\n(05:04):\nAnd then, I more recently started CPO Accelerator, which is a program to help VPs and heads of product really make the leap into the C suite. So that's been really great because I believe that the more we train people to be better product executives, the better products they'll make, and the better product managers they'll make by training them as well.\n\n(05:25):\nThat's been my primary focus. I am writing another book called Product Operations. After writing Escaping The Build Trap, I thought I would never write again, but it's time.\n\nLenny (05:33):\nI know the feeling.\n\nMelissa Perri (05:35):\nSo I'm excited about that. I'm writing it with my former VP of product at Products Labs, Denise. Before I was doing what I'm doing right now, I was doing all of that, plus I was also consulting pretty deeply with companies through Produx Labs. But at the end of 2020, I took a step back from that to take a little break from it, focus more the teaching aspects of things, and try to figure out what else I'm going to do from here.\n\nLenny (05:59):\nI love that you mentioned your book. You almost didn't, and I was going to make sure to mention it. And we're going to talk about it more in a little bit. And I have it right here. And hopefully I can get it signed someday in real life.\n\n(06:11):\nBefore we get into that, you've worked with dozens of companies directly, hundreds, maybe, indirectly through the course, and then, like you said, thousands of PMs. When you come into a company, they basically bring you in to help them level up their product team, their product management function. What are two of the most common problems that you run into, or even unexpected problems you run into? Especially at modern tech companies, not Ford and things like that. No offense. What do you run into usually?\n\nMelissa Perri (06:44):\nIn 2014, I started consulting with companies through Produx Labs. And it's funny because some people will be like, oh, well you've never worked with... I get two sides of it. I'll get the, well, you don't really work with the SaaS companies, but I had a whole partnership with Insight Venture Partners, where we'd go in and play the interim CPO role in their high-growth SaaS companies. We'd help them scale, we'd set their strategy and their roadmaps and all that stuff. So we did that for a long time.\n\n(07:07):\nAnd then, I have also come in and helped organizations that aren't really SaaS, like banks, a lot of banks. A lot, a lot of banks. But your pharmaceutical companies, and all these other ones too, kind of set up product management for the first time. So I've seen the whole gamut, from super software-focused teams to companies that are still just figuring out software. And it's been great because some of the companies I've worked with now, since 2014, I've been able to see eight years of their progressions and what they go through with that.\n\n(07:41):\nAnd I'd say it's very different if you're SaaS versus non-SaaS. But if we're talking about the SaaS companies that get software, software is what they sell, software is a critical part of their strategy, they're bought in, they know that it's really important, one of the issues I see with them and product management is, at this pivotal scale up phase, where they go from, hey, I found product market fit, to I'm ready to scale, one, it's hiring a great chief product officer that can help them figure out what the next phase is. So it's basically there is this junction point where they go from single product to multiproduct, but then they have to manage a complex portfolio and then they have to scale rapidly. At that point, they have to rethink their entire strategy. And then they have to focus because they have all of these choices to keep building for their existing customers and just take everything off the backlog because everybody's requesting things, they really have to focus and prioritize.\n\n(08:36):\nAnd that becomes absolutely critical, but it's usually the first time that company has actually had to form a comprehensive strategy and a prioritized strategy, and deploy it to hundreds of employees, which will scale to thousands of employees. And that is hard. It's not easy to do. And if you've never done it before, which a lot of people haven't in that position, that becomes really complicated.\n\n(09:00):\nAnd then there's some companies, too, that bypass that initial growth phase, because they already could clearly see what their second and third product should be, and they were scaling really fast, and it's awesome, and they're really, really successful. But then they start to plateau. And they have the same problem, where they have to rethink, reprioritize. And it just always comes back to how do I set strategy, how do I deploy strategy, and how do I make sure it's well communicated and that everything that we're doing on the tech teams, on the product teams, is laddered up into a company strategy that's well prioritized.\n\n(09:33):\nBut that has to be the biggest issue that I see with companies at all. They get the software piece, they know it's a critical part of their business, it's just, how do we prioritize it and double down?\n\nLenny (09:44):\nAnd build the org and find the right people to build it all out. I'd love to double-click on that. What is a sign that it's time for a CPO, and then what do you look for when you're hiring a CPO? I know these are big questions, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\nMelissa Perri (09:57):\nUsually, whoever was the product leader, whether it was the founder or maybe somebody who was a little bit more junior. In those phases at the beginning, finding product market fit, trying to get into the growth stage, early growth stage, it's really about execution at that point. It's rapidly experimentation, trying to figure that out. And all hands on deck, you're usually a little bit in the weeds as well, doing the work yourself, too.\n\n(10:18):\nAnd then, when you get into needing a CPO, it's like, hey, we actually have to pull together a product strategy that's all encompassing. We have to have great communication between product and the executive team. A big sign for me, when I've come in and worked with boards or executive teams as well, is they're telling me, I don't really know what's going on in tech or product. I have no idea if we're achieving our goals.\n\n(10:42):\nIf your executives and your board are telling you that, the person who's communicating those things to them are usually not chief product officer level. If your executives don't know what you're doing, that's a big problem. So that's usually the sign, to me, that we need that.\n\n(11:00):\nWhen I was going in and consulting pretty deeply, the first thing I would do is go to all the teams... if there was 5,000 teams, a smattering of teams. But I'd always ask them, what are you working on? What's the most important thing you could be doing, and why? And I would try to ladder that up myself into a strategy and see if it was connected. And if it wasn't connected, that's telling me somebody's not formulating the strategy and deploying it down. And then, that's telling me there is a lack of strategy at the top. And that would be like, hey, is there a CPO here? And if there is, maybe this person isn't right for the job. Or there's no CPO, and we do need somebody around this to actually formulate the strategy.\n\n(11:40):\nOn an org design perspective with the team, I'd look at the product managers. If the product managers aren't... Sometimes you have great product managers, and they're frustrated because they're not getting the direction they need. And you can tell they're great product managers. They know what they're doing, they're in there, showing me there's a lack of leadership there. If there's trouble hiring product managers, that's a good sign that you need a CPO, you need somebody they can learn from and give them those opportunities. And if there's a lot of junior product managers who've never done it before, it's like, what's their training path? Is there something in there? Is there a process implemented where everybody can follow it? Is there a way for them to learn? If those things are lacking, it's telling me there's a gap in leadership on the product level.\n\nLenny (12:23):\nAwesome. That is really helpful. Is there a number of PMs that it usually ends up being, of how many PMs you have when it's time to maybe hire a CPO?\n\nMelissa Perri (12:31):\nIt really differs. I'd say the critical junction points I've found deal more with company strategy. We used to talk about this a lot at Insight, but it's like if you're going above $10 million in ARR, it's usually when you hit around 20 to 30, you start to bring on a CPO in a high-growth company. What the product starts to look like is you have multi-products, so you have more than two or more. Sometimes you can have a VP of product over two, that's totally fine, but as soon as you start to think about expanding into a more complex portfolio after that, I'd look for probably a CPO. If you're expanding geographically, if you're going into new markets, drastically new markets... The more complex your portfolio, the bigger the sign is that you need a CPO. If you're doing a major transformation or pivot, if you're doing a huge merger of two companies, you're probably going to need a CPO of those two things. So those types of events usually lead to, if you don't have a CPO, it's time to get one.\n\n(13:28):\nThe number of product managers, I'd probably say it starts to hit around maybe eight, seven to eight is usually what I'd look for. But it depends on what the rest of the team looks like, too. A lot of times, chief product officers, especially in a high-growth company, are not going to be over just product. We'd have product reporting into them, design, some kind of product operations, sometimes analytics, depending on what company it is. And then, even in certain cases, I've put engineering underneath a CPO when there hasn't been really strong engineering leadership, and you need to have product leading tech. And maybe there's a disconnect there, and you don't have time. You need one leader. You need to simplify it and go.\n\n(14:11):\nSo depending on the scope that somebody is covering as well, if they're only seeing product, and there's no opportunity for them to be over design or something else, we would probably stick with a VP of product. But if you need a singular leader to bring all those things together, that's where I would start looking for a chief product officer, too.\n\nLenny (14:28):\nWhat do you suggest companies do up until that point? I know titles are not necessarily consistent. I imagine usually there's a head of product before that point. Is that what you'd recommend? What should you do up until you get to a point where it's time for a CPO?\n\nMelissa Perri (14:41):\nHead of product or VP of product, I think, are very interchangeable, in my head. What a VP of product or a head of product is, is a functional leader around product management. Sometimes you have design reporting into them, sometimes not. But they're very good at implementing processes so that product works smoothly. They can pull together the roadmap across all other product managers. They can usually train lower level people.\n\n(15:03):\nWhere the gaps come between that and becoming an executive is interfacing with the board, understanding the financials super deeply so that you can create revenue projections off of what your roadmaps and your product's strategy is going to be. So chief product officers have to deeply understand how to get from roadmap to revenue and how to analyze those things and put it into perspective. So they're usually joined at the hip with the chief revenue officer, or the head of sales, the CFO. They can confidently project to the board. They're a fantastic executive navigator when it comes to dealing with other executives and bringing those things together. And they can oversee a lot more functions than just product, usually. Everything can kind of... They're a senior enough person where you can have a couple different functional lines report into them with a head of design, head of product reporting up.\n\n(15:53):\nSo VPs of product are usually fantastic at growing one or two products. But then, when you get into multiproduct strategies, or very complex platform strategies, and the scope starts to really creep, that's where I would start to bring in a CPO.\n\nLenny (16:12):\nI was going to ask you about what to look for in a CPO, and you answered it. So, amazing. Real quick, before you move on to the scale of product management and some thoughts there, when would it make sense for a company to consider bringing in someone like you to do either interim CPO role or just to help out?\n\nMelissa Perri (16:28):\nYeah. I hope you never need me. That's my goal with everything I do. I'm always like, I would love to put myself out of business one day because I just want this to work really well. But where I am needed is usually when a CEO isn't sure who is the right person to hire. They're usually on the fence. I've come into organizations to help CEOs where they're like, do we need a product person to oversee this? I don't know what a product person does. And I usually talk them through like, hey, what are the challenges you're having? And they tell me everything, and I'm like, okay, these ones are actually caused by you not having that partner to work with. If you had that partner, this is what they could take off your plate and free you up to focus on your vision, and fundraising, and all the other stuff that you have to do as a CEO.\n\n(17:20):\nSo typically, that's where I'd come in to advise. And when I came in in consulting in the past, my motto was always... Well, first I will say I spent a long time doing transformational work, where I would deeply embed and try to push org design, and deploying strategy, and really taking these organizations that didn't understand product management and helping them design how to do it. So I did that for quite a while. And then, when I started working with growth stage companies, my objective was, how do I get in and get out as fast as possible, and bring them in the right leaders?\n\n(17:56):\nSo what I learned, being deeply embedded with these organizations doing this transformation work, was somebody needs to be at the helm of all of this work consistently. And they also have to be able to make the decisions, as well. So you can hire a consultant, but if you don't listen to the consultant, nothing's going to change. And that does happen more often than you think, where everybody just hires and they're like, no, not that way, and you're like, okay, well, it's up to you at the end of the day. I can't change it for you.\n\n(18:26):\nI've also had people hire me as a consultant and be like, well, no, you change it. And I'm like, I can't. You can't just tell me to do your job. You have to go out there and do it yourself. But I will give you all the informed choices and try to design it to meet your needs. And sometimes it's not coming out super ideal and perfect, but it's all a transition. We make roadmaps for transformations.\n\n(18:47):\nBut, being deeply embedded like this, I was starting to think, how do I make sure that this lasts? And that's where I believe strong product leadership comes in. Whether you train somebody up in the organization to take that role over and keep driving it forward, or you hire in somebody who knows what they're doing.\n\n(19:04):\nSo when I started working with Insight, our premise was, we will never touch a company, or be in a company hands-on, for more than three months. The idea was, within that three months, we hire in a chief product Officer to take the helm, and we do just enough to keep it on track, playing an interim CPO role, to make sure that they can keep delivering, they can keep growing. We'd have just enough of a roadmap to keep the teams moving. We train them a little bit, we'd help implement some processes. We'd help get all the information a CPO would need so that when they walked into that organization, they could read the background on their customers, understand what the strategy is so far, look at the current roadmap, watch some customer interviews, know who to talk to, get the lay of the land and have some people working on stuff. And then they could take the time they need to actually build a strategy that's going to help grow the company.\n\n(19:57):\nSo really, at the end of the day, when you need some help, you realize something is not working but you're not sure how to make it right. And then, you can either hire in a leader... Sometimes the question is what kind of leader. That's when you try to hire consulting, get some outside expertise on that. Or, if you want to hire an interim CPO type person, you have to understand that's very temporary, unless you're trying to convert that person into a full-time, which is totally fine if you want to do that and have those expectations going in. But consultants can only help as well when you're willing to take action.\n\n(20:25):\nSo I tell some companies as well at the beginning, you're not ready for this unless you are ready to take action. And sometimes that's drastic change. Sometimes that's changing up people. Sometimes you look at your organization and say, this isn't the organization that's going to get me to the next level, so we're going to have to make some changes, we're going to have to hire in some more senior people as well who can help train the masses of other people that need training. We're going to have to make some hard decisions, and you have to reevaluate your strategy a lot of the times, and figure out how to set course with that too.\n\n(20:57):\nI've met a lot of organizations that think most of their issues are in the training of their people. And 99% of the time, I see that it's actually in the way that they're setting their goals and deploying their strategy. Because once you train those people, they have no context on what to work towards.\n\n(21:15):\nSo it's such a holistic approach when you actually go through these transformations, or try to set up a product organization. So you either need somebody in there to do it, or you've got to really be ready to move when somebody comes in to help you.\n\nLenny (21:26):\nI was going to save these questions for later, but it's as good a time as any to get into them around strategy, which your book is about, I would say, is the fact that people just build features, features, features, and don't really have a strategy or aren't using a strategy. And so, just spending a little time there, what are signs that your team or your company either doesn't have a strategy or aren't using their strategy?\n\nMelissa Perri (21:51):\nYeah, that's a fair question. Signs that there are no strategy, teams are all working like dogs. They're working 80 hours a week. I see this all the time. People are heads down, crunching, crunching, crunching, releasing, releasing, releasing. Or sometimes not releasing, but they're working like crazy and none of the metrics are moving. So the executive team is going, what is happening? Product is a black box. Tech is a black box. We've got all these people. What do they do all day? A great example of when there is no strategy.\n\n(22:23):\nAnd what usually is happening is there's this missing middle. It's like, we all know exactly what each team... We don't all know, actually, what each team is working on. The teams all know exactly what they're working on, which is usually some kind of feature enhancement, new features, whatever you've got. Bug fixes, all that wonderful stuff. The people they report to usually know what the teams are doing, but the executives are like, cool, how does that matter to our business? How does that actually ladder up into our vision, where we want to go, our objectives for the year, our goals? Great sign that there is actually no strategy deployed correctly.\n\n(22:59):\nNow, when I say, too, there's no strategy, there's usually some kind of strategy, but it lives in people's heads, and they're really bad about writing it down and getting it out. So I always tell people, too, if you think that there's no strategy, go interrogate people for awhile. Go talk to the leaders. Is this good if we hit these numbers? Is this bad? Why? If I release this thing, what do you think will happen? What numbers will change? What behaviors will change? How will this make us better? I usually can pull out what people believe the goals to be, and sometimes they're just not explicitly written down.\n\n(23:34):\nSo that's an exercise that I typically do, too, when I don't see strategy well-manifested in these organizations. I just go in and I say, okay, what does good look like for you? Where is the vision and where are we going? And I ask all of these questions, too, to a lot of people. And you find that there's different answers across the organization, and that shows a lack of alignment on a complete strategy, as well.\n\n(23:57):\nI once asked all the executive team at a healthcare company, what's the vision for this company? And they said, to be the backbone of healthcare. And I said, what does that mean? And they couldn't elaborate. Nobody could elaborate on that. And I said, cool, that's a tagline, but it's not a vision. What are we manifesting into? What are we doing? What are we not doing? Who do we want to be when we grow up? Five to ten years from now, how are we different than we are today? Those things, more often than not, are not written down, and they're not clearly communicated.\n\n(24:28):\nSo one of the exercises we do is we write. If I see that there's no strategy, I have CEOs write two-pagers on where did the company come from? How is it different today? What are our external treats to our market? What's our competition? How do you view our competition? What should we care about? What should we not care about? What are we going to do? What are we not going to do? And then prioritize their strategic intents, or what I call them, which are really big business movers, for the next two, three years. So it's like, are we going to go up market? Are we going to go down market? Are we going to expand geographically? Are we going to innovate into a completely new market or a new opportunity?\n\n(25:13):\nThose types of things need to be clearly prioritized at the top, and then we can start to make the product portfolio at the bottom. And when there's a missing strategy piece... I call it the missing middle is usually gone, which connects those strategic intents and those business outcomes back into what the teams are actually doing. So it's like, great, that team is building a widget for sales people to do cold emails. Why? How is that going to move us into what we want to do for our vision? Is it retaining people because we have a problem with our current market? Is it allowing us to enter a new market if we put it together?\n\n(25:51):\nBut if we think about all the things that teams do in isolation, it's not enough, usually, to move those business metrics. So what people do in a lack of strategy is they spread the team too thin across tons of initiatives. One team usually isn't enough to get some really hard hitting metrics out there. And then, you don't see the progress that you're actually looking to see as an executive.\n\nLenny (26:16):\nIf a feature ships but no one knows about it, did it really ship? Keeping customers and internal teams like sales support and marketing in the loop on what's changing across your product is surprisingly hard. First, you have to dig through tickets and poll requests just to see what's been done. Then, you have to figure out what's relevant to each person, craft updates, and then share them across all of your channels. Multiply this by the number of things that ship every week, and that's basically a full-time job just to keep everyone updated on what's changing.\n\n(26:44):\nThat's why high velocity product teams like Monte Carlo, Armory, and Popsicle use Makelog. Makelog makes it easy to see what's happening across tools like [inaudible 00:26:54], Linear, Assan, and GitHub, and then to write bite-sized updates, which you can immediately share with your audience, wherever they are, including within your app, on Slack, over email, and even on Twitter. No more long, boring, blog-style change log posts that slow you down. Just quick and easy updates that keep your users informed and happy.\n\n(27:14):\nTry Makelog for free today. Just visit makelog.com/lenny to get started.\n\n(27:20):\nSo you're a PM on a team, or even just a leader of a company, and you're like, hmm, I think we might have a strategy, maybe we don't. I'm hearing things that are true at our company, and I'm worried. What does it look like for me to have a strategy? You named a few things that you should probably have, a vision, intents and actions, and things like that. What's the checklist of, oh, if I have this, this, this, that, we probably have a strategy in place, at least?\n\nMelissa Perri (27:48):\nA good test is you go to all of your teams, and you ask them what they're doing and why, exactly what I was talking about before. And they all tell a similar story. We're working on X, Y, and Z because it goes into this initiative, and it causes this type of value for these customers, which, in return, is going to get us this business value and help us enter these new markets. They can connect everything they're doing, from the tactical stuff on the team, all the way back up to the business metrics.\n\n(28:14):\nAnd if you deploy your strategy well, your product teams will deeply understand how their stuff actually impacts the business. And if you don't deploy it well, they're going to be like, I don't know why I'm building this stuff. If you have a bunch of people asking you, why are we building this, then you didn't do a good job as a leader explaining what it is that you're after. So everybody should be telling the same story.\n\n(28:39):\nAnother amazing sign when this is all done really well, too, that I love, is there's usually way less infighting across stakeholders and executives. One of the biggest issues I see in organizations is when executives all have different goals, and they're not aligned on the same goals for the company. So it's like, sales teams over here are like, no, our goal is new logos. And you're like, cool, but in what markets, and how is that prioritized against what we're building from our product roadmap, and why is this not in sync?\n\n(29:13):\nAnd I've seen really bad CEOs pit their executives against each other with different goals, so they don't see each other as one team. And the executive team should be one team. And the best teams I've ever seen, the most successful companies I've ever seen, everybody works together, and they're like, these are our goals, and these are our business goals.\n\n(29:32):\nSo when strategy is deployed correctly and you have that type of culture, too, with your executives, they're all on the same page. So you can have very calm trade-off talks about, are we going to do strategic intent one or two? If we do this, then we don't get that. Are we okay with that? And it's not emotional, it's more objective, because we're all there together to further the business.\n\n(29:57):\nAnd a lot of times, we complain, as product managers, about stakeholders all asking for different things, and that's always going to be the case. There's always going to be a little bit of that. But you typically will get less of that on the team two, because the priorities within each part of the business should be aligned to the overall priorities. And it will be easier to manage, and it's easier to push back on why we're not doing one thing over the other thing, because we all know what our goals are, we all know what the company priorities are, and we can see why one thing versus the other won't work.\n\nLenny (30:30):\nSo you have these conversations, which make so much sense. Just talk it out, see if everyone's on the same page about your goals, how you think you're going to get to that goal. What do you do with that? Do you usually recommend people throw it into a Google doc that everybody sits there and just confirms as happy, and is there a template that you share with people, like, here's what we're going to fill out by the end of this, say, three month process?\n\nMelissa Perri (30:50):\nYeah, I think it varies from company to company. Some companies already have their own template, and I'll just use that. I don't try to reinvent the wheel when it doesn't need to be reinvented. But I'll say the memos that we would write are probably... They're very easy to explain, two pages for me on what's the vision, where are we going after, how are we positioned in the market and against competition to reach that vision, where are we today, what's the current state of our product, what does it actually look like, what are we going to do to get there, what's our priorities. And then I make people prioritize them, so I'm like, if we're going this way, are we solving this problem? What does that mean, context-wise? And then, what are the outcomes that we're actually trying to achieve when we get there?\n\n(31:33):\nAnd I do that at different levels. So we typically have executive teams writing the strategic intents for the business level. We've got product management leadership, directors, VPs, CPOs writing the product initiatives. Usually the CPOs aren't writing them, it's more like director-level VP for their scope. Product initiatives are usually very problem-oriented around big problems we can solve for our customers. They're meaty. They're usually made up of multiple epics. And then you've got your product teams on the ground floor working with the developers. I use [inaudible 00:32:07] everybody doesn't agree on what they are. I call them options, sometimes, too, but it's the solutions. What's the solutions you're going to build to actually get into those product initiatives? Solve those problems for the users, and then hit those strategic intents.\n\n(32:22):\nSo you have to pretty much write a one-pager or two-pager like that for every one of those levels, and I think that's great. I think the more we write about these things, the more we talk about it, the more we put it into pros, the better. And it's not like a product requirements document that's 20 pages, it's like a two-pager, just explaining what we're doing and why. And that context, we usually throw into Google docs or Wiki or something like that, link them all together so that you can go from one to the next, and then read all the way up the strategy tree.\n\nLenny (32:50):\nI love that. It's so simple and not so formulaic that it feels like any company could do it, and it's not this rigid, one way to do it process.\n\nMelissa Perri (33:00):\nYeah. And I don't think there should be for certain things. I think every company, with a lot of these processes and tools and frameworks that we get into, you've got to massage it all and make it your own. And you're going to find certain things are going to work for one company that don't work for the other company, based on their culture and what they do. But I think the more that we can write and talk about things, the easier it is for all these different companies to find their way of working. And then you codify that, and you deploy that throughout your organization.\n\nLenny (33:29):\nOn the vision piece specifically, it reminds me, when I was managing PMs, one of the most common areas of development for them was get better vision. Because it always is like, mm, here's an opportunity to get better, vision. And it's always hard to explain exactly what that means and how it looks when they're doing better at vision, other than just coming up with an incredible idea that we execute on. So maybe very tactically, what's a form factor you suggest for folks to even lay out a vision? It sounds like you really encourage writing. Is that how you like to think about it? Or do you find storyboards are often great, or sketches, or anything else?\n\nMelissa Perri (34:03):\nYeah. When I write out visions, I like writing. I think that, to me, is probably the easiest way I've seen people lay it out. I've also seen people put together a great [inaudible 00:34:14] was in there consulting. We had one team with a fantastic head of UX and a VP of product who would sit there together, and they made a great presentation of the vision. But they mocked up prototypes of what it could be. And it wasn't tested or set, but the visual pieces of that got people really aligned over, oh, okay. And the diagrams, I find, when you can show how certain things relate to each other, sometimes it does come off in words.\n\n(34:44):\nSo I like a combination. I like a combination of some kind of presentation plus writing. And I think if you do those two things together, it becomes really powerful. But for me and for a lot of people, especially executives I've seen too, sometimes they're more visually oriented. So if you can grab your UX designer and sit there and sketch out ideas... And it doesn't even have to be wire frames. It doesn't have to be the end state of the product. It could just be how customers interact with things, or diagrams about the ecosystem and stuff like that. That just helps to draw a little bit more color on it. But I think those two things go hand-in-hand.\n\nLenny (35:20):\nI love that. I find that anytime I have a designer helping me with anything like that, I always look so much smarter...\n\nMelissa Perri (35:20):\nOh, so much better.\n\nLenny (35:20):\n... because they made it look so much better. Yeah, exactly.\n\nMelissa Perri (35:20):\nOh, I love it.\n\nLenny (35:20):\nSuch a superpower.\n\nMelissa Perri (35:32):\nIt is. And it's amazing. But I've seen that in every type of presentation. You bring in a designer to help you with board slides, and you're like, oh my God, it all makes sense now. I could talk over these types of things...\n\nLenny (35:32):\nRight, you look like a genius.\n\nMelissa Perri (35:45):\nYeah, you look like a genius. You're like, damn, these look real good. So I think there's just such a joint relationship with any type of presentation where you're trying to explain where you're going or what you want to do. If you can explain it through visuals and with design, it's just going to be so much better for everybody.\n\nLenny (36:02):\nYeah. On the vision piece, do you have any general advice for getting better at vision?\n\nMelissa Perri (36:07):\nI try to think about a lot of... There's a couple tips, here. One, a vision should be concrete enough where people can picture what it will be in their head. It can't be a fluffy... be the backbone of healthcare. What does that mean? I don't get it. So people need to be able to look at a vision and say, I can understand that we're going to get there one day. I don't know how we're going to get there today, but we will find out along the way. That's a good vision. It's lofty, far enough away where you can't just be like, oh, we build that one thing, we hit it. That's not a lofty enough vision. It should be something that you really want to iterate through, and test, and try to figure out how to get there.\n\n(36:53):\nIt should not be what you are at today. That's a sign of, you hit the vision already and maybe you're just tweaking and exploiting it, which is totally fine. But that's not really a good vision for the future.\n\n(37:04):\nI'd say, too, the way that I think through it is, how are we different? And it's crazy how many visions I've read where nobody actually talks about how they're different. It's like, we're going to be the best. Be the best, all right. How are you going to do that? And I think it's fine, while you're formulating a vision.\n\n(37:27):\nAnd this is why I personally like writing. I just literally brain dump in there, and be like, well, our competitor A does X, Y, and Z, and we definitely don't want to be like that. So what could we do to be different? We could do this, this, and this. And if you just brain dump all those ideas about what type of value it will bring for your customers, who you want your customers to be. Sometimes I don't read about future customers or who you want those customers to be in the future. How is the value different than the value you provide today? Is it going to be different, or just doubling down on what you do? The ways that you provide those values, how is it different than your competitors? Why is it better? Not just being better, but why is it better? What's the ways that you're going to win?\n\n(38:15):\nAnd then also, I think good visions also say what you don't want to do. I love reading a vision that's like, we're not going to be like that. And that, to me, is so powerful because you're like, oh, okay, we're not going to copy that. We're not going to go after that. Because you can easily have a whole team be like, oh, let's just copy what they did over there.\n\nLenny (38:33):\nI'm learning a ton. Thank you for sharing all this. This is, for me, really helpful, too.\n\n(38:38):\nOn that topic a little bit, say a PM wants to get better at strategy, which we talked a little bit about. Do you have any advice, someone trying to get better at being more strategic in thinking about strategy?\n\nMelissa Perri (38:49):\nYeah. It was interesting. I was just talking to one of the chief product officers who graduated from my program last year, and now she's the CPO of a company. And I said, what was your advice for especially people who are not chief product officers yet, or ICs? Because I hear from a lot of people, I'm not getting the opportunity to work on strategy. And I loved her advice because she said, even when I didn't have that role or responsibility or that scope, I sat there and I still imagined what I would do if I was in their position. And I think that's powerful. Pretend you're the CPO. Would you do something different? What would you do? Can you dig into the data? Can you ask questions? Can you get into there?\n\n(39:29):\nAnd I'm not saying, go reinvent the wheel for the company. But it's going to give you reps. It's going to give you the experience asking those questions. So I think that's powerful, picturing what you would do in their scenario.\n\n(39:42):\nIf you want to get better at strategy, talk to people who really understand the market, really understand the financials. I'd go talk to your chief product officer if you have one and just ask them, what's your process? How do you set this? We got to these three priorities, or something, how'd you get there? What'd you look at? I think that's important, just having conversations with people about what their thought process is, how they analyzed it, what that means. I think that's really important.\n\n(40:08):\nWhen you get into setting strategy at higher levels for product, a lot of it has to do with the market, and the customers, and the financials, and things that we don't get exposed to as much as a team-level product manager. So the more you can talk to people in other disciplines... Go have a conversation with sales and see why people were buying competitors? What was your win-loss analysis? Why are we losing? What do you think is the issue? A lot of times, we just don't go and talk to other departments. And they have a wealth of knowledge. And we've got subject matter experts sitting in certain places that can fill you in on how the market's moving, and what things are happening there, and how people are innovating. And it is fascinating to talk to those people.\n\n(40:50):\nSo I would do that. I would talk to other departments. I would talk to your leadership, try to understand their thought process.\n\n(40:56):\nIf you are a leader and trying to figure out how to do a lot of this, one of the biggest issues I see for leaders, and why I got very excited about product operations over the last couple years, is the lack of data. One issue I see is that leaders have never really set strategy before, so they get into these positions and they don't know where to start.\n\n(41:17):\nAnd the place that you need to start is data from everywhere. You need to start with internal data, and you need to have an analyst on your team. I also tell them, hire a data analyst. Hire somebody, some ex-McKinsey consultants. They're great at crunching data. I had them on my team. It's amazing. But they'll pull the numbers out. They'll find interesting patterns for you. And you say, I want to answer these questions, and they will go get the data for you, put it into ways that you can actually look at it, and then you can actually start making informed decisions.\n\n(41:45):\nSo you want to take that data. You want to take customer research, so whoever is talking to customers, you want to bubble that up and make sure that you can see that as well. You want to take the company goals and put that into context.\n\n(41:55):\nAnd then, really, strategy always comes down to asking the questions about how can we win, how can we get further to the goal, which is the vision. But it's also keeping into context of where we are now and what we're able to execute on now. And I think it's interesting because we don't always make the right choice when it comes to strategy, but you've got to make a choice. And I think that's the hardest part for some people. They're like, I want to be 100% certain this is going to work. And you can't. And I think a good aspect of being a leader, whether you're a product manager on a team or even an executive, is making the best informed decision that you possibly can at the time, but then also being willing to correct yourself if you find out it's the wrong one by looking at all the information, and then saying, okay, let's try something different.\n\n(42:44):\nAnd that, to me, is how we do great strategy. We take all the information we can, we make the best possible guess to go in one direction, and then we just keep reevaluating it to make sure it's the right direction. And if it's not, we pivot.\n\nLenny (43:00):\nI love that your answer is talking to people, getting information, gathering data, thinking, and it's not, go read books on strategy, go get an MBA, or anything like that. You get better by doing it and learning from other people, right?\n\nMelissa Perri (43:12):\nYeah, and seeing it, too. For me, when I'm learning about strategy, because it's not like I just started project management and started doing strategy immediately, I analyzed how other companies did it. So I was like, how did Netflix do their strategy? How did this company do their strategy? And reading how a company goes from point A to point B is fascinating. There's tons of articles on there about how companies have done it. But it just helps you see that everybody does it differently. Everybody's got a different framework. Doesn't matter what framework you use, as long as it works for your company. But they all got to that framework by asking those questions, and looking at the data, and deeply understanding their market, and deeply understanding their customers, and just trying to piece it all together.\n\nLenny (43:54):\nAwesome. You touched on product operations, which I know is the book that you're working on now. I know that there's a role, an emerging role, product operations. Can you give us a preview of that this book's going to be about and what people should be thinking about there?\n\nMelissa Perri (44:07):\nYeah. Having worked with all these companies, especially the ones that are scaling pretty rapidly, I started realizing, hey, we trained all the teams. We deployed the strategy. We've got a bunch of people, now, in this product management role. And then you look at certain things, and you realize it just didn't scale to the rest of the team. And things broke down. One standardization of processes, everybody had a different roadmap. Cool, I can't do anything with that when I'm trying to set a strategy. If I can't compare your roadmap to that roadmap, all your time horizons are off, all your data is off, nothing's set in the right format, I can't roll that up into my strategy as product leader.\n\n(44:47):\nTwo, maybe there's no career ladders for the product mangers. Three, we're having 18 different types of meetings and all the wrong people are in the room.\n\n(44:55):\nProduct mangers can get the data that they need to make the informed decisions on the product strategy. We're interviewing customers one off, and then I find out the same team is hitting up all these customers over here again. They're getting really upset. These customers don't want to talk to the same team over and over and over again.\n\n(45:11):\nProduct management at scale is really hard, and that's where product operations comes in. So what it does is it helps you get the right insights to the team, and then help standardize those outputs and those check-ins to make sure that you're on track for the right strategy.\n\n(45:26):\nThere's usually three parts to it that I say, and not all companies have all three. And it depends where you're at for where you want to start with this. But typically, we have internal data and insights, and that's a team that's going in and taking all the data that we have that lives in our financial systems, our user analytics, all of these different things that live inside our company, and they're helping to surface this up in ways that people can look at them, see the progress of our strategy, and track those OKRs, and say, okay, we're going to go this way or that way. So that helps give us the inputs we need for strategy, helps monitor the strategy, and it helps us make decisions.\n\n(46:02):\nThen, there's also customer research and user insight, so that's really the external data. And market research. Customer insights and market research. So that's the external data that doesn't live in our company that we need to get from our customers or our market to help inform strategy.\n\n(46:17):\nSo from a market research perspective, that might mean having subscriptions to publications, or making sure that we have subject matter experts who are giving this great advice where the market's moving. But then also, for customer research, it's standardizing the approach so that product managers can go talk to customers so we're not hitting up the same person all the time. We're recording all the user interviews we do in a way where we can actually search through it and gain that information later, when we go and revisit those things. It's really helping to streamline it. It's not centralizing user research as a practice, it's helping to scale user research so that we can enable more people to do user research, especially when you get into some of these companies.\n\n(46:59):\nWhen I first started doing this, it was at Athena Health, and we had 350 product managers. And we had to make sure they weren't bothering the people at the same hospital over and over and over again because they were when we came in. And we said, wow, okay, cool. We've asked these people, now, the same question 10 times from 10 different teams. How do we make sure that those things don't happen, but how do we also empower those product managers to go still talk to them when they need to? So we're not taking user research away, we're just helping make it more scalable, more efficient, give them more tools for it.\n\n(47:30):\nAnd then the last one is standardizing your processes, your cadences for strategy check-in. So it's like, hey, we do roadmap check-ins every month. These are the people that need to be in the room. We do quarterly planning sessions with executives, and this is the inputs to it, this is the outputs to it, here's the decisions we make in this meeting. This is what we review. And those people can help do that part, and then help standardize the product management processes that touch other divisions. For instance, if I need to update roadmaps to sales, they will help own that cadence of what that looks like and how those formats go out.\n\n(48:08):\nBut what I say is it doesn't standardize stuff that only belongs to a team. I don't care how a team does their stand-ups. You choose how to do that. I'm not going to standardize that. But I do care what format your roadmap comes in. I do care how we make sure that we have a good working relationship with sales. I do care that we have a good working relationship with product marketing, those types of functions. That's the interactions we want to standardize.\n\nLenny (48:32):\nI can't wait to read this book. When do you think it'll be coming out?\n\nMelissa Perri (48:35):\nWe're aiming to get it out before the end of the year.\n\nLenny (48:38):\nOh, wow. Okay. That's pretty soon.\n\nMelissa Perri (48:40):\nI know. It's coming up.\n\nLenny (48:43):\nOn that topic, as a PM trying to learn, trying to get better, there's so much information out there. There's books, newsletters (guilty of that), tweets, advice, podcast, all these things that are always coming at you as a PM. And I hear a lot from PMs that are burnt out from all the information always coming at them. It's just never ending advice. Do you have any advice for either new PMs or just any PM of how to take in knowledge that's all out there, and not just burn out?\n\nMelissa Perri (49:14):\nI'm going to burn them out with more advice. [inaudible 00:49:17] the advice.\n\nLenny (49:17):\nThis is the only advice they'll need.\n\nMelissa Perri (49:21):\nSo I'd say, one, the best thing that you could possibly do as a product manager, even if you've been in this role for a while, is to make sure that you're always learning. But the way that you're going to learn the most, usually, is from execution. So what I'd say is first, focus on that. Focus on doing your job every day.\n\n(49:41):\nThen, I would analyze your job and say, what's working? What's not working? And then, take out certain pieces of it that you want to get better at, and then do a deep dive into that.\n\n(49:49):\nSo for me, when I was thinking about my career and my stuff, I did a similar approach where I'd just run into problems, and I'm like, I need to learn more about why that problem is causing this. One of them was Agile. I found out that a bunch of people who never did product management before became product owners. They were writing 8,000 user stories for very small, little features. I'm like, why are you writing so many user stories? So I went down a rabbit hole, interviewing everybody who wrote the Agile manifesto and [inaudible 00:50:19] and taught all those things to find out where this came from, so then I could figure out how to fix it.\n\n(50:24):\nAnd I think you need to carve stuff out like that, where you go, what's this topic I want to get better at? What's this going to do to help me get to the next level? Where do I need to learn and help fill in my skill gaps? For instance, if you're not great at user research, or you haven't had a lot of experience talking to customers, I might deep dive on that. If you're not great at data analytics, I could deep dive on that.\n\n(50:46):\nBut I think there's a certain point where we get to, okay, I understand the basic product framework, and everybody's going to have different opinions about what that framework should look like. But we all generally agree at the end of the day, you should be talking to your users, you should be working with your teams to develop what a test should be, run some tests, figure out what your users want, build it with your team in an iterative fashion, measure success, and keep going from there. That all generally stays the same. But how you do each part of that, you're going to find some people have one opinion, some people don't. And you have to find something that works for you, and then stick with it, and then find out that if it doesn't work for you, change it.\n\n(51:26):\nAnd this is where I get really passionate and frustrated with Agile processes, which I used to rant about a lot. But I feel like some places, we've solved this problem, some places we haven't. But I try to tell teams that started with scrum or started with some of these more dogmatic processes, if it doesn't serve you, move on. Change it. Everything is meant to be iterated on. Everything is meant to be adapted. If it does not work for you, you do not have to keep doing it.\n\n(51:55):\nAnd I think that's the biggest message I can tell to anybody learning, is really, sit down, do a retrospective with yourself, and say, is this helping me get better at being a product manager? And if it's not, change it. Change your approach. Do something different. If it is, keep it. Keep it in your toolbox. Create your own toolbox and go from there.\n\nLenny (52:16):\nWhat a perfect way to end our conversation. Where can folks find you online, and how can listeners be helpful to you?\n\nMelissa Perri (52:24):\nYeah. I am on Twitter all the time @lissijean, so feel free to tweet with me. I love hearing what you guys are up to. You can also submit questions, if you have questions, to me at the Product Thinking podcast. So if you go to productthinkingpodcast.com, or dearmelissa.com, I take questions there all the time.\n\n(52:46):\nI'm always curious what everybody's thinking about. What are your questions? What are your burning questions? That's how you can help me. I am very passionate about figuring out what are the problems that we're facing as product managers, and that's what makes me happy, trying to figure out where they're coming from, how do we solve it, what's on people's mind. So definitely hit me up with questions. I always answer them on the podcast.\n\n(53:08):\nAnd then my website, melissaperri.com, has all my other information, if anybody needs to get in touch.\n\nLenny (53:13):\nAmazing. If anyone has any problems in their PM job, just tweet you, and they will get an answer, is what you're saying.\n\nMelissa Perri (53:19):\nYes. Do that.\n\nLenny (53:21):\nAmazing. Thank you so much, Melissa.\n\nMelissa Perri (53:24):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (53:24):\nThat was awesome. Thank you for listening.
