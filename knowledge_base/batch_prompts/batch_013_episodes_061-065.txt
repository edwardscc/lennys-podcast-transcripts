You have to have a very light touch. If you're building a SaaS business, you're a construction worker, you're building the product and the features and selling it, and it's this very linear thing. For a marketplace, you're like messing with this ecosystem that you don't actually really understand how it works. And sometimes you might do something over here which drives this long-term effect two months later, and then you're going to be pulling your hair out two months later trying to figure out what you did over here that made that thing happen. So I think that the main advice is like to tread lightly. When you're messing with the core incentives or mechanisms of a marketplace, be very careful, particularly if you've got something that's working on playing with those variables.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:00:45):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Dan Hockenmaier. I venture to say that Dan has worked on more marketplace startups than anyone else in the world, including helping scale Thumbtack in the early days, currently working at Faire where he is head of strategy and analytics and, through his consulting business, Faces One, where he's helped dozens of startups figure out their growth models and growth strategies.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:01:20):\nDan hasn't shared a ton of his insights and experiences publicly, so I was really excited to chat with him and to dig into all the things that go into building a marketplace business along with coming up with your growth model. This episode gets very deep into the weeds and so, if you're working on a growth strategy or you're building a marketplace business, this episode is for you. So with that, I bring you Dan Hockenmaier.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:01:45):\nI'm excited to chat with my friend, John Cutler, from Podcast Sponsor Amplitude. Hey John.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:01:49):\nHey Lenny. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:01:51):\nJohn, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:02:02):\nWell, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop, think collect data, inform [inaudible 00:02:08] ship experiments and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So the big aha was seen how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach and send data to other destinations. Experiment and CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.\n\nLenny (00:02:23):\nSupporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:02:27):\nYeah. So Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.\n\nLenny (00:02:36):\nAbsolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John, and head to amplitude.com to get started.\n\nLenny (00:02:43):\nHey, Ashley, head of marketing and flat file. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?\n\nAshley (00:02:51):\nAt least 40%.\n\nLenny (00:02:52):\nAnd how many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?\n\nAshley (00:02:56):\nWell, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common considering customer files are chock full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n\nLenny (00:03:15):\nI am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n\nAshley (00:03:30):\nTotally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of flat file, this because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.\n\nLenny (00:03:47):\nIf you'd like to learn more or get started, check out Flatfile at flatfile.com/lenny.\n\nLenny (00:03:56):\nDan Hockenmaier, welcome to the podcast.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:03:59):\nIt's great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:01):\nIt's great to have you here. So we are actual real life friends and we've collaborated on a number of writing projects, including the race car growth framework and a whole thing on consumer growth strategy. But there's a couple topics that we've never actually dug deep into and that you haven't written about. So I'm really excited to dig into two specific things in our chat today.\n\nLenny (00:04:23):\nOne is growth models and two is just marketplace growth strategy and all things around marketplace growth. But before we get into all that, can you just give us a 55 second background on all of the wonderful things that you've done in your career?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:04:36):\nYeah, absolutely. So I feel very fortunate being able to work on a bunch of consumer and marketplace businesses for a long time. I started in consulting at BCG and then in private equity. I don't think I learned much about how to actually run a business at those places, but I did learn a lot about how to think about them. I think my real education on this began at Thumbtack. So I joined when there were about 30 people and we just had to figure it out. I was there for a little over three years and we more than 10Xed the business in that time.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:05:02):\nFrom there I built a strategy consulting firm where we worked with a bunch of the top gross stage marketplaces on a range of topics, and ultimately that firm was acquired by Faire where I am today. So I lead the strategy analytics team at Faire. I think this is probably the most fun I've ever had in my career. It's just the incredible mix of the team. The business is really strong and I love the customers we're serving. So it's a marketplace connecting local retailers and independent brands, and I just think that's a really fun group of customers to build for.\n\nLenn (00:05:31):\nAwesome. And we're going to chat a bit about the stuff that you do there and marketplaces. But before we get into marketplaces, I wanted to start with our first topic, which is around growth models. So people may have heard this term, this general idea. Just to set the stage, can you just describe what is a growth model and why is it useful to think about your business through the lens of a growth model?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:05:54):\nSo I think it's useful in many contexts. If I apply it to the current work that I'm doing, the strategy analytics team at Faire does a bunch of work to help our other teams make better decisions. So we're typically diving really deep into a bunch of topics across the business. I think it's really easy to make that work kind of go off the rails or go too deep unless you have a conceptual understanding of how the whole business that it comes together. And that's how I think about a growth model, so the analytical representation of how the business grows and it's typically built in a spreadsheet which has a really nice feature of being very hard to fake. You can talk about a business conceptually, but when you actually have to get it to line up and link in a model, it's very hard to not force yourself to understand how the business works. So I think it's very valuable for that.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:06:37):\nI think 50% of the value you get from it is simply building the model. It forces you to understand it and then you get this artifact which you can use to understand how to weigh different opportunities or understand the benefit of working on different things. I think importantly it is not a forecasting tool, so it's not going to replace what your finance team is building to project the business. In fact, often the output can be highly variable because you're playing with lots of these assumptions, but it is a great tool for kind of opportunity assessment for the business.\n\nLenny (00:07:05):\nAwesome. So maybe a simple way to think about it, just summarizing, is it's essentially a formula for your business that often lives in Excel that kind of summarizes and puts together all the things that can drive your business. Is that a simple way [inaudible 00:07:19]?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:07:18):\nYeah. That's exactly right.\n\nLenny (00:07:20):\nSweet. So we're going to go through examples of these growth models and how you've thought about this in actual potential formulas for companies. But first, just broadly, how would someone approach figuring this out for themselves? How would you build a growth model for your own business?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:07:35):\nSo if you think about some of the basic building blocks and probably the simplest use case would be a SaaS business, there's really three components that you need to build for that. One is to understand your acquisition channels. Are you looking at paid marketing or sales or viral kind of customer referrals? And for each of those you have some different assumptions around traffic or spend or conversion rate, those kind of things. So that's the first section. Second would be retention. So at what rate are these customers activating? And then have some kind of basic monthly retention curve. So how long are they staying around? What's the survival rate in each of these? And those kind of stack over time. And then you have monetization. So in the simplest example, they might be paying you some monthly or annual fee and so that translates in monetization.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:08:13):\nSo actually if you're modeling a relatively simple SaaS business, those are the only core building blocks you need and you add a lot more complexity on it based on your kind of individual business that you're building. If you then are trying to build this for more of a transactional business, you need to layer on the way that your current kind of retained customers start to transact. So how many transactions per month? What's the AOV? And then you're also going to typically need to build unit economics because those businesses often have higher costs. And so you're going to be thinking about cogs or other major costs that you build into it.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:08:39):\nAnd then one click beyond that would be to build this for marketplace business. So now what we've talked about is mostly modeling like the demand side of a business. So now you'd also need to think about supply acquisition and retention and how these two sides interact. So as we add supply, what's going to happen to demand? But those are the basic pieces. I think you can start pretty linear like acquiring customers, they're activating, retaining and generating contribution margin typically would be the output. But where it gets really interesting is we start making it non-linear. So the most basic example of this would be virality. Your existing customers are referring new customers and those go on to refer new customers. Based on that coefficient, it has a lot to do with how fast your business grows.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:09:17):\nAnd similarly with paid marketing, as you generate contribution margin, you can reinvest that and grow and actually if you link those two up explicitly, it makes it really clear why thinking about something like payback period is a much better measure of paid marketing performance than LTV to CAC because the speed at which you get enough money back to then go acquire another customer has much more bearing on how fast your business can grow than just the raw kind of [inaudible 00:09:39]. This is where it gets really interesting where you get some variables to play with.\n\nLenny (00:09:43):\nOkay. So let's unpack a bit of the stuff you just talked about. There's a whole decade of knowledge that you just I think collapsed into a couple of minutes. So just to spend a little more time there. So the core three kind of variables to a SaaS business, if you're thinking about the growth model of a SaaS business, for example, you said acquisition channels, where's traffic coming from, and that's essentially how much traffic are you getting, how is it converting and things like that.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:10:07):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:10:07):\nAnd then there's retention and then there's monetization and multiplying all that together you end up with here's how much revenue you're making as a business. Is that roughly how to think about it?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:10:14):\nYeah, it's roughly right. And those three building blocks are true for here in most businesses. Most of what we're talking about is then nuance on top of that that makes the business unique.\n\nLenny (00:10:22):\nCool. So if someone was just starting the spreadsheet for their SaaS business, and we'll talk about even more examples, but if someone was like, \"Here, I'm going to try to figure out my growth model,\" it's create a row for acquisition channels and traffic you're getting, then a row for roughly your retention rate and then how much you're making per customer. Very high level, is that to think about this?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:10:42):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:10:43):\nOkay, sweet. And then marketplaces, I think you said that it's transaction over time and average order value. So it's like how many people are buying stuff, how much are they paying each time? And then unit economics per transaction, how much they're making profit per [inaudible 00:10:58].\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:10:57):\nYeah, exactly. And the critical distinction there is for a SaaS business, your marginal costs are often very low. And so it's not an important part to model. But for transactional business, you typically have very high cost or something else that you need to model so [inaudible 00:11:09].\n\nLenny (00:11:08):\nRight, because you're just taking a cut and you're not selling software. And then the acquisition channels, retention, monetization, marketplace have those three things just broadly and then plus these additional two elements.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:11:19):\nYeah. I think one warning I would give ... so I built these for many businesses. I built them for Thumbtack, at Faire. Many of the companies I worked with, at my consulting firm, they break down in a few places. As soon as you start stacking assumptions, you're highly sensitive to how many assumptions do you have to make and do you know how to make that assumption. And marketplaces kind of create complexity on both of those because for the first piece you're modeling both sides of the business. There's a lot of assumptions. And second, there's a few pieces which are very hard to understand how they work. So the interaction between supply and demand is a big one. Take Amazon as an example. There's a category manager at Amazon who's running their pets business and he decides that he wants to go add a bunch more pet supply to the business. So he's going to go find pet food brands, pet toy brands. Those businesses will generate a bunch of revenue on the Amazon marketplace.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:12:03):\nBut how much of that was actually incremental? Maybe there's a bunch of existing pet supply that customers would've bought anyway. And does having a bunch more supply create a happier customer who retains longer and drives those cohorts up? These things are very hard to decide, something we've spent a lot of time thinking about in various marketplace businesses. And so if you're not careful, you can have a junk in, junk out problem with marketplaces. So the thing that I have gravitated to more as I've done more of this is one very basic high level conceptual model, so that's like the building blocks you talked about, which as simply as possible describes how the whole system works. And so you start to get a feel for which levers are important.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:12:39):\nAnd then for each area of the business, so each product pod, each go to market team, they should have their own kind of mini model which describes the piece of the business they're working on. So that team typically has a north star and they should know what are all the inputs that drive that and a little model to articulate how that works. And you'll never kind of stitch this up into one master thing. I think that's a very difficult task. But you have the dual benefit of understanding how the business works broadly and then understanding if you zoom in on this piece, what are the levers i need to be pulling to move my metric.\n\nLenny (00:13:07):\nTo make that last point a little more concrete, what's an example of that? What's a team that would have their little model? I imagine every team has their own understanding of how the lever works, but what's an example?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:13:17):\nI think there's probably two core archetypes for this. So if you have something that's more like a growth team, it's a little bit simpler. They're typically managing some kind of funnel and they can understand do I want to work on driving more traffic, more conversion, more retention. Typically, that's a somewhat linear relationship.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:13:32):\nBut then you have all these teams that are really managing some tension in the business, which is totally different than a funnel. So say if you have a marketplace quality team, what they care about is driving some standard for quality for the suppliers on a marketplace, but there's not a linear kind of relationship between working on that kind of problem. So if I let on a bunch of new supply to a marketplace, probably the first thing that happens is our GMV or our revenue goes up because we have all these new suppliers which can transact demand, but if those are on average lower quality, it's going to degrade the kind of customer experience and reduce retention over time. And so the model that they're trying to build is how to manage that tension.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:14:08):\nSimilarly in a FinTech business or many marketplaces now have FinTech elements, you're often underwriting the transaction. That team is thinking about the tension between extending more credit and driving higher spend versus defaults on the other side, like what's the contribution margin maximizing point at which we could offer credit. And so their models are going to look pretty different than what a growth team is managing.\n\nLenny (00:14:29):\nGot it. So you mentioned this idea of archetypes and I was going to ask you when you think about developing a growth model for a company and with Basis One, the company that you ran before Faire, you basically developed these things for startups and how many companies would you say you helped through this process and helped develop growth models for just to [inaudible 00:14:47]?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:14:47):\nWe probably built 20 or 30 these in my time at Basis One.\n\nLenny (00:14:49):\nAwesome. It's probably more than anyone out there. So I think that's a context to set. You've had more experience doing this than maybe anyone else out there, but we won't compare.\n\nLenny (00:14:58):\nAre there archetypes/templates/tools that you have found useful to think about, I'm coming in fresh to think about the growth model for a company. What have you found helpful to get started to lay the groundwork?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:15:11):\nOne thing I'll say is going back to 50% of the value being figuring it out, that actually negates the value of templates in some way. You kind of want to build it up for yourself from first principles to understand how the business works. So the more painful the process of building it is, probably the more you're learning. But I do think there's been a lot written on this that you can find online and I think the building blocks I talked about are a useful starting place for how to put these together. I also think Reforge, which is a product in growth school, which we both know has done I think probably the most work to build this into a discipline. And so if you want to go really deep on this, my top recommendation would be to start with Reforge.\n\nLenny (00:15:45):\nOkay. So getting even more concrete, you've built a lot of these growth models. What's an actual example of growth model you've built and more specifically what have you learned from the experience of building that growth model at either, I guess, I was going to say a fictional company but let's go with a real company?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:16:00):\nOne of the immediate things that you see when you build these is that your growth is much more sensitive to customer retention than you can ever intuit because there's a lot of interaction between having a healthy retained customer base and everything else you care about, which is the rate at which they're referring new customers, generating content, generating contribution margin. And so it quickly makes it clear that actually getting a smaller percentage gain on retention is often much more valuable than making a bigger change in some other area. And as a result you may be misallocating your product and growth resources in a pretty significant way.\n\nLenny (00:16:35):\nSo your point there is really important that the more you work on this stuff, the more you will learn what actually is movable and the expected ROI on investments. For founders that are just getting started on this sort of stuff, do you have any just general advice or guidance on okay, retention is probably going to be very hard to move, don't expect that metric even though it's your point that it's often the biggest lever? Any just general guidance of here's where you probably will see impact, maybe you should now count on a ton. How do you think about that?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:17:04):\nI think one tactical piece of advice, I think the best way to start this is to find a smart analyst or smart finance person often is the right type of person to partner with and just start building it. So you may have some intuition around this for the core operating model the business is running. This is a little bit different. You need to start building in more variables but I would start there and start iterating on the model. And I think this process of where you have leverage to move it is very hard to intuit. So I think you just have to start and there's a feedback loop between what kind of gains the team is putting up and how that impacts your model and over the course of multiple quarters of iterating on this, you build much more intuition for what works.\n\nLenny (00:17:41):\nAwesome. So say that somebody has been listening to this episode, maybe they've heard it, they've listened to it three times now and they're just like, \"Hey, I got a model that kind of feels like the beginnings of something.\" What do you do once you have a growth model? How does it actually inform what you do as a startup?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:17:56):\nIt's very helpful input into a quarterly or annual planning process. It depends a little bit on the stage of the company, but say you're at the stage where you have maybe 10 or 20 product pods which are allocated across various parts of the business and you're going through annual planning. Often you want to do a zero based accounting exercise where we say we want to from the ground up decide how those people should spend their time and there's some kind of pod allocation exercise where we're deciding which places those go to. The most difficult thing about making that kind of effort is developing a common currency by which you can trade off their efforts. So this team is saying they can move this metric by X and this team is moving this metric by Y. I have no way to make those two things comparable. The growth model is the function that lets you do that.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:18:36):\nAnd so you can have this analyst or this finance person we talked about who is operating this model work with the product managers to run those scenarios through this model and generate it into a common currency. So now we have a spreadsheet that says these are the things we could work on. This is roughly how it will impact our short or long-term growth. Now you have the ability to make much better kind of allocation decisions. So that would be at the most macro level. And I think the more micro one is for an individual product pod, I have this north star goal, which levers should I be pulling? They should be using their mini models to make that assessment. If you look at the strategy doc for a product group or team, I think that having a model like this should be a core part of that because that way they can articulate what it is they actually [inaudible 00:19:18].\n\nLenny (00:19:18):\nHave you found a model doing this exercise, coming up with a growth model for a company or a startup you've worked with, radically shifted the way they think? Is there an example that comes to mind of, \"Oh wow, we came up with this,\" and they're like they didn't even know this was a huge lever and that changed the way they approached growth.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:19:32):\nI mean the first time this was very eye-opening to me and probably the first one I built was the one we built at Thumbtack in partnership with our finance team, and it made it so immediately obvious that we were exceptionally sensitive to the repeat rate of new customers. If you think about Thumbtack, we offered a thousand categories. This is a local services marketplace for people to hire electricians or plumbers or wedding planners. Almost all the traffic came from a very targeted SEM or SEO on a specific thing. So they hired [inaudible 00:20:01].\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:20:01):\nInitially, it was very hard for us to then go upsell you into something else, but the rate at which we did that made all the difference because it radically changed the LTV of that customer, which then fed back into how much we could go pay to acquire new customers. And so we had a team that was primarily focused on optimizing that initial flow. So SEO and conversion rate. We shipped hundreds of experiments to increase our conversion rate. We had done much less on the life cycle piece like how do we cross sell you into these other things. Building this model helped us internalize that we needed to shift a bunch of resources from top of funnel to deeper in the stack and that ultimately let us build a much better customer journey.\n\nLenny (00:20:36):\nAwesome. Your point about retention being one of the biggest levers reminds me at Airbnb there's like a data dive once where a data scientist found that same conclusion. \"Man, if we move retention by 1%, we're going to hit all our goals.\" And we tried and it was just very hard. And I'm curious, how often do you find that you can actually meaningfully move retention or is there anything that you've found to be effective in increasing retention for many of the companies that you've worked at?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:21:04):\nRetention is a tough measure to work on because it is the culmination of the entire product experience. Whether people come back or not has to do with everything that they experienced along the way. And so I think that the primary advice is actually if you were trying to remove a retention style metric, rarely should you go right to the source and send them more email or push notification or something like that. It's really actually about understanding what is the customer experience and what matters to them. And in a marketplace context, it's often depth of supply or the interaction they have with supply. So you actually should be working more on core product levers than you are on, call it, growth product levers to move retention. So it's a deep understanding of that customer journey and where you actually have the opportunity to improve it.\n\nLenny (00:21:43):\nIf you can share any idea or any example comes to mind, what's one of the biggest successes you've seen in increasing retention?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:21:49):\nVery often I think the biggest wins in retention come from inflecting the early user experience. So if you're at three, six, twelve months out, usually a customer has formed a pretty strong opinion about whether or not they like this product and they have a pretty good understanding of it. But in that very first experience, you have a lot of opportunity to teach them about why this is a valuable product and kind of prove to them that it's valuable. So the experiments that have been most effective have been typically focused on very early life cycle, and one really valuable lens is to look for variability in that experience. So for the first week or month, which customers are having a bad experience but shouldn't be.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:22:27):\nSo if you take Lyft or Uber, for example, an Uber driver signs up for the service. Some of them just by luck of the draw are going to make a pretty bad hourly rate because a customer canceled on them or they were just in a low density area, and there was some problem with their experience. That driver doesn't know that's not how it works. They might think, \"I just make $3 an hour on this platform,\" and they're never going to come back. And so if you can target streamlining that experience or homogenizing that experience, it's typically very helpful. This is why you see both of those companies dueling it out to guarantee the highest first first week or first month earning. What they're trying to do is prove to you that this is what the experience is going to be like longer term, and you pull up all those below average first experiences to average and drive much better retention curves going forward.\n\nLenny (00:23:12):\nAmazing. Such a great example and story. It makes me think about this work that I imagine every company ends up doing, which is what are leading indicators of future retention. I'm curious if you've had success doing that. I find there's always these obvious things that you can't do much about to increase retention down the road and there's always this idea of building some ML model that's like anticipating retention based on some behaviors that someone takes. Have you had any experience, any success with those sorts of investments?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:23:41):\nI think one of the most common analytical failure modes is this pattern, which is our best users do X, so why can't we make other users do that same thing and then drive future attention. It almost never works that way because there's something unique about that customer and their experience which is driving it. And so these correlational exercises, I put very little weight in because I've rarely been able to move Bucket B into the better Bucket A, for example. So I think it's much more about understanding where the real drivers of value are, how to create that really good first round experience to prove to them.\n\nLenny (00:24:12):\nAwesome. And it's interesting that onboarding comes up a lot on these conversations, just the power of onboarding and how much effect that has down the road.\n\nLenny (00:24:20):\nTo your point, people often want to increase retention by focusing on people about to turn and this is a great reminder that your biggest lever is early on when they're just experiencing for the first time.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:24:30):\nSo yeah, the flip side is absolutely true, right? Working on early user experience is highly impactful. You often see product teams say we should work on resurrection because we have this huge pool of users that is churned out. If we get just 1% of those people back, it's going to be such a big lift. The problem is that pool of users is the group of people who has tried the product and decided they don't want to use it and so it's very hard to convince them otherwise. It's usually much higher leverage to focus on new users and, as a result, typically you want to wait to spin up resurrection efforts until you've exhausted some of these earlier funnel efforts.\n\nLenny (00:25:02):\nSo I want to transition a bit to talking about marketplaces. I honestly can't think of anyone that's worked on more marketplace companies than you. Maybe Jeff Jordan at a16z who's invested in Airbnb and worked at eBay and OpenTable and these companies. But I feel you have so much insight into how to grow and run a marketplace and so I'm really excited to dig in to stuff here.\n\nLenny (00:25:23):\nMy first question, just why are you excited about marketplaces? What gets you continuously interested in working on marketplaces and why are they such interesting and good businesses?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:25:32):\nWhy is a marketplace a good business? The first thing is it's like a perfect fit for the venture model, which is why everybody's so interested in them, right? They're very hard to get started, super capital intensive to get started, but once they're rolling, they're very hard to stop. You get this kind of compounding defensibility and gains that makes them very hard to stop. And, as a result, as a marketplace grows, you see these crazy things in the metrics which you don't see for most other businesses. So typically, as you acquire more and more customers, you're acquiring the marginally good fit customer over time and your CACs go up, your LTVs go down, it gets harder and harder.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:26:08):\nMarketplace is actually the inverse. The supply liquidity is improving, the experience is improving. So often actually as you see later cohorts in marketplaces, CAC goes down, LTV goes up. You see this crazy inversion where the business gets better and better over time. And so that's I think one of the reasons they're such great businesses. I think to your question on why they're fun to work on, I think everything is just harder. Every question is more complex and so that's made them I think really fun to work on for me.\n\nLenny (00:26:37):\nAnd that's interesting coming back to your first point about marketplaces are hard to start, but once they're started they become cheaper to grow and you build moats and work effects. It feels like you as a advisor and person that works on marketplaces, the same thing happens. The fact that you've worked at so many marketplaces makes it more interesting and fun I imagine because you've seen so much of this and so many people haven't experienced this, and so there's almost a Dan Hockenmaier network effect.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:27:02):\nI appreciate that. I mean I think there's a few folks in this community who've worked with a bunch of marketplace, and you start to see the same topics over and over. So it's really fun to riff with that group on these topics.\n\nLenny (00:27:12):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage.\n\nLenny (00:27:49):\nEppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And Eppo supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, geteppo.com and 10X your experiment velocity.\n\nLenny (00:28:22):\nOkay, so we're thinking about marketplaces. One of the biggest questions people ask about marketplaces is how do you know if they're going well? What are health metrics? What are KPIs that you find are most helpful to think about when evaluating the health of a marketplace?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:28:36):\nI can give you a couple of pretty obvious ones or basic ones and a couple that are a little bit more nuanced. So that in that first bucket, certainly you need to look at some measure of GMV or transactions. You need something that brings together both the supply and demand side to make sure it's working and that's typically your ultimate north star of which everything else ladders up to.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:28:54):\nI think the second would be a deep understanding of unit economics because the dynamic I talked about where they're hard to get started means that most marketplace in the early days have pretty poor or maybe even negative unit economics. Instacart famously was losing the money on every order. Uber was losing money on every drive. And so I think understanding that and the components that lead up to it is a very important part of understanding your marketable. So those would be the two kind of obvious ones.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:29:19):\nI think other two that I would look at beyond that, number one is liquidity. And this is a really broad term that people define in a bunch of different ways. The definition I would give is how reliable is the marketplace? If the consumer is looking for something or supplier is looking to sell something, how often can they do that thing that they're trying to do? And ideally you want to express this metric in the form of a dimension or a type of product experience that a customer really cares about. So for Uber or Lyft, wait time is a classic example. As you add more supply, the average wait time for a customer goes down and there's some magic moment around four or five minutes where it really clicks and is now just a much better service than calling a traditional taxi or something else.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:30:01):\nFor a commerce market, typically it's some form of conversion rate or search to fail metrics. So if I go look for this thing on Amazon, how often can I find it and convert? And so by articulating what the customer cares about and where this threshold is, you can tell when you have a liquid marketplace and essentially until you have a liquid marketplace, really nothing else matters. So this should be the primary thing you're focused on defining and then building towards, and this is why you hear a lot of advice to marketplaces to basically cut scope down to a specific geography or a specific category so you can focus on generating liquidity in that area before you can then scale it elsewhere. So this is the number one, I think, metric for a marketplace.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:30:41):\nAnd then the last one I'll give is share of wallet. So this is effectively for your buyer, how much of their total spend are you getting on your marketplaces versus the alternatives. For your seller, how much of the business that they're doing is you versus others? So for Uber drivers, if they spend X amount of hours driving per week, how much are you getting versus Lyft or Door Dash or something else? For a retailer on Faire, if they're buying to stock their store, how much of the product on their shelf came from Faire versus from somewhere else? These are very important metrics for us to understand.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:31:11):\nOne, for the obvious reason that as it goes up, your LTVs go up and you have a much better business. But probably more importantly than that, the higher it is, the less likely a customer is to multi-tenant, meaning use another marketplace or another service. And ideally you want that customer to commit to using just this marketplace and the higher share of wallet is the more likely that is. But I will say that it's very hard typically to get this to happen on both sides of the marketplace simultaneously. So often you have to pick your leverage point, which one do you think you can actually drive very high share of wallet on.\n\nLenny (00:31:41):\nAwesome. Okay. So just to summarize, the metrics that you find to be most helpful in tracking marketplace health, there's these two that are just general business health metrics, GMV and unit economics. Then I think what's most unique to marketplaces, which is liquidity and essentially it's just like how often are people having a good time on both sides of the marketplace? And I love the way you broke it up like for Uber it would be how quickly do you get a car. For most marketplaces, it's just like what percentage of the time do you get something that you want, fill rate basically. And then share a wallet, which to me feels like ... even again going back to the first kind of bucket of just broadly this business going well, do you think about that separately versus just business growth and how much we're making, do you feel like share of wallet is a different category of metric?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:32:30):\nI do think share of wallet is different for this reason. If you could tell me we could grow GMV 10% by getting 10% more customers or by getting 10% more of our current customers' wallet, I would take the latter because you now have a deeper relationship with them, which tells you something more about the future retention and defensibility of the marketplace. So I think it's basically a measure of depth rather than breadth. And I will take depth every time in a marketplace.\n\nLenny (00:32:57):\nAwesome. You worked on consumer and B2B marketplaces and so I'm curious, do you find share of wallet is important on both types of marketplaces or is it a lot more important in B2B?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:33:06):\nSo you typically have some form of business on the supply side of a marketplace. Maybe it's a pseudo business that's effectively a consumer, but you can almost always measure some form of share of wallet on the supply side of a marketplace no matter what. On the consumer side, if you're a B2B marketplace, you typically have a cleaner share of wallet metric, but it's not always the case for consumer businesses.\n\nLenny (00:33:25):\nSweet. And again, just to clarify share of wallet, it's essentially percentage of spend in, say, a problem space that they're giving to you. So for Faire, it'd be like the retailers, what percentage of their vendors come through Faire?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:33:39):\nExactly. If you look at their shelf in their store, what percentage of that shelf came from Faire versus something else?\n\nLenny (00:33:45):\nAwesome. Another constant question marketplace founders have is whether they should focus on supply or demand. And I know it's never black and white, but do you have any general advice on where to focus?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:34:00):\nYeah. I mean the answer is obviously both to some extent. I think you can't ignore either side. I do think though that on average when you hear advice about where to focus, people over rotate on supply and actually are under focused on demand. And I think there's a couple of reasons for this. One is supply is disproportionately important early on because it is the product. Until you have enough supply, you don't have anything and so you do have to focus on it to a high degree early on. And two is often the supply side of marketplace is using the product more deeply. There's more product surface area and you need more product resources on the supply side.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:34:35):\nHowever, I think this tricks people into thinking that that's the optimization function or you think you should think more about supply. I think ultimately demand is the only thing that matters. If you are successful at aggregating the demand in your industry, you will have the winning marketplace. Because if you go to a supplier, a restaurant or an electrician or a driver and say, \"I have this customer for you that I can give to you at a rate that's going to make you money,\" they're always going to say yes. And so demand is the currency. And so when you think about trade-offs or how to optimize a business, I think taking the perspective of the customer or the demand side is always the right one.\n\nLenny (00:35:11):\nI think there's a really important nuance here, and there's actually a little mini Twitter debate with Bill Gurley I think a while ago where he made the same point that in the end, the most important thing you got to get right is aggregate all the demand. You need to become the place people come to transact in that space. But oftentimes the way you do that is acquire supply that is hard to acquire. And so would you agree with that? Often it's just, yes, prioritize the customer experience, but that may be you need to spend most of your time acquiring supply so that they're happy.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:35:40):\nAbsolutely. And the culmination of those two points is you only should acquire supply to the extent you understand how it impacts demand. So, for example, if we go back to this liquidity metric, there is some point for a market for Uber where you don't want more supply because you're no longer reducing wait times or doing something that improves the customer experience in a meaningful way. And similarly to the kind of pet store example on Amazon, there's some amount of supply where you're probably no longer incrementally improving the pet buyer's experience and so it's probably not worth investing those dollars. So supply is critically important, but it has to be framed from what is the customer benefit that I'm driving.\n\nLenny (00:36:17):\nAnd another way to put that is what's the biggest constraint to your marketplace's growth, right?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:36:21):\nRight.\n\nLenny (00:36:22):\nWhile we're on that topic, do you have any just rough heuristic that you use to understand which side is most constrained? This may be a big question that isn't answerable in a short answer, but any thoughts there?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:36:35):\nOne is I've actually become less and less focused on pure marketplace balance metrics. They're important to monitor, so ratio of buyers to sellers, some of these other things. But actually the thing that matters is can you write an ROI equation for acquiring supply and demand which fully internalizes the marketplace dynamic. So what I mean by this is if you're acquiring a new customer, you need to include the CAC of acquiring that customer, but also the CAC of acquiring the supply for that customer to purchase, which is based on some ratio between the two.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:37:09):\nAnd similarly on the supply side, that business can't make a sale unless you also acquire the customer to transact with them. And so if you have dual-sided ROI equations which are appropriately capturing this dynamic, actually I think you can somewhat ignore marketplace balance and just push your acquisition all the way out to the payback period that you're comfortable with on either side. I think the one exception to this would be are there externalities which you can't capture in this equation. So for example, if you have too little demand for Uber drivers, at some point do they just become disillusioned with the service, switch to Lyft, talk badly about it on social media. You do have to look out for extreme low supply or demand scenarios. But generally my view is build really strong ROI models that account for this and then just push to your threshold.\n\nLenny (00:37:57):\nI like the sound of these ROI models. Do you have any guidance for folks to come up with these models in some way? Or is that a whole master class of its own?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:38:06):\nSo there's a lot of nuance by business, but the basic formulation is CAC for the side you're focused on. So let's take Uber again, as an example. CAC to acquire a rider and then an additional amount of CAC loaded on for the supply, the drivers that you're acquiring, times the ratio of drivers to supply you're acquiring at that time. So basically, do I need one driver for every 10 passengers? We then take the CAC of that passenger times 10% of a driver. That gives you CAC and then you compare that to the LTV of the customer, and that allows you to calculate payback period.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:38:44):\nNow there's a lot of nuance when you get into an actual marketplace because often they're referring other sides of the marketplace or other things are happening. But that's the basic formulation.\n\nLenny (00:38:53):\nWow. Okay. We should do an actual master class on this formula concoction.\n\nLenny (00:38:57):\nA question I wanted to cover also is I find that for early stage marketplaces, founders sometimes over focus on the theory of marketplaces and how all this stuff that people have put out, including yourself and others, about just how to think about marketplace, all the complexity there. But I find that oftentimes it's simpler just to think of a marketplace like 90 something percent of your success is going to be the same things that any business will have to deal with, growth and profit and retention, all these things. And then there's these additional layers that make a marketplace more complicated. And so just to double click on that last piece, what have you found to be most different about working on a marketplace business versus non-marketplace business?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:39:43):\nYeah, it's a good question. So I think that effectively every decision you make in a marketplace has a second order consequence that you need to think through and maybe third and fourth order consequences at that. Take something like pricing. It's like this is a pretty complicated topic no matter what, but if you're looking at a SaaS business and you're trying to figure out how to price your subscription, theoretically you can draw a curve which says, \"As my price goes up, fewer are going to convert,\" and so just find the optimal point on that curve where we're managing the tangent between more customers versus more revenue per customer.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:40:15):\nBut if you take a marketplace, typically you're charging commission on the supply side and their sensitivity to that commission is much harder to understand because, theoretically, if they can transact at a rate that makes them money, they'll sign up all the way to that highest possible commission you could charge. The more you charge, the more you can fund benefits for your customers. So if Amazon charges a higher commission, they can fund more returns and faster shipping for their customers. And so what's the right balance between charging more and maybe kind of discouraging supply from signing up to giving more benefits to demand and encouraging them to sign up?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:40:52):\nSo it's very hard to model that kind of relationship. There's not a simple curve that describes it and so many decisions follow this same pattern. And one lesson I've learned the hard way a bunch of times on this is that if you think about running a marketplace, you're basically a gardener. You have to have a very light touch. If you're building a SaaS business, you're a construction worker, you're building the product and the features and selling it, and it's this very linear thing. For a marketplace, you're messing with this ecosystem that you don't actually really understand how it works. Sometimes you might do something over here which drives this long-term effect two months later and then you're going to be pulling your hair out two months later trying to figure out what you did over here that made that thing happen.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:41:30):\nAnd so I think that the main advice is to tread lightly. When you're messing with the core incentives or mechanisms of a marketplace, be very careful, particularly if you got something that's working on playing with those variables.\n\nLenny (00:41:42):\nI love that metaphor and your point about pricing reminds me ... Your colleague at Faire, Carla Pellicano, she led the pricing recommendations team at Airbnb. It was a team of, I don't know, probably a hundred people that were just dedicated to pricing, figuring out what prices to recommend to hosts, how to get them to adopt these recommendations, building a model to actually come up with the recommendations. And so to your point, pricing is such a complex beast and especially in a marketplace.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:42:09):\nAbsolutely. And in general, Carla's been such an incredible force in growing our team and helping us think more rigorously about marketplaces. This is one of the things I mentioned at the start that makes Faire so fun is we've got a lot of people like this that are just so fun to riff with on marketplace problems.\n\nLenny (00:42:23):\nThere's so many ex-Airbnb people at Faire. It seems to be a magnet for the Airbnb alumni. So whatever you're doing, keep that up.\n\nLenny (00:42:30):\nAnother topic that I wanted to chat about is expanding marketplaces and just the idea of thinking about where you expand to with new markets, new verticals, and then also horizontal versus vertical marketplaces. But first, how do you think about the idea of expanding your marketplace once you've got a foothold in a specific area?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:42:48):\nI've been fortunate to work on marketplaces that are in these massive, massive industries, which is actually true for a lot of marketplaces because they tend to have winner take all dynamics in really big markets. And so you get these really huge [inaudible 00:42:59].\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:42:59):\nSo the local services industry for Thumbtack or the global wholesale industry for Faire, these are meaningful percentages of global GDP. They're huge markets and, as a result, they're really frustrating to work on and also really fun to work on because you have this thing where there's 10 big opportunities that are just one click away from your core business and they all seem really good ideas to do. So how do you actually prioritize between doing those different things? And one thing I've learned here is that actually beyond a certain point, TAM or the size of the market actually matters very little because these are all big enough that they would dramatically inflect the curve of the business if you make them work.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:43:35):\nIt's much more relevant to focus on a couple things. One is how adjacent is that to the business as a proxy for can we actually go get it? So if you think about Instacart's setup options, it makes much more sense for them to expand into convenience stores which they have than into traditional retailers because the convenience store looks much more like their current model. The high frequency, shipping speed matters a lot, fulfillment speed matters a lot. And so it's much more likely their current model's going to work there than trying to expand into something else. And that's the right prioritization function for them to think about versus as retail is a slightly bigger market that could be in stores.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:44:09):\nAnd the second thing is are there places that you can accentuate your network effect by expanding into new markets. And what I mean by that is are there places where you can use the same supplier or a consumer has demand for multiple things and so it makes your marketplace stronger versus trying to spin up a new network. So for Uber, it makes all the sense in the world to have Uber Eats because, one, they're the same drivers in many cases, but two, the customer wants rides and meals. And so you automatically have this built-in supply base where if they try to do something that was one click further away from this, it would be much less important to them. And so I think that's the way to prioritize new bets.\n\nLenny (00:44:46):\nThat is such an interesting point that basically if you're thinking about the upside of a marketplace, think less about just the total TAM of all the adjacent marketplace opportunities in the markets around them and more about how easily it'll be for you to expand into them even if they're smaller.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:45:01):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:45:02):\nAwesome.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:45:04):\nThere's one other lesson here which I've learned a few times, which is that product is the thing that matters when expanding. So because of this dynamic we talked about where liquidity is so important and there's a race to get there, like the first person, the liquidity wins, you often see this arms race where people will spend a huge amount of money on go to market and incentives to bootstrap the market. And that is an important part of the strategy because it actually does matter who drives liquidity faster.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:45:33):\nBut I've learned over and over and over that that's actually not the main thing. It's who can deliver an incredible end-to-end customer experience first, even if for a smaller number of customers. Because that's what creates the flame where actually customers are really loving it, retained, talking about it, and you can then expand from there. So the other big learning from expanding a marketplace is don't let go to market get too far ahead of product. You need to keep those two pieces in lockstep as you're expanding.\n\nLenny (00:46:01):\nThis touches on a really common piece of advice for marketplaces, which is don't focus on GMV and growth rates and just expansion early on, but instead focus on getting a flywheel going even if it's small, to show that you can make people happy and you can give people what they're looking for. Is there anything you can add there or talk about?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:46:20):\nYeah, I think that's exactly right. And the reason this is the right advice is because everything else follows proving you have a good customer experience. Even if you have a very few customers, if your cohorts look really good, they're retaining or even kind of like the classic smiling curve where you see more in engagement later in the life cycle than you do earlier, that's the thing that gives the company conviction to invest resources against it. That's the reason that VCs are going to want to invest rather than a bunch of low quality GMV in a market.\n\nLenny (00:46:49):\nAwesome. Speaking of VCs, investing and expanding marketplaces, something that I've noticed is a lot of marketplaces try to find a SaaS business to build on top of their marketplace and find some kind of recurring revenue component and then, in reverse, a lot of SaaS businesses look for how do we add a marketplace to what we're doing. I'm curious how often you find that this actually works out and what do you have to get right to add this other type of business model on top of something that's working.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:47:17):\nSo broadly, I will say I think it's easier for a marketplace to go SaaS than it is the other direction and the reason for that is two things. One is it's a new capability to generate demand, which is fundamentally what a marketplace has to do, and it's a higher value activity. This is why the effective commission of a marketplace, often 10, 15, 20% is much higher than the effective commission of a SaaS business in the 2% to 3% range. So you're just doing much more of the value chain in the marketplace. And second is the marketplace by definition starts with relationships on both sides. But the SaaS business does not have any relationships with the demand side customer. And so they have to acquire a whole new type of demand to make this work.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:47:58):\nIt's not to say it can't work. There's actually a classic kind of SaaS bootstrap to marketplace playbook. This is what OpenTable did. I think we've actually seen some new examples of companies doing this. One in the healthcare space is Solve. They built some interesting products for healthcare clinics that they're now bootstrapping into marketplace. And so I think it's possible, but I think it's very difficult. And then for a marketplace, the lens you should take is much less about how to drive more monetization, but just how do we create a much better experience for our customers because there's some painful thing that they're doing today that we can build for them instead. And so how do we better integrate with the way that they're running their back office or accounting systems is a classic example of where you can make it much better.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:48:42):\nIn the process, you're often making their lives easier, but you're also making your product much stickier. Your retention will go up as a result of this. And so I think if you take the lens of what's the customer pain we're solving, you'll be much more effective than how do we get a few more points of margin out of this customer.\n\nLenny (00:48:57):\nIf a founder was coming to you and they're like, \"Hey Dan, we are a marketplace and we're thinking about adding a SaaS product on top, would you, one, try to discourage them from that? And if, two, that doesn't work, what would you suggest that they focus on most?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:49:12):\nI mean I think the first thing is looking at those core metrics we talked about, do they have a really liquid high performance marketplace first. That has to be the optimization function. And before you're there, I don't think you should be thinking about some of these expansion levers.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:49:27):\nThe second would be show me the customer problem or the reason it's so hard to engage with this marketplace today that we need to build a deep set of tools or products for this customer to solve. And if both of those things are true, then I think maybe it's quite interesting. But I think more often than not, it's better to focus on the core marketplace.\n\nLenny (00:49:46):\nAwesome. Another common question that marketplace founders have is should I go vertical or should I go horizontal? So thinking about eBay as an example, they are very horizontal. You could buy anything you want on eBay. And then there's all these spinoffs that emerged, just classic cars, eBay for classic cars, eBay for guitars. And I'm curious if you have any advice there for either an early stage founder trying to decide should I go horizontal or vertical and/or where do you find the biggest opportunities to slice off a piece of a successful horizontal marketplace?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:50:18):\nYeah, absolutely. And in that eBay example, there are now a few quite successful examples of this like [inaudible 00:50:23] and StockX are two where they carved out the sneaker category and the key insight was you couldn't trust the inventory you were getting on eBay. So there's a lot of work you need to do to verify, and those businesses just did it much better than eBay. Broadly though, I think that we over hyped the idea of unbundling. So I think every six months I'm seeing an article where somebody wrote, \"This is the unbundling of Reddit, the unbundling of LinkedIn, the unbundling of Facebook.\" We're going to take all those blue links that you saw on another site and they're all going to become new businesses. And very rarely that thesis plays out. I think the core logical error in the argument for unbundling is that they over focus on one type of improvement, which is user experience and they under focus on the things that make scale businesses have better economics.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:51:07):\nAnd so to unpack that, if you look at UX, like if you built a LinkedIn just for construction workers or just for architects or just for investment bankers, you could definitely build some set of features that group liked better than the core LinkedIn experience. But then you have to weigh that against all of the benefits of being broader. And so the two big pieces of where you get benefits from scale are in your customer LTV and then I think the network effect you can build. So if you go back to that Thumbtack example, we had a spreadsheet which tracked hundreds of verticalized competitors where somebody would try to pick off the electricians category, the wedding category, the lessons category, and very few of them got traction for the simple reason that we could upsell customers into a thousand things.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:51:48):\nAnd so our customer LTV was always higher and we would always win when we were bidding against those other customers on SEM keywords that were relevant to that category. So it becomes very hard to compete if you're picking off this kind of narrow thing unless you find something which that sub-segment is itself very high frequency or very high dollar value. So Airbnb's an example. They unbundled from Craigslist because they picked off this massive high frequency, high dollar value category [inaudible 00:52:16] but there's not that many of those examples.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:52:18):\nAnd then I think the other source of benefit would be the network effect. So if you go back to LinkedIn, for example, I think actually there's an opportunity and we see some successful businesses picking off now blue collar work. So there's a company called Workrise. I think they used to be called Rigup where they're basically building like a LinkedIn but for blue collar work. And that works really well because it's a huge segment and it's somewhat self-contained.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:52:39):\nBut for most other things there's a lot of fluidity between the employers and the employees in terms of who wants to transact with one another. And so if you're an investment banker, you don't really want to be on the LinkedIn investment banker because you're probably in the future going to want some other job. So you want to be in the biggest network that's relevant to you and so this is why you can complain about LinkedIn's UI all day, but they have a very strong place in the market because of that network effect. So broadly, I think there are some pretty interesting examples, places where you can unbundle but they're rarer than people think.\n\nLenny (00:53:10):\nThat is amazing. There's so much value in what you just shared. So one takeaway I have here is you have an opportunity to unbundle/split off into a vertical marketplace potentially if there's high order value and high frequency. And the third piece is there's almost a self-contained network that doesn't benefit significantly from the rest of the network. For example, I love the Rigup example, like I doubt oil rig operators are on LinkedIn and when something comes around that's like, \"Oh, all my buddies are on this thing, I'm going to be on there,\" you don't need the rest of LinkedIn.\n\nLenny (00:53:40):\nThe first piece, though, is interesting. So Airbnb I wouldn't say is high frequency. I'd say it's just very large high order value. And so I wonder if you just need one or the other really in a big way. Really high order value or really high frequency?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:53:51):\nThis is a good point. Probably what you're solving for is customer LTV and you can get that in multiple places. There's not that many things which are both high frequency and high dollar value so you can do both. I do think if you go to a place that is low frequency, it comes with all kinds of new challenges because, without frequency, customers forget about you. And so what is the hook to get them to come back? Do you have to reacquire traffic? It creates a whole other set of problems. But if you can get it right like in the Airbnb case, it can work really well.\n\nLenny (00:54:17):\nYeah, Thumbtack is a classic example of how often you need a plumber. And even with the thousands of services that you all had, from what I understand, it's still a struggle to get people to come back often. And remember Thumbtack when they had, \"Oh, they have an electrician. Oh yeah, Thumbtack.\"\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:54:30):\nThat's right. Initially, it was very difficult. I mean the average person hires eight or ten new professionals a year, the average homeowner. And so that's decently high frequency, but it's not food delivery or a ride sharing or something like that.\n\nLenny (00:54:42):\nComing back to Faire, so Faire is one of the maybe few really successful B2B marketplaces and it's always felt like there's this gap in B2B marketplaces. You always feel like there should be many more. Like why are there so many consumer marketplaces but so few B2B, and I'm curious what's your take there. Do you think there's a rising trend to B2B marketplaces? Do you think this is always going to be a smaller collection? What's your feeling?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:55:07):\nSo I do think we'll see more of them. Part of the reason we've seen fewer is there are fewer potential founders who understand B2B problems because most of them are consumers and so the consumer use cases are more obvious. So if you take Faire, for example, when I met the founders, which is probably five years ago now, I immediately understood what they were talking about, but only because I had run an e-commerce business in the past and I had the experience of dealing with a hundred suppliers and line sheets and PDFs going back and forth and pricing not being right and just how painful it is to be a retail buyer. And they had a solution which was much better and that clicked.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:55:44):\nBut had I had the same conversation five or 10 years ago with the team at Convoy like I don't know anything about trucking, I probably wouldn't have understood why that business was going to work. And so I think there's partly that. Just the discovery process takes longer for that reason. But I think the reason we won't see a huge explosion in this area is that B2B also comes with something else, which is much lower fragmentation in many cases and you need fragmentation for a good marketplace. The more concentrated either side of your market is, the more leverage they have, the less likely they are to need you and the less likely they are to be willing to pay a high commission.\n\nLenny (00:56:20):\nYou made that point to me once when we were talking about marketplaces years ago, and that's so stuck with me that when evaluating marketplaces in B2B especially, usually the reason it's not going to work is just it's not fragmented enough. And just to double click there, can you explain what that means? What does fragmentation mean in a marketplace context? And then are there any examples of really low fragmentation of this will never work as a marketplace? And then here it's really high and this is why it's working?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:56:45):\nFragmentation is basically just a measure of how many total businesses are there in the space relative to the transaction volume in that space. And if you took the top 5% of suppliers in the space, what percentage of the total volume are they doing? And the higher that percentage is, the less fragmented you are. The challenge that creates for a marketplace is if there's 10 companies in a space that are doing 80% of the volume, it's very important for me to have a relationship with those 10 companies. But those 10 companies are also big enough to have their own sales teams, have their own internal operations. They just need less from a marketplace and, as a result, they're going to be willing to pay less. And you're also probably going to see many more problems with disintermediation, which is when the supplier and the customer go around the marketplace because they can just transact themselves.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:57:27):\nOne principle to use here is how many total dollars are attached to each transaction in the marketplace. When it goes above a certain amount, it becomes much more attractive to figure out how to go around the marketplace. With ride sharing, for example, the absolute dollars of commission on a ride is $2 or $3. Is it worth it for the driver to figure out how to call the passenger two minutes in advance, go around Uber and pick them up? Maybe. You probably see some of that happening, but usually not.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:57:55):\nBut now take there's a bunch of people in the kind of material space within B2B marketplaces, you have manufacturers of say beauty products who need to source aerosol cans and all the inputs into making beauty products. There's not that many of these big suppliers and each of their transactions may be tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars. The commission you would charge on that order is too high because a supplier would rather just pick up the phone and call this person and save those tens of thousands of dollars. And so you just run into these kind of fundamental problems where a marketplace doesn't work anymore.\n\nLenny (00:58:29):\nThat makes sense. Basically, how much value are you bringing to this market? And if it's not enough where you can charge anything meaningful to run a business is just not going to work. And so that's a really good way of framing it.\n\nLenny (00:58:41):\nFinal question around marketplaces and, broadly, and I'll let you go. You've spent a lot of time on marketplaces. You've seen their evolution. You've worked on this maybe for the past decade. Where do you see the future of marketplaces going?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:58:54):\nI actually wrote a blog post on this where we charted the commission that a marketplace charges and the year they were founded. And if you put those on the x and y axis, there's this very clear up into the right trend. Newer marketplaces are charging higher commissions and they're doing more work to justify those commissions. So broadly the evolution looks like kind of Marketplace 1.0, which is all they're doing is aggregating demand. So that's Zillow and Home Advisor. They're basically like lead gen and their commission rate is often pretty low. It's like 5%, maybe 10%.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:59:24):\nThen you have a managed marketplace like Airbnb or Etsy, which did something really fundamental on top of that, which is generated trust. So they deadhead supply ... You could probably tell me more about what Airbnb did in this space, but they made it a safe transaction and there's a lot of work it takes to make that transaction trustworthy and safe and so they charge a higher commission as a result.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (00:59:48):\nThere's then one click beyond that which, for lack of a better term, you could call it a heavily managed marketplace, but now they're typically doing some work in the value chain, which is distinct from just aggregating demand. So DoorDash and Instacart own logistics. They took over logistics and, as a result, DoorDash did a much better job than the previous model of Seamless of being able to bring on a lot more restaurants and make it much more reliable for the customer. As a result, they could charge more to the restaurant. Similarly, Faire, we actually underwrite the transaction. We take the risk. If that transaction falls through or the retailer defaults, Faire eats that. And so we are playing a much more fundamental place in that transaction.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (01:00:25):\nBut as you play this out, what happens at the end of this continuum? Ultimately, you're charging a hundred percent commission and you're not a marketplace anymore. So I think, as we think about the future of marketplaces, one important question is which marketplaces are going to tend towards evolving out of the marketplace model altogether and which will stay in marketplace mode in equilibrium? And you see these examples already like people talk about Opendoor as a marketplace, but it's not. It's an e-commerce website which has the highest price points you can imagine because you're buying houses, but there's no supplier on the other side. They've already bought the house so it's just e-commerce. And I think many marketplaces will go that way. And I think the variable to me that matters in deciding which case you're going to have, whether they consolidate or not, is how much creativity there is in the space. So how much do you need the supplier to be coming up with interesting new things for your customers to buy.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (01:01:18):\nWhat the customer cares about is actually commoditization. They want the same experience every time. Then you're ultimately going to evolve away from marketplaces I think. With ride sharing, basically what I want is a clean car that shows up on time and gets me there every time. So as soon as autonomous vehicles arrive, we're going to fully consolidate that industry and it's not going to be marketplace model any more. On the other end, you have Etsy and Amazon. I think Faire's in this bucket. Steam, the video game marketplace, is in this bucket where the thing you care about is suppliers bringing you amazing creative new things. And that's something that big companies are really bad at doing. So they need the marketplace suppliers to supply this. And so I think those businesses stay in marketplace mode longer term.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (01:02:02):\nAnd then the middle, I don't exactly know how to call what happens in food delivery. You do want some standardization elements, but you also want the local restaurants and so does DoorDash win or the Cloud Kitchen model win? I think it's a little bit harder to understand, but I do think that's kind of the variable that's determining where the future of marketplaces are going.\n\nLenny (01:02:19):\nIt's interesting to think about this event horizon for when a marketplace is no longer a marketplace. Is a simple way to think about that being when you own the supply, you're no longer a marketplace. When you don't own the supply, you are. Is that how you think about that?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (01:02:34):\nYeah, that's a good mental [inaudible 01:02:37]. Perhaps another way to say owning a supply is when there's no longer a direct transaction between supply and demand. That's what Opendoor took out, for example. You're not transacting with the home seller. You're transacting with Open Door and so that's, in my mind, no longer a marketplace because you also eliminate some of the marketplace mechanics we were talking about a bit.\n\nLenny (01:02:55):\nAwesome. Dan, this has been incredible. I feel like we've achieved our goal of getting really deep into the weeds on growth models and marketplaces. Two final questions for you.\n\nLenny (01:03:06):\nWhere can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (01:03:11):\nYeah, so I'm on Twitter at Dan Hockenmaier and then LinkedIn. People should feel free to reach out. I think the most useful thing is we're always growing our team at Faire. And so for folks who are interested in this space, I would love to connect with them.\n\nLenny (01:03:26):\nWhere do they go to learn more and apply for Faire?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (01:03:29):\nJust faire.com or faire.com/careers.\n\nLenny (01:03:32):\nAnd that's Faire with an \"e\" at the end?\n\nDan Hockenmaier (01:03:34):\nThat's correct, yes.\n\nLenny (01:03:36):\nAwesome. All right, Dan, thank you for being here.\n\nDan Hockenmaier (01:03:38):\nThank you so much for the time.\n\nLenny (01:03:41):\nThank you so much for listening.

She's just constantly building prompts and building workflows that I and everyone else on the team are just automating as much as possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):\nWhat are some things that you believe about AI that most people don't?\n\nDan Shipper (00:00:20):\nI hate the headlines that are like, \"Entry-level jobs are taken away by AI.\" Whenever I see a kid with ChatGPT, I'm like, \"Holy shit, they're going to go so much faster than any other person that I've worked with.\" We have this guy, he made a year's worth of progress in two months because every time I sat down with him and told him, \"Okay, here's how you tell a story, here's how you think about a headline,\" he recorded all of it, put it into a prompt, and he never made the same mistake twice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):\nThere's this sense we're getting to a place where you don't have to write any code, you have a product team not writing code at all.\n\nDan Shipper (00:00:46):\nNo one is manually coding anymore. Organizations like ours, people who are playing at the edge, we're doing things that, in three years, everybody else is going to be doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):\nToday, my guest is Dan Shipper. Dan is the co-founder and CEO of Every, which is a company that is at the very bleeding edge of what is possible with AI. Their team of just 15 employees has built and shipped four different products. They publish a daily newsletter, and they have a consulting arm that helps companies adopt the latest AI best practices. On their product team, their engineers don't handwrite a single line of code and instead use an arsenal of agents who help them craft requirements and build their products.\n\n(00:01:22):\nTheir editorial arm uses AI to publish better work faster, and they even have a person whose entire job is to help every employee at the company become more efficient using the latest AI workflows. In our conversation, Dan shares a bunch of tactics that they use internally to increase the leverage of their own employees, his personal AI tool stack, the one predictor that he's found for whether a company will successfully find huge productivity gains through AI, how he's building his company in a really unique way, a bunch of predictions for where AI is going, and so much more.\n\n(00:01:53):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

I've obviously been a huge fan for a long time and so it's an honor to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:16):\nIt's my honor, Dan. I feel like this is a podcast that was meant to be. I'm so happy we're finally doing this. There's so damn much that I want to talk about; there's so damn much we can talk about. I thought it'd be fun to start with just some hot takes.\n\n(00:04:29):\nAnd the reason I want to start here is I feel like you spend more time thinking about AI, building with AI, using AI, evaluating AI than anyone else I know nearly. And so I really respect your insights and your perspectives on where things are going. So let me just ask you this question and see where this goes. What are some things that you believe about AI using AI tools that most people don't believe?\n\nDan Shipper (00:04:55):\nI'm going to go with my hottest take, and this is the take that I have the least evidence for. So let's just start with that. I have other more well-reasoned takes to give you, but this is my hottest one, which is I think that AI may be one of the biggest force for reshoring American jobs. And so I think everyone is worried about it unemploying people. And for sure, it will change the skills needed to do the jobs that you're doing, but I think it may actually reshore a lot of jobs, and it'll do that in two ways.\n\n(00:05:27):\nOne is, there are a lot of expensive services that rich people and big companies are paid for right now, so in-house counsel or call center or whatever. And what cheap intelligence does is it makes those kinds of things affordable for small companies and individuals. So it stimulates demand. The other thing that it does is it allows people who are in those jobs to serve more people cheaply. It may not get rid of customer service, for example, but it may allow 10 people in the Midwest, who would normally be working at a call center, to serve hundreds of thousands or millions of people. Maybe that's too much, but a lot more people than they would ordinarily if they were the ones on the phone all the time.\n\n(00:06:22):\nAnd so it becomes much more cost-effective for American companies to hire people in the US. And I think the people in the US are going to be better, in a lot of cases, at using these AI tools to do work. So I think it may actually make it more effective to have those jobs in the US run by people sitting in the US who are using it to get work done. And also, the model companies are here too. So there's a lot of American stuff happening, and you can decide whether or not you think that's a good thing, but I think it's quite lost in the conversation over whether AI will get rid of jobs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:58):\nI like optimistic takes about AI, so this is great. And to your point, TBD if this is good for other countries, but good for the US. What else? What else you got? What other hot takes?\n\nDan Shipper (00:07:10):\nOkay. Another big hot take, and this is less contrarian and more just, I think, people are truly sleeping on it. I think people are truly sleeping on how good Claude Code is for non-coders. And I'll extend this to not just Claude Code, but Google just came out with the Gemini CLI command-line interface. So things like that. And I'll tell you for people who are listening that don't know what Claude Code is. Claude Code is just the command-line interface. It's those black terminals that programmers use. It's a command-line interface that you can boot up. It has access to your file system, it knows how to use any kind of terminal command and it knows how to browse the web, all that kind of stuff.\n\n(00:07:47):\nYou can give it something to do and it will go off and it'll run for 20 or 30 minutes and complete a task autonomously, agentically. Especially with Claude Opus 4 that just came out, it's this gigantic leap forward in AI's ability to work by itself. And Claude Code can even spawn multiple sub-agents that do a bunch of tasks in parallel and it's incredibly useful for programmers. Everybody inside of Every is using it all day, every day. Everyone's agent-pilled. They've got 15 agents doing all this kind of stuff. It's crazy.\n\n(00:08:18):\nBut non-programmers don't use it because it's intimidating to use the terminal. But for example, you can download all your meeting notes and put it in a folder and just be like, \"Okay, I want you to read every single one of my meeting notes and tell me...\" Something that I do, for example, is, \"Tell me all the time that I subtly avoided conflict.\"\n\n(00:08:38):\nAnd it writes a little to-do list for itself. It can have a little notebook, it can go and read each little thing and then write into its notebook, go down its to-do list and give you a summarized answer over multiple turns. So it's not just stuffing everything into context, which is what you'd be doing with ChatGPT chat or a regular Claude chat. It's actually processing every single file that you give it. And so I think it's incredibly powerful for any kind of task that involves processing a lot of text.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:06):\nSo as a simple way to think about this, you basically have an agent on your local computer that can read your local files and do your bidding.\n\nDan Shipper (00:09:14):\nYes, exactly. And it can do that for long amounts of time without going off the rails.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:21):\nInteresting. And so there's a small hurdle that non-technical people have to overcome, which is using their terminal and giving commands, but once they get it running, it's just you talk to it in English and ask it to do stuff.\n\nDan Shipper (00:09:32):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:33):\nSo the hot take here is just Claude Code, which most people think is for engineers, is the most underrated tool for non-technical people.\n\nDan Shipper (00:09:42):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:43):\nWhat are some other ways you imagine people seeing this? This meeting note example is really cool and I could see people using this. What else have you seen or thinking about?\n\nDan Shipper (00:09:52):\nSomething that I've done a lot, so I'm a writer for a lot of my job. And I know you're going to ask me about books I love, so I'm going to give you a sneak peek, which is I love War and Peace. I just read it for the third time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:03):\nWow, that's a long book.\n\nDan Shipper (00:10:06):\nIt's so long, but it's so good. I think Tolstoy is a brilliant writer. And one thing that I wanted to do is I was like, \"I want to inflect some of my writing with some of Tolstoy's style.\" And the way I did that is I think he's incredible at these little subtle sentences where he shows you what a character is thinking and feeling just by how they behave, how they move their face or the mismatch between the intonation in their voice and the expression in their eyes, all that kind of stuff. He's just an incredible student of human behavior and psychology.\n\n(00:10:36):\nAnd so I just downloaded War and Peace to my computer, which you can do because it's public domain. And then I had Claude read the first three chapters of War and Peace and pull out all of those descriptions, and then make a guide for itself for how to do character descriptions like Tolstoy. And you could totally do this with a regular Opus command, but you couldn't put all of War and Peace into it. It would take a lot more hand holding to get it to do this. And it just did this by itself without my really intervening.\n\n(00:11:05):\nI had it download a Russian version of War and Peace and the English version, and then start comparing different scenes that I love to tell me about things that I might've missed in the translations, so that you can get as deep and weird and nerdy for whatever subfield you care about as you want to. Same thing for if you've got tons of customer interviews or tons of customer data you want to go through, it's incredibly powerful for going and figuring stuff out from big data sets like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):\nYou actually inspired me to use... This is not what you're describing, but it's also something that's very cool. This is going to sound so nerdy. I'm reading Anna Karenina right now.\n\nDan Shipper (00:11:40):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:41):\nAlso Tolstoy. And this is recommended by a previous podcast guest. And so I was like, \"All right, I got to read this.\" Also very long. I'm on my Kindle, I'm just like, \"All right, 13% in, I've been reading for months.\"\n\nDan Shipper (00:11:52):\nHot take, I think War and Peace is better than Anna Karenina, especially for a tech person. But they're both good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):\nOkay, there we go. There's my year. I saw you tweet this use case that I love that I've been using, which is just while I'm reading, having ChatGPT voice sitting around and then just asking it questions. Because you don't actually have to feed it the book, it knows the whole book. And Anthropic just shared this. I don't know if they shared or someone found this in their legal briefings that they actually bought tons of books and scanned them themselves, is how they did fair use.\n\n(00:12:23):\nAnd so it has all this context. So just sitting there and asking it, \"What the heck is this thing in Russian society?\" is super fun. Okay, so this is awesome. So the tip here is just coming back to your hot take. The tip is you basically can have an agent using local files and doing all kinds of cool stuff on your computer versus having to upload it into projects or into your prompts and things like that. Super cool. So the bet here is that people are going to discover this and start using this just day to day.\n\nDan Shipper (00:12:53):\nI think they absolutely will. And I also think probably the model companies are going to start making this more accessible. I think one of the things that will just come from Claude Code and other things like it into everything else you use, whether it's on the web or wherever, is all of the original AI apps were pasting a chat box into an existing UI. So you've got Copilot, it's got the auto-complete in the IDE. You've got Cursor, it's got a little sidebar with a little chat. And the difference with Claude Code is you never look at the code. It's not meant for coding, it's not meant for coding by hand.\n\n(00:13:34):\nIt's meant for you to say, \"I want you to get something done,\" and it goes and does it. And I think we're just getting to a point where for pretty much all the usual applications, AI is going to be good enough that we can get rid of the interfaces more or less where you're digging into all the things that it's actually doing and you're interleaved with its execution and you're more just like, \"I'm delegating, it's going to go do it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:58):\nYeah. I had Cursor's CEO, Michael Truell, on the podcast, and this is his big vision is, \"What comes after code?\"\n\nDan Shipper (00:14:05):\nEnglish.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:06):\nExactly. Exactly. I also just had the founder of Base44 on the podcast who built this company, sold for 80 million bucks to Wix. And he shared that he's been around for six months, the company. For the last three months, he hasn't touched a single line of front-end code, all Cursor and other tools he's using. So this is happening.\n\nDan Shipper (00:14:27):\nSame thing for people inside of Every, no one is manually coding anymore.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:32):\nOkay. Definitely need to talk about that. Before we do, any other hot takes that you want to throw out there?\n\nDan Shipper (00:14:38):\nI have one other hot take, which is I have a definition for AGI. And so AGI is famously hard to define. What does it mean for it to be artificial general intelligence? The Turing test was one, but we'd pretty much blown past the Turing test in a lot of ways. So we have no good one. And so what I have noticed is that you can tell how much better AI is getting by how long a leash you can give it to do work.\n\n(00:15:09):\nSo with Copilot, you can tab complete and that was the beginning. With ChatGPT, you ask it a question and it returns a response and that's maybe slightly better than a tab complete. And then now with Claude Opus 4 and Gemini and all that kind of stuff, also with deep research, it can go off and work for 20 or 30 minutes. So that leash is getting longer where you have to intervene.\n\n(00:15:34):\nAnd I was thinking about this and it reminded me of Winnicott, who was a child psychologist. He wrote this book called Playing & Reality. And his conceptualization for what it means to become an adult, what it means to go from being an infant to a child to an adult is when you're first born, you're effectively fused with usually your mother, your caregiver. There's no difference between you and her or you and whoever your caregiver is.\n\n(00:16:02):\nAnd growing up is this process of being gradually let down in certain moments where you can handle being let down. So you learn that there's a separation between you and your caregiver. So for infants, it's instead of being fused at the hip for every hour of every day, you get left alone. Maybe you get left alone to cry it out. Who knows if that's the right thing to do with infants? A lot of consternation there. But that's teaching you that there's a separation between you and your mom or you and your dad. There's not going to always be someone to pick you up.\n\n(00:16:38):\nAnd raising a child is about knowing when they're ready to be let down a little bit and have to stand up on their own. So I think there's that same leash with human development. You get longer and longer periods of time where you can be on your own. So we're still in the 20 to 30 minutes is maybe... I don't know, you probably can't leave a toddler alone for 20 or 30 minutes, but it's a little bit older than a toddler.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:02):\nMaybe 20, 30 seconds.\n\nDan Shipper (00:17:06):\nWith a toddler, you can be in the same room but not interacting with them every single second for 20 minutes sometimes. So it's around there. I think we have that similar leash with AGI. And so I think a good definition of AGI is when does it become economically profitable for people to run agents indefinitely? So it just never turns off. It's a Claude Code that's always running, it's always doing something, you just never turn it off, and you don't need to because you know that it's worthwhile to keep it on.\n\n(00:17:41):\nIt's never waiting for you to be like, \"Okay, next thing.\" It'll always respond to you when you're like, \"Okay, next thing.\" But it's off just essentially living its life like a teenager and that is profitable for you. You'd rather have it do that than just wait for you to tell it what to do next.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:56):\nInteresting.\n\nDan Shipper (00:17:56):\nI think that's a good definition of AGI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):\nThe profitable piece is also just the cost of running that thing and having it.\n\nDan Shipper (00:18:02):\nIt's partly the cost and partly the value. And obviously, you can game this a little bit and be like, \"Cool, I'm just going to tell Claude to run in a loop forever.\" But I'm talking about more than that, more widespread adoption of agents that work all the time. And I like the profitable thing, because if it costs a little bit of money and the bar is profitability, it has to actually be doing something useful for you to keep it on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:29):\nIt's interesting how the metaphor of a senior employee and autonomy and essentially the more autonomous they are, the less instruction you have to give, the less reviews you have to do, is also just directly correlated with how senior they are.\n\nDan Shipper (00:18:44):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):\nOkay, great. Anything else along these lines?\n\nDan Shipper (00:18:48):\nI have plenty of them. I hate the headlines that are like, \"It's going to replace jobs,\" or \"It's going to unemploy two thirds of the workforce.\" I don't think that's true. I hate headlines that are like, \"You don't use your brain when you use ChatGPT,\" or another good headline is, \"Doctors alone, doctors plus AI, or just AI, which one is better? AI is better, therefore, doctors are going to be outmoded.\"\n\n(00:19:18):\nAll that stuff is, I think, pretty dumb. So for the doctors plus AI example, I think it's important to recognize that using AI is a skill. And so if you study doctors in a vacuum that don't really have a lot of experience with AI, you could probably create a situation such that it's better to just use an AI. And sometimes it is going to be better. But there's so many contexts that doctors need to make decisions and do things that it's really hard to take one study and make any conclusion about that.\n\n(00:19:52):\nAnd it's especially hard when you're dealing with a technology that's developing so rapidly that doctors can't really be expected to be experts at it yet. But I would guess in five or 10 years, that will be totally and completely different. For the student example or the \"AI turns your brain off\" example, I think it's really important to understand that in the history of technology, it has always been the case that you give up certain skills in order to get other ones. For example, Plato is famously very skeptical of writing because he thought it would harm your memory. And it did. We don't remember things quite as well as they did back in the day because they had to remember long epic poems to entertain each other.\n\n(00:20:37):\nBut I think writing is a worthwhile trade for having a slightly worse memory. And I think something similar is going on with AI where you may be slightly less engaged in certain tasks, but if you use it right, you're going to be way more engaged in other tasks where you have much more power. And so you can construct a study that says brain connectivity goes down when you use AI in the same way that you could construct a study that says people's memory are worse when they have writing skills. But I don't think anyone would want to go back to a world where no one was literate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:10):\nThat is super interesting. There's all these studies that are showing the benefits of AI to students with these studies in Nigeria and just how fast people progress. So I think it's really important, this context you're sharing that you will lose some things, but the hope is the gain is much higher, and so far it seems like it will be.\n\nDan Shipper (00:21:27):\nYeah. I think people always, especially at the beginning of a tech hype cycle or a revolution paradigm shift, it's always easy to underestimate how quickly things are going to change. And the example I always use is, I live in Brooklyn and the tailor down the street from me doesn't accept credit cards. Credit cards have been around for a long time, so it takes a long time for technology like this to be adopted even in the best case.\n\n(00:21:55):\nAnd I think it's really easy to underestimate how complex specific contexts are that humans know how to deal with. And just because you can get a really good score on a test... It's incredible. I love AI, it's so incredible, but it doesn't actually give you an intuition for how difficult it is to actually be replacing specific parts of work or activities that you would do. I think a really good thing to give you maybe a little bit of an intuition for it is I built this thing over a weekend a month ago that was, \"0.3, can it predict what I'm going to say in a meeting?\"\n\n(00:22:45):\nThat's a benchmark. It's the CEO benchmark. And the reason I did that is because the gold standard for OpenAI for testing how powerful a model is, is they test it on their internal code base. So they say, \"How good is the new model at predicting what comes next in our internal code base?\" Because that's not anywhere out on the internet. So it's a really good benchmark for that. And so I was like, \"Well, my meeting transcripts aren't anywhere on the internet. A lot of what I say is on the internet and there's some overlap, but it'd be interesting.\"\n\n(00:23:19):\nAnd so I ran a bunch of the frontier models on this, on just my Granola transcripts, and they're pretty bad. They are pretty bad, and it's not because they're not smart. There's this real push now. Tobi from Spotify coined this term called \"context engineering,\" which is getting the context to the model, the right context at the right time, is at least half the performance.\n\n(00:23:43):\nAnd I think that's 100% true. It's something that I've been writing about for three years. At the time, I called it knowledge orchestration. I think context engineering is probably a better term. But it's totally true, and that's a very, very hard problem to solve. It's not just a one- shot problem where it's gigantic context window and we're done. It's going...\n\nDan Shipper (00:24:00):\n... that problem, where it's like gigantic context window and we're done. I think it's going to get better over time, but the minute it gets good at predicting what I'm going to say next in a meeting, I'm just going to use it as a tool, and that's going to change the entire dynamic of what I say next in a meeting. So it's not as easy as it seems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:18):\nInteresting. I imagine you can build a GPT from that. And then, instead of having a meeting with Dan now, just talk to this thing, and he'll make decisions.\n\nDan Shipper (00:24:26):\nYes, definitely. And I mean we do this a little bit. It's not the same as being able to predict exactly what I'm going to say in a meeting. But I think if you're a CEO, or founder, or manager, it's really stunning how much of your job is just repeating yourself. And that is one of the best things about this AI, particularly AI revolution, is that you don't have to repeat yourself.\n\n(00:24:48):\nAnd so we had it last quarter. I tend to set one or two quarterly goals. And one of my big goals for us last quarter was don't repeat yourself. So I don't want ever say the same thing in a meeting twice, if I can help it. So for us, at Every, one of the big parts of Every is we have a daily newsletter. And I'm spending a lot of time giving feedback on headlines, or giving feedback on, \"How do you write an intro,\" or \"Is this idea any good,\" that kind of stuff.\n\n(00:25:15):\nAnd we've started to codify all of that into prompts that basically... It's not the same as mimicking me. It can't exactly say exactly what I'm going to say in a meeting, but it pushes my taste out to the edge so that writers who are not able to talk to me, by the time I see it, they've already talked to some simulation of a simulation of me. And that's incredibly powerful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):\nLet's follow this thread. This is exactly where I want it to go. I feel like the business you're building, the team you're building, the way you're operating is the very bleeding edge of how companies will operate and are trying to operate in this AI era. You guys are trying to be super AI-first. And it's super aligned with just so much of your writing. There's just so much reason to study what you guys are doing. So-\n\nDan Shipper (00:26:04):\nWell, thank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:05):\nYes. And this is benefiting all of us, so thank you. So first of all, just tell people what the heck Every is, and then share a few insights into just how you operate. It's funny that you laugh at [inaudible 00:26:20] whatever you say.\n\nDan Shipper (00:26:20):\nEveryone asks that because it's a very weird shape of a company. You can actually see other companies that have this shape from earlier eras, but it's less common. It doesn't make as much sense.\n\n(00:26:33):\nAnd I think it's newly enabled by AI, and we can talk about why. But the way that I typically talk about Every is we do ideas and apps at the edge of AI. So the core of the business is we have a daily newsletter. We've been doing it for about five years. We have about 100,000 subscribers. All of the people from the top AI labs read us. Anyone who's basically interested in or working in AI at the frontier and wants to know what's on reads us.\n\n(00:27:00):\nWe do a lot of... For example, whenever OpenAI or Anthropic drop a new model, we get our hands on it early, and then we get to play with it and write about it, which it's my ideal job. I love it. It's the best.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:14):\nIt sounds like it.\n\nDan Shipper (00:27:14):\nI don't if I can curse on this podcast, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:15):\nYou can.\n\nDan Shipper (00:27:15):\n... it's the fucking best.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:18):\nPerfect. Excellent use. And you call those \"vibe checks\", is that the-\n\nDan Shipper (00:27:22):\nYeah, we call them vibe checks-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:22):\nVibe checks, love those.\n\nDan Shipper (00:27:24):\n... which I think is really important because... And this gets to the next part, the apps part of what we do. I think it's really important to do vibe checks and to call them vibe checks because they're about how does it feel to use this thing and how does it feel to use it for work for things that you would normally use it for in your job or in your life. Because I think that captures something that standard benchmarks just don't capture and really can't. And the best people to tell... to write a vibe check are people that are actually at the edge using it for stuff.\n\n(00:27:57):\nAnd so what we've found over time is we have... We love, we think the best writing and content about technology is from people that are actually using it and building with it. And so we've always had this sort of function, where we're always building little experiments in addition to our writing, and that helps us write great stuff. And that has turned into a suite of apps that we run internally. And the people who are building those apps are also writers, and they're contributing to things like vibe checks.\n\n(00:28:27):\nSo you get a really inside look into how is this stuff being built from people who are actually using it every day. And the suite of apps that we have, one's called Cora. We just launched Cora publicly on the day that we're recording this, which is really awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:39):\nCongratulations.\n\nDan Shipper (00:28:40):\nThank you. You can think of it like a chief of staff, an AI chief of staff for your email. It helps you manage your email with AI. It's very cool. We can go into more of it later. We have another one called Sparkle, which is an AI file cleaner. We have another one called Spiral that does content automation with AI. We originally incubated Lex, which is an AI document writer, which we spun out into its own company, and my Every co-founder runs that.\n\n(00:29:05):\nAnd basically we bundle everything together. So you pay one price, and you get access to all of the software that we make, and we're constantly putting new stuff in the bundle. And I can tell you more about what kinds of things do we like to incubate and how do we like to incubate it because I think there's some really interesting, special things in there.\n\n(00:29:21):\nBut I've been blabbering for a while, so I'll stop there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:23):\nThere's also a consulting firm, which I want to talk about, but let's hold off on that.\n\nDan Shipper (00:29:25):\nYeah, we have consulting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):\nYeah.\n\nDan Shipper (00:29:27):\nWe also do that, and that's the third leg of the stool in the business. It doesn't fit quite as nicely into my ideas in app streaming, but we spend a lot of time with big companies, where we teach them basically how to be AI-first. We train all the people on how to use AI. And it's very cool, it's really fun, and a very important part of what we do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:47):\nThat feels like a billion-dollar business right there. I want to come back to it.\n\nDan Shipper (00:29:50):\n[inaudible 00:29:50].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:51):\nBecause everybody wants to learn this.\n\n(00:29:53):\nOkay, so share a few ways that you guys operate. You mentioned that your team doesn't write any code. What are just some ways that allow you to operate this efficiently? I know your team's really small. You have a daily newsletter, you have three, four products, you have a consulting arm. How big is the team at Every?\n\nDan Shipper (00:30:10):\nWe have 15 people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:11):\n15 people? Okay.\n\nDan Shipper (00:30:12):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:12):\nSo just give us insight into some of the ways you operate that are at the bleeding edge.\n\nDan Shipper (00:30:16):\nOkay, so a couple of things. One, and I think everyone should do this, is we have a head of AI operations. I sit with her once a week. And every time I'm doing something repetitively, we put it in a to-do list. And she's just constantly building prompts, and building workflows, and stuff like that so that I and everyone else on the team are just automating as much as possible. And I think that has been a big unlock because it's really hard to...\n\n(00:30:44):\nIf you're working in a job all day, you're fighting fires, and you're like, \"Okay, am I going to do this in the way that I know how or am I going to do it in the new way that might not work?\" I don't want to spend a bunch of time [inaudible 00:30:54] you're building some no-code automation. I don't want to do that. And having an AI operations lead lets you basically identify those things and have them solved without people who are doing the work actually having to take time to do it, which I think makes it much more likely it happens.\n\n(00:31:10):\nThere's always a trick with that, where it's like you have to make sure it gets used. So it's basically you're developing little applications internally, but if you're good at making applications people use, it's great. Highly recommend having an AI operations lead.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:23):\nI imagine you saw the [inaudible 00:31:25] Quora tweeted about this, wanting to hire exactly this sort of person.\n\nDan Shipper (00:31:29):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:29):\nSo clearly this is a trend.\n\nDan Shipper (00:31:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:31):\nSo the idea is your point that this needs to be somebody who's outside of the day-to-day work of the company, and is specifically focused on helping the team be more efficient with AI?\n\nDan Shipper (00:31:43):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:44):\nAnd then is this person mostly just you automating you, or can they help other people? Are they helpful-\n\nDan Shipper (00:31:49):\nNo, she helps everyone, basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:49):\nEveryone? Okay.\n\nDan Shipper (00:31:51):\nWhere we're starting right now is with the editorial operation. So there's so much stuff in the editorial operation, where I or our editor in chief, Kate... Kate, is constantly doing little, small copy edits to make sure everything is in Every style, and it takes hours a day. And so now Opus is at a point where you can give it a style guide and a prompt, and it will go through anything you're writing, and copy edit it, which is amazing.\n\n(00:32:24):\nThe trick is it's not just building that. You also have to get Kate to be like, \"Did you put this through the prompt yet,\" anytime someone gives her something. So there's a little bit of behavioral update too that has to happen, which I think is a really interesting organizational challenge.\n\n(00:32:38):\nAnd I think for us it's a little easier because everybody inside the org is very AI-first and just wants to go do it. We don't have anyone really who's like, \"I don't know. I don't really want to do this.\" And that's a whole different challenge, which I think a lot of organizations face, but there's always a problem of getting people to use it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:55):\nThat is super cool. What is her background, this AI operations person?\n\nDan Shipper (00:32:59):\nHer name is Katie Parrott. She actually does a lot of ghostwriting for us. So she also, when people inside of Every who are builders... Often they just write themselves, but sometimes they want help, and she'll help them write about whatever they're working on. So that's how she started with us. She still does that, but she also spends a lot of time doing the AI operation stuff.\n\n(00:33:20):\nAnd then before that, she worked at Animalz, which is a content marketing agency, one of the top content marketing agencies. And they're very process oriented. And I think the reason Katie is so good is because she's incredibly good at that kind of process stuff or thinking about that, but she's also a great writer and she's also just incredibly excited about AI. She just wants to tinker and wants to use it. And that was the thing that got me to be like, \"Okay, you should just come and do that. Instead of just ghostwriting, we should add this to your plate.\" And it's been really fantastic.\n\n(00:33:58):\nAt minimum, you really just want someone who's just like, \"I want to tinker. I want to build stuff.\" There's also people who have a little bit more of that process orientation. I think that is important. And to the extent they understand the craft of the thing that they're trying to build for, that also helps a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:14):\nThis is an amazing tip. I feel like everyone's going to start hiring these people.\n\nDan Shipper (00:34:17):\nI think so. There's a couple other people who talk about this. I heard Rachel Woods, who's another... She thinks a lot of AI stuff. She's talking about it. I think it's becoming a thing, and I think it's really important, and it just bleeds out into every other part of the org.\n\n(00:34:33):\nSo we're doing this inside of the editorial org, but there's a lot of copy that goes out on Cora. And by the way, Cora is spelled C-O-R-A, so it's different from Q-U-O-R-A, slightly confusing. There's a lot of copy that goes out on Cora, or Spiral, or Sparkle that we want to have that same Every quality bar for. And so we have engineers sending Kate, like, \"Here's the Figma file. Can you go and do copy edits?\" And that sucks for everybody. And Kate is one person, and it's just really hard to do that.\n\n(00:35:04):\nSo one thing that we did, Nityesh, who's one of the engineers on Cora, built a Claude Code command that just uses that prompt, and checks through the entire code base for all the copy edits, and then creates a pull request on GitHub, and then sends the pull request to Kate. So she's just looking at the pull request, and being like, \"Does this make sense?\"\n\n(00:35:26):\nAnd so you can translate that prompt into, for example, a format that engineers can use. And suddenly your engineering team is writing marketing copy in the style you want. I think that's so cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:36):\nThat is extremely cool. I'm going to take us on a little tangent. You keep mentioning-\n\nDan Shipper (00:35:42):\n[inaudible 00:35:42].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:42):\n... Claude, and I'm curious just what is in the stack of tools that you find yourself using, your team ends up using. It seems like Claude is a core part of it.\n\nDan Shipper (00:35:51):\nI do love Claude. I would say I'm generally... My first thing that I open is o3. I'm a ChatGPT boy. And I think o3 is super high quality. I think it's great for writing, it's great for coding, it's great for all that stuff. And what it has that really makes a difference still from Claude is it has memory. And I just love that. I've spent so much time yelling at ChatGPT about, \"I need my writing to be punchy and concise.\" And it just knows that now.\n\n(00:36:20):\nSo I think when I ask it to write something for me, it's actually better than yours. Or maybe not yours, but your average ChatGPT user. And I also find I use it a lot for self-reflection and personal growth type stuff. So it knows me. So when I send it a meeting transcript, and I'm like, \"How did I do?\" It's like, \"Well, you did that thing that you normally do, but you're way better on this other thing.\" And I like that. I think that's really great. So day-to-day, o3, that's my go-to.\n\n(00:36:49):\nI think Claude Opus is... First of all, Claude Code, everyone inside Every, that's basically what we use. If you're building something, you're using Claude Code. It's crazy. It's so good.\n\n(00:37:01):\nGemini just came out with something, so I'm very excited to try that because I think that's the model that we use most for the apps that we build, inside the apps. It's incredibly powerful and it's incredibly cheap, which is great. So I want to try the CLI tool that they came out with.\n\n(00:37:17):\nWe also use Codex a bit, which is OpenAI's coding tool. And that's for, like, \"I want a one-off, self-contained... I want to pick off this little feature.\"\n\n(00:37:27):\nWhat else do I use? Going back to Claude, Claude Opus 4 can do something that no other model, except one other model that I can't talk about... can do something that no-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:39):\n[inaudible 00:37:39].\n\nDan Shipper (00:37:39):\n... other model can do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):\nOkay, we won't go there. We don't want to get you in trouble. Okay, go on.\n\nDan Shipper (00:37:44):\nBut yeah, no other model can do this. Which is earlier versions of Claude, and I think generally versions of other models, when you ask them, \"Is this piece of writing any good,\" Claude, for example, would always give it a B+. And then if you did another turn of the same conversation, you're like, \"I updated this,\" it would always go to A-. And then if you give it another turn, it would go to A.\n\n(00:38:07):\nSo it doesn't have the same kind of gut. It's thinking about what you probably want hear too much. And there's various methods that you can use to prompt engineer around this, like give it a template or whatever. And they sort of worked, but it just still doesn't have that thing where it's like, \"Can it tell if writing is interesting or any good? Does it have that gut sense?\" And Opus 4 has it. It's really wild. And I think that's super important because it opens up all these use cases where you might want to use a language model as a judge. So for us, for example, we're working on a new version of our product Spiral, which does content automation. You've used that in the past. And we're doing essentially Claude Code, but for content style product, where you say, \"I want it to write a tweet,\" you give it all the documents, it has a bunch of memories, it creates a to-do list for itself, and then it goes and writes.\n\n(00:39:04):\nAnd one of the things that is so interesting is now, because it can judge things, part of its to-do list is, \"Okay, I wrote three tweets. I'm going to judge whether I think these are any good,\" and then it can improve before it comes back to you.\n\n(00:39:21):\nAnd that's just a huge, huge unlock, that we were struggling for three months to build this crazy system to try to get it to judge writing. And then Opus 4, just one-shotted it, and we're like, \"Great, this product works. Let's start chipping it.\" So yeah, I love it for that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:37):\nAre there any other AI tools that you just use regularly? You mentioned Granola, even outside of the bottles. So what are some that you think maybe people are sleeping on?\n\nDan Shipper (00:39:46):\nI use Granola. So I used to use Super Whisper and Whisper flow, which I think are fantastic. We have an internal version of that called Monologue that will be shipping in a month or so that I use now, but you can think of them as roughly equivalent. And I think generally speech to text interfaces are the future, and more people should be using them, and more people should be building them as affordances. We use Notion all the time, and I specifically use their meeting recording. I think that's mostly the stack.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:17):\nOkay. That was really helpful and super interesting.\n\n(00:40:20):\nThis episode is brought to you by PostHog, the product platform your engineers actually want to use.

Was that her name?\n\nDan Shipper (00:41:33):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:33):\nOkay. What else? What else do you do that you think other companies should be doing or will eventually start doing?\n\nDan Shipper (00:41:39):\nSo the Cora team, which is Kieran and Nityesh, basically-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:43):\n[inaudible 00:41:43] that's the team, two people?\n\nDan Shipper (00:41:44):\nThat's the team, yeah. Well, with Cora, it's Kieran, Nityesh, and 15 Claude Code instances, so it's more powerful than you think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:53):\nI love that. This is just, again, a glimpse into the future.\n\nDan Shipper (00:41:58):\nOne of the things that we do that I think is really cool, and they basically invented this, I had nothing to do with this, is they invented the idea of compounding engineering. So basically, for every unit of work, you should make the next unit of work easier to do.\n\n(00:42:16):\nSo an example is, in a Claude Code world, where you're not coding a lot, you end up spending a lot of time essentially typing PRDs. Like, \"Here's a document with exactly the stuff that I need to do,\" right? And so you could just be like, \"Okay, cool. That's my job now. I'm going to just write PRDs.\" And so each successive PRD, it's the same amount of work.\n\n(00:42:45):\nOr you could spend a little bit of time being like... There's a sort of platonic ideal of a PRD. And what I'm going to do is write a prompt that can take my rambling thoughts and then turn that into a PRD. And so you spend a little bit of work to make all of the next PRDs that you're doing easier to write because you're writing less of them.\n\n(00:43:08):\nAnd so finding those little speed-ups, where every time you're building something, you're making it easier to do that same thing next time, I think gets you a lot more leverage in your engineering team.\n\n(00:43:20):\nAnd so, yeah, we have Kieran and Nityesh. And Cora, it just became public. It was in private beta. It had 2,500 active users. And there's millions of emails going through it. And that's one of the products that we do as a 15-person company. It's kind of crazy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:37):\nIt is crazy. How do you do the speed-up thing? Is it prompts that they continue to refine [inaudible 00:43:44]?\n\nDan Shipper (00:43:44):\nA lot of it is prompts, and automations, and stuff like that. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:47):\nGot it. For automations, what's the tool? What's the tool you use for automating automations?\n\nDan Shipper (00:43:52):\nWhat they're using a lot of is Claude Code. So you can do slash commands in Claude Code, which are repeated prompts that you're doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:01):\nGot it. Okay. So basically they're building a library of prompts that make the process, of, \"Here's what I want to build,\" to a good solid PRD that you can feed into Claude Code more correct and more efficient?\n\nDan Shipper (00:44:13):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:14):\nSuper interesting. And they just keep a file or they put this into a project? Is that how they store this stuff?\n\nDan Shipper (00:44:14):\nIt's a GitHub. It's a GitHub GitHub-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:22):\n[inaudible 00:44:22].\n\nDan Shipper (00:44:22):\n... where they can share it with each other.\n\n(00:44:24):\nAnother thing that they do, which I think is very cool, is they use a bunch of Claudes at once, but then they're also using three other agents. There's an agent called Friday that they love.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:36):\nThat's an AI Asian product called Friday?\n\nDan Shipper (00:44:38):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:38):\nHadn't heard of that. Okay, interesting.\n\nDan Shipper (00:44:40):\nThere's another one called Charlie that they really love. And in particular, I think the thing they like about Charlie... We have a whole video about this, which I can send to you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:47):\nYeah, I'll point to it.\n\nDan Shipper (00:44:48):\nThey did an S-tier through F-tier of AI agents, which I think is so funny. And one of the things I really like about Charlie is that it lives in GitHub, so when you get a pull request, you can just be like, at Charlie, \"Can you check this out?\" And that seems to work really well to have different agents that have maybe slightly different perspectives. It's like different people that have different perspectives and have different taste.\n\n(00:45:15):\nKieran, he's one of those serious Rails-files, who they just love Rails, and they love the way that Rails feels, and so I think he has a real sensitivity to... Okay, this agent, ChatGPT for example, it feels very terse, and minimal, and professional, and it has a particular kind of style that maybe he likes. Versus, I don't know, Claude is a slightly different style. And I think all of that is so interesting that these things have personalities, and that that changes what you might want to use it for or why you might want to use three of them at once.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):\nThat is so fascinating. It makes me think about Peter Deng's conversation again, where he talks about his hiring strategy and one of his key lessons. And he ended up hiring the current head of product for ChatGPT, the current head of marketing at ChatGPT, the current head of engineering because he hires these incredible people.\n\n(00:46:07):\nAnd his philosophy is to hire a team of Avengers, where everyone is strong at certain things, and together they're the perfect team, versus everyone... versus the best at everything. And it's interesting that you can almost do that with different product, different agents from different companies.\n\nDan Shipper (00:46:22):\nYou definitely can.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:23):\nAnd it makes me feel like there's a bigger market than people think potentially, where people will want different companies, agents, not just all Devins or not all Codexes.\n\nDan Shipper (00:46:30):\nI think there really is. It's definitely not one agent to rule them all at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:35):\nSo interesting.\n\nDan Shipper (00:46:36):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:36):\nOh, my God. The two people on the Cora team, what's their background? Are they both engineers or what are they?\n\nDan Shipper (00:46:42):\nThey're both engineers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:43):\nOkay.\n\nDan Shipper (00:46:44):\nKieran's got this crazy background, where... They both have really interesting backgrounds. Kieran's got this crazy background, where he was previously VP Eng at a startup, so was effectively the CTO of a startup, or maybe two startups, and was one of the founders. But before that, he was a composer, a professional composer. And before that, he was a baker. So we did a team retreat in France last year, and he taught us all how to make croissants. My croissant was horrible. His was beautiful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:14):\nSeems [inaudible 00:47:16].\n\nDan Shipper (00:47:16):\nAnd generally, I think that kind of multidimensional type of talent is the kind of person that I love having at Every. Because we're all generalists. We all want to use AI for all these weird, awesome, creative things. And someone who has that background is going to have a good taste for not only agents, but, \"What should the landing page look like,\" or whatever. Which I think is increasingly important, where you're trying to scale a team of generalists of 15 people to five products. So that's Kieran's background.\n\n(00:47:43):\nNatasha's background is... I'm jealous because he only started learning to code when ChatGPT came out. He had wanted to learn to code forever, and he's only known how to code in an AI era. And I keep telling him, \"Dude, I learned to program in middle school from books.\" I had to go to Barnes & Noble and buy a book. And there was nothing... I couldn't Google any-\n\nDan Shipper (00:48:00):\nI had to go to Barnes and Noble and buy a book and there was nothing... I couldn't Google anything about why this function wasn't working.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:08):\nNo Stack Overflow even back then.\n\nDan Shipper (00:48:10):\nYeah, yeah. There wasn't that overflow. There was weird BB net forums and stuff that I was like 12 and I probably shouldn't have been on there or whatever. So he has gone so much faster than any other engineer, I think in a pre AI era. And I see the same thing in the rest of the company. I think there's this huge question about what happens when kids... Entry level jobs are taken away by AI. And my take is like that's worth thinking about and it's possible that that might be a problem at some point. But my take is whenever I see a kid with ChatGPT, I'm like, holy shit, they're going to grow so much faster than any other person that I've worked with. We have this guy Alex Duffy who works with us, he writes for Context Window and he just launched, we taught AIs how to play diplomacy with each other, which is really cool.\n\n(00:49:08):\nAnd he did that whole thing and I think he's really, really, really talented. And when he came to us, I guess almost a year ago now, it was one of those classic cases which I've seen over and over at every... Which is, you have great ideas, but you're not a good writer yet and it's really hard for me to do anything with you until you're good enough at it. So I have to give you small little things until you get better and blah, blah, blah, whatever. And what I noticed with him is he was just making a year. He made a year's worth of progress in two months because every time I sat down with him and told him, okay, here's how you tell a story. Here's how you think about a headline. He recorded all of it, put it into a prompt, and he never made the same mistake twice.\n\n(00:49:49):\nAnd I think he's so much accelerated from where he would have been because of this stuff, and I see that in lots of other parts of the work. So Natasha is another good example. And so I think generally people are going to figure out that some 20-year-old with ChatGPT subscription is super powerful if you just mentor them. And I think that's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:11):\nMan, there's so many threads I could follow here. There's all this fear of entry level people will never... The roles are disappearing for entry level people and so how will we ever have senior people if these people can't learn to do things as an entry level person? And what you're saying is ChatGPT and these tools help you accelerate really quickly so you don't really need to be at the bottom rung for a long time.\n\nDan Shipper (00:50:33):\nYeah. You're effectively learning how to be one level above the entry level from the beginning and this is sort of my whole allocation economy thesis where when you look at skills are going to be valuable in the AI era, one big group of skills are the skills of managers. Today, they're human managers, tomorrow everyone's a model manager. Right now, AI is not... Right now, management skills are not broadly distributed, because it's very expensive, another expensive thing that... So 8% of the workforce is managers. It's now going to be much cheaper to manage, so more people are going to have to do it. And so that's the thing that kids, 20-year-olds, whatever, I see is now are going to start to have to learn in addition to, it's not like you can just say, okay, go do it and then come back. You have to be able to go into the work that's being done and help make it better. But they're learning both at the same time. They're learning how to manage and how to do the actual work so that they're good at it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):\nAnd the managing here is managing agents. Right?\n\nDan Shipper (00:51:41):\nYeah. You're managing AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:43):\nAnd so coming back to your point about how this core team, and I guess you said everyone doesn't write code, zero code written, now it's just managing agents that are writing code for you.\n\nDan Shipper (00:51:54):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:55):\nOkay. I've never heard of a company at this stage, so this is extremely cool. So the workflow is they give it, here's what I want. I refine it using this cool prompts library that they build on and agents build code, write the code. Then basically the time is spent reviewing code and then reviewing the output. What does it look like? What does it feel like? And then continuing to refine, wow. So you guys are at where Michael from Cursor said we will be. So I chatted with him a few months ago. He said in a year, this is where he thinks the thing will be. We're not looking at code anymore. You guys are already there. Although you were looking at code. Okay, you're still looking at code.\n\nDan Shipper (00:52:33):\nThey definitely are looking at code. So you're doing a code review before you do anything. And I do think Danny, who runs Spiral, which is the cloud code for content tool I was talking about that we're building, he spent a couple of days digging into the internals of some third party library that we were interested in just because it's helpful to know, it's helpful to understand those things, but then he's not actually writing any code. Once he understands it, he's just off telling cloud code what to do. And I think that's really important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:08):\nThis is an insane milestone we're hitting here. There's this sense we're getting to a place where you don't need to really understand code, you don't have to write any code. We'll get there and you guys are there. I think this is so easy to overlook how wild this is. You have a product team not writing code at all.\n\nDan Shipper (00:53:26):\nIt is really wild. I think it's really wild in particular, just having a small group of people that have... Everyone has all these different skills. Everyone's a generalist, everyone's AI forward. So what you can do in an environment like that with just still a small team is crazy. And you're kind of inventing all these new principles for how do we work together, how do we do engineering, all that kind of stuff. And I think that's what makes the writing... That's why I like doing that is because the writing that we do from that I think is really good because we can talk about it from a sort of position of experience, but I do want to say something else which is we're not at a point yet where the people that work at every could do what they do if they didn't know how to code.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):\nYeah, this is what I was going to ask.\n\nDan Shipper (00:54:10):\nWhich is a different bar, and I think for a long time it's going to be valuable to know how to code for a long time, but this is a progression that is not a new progression. So for example, when I was in middle school learning to code, the new hot thing was scripting languages, which is Python and JavaScript. But if you were a real programmer, you would understand the language underlying Python and JavaScript, which is written in C. and scripting language weren't totally real. And in order to really do anything interesting, you had to be able to learn both parts of the stack. Same thing for C programmers, when I guess in the seventies C was invented, it was like you got to be able to write assembly.\n\n(00:54:59):\nAnd English is just a layer on top of scripting languages. So I think all of those things were right in the sense that there's... Especially during transitions, there's a lot of reasons why it's important to be able to go down a layer in the stack and it gets less and less frequent over time, but that still takes a long time. And there's some times when even if you're a JavaScript or a Python programmer, it's useful to know how that stuff works, how it's written, and see how it's implemented. Today it's much less important than it used to be, but that took 10 or 20 years. And I think that the same thing is going to be true for programming. Having that skill is super important and will accelerate you significantly. It will sort of start to get less important over time, but we're not close to that yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:44):\nOkay. That's a really important point. I'm glad you went there. So do you have a sense of how far we might be from you hiring someone to build another product that isn't an engineer?\n\nDan Shipper (00:55:54):\nLike a real SaaS product?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):\nSo hey, we have this idea we want to bring someone on to actually lead it.\n\nDan Shipper (00:56:00):\nVery far. Not within sight, but there's a lot of things that could be products that are a level down from that I think that you could do almost now. So an example, we were talking about DIA, the new AI browser from the browser company. DIA has these things called skills, which are effectively little AI apps that you can run in the browser. You can prompt them and they run on the web page and do work for you. A non-technical person can build that, same thing for custom GPTs from ChatGPT. A non-technical person can definitely build that. So I think while I will definitely maintain that we're not anywhere close to anybody being able to build a conventional SaaS app with zero programming knowledge, aside from just a demo, there are going to be other forms of software.\n\n(00:56:55):\nOne of my things is like software is becoming content. There's going to be other forms of software that don't look like the software today, but you can run, start and run as a business, as a non-technical person even if you don't know how to code. And that'll happen very soon. I mean, it's already kind of happening. It doesn't look like the thing that you're asking about. It's sort of like the difference between a Hollywood movie and a YouTube video.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:17):\nI think that's really reassuring to a lot of people. Basically what you're seeing is AI just supercharges people who have a skill and allows them to do a lot more.\n\nDan Shipper (00:57:25):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:26):\nOkay. Is there any other way that you guys operate that is really interesting that might be worth sharing that helps you operate really quickly, helps you do more with less?\n\nDan Shipper (00:57:38):\nI mean, I would love to talk about how we think about building products, what products to build, what do we end up building? Because I think that there's something sort of special about it that probably there's a playbook that is useful for people. So when I think about... This is only sort of snapped into focus recently. So a lot of this was just doing it intuitively without really a thought for it. But when I think about the kind of things that we have ended up incubating, it's basically goes back to something I said at the beginning, which is there are these things that were historically really expensive that only rich people or big companies could buy. So a chief of staff for your email, I think a therapist or a lawyer is another interesting example. Someone to organize your closet or organize your computer is another example. Someone to go straight for you, that are becoming orders of magnitude cheaper so that everyone can use them even if you're at a small startup.\n\n(00:58:39):\nAnd so basically when you're running, we are sort of this AI first company. You're running into all these little things where you're like, I wish I had a ghost writer right now, but ghost writers are really expensive. Or I wish I had a lawyer but it would cost me like $25,000. Lawyers are really expensive and there's a lot more demand for those services than can be fulfilled because they're so expensive. And what AI does is it allows you to be like, oh, I could just use cloud for that. I can use ChatGPT for that. And so you're able to use the demand that you have that we can afford a lawyer. We have ghost writers, but there's a lot more that we can't do because we can't afford it. So we still have our lawyer and we still have our ghost writers, but we just do a lot more of that stuff.\n\n(00:59:27):\nAnd so we notice that. We start to then use ChatGPT and cloud first, these general purpose tools to try it and see is this useful? Does this actually work? All that kind of stuff. And then if it does, we will unbundle it into its own separate thing that becomes an app. And I think what's really special about this time is the entire game board has been totally reset in terms of things you can build. Where five years ago it was like you're going to build another Notes app. We've been building notes app for forever, another B2B SAS app. It's all the same stuff in slightly different packaging. And now it's totally new territory. No one knows what's going on. Everyone's inventing it as it happens. All these new workflows are being created in a very similar way to, I don't know, for example, when spreadsheets were first a thing on computers, we were figuring out all these new workflows on spreadsheets.\n\n(01:00:24):\nThey got unbundled in the B2B SAS, same thing for ChatGPT and Claude. And what's really cool is you can be like, cool, I'm using using ChatGPT for this. It's really useful for me. And you might be one of the first people to really notice that. And then because everybody that works at Every is AI first and came to us because they reads Every, they read Every, so we all have the same vibe and we're all kind of doing similar stuff. They become our first users. So we measure the success of the product by is it a banger inside of Every, monologue the app that I was talking to you about, everyone just started using it and we're like, okay, we've got something here.\n\n(01:01:05):\nAnd what's really interesting then is if everyone inside of Every uses it and people read Every, they have a similar vibe to us too, so they become the next set of users. And that's a really, I think, interesting pipeline for building applications or building apps. It's a totally new greenfield so that all the stuff you're thinking about, it's probably new, which is really cool. And over time, what I think is organizations like ours, people who are playing at the edge, we're doing things that in three years everybody else is going to be doing. So it may be kind of niche for now, but it will be a big deal in three years when everyone else has the same needs that we do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:45):\nThat is really cool. What I'm hearing is GPT wrappers are a good idea and are worth building.\n\nDan Shipper (01:01:50):\n100% thank you. GPT wrappers are amazing and they've been much maligned for absolutely no reason and people don't understand how absolutely valuable they are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:03):\nI think there's also just you guys raised a sip seed round. This is a good time to maybe talk about that. Just these products don't have to become some mega-billion dollar hits. You kind of have this portfolio of companies, you have the content business. So I think there's a really interesting approach to how big these need to get to be successful. Maybe just talk about that.\n\nDan Shipper (01:02:25):\nYeah. I really want Every to be an institution that teaches people how to live a better, more human life with technology, particularly with AI. And both teaches them how to do it with writing and the content we make and then builds tools for them to do that. But I think fundamental to building an institution is, at least for me, the way I would like to do it is I want internally it to feel like this creative playground where we have the opportunity to take risk and do stuff and do weird stuff that just doesn't make any sense. We can't justify anyone, but we just feel like it would be fun. And so I think I'm always playing with that dynamic tension between institution serious, we want this to be lasting and important and it should just be fun. Let's play around. And I think having that tension is really valuable.\n\n(01:03:16):\nAnd so I've always been sort of hesitant to raise a lot of money because I think it locks you into having to be that serious thing that's totally going for it. And there's lots of companies that figure out that balance. But just for me personally as a founder, I'm like, I want to keep the optionality alive and I want to keep the kind of playful feeling alive. And I think part of that comes from I know I have the control to do what I want more or less. There's probably also some deeper psychological things going on there, which I'm happy to talk about if you want to get into it. But I think there's also just... That's what I want. And so when we started Every, we raised a very small 700K pre-seed round, and this was at the height of the creator economy.\n\n(01:03:59):\nSo we both started our newsletters. He and I started our newsletters around the same time. It was the hypest, craziest thing. People were throwing money around. It was wild. But we raised 700K because it was like, I want to raise enough for us to be able to experiment, have a little cash cushion, but not so much that it locks us into anything. And we sent an email to all of our investors being like, and you're one of our investors, so you've probably got this email.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:22):\nTiny investor. But I'm in there, I'm in there.\n\nDan Shipper (01:04:26):\nWe sent an email to everyone being like, this is probably not a venture business, so you should not expect us to raise again. And we even raised on this slightly modified safe that gave everyone the option to convert to equity in three years, even if we didn't raise more money. So we did it in a way that allowed us the option to get really big and do the traditional thing and also the option to do it the way we want to do it. Maybe it's not a huge business, but we love it. That's great. And we did the same thing for this recent round where we raised up to 2 million from Reid Hoffman and starting line VC. And we did it as what I've been calling a sip seed round, which is basically they've committed $2 million, but we can pull it down whenever we want and we just do it on a safe at a set cap.\n\n(01:05:12):\nAnd for me, that's really helpful because it allows me psychologically to take a lot more risk. If we go to zero on the bank account, I can get more money. Great. I don't have to think about it. But what's also really helpful is I'm not, and the rest of the team is not staring at a gigantic number in the bank account being like, cool, we can burn this. Let's burn it. And also for our investors, I think Reid very much wants us to succeed, but I don't think he cares what size of business this is. I think he's more philosophically aligned with the thing that we're trying to do. And if it becomes a huge business, he's psyched for it. And I think that kind of alignment is what I was looking for. I think there's this core creative spirit to the thing that I want to maintain and I really care about having a big impact.\n\n(01:06:03):\nBut I think there's a lot of ways to have an impact. And one of them is building a $10 billion business. I think another way is really changing how people see the world, see themselves in the world. And I think that's what stories do. And you don't necessarily... Sometimes you do that by building a gigantic company, but you don't necessarily always have to do that. A lot of the stories that we care about most are from people who maybe they weren't rich at all. And so I really like creating this place where we can make a really good business. And I care a lot about that. But also the core of the soul of it is about changing how people see themselves in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):\nI love that you've kind of innovated a new middle ground way of fundraising, not bootstrap and not just regular VC. It's a seed. And I love that this two... If I raised 50 million, it'd be like, okay, I get it. Let's not put 50 million in our bank account, but you do have 2 million. It's too much for us. We don't want to see that in our account.\n\nDan Shipper (01:07:01):\nThat's another thing. And we'll see how this ages. I might be back here in two years crying the blues because we didn't raise enough money or whatever. Who knows? But that's the other thing is I do think we can get so much further with very small amounts of money. Like Cora, I think all in to build Cora, we've spent maybe 300K, Maybe. That's crazy because-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:24):\nAnd that includes salaries?\n\nDan Shipper (01:07:27):\nIncludes salaries. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:27):\nWow.\n\nDan Shipper (01:07:28):\nThis product was not even technically possible even if you had billions of dollars three years ago. Not possible because you can't do email summarizing and automatic responses and all that kind of stuff without GPT. So not only was it totally impossible, but now we can get with two engineers, we can get the amount done that would've taken a team of 20 people. And I think that means that we need less money. And I don't think that VC has really caught up to that yet. And I think there are other companies that are doing... There's a term called seed strapping, so there are other companies that are starting to wake up to this too. And I'm curious about how it changes the VC model. For sure for us, we have a specific incubation model, which is a bit different from a VC model. And I think there's some differentiation in the stuff that we can do with founders, which is kind of cool. But yeah, I'm just trying to figure out a shape that works for me and that's different from other people and we'll see how this goes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:41):\nWe'll revisit in a couple years. Seems like it's going great from the outside. I'm going to ask about a couple other things before we wrap up. One is around this consulting arm that you have. I think it's really interesting because like I said, I feel like this could be a billion-dollar business. I feel like every company right now is trying to figure out what the hell's everyone else figured out that we're not doing. I've had so many emails from chief product officers at companies being like, can you introduce me to some chief product officers that have done cool things with AI that we should learn from? So many people and I would just introduce them to each other and it's cool because you guys are basically solving that problem for a lot of companies.\n\n(01:09:18):\nSo one is just maybe share a bit about what that side of the business for folks. And then two, I feel like I imagine you've seen companies that have done this really well, have adopted AI, things have worked really well, they found really good productivity gains, and then you found companies that don't. What do you find is the difference between those two?\n\nDan Shipper (01:09:35):\nI love this question and I have a very specific opinion about this. So one, yeah, the consulting arm, basically we spend all of our time playing around with new models, writing about them and building stuff with them. And we have a big audience. So naturally we've gotten companies over time being like, can you just come and teach us how to do this? And so we started to do that. This is pretty nascent. It's probably been over the last six to nine months, but it's a pretty big business now. It'll probably double this year. Last year we did about a million. Maybe it'll be more this year. We'll see. It depends on a couple... We have a couple of big contracts out, so it might be way more than that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:13):\nA billion. I predict a billion dollars in a few years.\n\nDan Shipper (01:10:17):\nBut yeah, basically people are like, can you come help us learn how to do this? So what we do is we spend some time going and researching your organization. So we go in and try to understand what are all the different teams doing, what are the repetitive tasks, some of the stuff we were talking about earlier. And then what we will do is first we present a little report, tells you here's everything that we found. Here's not only that, but you have a chatbot where you can chat with all the interviews that we did and you can pull out your own insights. We have a whole dashboard where it shows you, here are the teams that are really into this, here are the teams that are not. Here's how much leverage you might be able to get on different teams based on the interviews and based on the AI analysis.\n\n(01:10:57):\nIt's pretty cool. And that's an app that I coded over a weekend with Devin a year ago. And then Alex runs part of the consulting has helped upgrade it. Then what we do is we have a training curriculum. So we go in and train each team and we customize it based on the interviews that we do. Because one of the interesting things about AI is it's such a general purpose technology, and I think people who work inside companies, 10% of them are like, I'm super curious about this. 10% are like, I will never touch this. And 80% are like, if you tell me how to do it for my job, I'll do it.\n\n(01:11:31):\nAnd so we customize the training to be like, here are the exact prompts you're going to use and here's the exact situations you're going to use them. And that really, I think helps drive the adoption. We spend four weeks with each team, an hour a week, that kind of thing. It seems to be really cool. And then we'll often also after this, go and build automations and do some of the AI operations stuff we were talking about earlier. Companies really like it. I think we work with a lot of big hedge funds and PE firms and big companies, all that kind of stuff. To your-\n\nDan Shipper (01:12:00):\nCompanies, all that kind of stuff. To your second question, which is, \"What separates the good companies from the bad, or the companies that end up adopting this?,\" I think the number one predictor is, \"Does the CEO use ChatGPT?,\" or insert your own chatbot. If the CEO is in it all the time, being like, \"This is the coolest thing,\" everybody else is going to start doing it. If the CEO is like, \"I don't know, this is for someone else,\" no one else is going to be able to lead that charge, and they're either going to have ... Either they're going to be negative on it, and so definitely no one's going to do it, or they're going to have way unrealistic expectations because they have no intuition for what's possible, and they're just going to get really disappointed.\n\n(01:12:47):\nBut the CEOs that are using it all the time are able to both drive the excitement and set reasonable expectations for what can be achieved, and so those things end up working really well, and the people that do this really well ... So, for example, we work with a hedge fund called Walleye, which I had the founder on my podcast, AI and I, a few weeks ago, their gigantic $10 billion hedge fund. One of the things that they do, which I think they're basically the model for how to do this, first thing you did, which a lot of CEOs are doing is send the, \"We're an AI-first company\" email. Everyone's got the memo.\n\n(01:13:20):\nYou just got to really do it, and one of the things he said in his memo, which I love, is, \"I wrote this email with ChatGPT, and you should too.\" So you got to like ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):\nIn the memo.\n\nDan Shipper (01:13:30):\nYeah. You got to lead from the front in that way. And then, what he does in, I think what a lot of other really cool companies do is they're doing weekly meetings where people share prompts and share use cases. They do a weekly email to their entire company, being like, \"Okay, here are our usage stats for ChatGPT. Here are the people that came up with a new prompt and contributed to it.\"\n\n(01:14:00):\nCreate this sort of awareness and momentum, because going back to the point I made earlier, about 10% of people are early adopters, those are the people inside of a company that you need to find and highlight because they're going to just go spend all this time figuring out what works, and then all you have to do is translate what they learn into the rest of the organization. And so if you create forums for them to be rewarded, you're going to automatically transfer a lot of their learnings to everybody else, and encourage more of it, and I think that's kind of the secret.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:32):\nThat is awesome. I love this advice. So just to reflect back, what you just shared, a few kind of tactics you find that you encourage within companies, one is just send this memo, the Toby memo. I don't know if that's the right way to describe it, who I think it was first along these lines just, \"We're AI-first.\" It's going to be part of your performance review.\n\n(01:14:50):\nIt's going to be asking, \"Can you do it in AI before you could talk to anyone else?,\" all these things, and then just note, \"I wrote this using ChatGPT's,\" it's a great idea. This idea of a weekly meeting, so it's like a live or Zoom meeting, where people share, \"Here's the thing I've learned about using AI,\" and then this weekly stats email of, \"Here's how much we're using ChatGPT across the org. Here's some people that did some awesome work.\"\n\nDan Shipper (01:15:12):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:13):\nAmazing. And I especially love this very simple heuristic of, \"If you're a CEO, uses ChatGPT or Claude, or whatever daily, it's going to work out.\"\n\nDan Shipper (01:15:22):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:23):\nThat is super cool. I know it's early, but what kind of impact have you seen from a company, kind of leaning into this and adopting AI widely? Anything you've seen either anecdotally or numbers-wise?\n\nDan Shipper (01:15:34):\nIt's early. It's really hard to say other than ... I think generally, people who do this well now feel like they can do way more work than they used to without having to hire more people, and so they're just going further faster at the same budget. I don't see a lot of people being like, \"Cool. We're going to fire a bunch of people.\"\n\n(01:15:58):\nAlso, I don't really want to do consulting work like that. That sucks. But we've never had to say no. Mostly, people are like, \"Cool. I'm just going to go further with the people that I have.\"\n\n(01:16:08):\nI think also, back to kind of the first point I made about reshoring American jobs, I have seen some companies, not the ones that we worked with, but I have seen some companies of people that I'm friends with, where they're like, \"We have a call center somewhere, but I think I can get the same amount done with two employees in the U.S. that use one of these customer service platforms.\" They're still not totally automatic. I think that Klarna CEO thing, that was bullshit. But, yeah, you can have a couple people in the U.S. that maybe you pay a little bit less to than you would for 100 people somewhere else, and obviously, that's the calculus that everyone has to make for themselves, but I've definitely seen that happen, and yeah, I think that's the get more done with the same amount of people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:03):\nMaybe to close out our conversation, I want to come back to this idea that you referenced, but I want to spend a little more time on this, which is this idea of the allocation economy. If I understand it correctly, we've been in this knowledge economy, where people get paid to do a thing, and your thesis is that we're moving to this allocation economy, where the manager skills become more important, and we're going to be spending more of our time managing. And I think what's amazing about this is it also tells you which skills will matter more in the future, which is something I think a lot of people are thinking about. So maybe just answer that question and share whatever you think is important to share to give people a sense of what you're thinking.\n\nDan Shipper (01:17:38):\nYeah. So this is based on our article I wrote two, two and a half years ago. So this is back before agents were even thought of as viable. And I was really trying to think about, \"How do I express what ... In my experience, using this every day, what skills are useful for me?,\" because I think that'll be the case for a lot of other people, and I think that's kind of the best method, I think, to do these sorts of predictions, is you have to be doing it all the time yourself, and then that informs your opinion about this stuff.\n\n(01:18:14):\nSo what I noticed using, at the time, like GPT-3 or maybe GPT-4, was that I was spending a lot of time, for example, thinking about, \"How do I communicate the problem? How do I gather the right information for the problem? How do I put it in the right way so that the model that I'm working with gets it? How do I pick which model to give it to you, and how do I maybe divide up the task to be like, 'Okay, this model does this, this model does this,' based on what I know to be like, 'What's good and what's bad?'? How do I give them feedback?\"\n\n(01:18:50):\n\"How do I have a vision for what I want and a set of criteria for whether it's good?\" All that stuff is exactly how I found myself using these tools, and I was like, \"Oh, that's just managing.\" And once that clicks for you, I think you'll start to see a lot of other things. So a really good example is there's a big complaint that it's like, \"Well, how can I have AI do this? I can't trust that they're going to do it well, so I just do it myself.\"\n\n(01:19:22):\nAnd I'm just like, \"Yeah, that's exactly what Every first-time manager says.\" You always have this problem, where you're like, \"Okay. Well, if I delegate it, it's not done in the way that I want it to be done. If I do it myself, I get no leverage.\" And so that's how a manager has to learn how to be a manager is like, \"When do I lean in and maybe micromanage a little bit, and when can I delegate, and how can I trust it, and how do I divide up the task and all that kind of stuff?\"\n\n(01:19:45):\nAnd so I think there's a lot of overlap in those skills. And those skills are not broadly distributed right now, but they will be in the future because it will be so much cheaper to be a manager.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:57):\nAnd specifically, I was looking at the article you wrote, the skills that you highlight will be more valuable is evaluating talent, vision, taste, and to your point, when to get into the details, when it makes sense to dive in.\n\nDan Shipper (01:20:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:12):\nAwesome. And then, there's also kind of a connected point you made that you referenced, which is that generalists will become more and more valuable in the future. You mentioned that everyone at Every is a generalist.\n\nDan Shipper (01:20:20):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:21):\nShare a little bit about that.\n\nDan Shipper (01:20:22):\nYeah. I find ... I mean, maybe it's because I'm a generalist, so you should take this with a grain of salt.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:27):\nSame, same.\n\nDan Shipper (01:20:28):\nBut I think that's one of the things that has made AI so awesome for me, is I love to dabble in different things. So it's like in one day, I can be coding an app, and making a video, and making images, and writing, and all that kind of stuff, and ChatGPT is right there with me. And I think basically what has happened, as civilization has progressed from Ancient Greece to now, is what we've discovered is the more that we specialize, the better we can coordinate across many different people. And so it's like the Adam Smith, like there's a pin factory and someone's making a pin or whatever his thing is, is specialization against our trade. And there have been a lot of really good impacts of that.\n\n(01:21:18):\nOne of my favorite examples of this is back to Ancient Greece, Ancient Athens. Athens was a civilization of generalists, at least for citizens. They have a bad history with women and people who are slaves, but let's just put that to the side for a second. If you're a citizen, generalist. You could be expected to be a fighter, a judge, a juror, maybe a general.\n\n(01:21:46):\nYou could expect it to have many different roles inside of your society in your lifetime. That changed though, because Athens became an empire. And as it became an empire, if you're going to send a general off to go and invade Sicily or whatever, you want that person to be pretty skilled. And so it started to break the general kind of thing into people start to have specific roles, and they coordinate with each other and all that kind of stuff, and I think that pattern has actually been really good for developing civilization, but it's also, in a lot of ways, it is not as fun. It's actually really cool to be a well-rounded person. And I think the interesting thing about AI is that it's a little bit like, you can think of it like having 10,000 PhDs in your pocket.\n\n(01:22:36):\nIt knows so much about every little branch of human knowledge and every art form and every way of making things or building things, and you just have access to that, so it's doing a lot of the ... It's good for doing a lot of the specialized tasks that you might've had to spend 10 years getting good at learning about this particular species of cicada, so you know exactly how they reproduce. But now, you've got this thing in your pocket that can tell you all about that in any given context at any given time, and so you're empowered to jump a lot more between all those different domains of skill, and you can get more done as, for example, like a founder, where I think we can stay at 15 people much longer than we would be able to. So the people inside of Every can stay generalists for much longer, and I think that that may sort of ripple out into the rest of the economy, where instead of gigantic, massive corporations, where each person is doing one little button turning, you have many more smaller organizations with more generalists, and I think that would actually be a really good thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:44):\nThis reminds me, I was talking to my personal trainer that I'm trying out for a little bit, and she said that she's a very big vision, kind of high-level person, and not good at executing, like we're staying organized, and ChatGPT is such a godsend for her, because she's just like, \"Here's what I want to do roughly. Just help me get it done.\"\n\nDan Shipper (01:24:01):\nThat's great. I love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:03):\nAnd so, yeah. And it really made me think about just how much value all this stuff is going to unlock. This was amazing. It was everything I wanted it to be. But with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Dan, are you ready?\n\nDan Shipper (01:24:14):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:15):\nHere we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nDan Shipper (01:24:21):\nWell, I already recommended one, which is War and Peace. Definitely got to read that. If you want a like Tolstoy primer, I would read The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Another good one is A Swim in a Pond in the Rain, which is by George Saunders, and that's a collection of Russian short stories that is also about writing. And in particular, I really like the Russians because a lot of the Russian novelists are dealing with the effects of technology on the traditional Russian way of life, and they're very kind of in this really interesting middle ground between a sort of romantic outlook on the world and a more rationalist like, \" We're progressing, we're making progress.\"\n\n(01:25:02):\nAnd that's one of the things you'll find in Anna Karenina, oh, and ... God, what's the guy's ... Levin is out in the fields with the peasants, doing the scythe thing. That's Tolstoy kind of thinking about, \"Oh, what would it be like, instead of being a nobleman who's trying to make farms way more efficient, I was just like with my scythe, that was really happy?\" Anyway, so they're dealing with a lot of similar stuff to, I think AI.\n\n(01:25:27):\nThe Master and His Emissary is another really good one, and that's about basically how the different hemispheres of the brain view reality. It's really, really good, and I think it relates to a lot of AI stuff too. Yeah, I think those are my three or four. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:44):\nExcellent list. I think nobody's mentioned any of these, so that's always a good sign. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nDan Shipper (01:25:53):\nYes. I really love Deadwood. Have you seen it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:58):\nI absolutely love it. I remember when they stopped it for some reason. I think he had to go do something else at HBO. It was so sad.\n\nDan Shipper (01:25:59):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:06):\nIt's amazing, yeah.\n\nDan Shipper (01:26:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:07):\nYeah.\n\nDan Shipper (01:26:07):\nDavid Milch is incredible, national treasure, incredible writer. But what I really love about it, and I only recently watched it, is he talks about Deadwood being about how order forms out of chaos. So it's this like frontier town, people are going to it, and there's no law, there's no rules. And by season three, there's a mayor, and all the industry has come in, and it's like a real proper town, and I just love that. And I think there's a lot of parallels from the Western frontier to technology frontiers, and so I think that show is a really interesting study in that kind of dynamic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:50):\nI love how everything connects to how tech works and how AI came to be. I love this.\n\nDan Shipper (01:26:57):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:58):\nDo you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nDan Shipper (01:27:00):\nI don't have a good answer for that because I just spent a lot of time using our internal products, but my stock answer is Granola. So I do really love Granola. My one gripe with them, and I hope they listen to this podcast, is I really want to export all my notes. I want an API, but other than that, I think it's a fantastic product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:18):\nThat is definitely the most mentioned product in this segment for the past couple months, so good job, Granola. I can't help but mention, you get a year free of Granola if you become an annual subscriber of my newsletter. Well, what a freaking deal. And not just you, but your whole company gets free Granola for a year. What a deal.\n\nDan Shipper (01:27:34):\nThis is not a paid promotion by me. That's just how I feel. So I'm glad it's part of the bundle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:41):\nYeah, incredible. Okay. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?\n\nDan Shipper (01:27:47):\nSo basically, I use ChatGPT all the time, and it has memory. So I was like, \"I'm going on Lenny's podcast. What would my life motto be?,\" and it said, \"Your life motto is witness deeply, build bravely. You prize slow, attentive seeing, whether it's reading Tolstoy, tracking meditation themes, or X-raying a David Milch paragraph.\" So it's hitting all the stuff I just mentioned, which is really funny.\n\n(01:28:10):\nAnd then, Build bravely, you turn those insights into concrete things, like Every in Quora and longform essays and all that kind of stuff. So I think there's something about that. Actually, this reminds me, this actually reminds me of the actual motto, which is ... And I didn't come up with this. I think it's like Pliny the Younger said, \"Do things worth writing about, and write things worth reading.\" Seems like a pretty good summation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:31):\nDo things worth writing about and read things worth reading.\n\nDan Shipper (01:28:34):\nWrite things worth reading.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:36):\nWrite things worth reading. That should be the motto of both of our newsletters.\n\nDan Shipper (01:28:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:41):\nThat is really good. Okay. And by the way, I love that you asked ChatGPT, \"What's my life motto?\"\n\nDan Shipper (01:28:48):\nAnd wait, this is interesting. So it didn't give me the answer, but inspired the answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:51):\nYeah.\n\nDan Shipper (01:28:52):\nAnd I think that's actually exactly how I use it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:55):\n[inaudible 01:28:55] Wow. It's an extension of our brains already.\n\nDan Shipper (01:28:57):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:57):\nLast question. I was reading somewhere, where you wrote that you stopped writing at one point. You were just like, \"I need to do other things, I need to build this company,\" and then you realize, \"I need to get back to writing,\" because things started going sideways. And I feel like this is such an interesting corollary to a lot of the stuff you talked about, of just things that make you happy, stay close to enjoy. Just share what happened there, because I didn't know that.\n\nDan Shipper (01:29:23):\nThis is definitely not a lightning round thing, so I'll expound, but I'll try to do it as quickly as possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:29):\nPerfect.\n\nDan Shipper (01:29:30):\nI think generally, when you're building a company, even if you do it the way that I do it or did it, which is you don't raise a lot of money and you try to stay in control, there's a big temptation to try to run the company in the way you think you should. And I have this weird thing where I'm like, \"I really love writing, but I also really love business,\" and there were not a lot of models for me of people who had successful businesses that were also writers. It turns out there are, but I didn't know about that for a while. And so early on at Every, it was growing really well, because I was writing a lot, and Nathan was writing a lot. And when I stopped writing, the business didn't work as well because media businesses don't follow the same pattern as tech startups, because if you're a media business and you are a founder who then hires people to make the product, which is right, if you have product market fit before, you lose it, and maybe you hire people that are good writers, but that's hard. It's total opposite pattern for startups. So you build the first version of the product, and then you hire people to build the rest of it, and so that's what I did. And I also really struggled with, \"Okay, what are the implications for that and for my career,\" and I think it was hard for me to admit, like I actually want to write because I just didn't have any examples of someone being the kind of writer that I wanted to be. And what's really interesting is three years into the business ... The business has been pretty flat.\n\n(01:30:57):\nI was pretty miserable because I was not doing the thing that I really wanted to do, and I asked ChatGPT, I was like, \"Are there any examples of writers that have built businesses?\" And it was like, \"Yeah, Joel Spolsky, who built Trello and Stack Overflow. There's Jason Fried who I've known for a long time, and I've always looked up to, but I forgot about in this context. There is Sam Harris who's got a great podcast, and he's got a gigantic meditation app. There is Bill Simmons, who's incredible podcaster and also built The Ringer, sold to Spotify for a couple hundred million bucks.\n\n(01:31:32):\nThere's a lot of these people, and there are patterns that they use to build companies that are pretty well-understood. They're just not typical Silicon Valley patterns. And so I was like, \"Cool. I just want to be a writer. I think it'll be really fun.\"\n\n(01:31:48):\nAnd so I sort of flipped. I still have the builder, entrepreneur, founder part of my identity, but I sort of flipped it to be like writing is at the center, and I'm unapologetic about it, and that's actually good for the business. It's good for me and it's good for the business. And the more I've leaned into that, doing the thing that ... If you told anyone that you're starting a business, where it's like, \"Well, we're going to be a newsletter, and we're going to incubate all these apps, and we're going to do consulting and whatever,\" they would be like, \"You're nuts.\"\n\n(01:32:14):\n\"Everyone wants to do that. Of course, Every founder wants to do that, but you have to focus. You can't write, whatever.\" But every time I've kind of just leaned into something that feels like the most, the ultimate luxury of my hidden secret desire, it's actually worked a lot better, and I think you end up ... What it really is, is there's a huge tax to doing something every day that you don't quite like that much, or you're not quite a fit for, and by sort of giving into those secret desires, you end up finding a shape for the work that you do and the business that you build that is good for you, and that's always going to be a somewhat unique shape from other businesses that have been built.\n\n(01:32:54):\nIt's always going to rhyme with other things, but I think finding that unique shape, instead of just kind of cargo culting, like what you think a company should look like is definitely a much better way to be successful, and it's also a much better way to live.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:08):\nI think this is going to hit hard with a lot of people who are listening, who are maybe founders or want to be founders, and this resonates with a lot of people that have been on this podcast sharing similar lessons. Dan, this was incredible. Two final questions. Where can folks check out Every, find you online, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nDan Shipper (01:33:24):\nSo you can find us at every.to. I'm also on Twitter at @danshipper. You can go there to check out our products, our newsletter, if you want to stay on top of AI, all that kind of stuff. I also have a podcast. It's called AI and I.\n\n(01:33:41):\nYou can find it on YouTube and on Spotify. And how can people be useful? Honestly, I think that the most useful thing for someone like me, based on what I want to do, is I want people to find interesting, cool ways to use AI that actually helps make their lives better. So just go do that, and tell me about it, and I think that'll be great, and so-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:01):\nWhat's the best way to tell you? Is it comments on your YouTube show? Is it emailing you, DM you?\n\nDan Shipper (01:34:05):\nI would say tweet me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:08):\nYeah.\n\nDan Shipper (01:34:09):\nIf you subscribe to Every, you can also reply to those emails, and they eventually get forwarded to me. So tweet me. Reply to Every. And if you want to comment on YouTube, great. I'm not in the YouTube comments as much as I should be, though.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:22):\nDon't do that. Maybe don't do that.\n\nDan Shipper (01:34:23):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:25):\nOkay. Well, Dan, this was incredible. Thank you so much for sharing. Thanks for being here.\n\nDan Shipper (01:34:29):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:30):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

Design will change, messaging will change, products will change, but that name is there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:09):\nWhat's a name that you came up with that you had to fight super hard for, that the client just hated?\n\nDavid Placek (00:00:14):\nWhen we presented Sonos, it was rejected because it's not entertainment-like. We argued about that because I said, \"This is outside looking in, but I don't see you as an entertainment company.\" Humans do like to be comfortable. Part of our job here is to help people to give the confidence going bigger and being uncomfortable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):\nThere's a quote that I found of yours, \"If your team is comfortable with the name, chances are you don't have the name yet.\"\n\nDavid Placek (00:00:37):\nWe look for polarization. We look for tension in a team arguing about these things. Polarization is a sign of strength in the word. Most clients, they come to a naming project absolutely believing with full confidence that they're going to know it when they see it, and the truth is it almost never happens.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):\nMost people listening to this are founders, a lot of PMs on product teams. Let's say they have a couple of weeks, got to come up with a name. What should they do?\n\n(00:01:05):\nToday, my guest is David Placek. David is the founder of Lexicon Branding, which pioneered the field of brand naming, and invented a few names that you may have heard of including Powerbook, Pentium, Blackberry, Swiffer, the Impossible Burger. Also, Vercel, Windsurf, CapCut, and Azure. In our conversation, David opens up about the very specific process that he and his team go through to find winning names, including a simple exercise that you can do with you and your team to help you find the right name in just a few weeks. We also talk about why a great name is worth spending your time on, why you won't know a great name when you see it, and why you need to feel uncomfortable about the name first. Also, why big team brainstorms don't ever lead to great names. The stories behind names like Pentium, and Sonos, and Vercel, and Windsurf. Also, such interesting insights about the feeling and energy of every letter of the alphabet and so much more.\n\n(00:01:56):\nThis episode is designed for anyone trying to figure out a name for their product or company, and also just for anyone that's interested in hearing the stories of how some of the most iconic names came to be.

If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grain authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.\n\n(00:03:45):\nLast year, 1.3% of the global GDP flowed through Stripe. That's over $1.4 trillion. And driving that huge number are the millions of businesses growing more rapidly with Stripe. For industry leaders like Forbes, Atlassian, OpenAI, and Toyota, Stripe isn't just financial software. It's a powerful partner that simplifies how they move money, making it as seamless and borderless as the internet itself. For example, Hertz boosted its online payment authorization rates by 4% after migrating to Stripe. And imagine seeing a 23% lift in revenue like Forbes did just six months after switching to Stripe for subscription management. Stripe has been leveraging AI for the last decade to make its product better at growing revenue for all businesses, from smarter checkouts to fraud prevention and beyond. Join the ranks of over half of the Fortune 100 companies that trust Stripe to drive change.

I'm excited about today and looking forward to the conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):\nMe, too. These are actually my favorite kinds of conversations because this topic is so outside of my wheelhouse, and I know I'm just going to learn a ton. Also, this is just something that every founder and product builder has to think about at some point, and they have no idea what they're doing. And then, their name becomes so core to their identity. It's hardly the word they say more than any other word. And I feel like I've never heard advice on how to do this well. So, I'm really excited for this conversation.\n\n(00:05:25):\nI'm going to just dive into a question. And the question is just what's a name that you came up with, and your team came up with, that you had to fight super hard for that the client just hated, and you ended up winning. And now, it's just such an obviously awesome name that everyone loves.\n\nDavid Placek (00:05:40):\nThe story I like to tell is a story of Sonos. One, a great client team. I worked with all the founders. But at the time, they were stuck on being in a brand name that put them in the entertainment business. And so when we presented Sonos, which has many qualities to it, it was rejected because it doesn't have enough emotion to it. It's not entertainment-like. And we argued about that because I said, \"This is outside looking in, but I don't see you as an entertainment company. You make speakers that allow for the flow of entertainment through these things. And Sonos is about sound.\" But it had a particular quality. It's called a palindrome, which really means that you can flip it and it means the same thing. In the case of Sonos, you could also turn it upside down and it was essentially the same.\n\n(00:06:47):\nAnd so that got them thinking about this, but they were still has... So I left that meeting in Santa Barbara, and I came back and they were still struggling with it. And I got on a plane, didn't even bill them for this, went back down to Santa Barbara and met with them again and said, \"I really believe in this name and I think it's the right for you.\" And at a certain point, one of the founders, Bob MacFarlane, who's just a wonderful client. I could see him thinking, and he said, \"You know? We're trying to name this for ourselves, and what we really should be doing is naming it for the marketplace and the customers. And I think Sonos now is the right name. And I felt really good about that.\" He later wrote me a note about how I help to do that, and we use it sometimes in credentials presentations because it's such a nice note.\n\n(00:07:45):\nBut Sonos is something I'm so glad that I had this internal energy to, \"I got to go down there and make a bid for this.\" I don't do that often, by the way, but I felt very strongly about Sonos.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:58):\nI love Sonos. I love the name. I have many Sonos products. How often does this happen where the client is just, \"No, this is not the name. We have this bigger vision, we have a whole other idea of it.\" And then you convince them.\n\nDavid Placek (00:08:07):\nWell, it happens all of the time. And it's a little bit bidirectional, right? Most clients, and I can understand this, they come to a naming project absolutely believing, with full confidence, that they're going to know it when they see it. And the truth is, it almost never happens. I think this year we'll hit 4,000 projects that we've completed.\n\n(00:08:37):\nAnd it's interesting, we'll tell people in a very polite way, \"You're not going to know when you see it.\" But I know they don't believe me. And even when... You could see them thinking that, \"You know what? He was right. I really have to think about this. I have to process it.\" And part of that, part of why clients don't like the bolder names, the more imaginative names that we present is they are looking for comfort. And that's the opposite that what you want to do. And part of our job here is to help people to give the confidence that going bolder, and bigger, and being uncomfortable. I use the expression, \"There is no power in comfort, not in the marketplace.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:27):\nWow. There's so much here already. So this idea of you're not going to know it when you see it is something that people come in with thinking like, \"Once I see it, it'll be obvious.\" Just why is that almost never the case? Is it because the name has to be something that is uncomfortable?\n\nDavid Placek (00:09:43):\nThere's a lot of psychology to this, which ironically, I never even took a psychology class in college or graduate school. But the first element is humans do like to be comfortable. And one of the mechanisms of comfort is if something's been successful before, then I feel like I can approve it or select it. This is why movies like Harry Potter or even novels like Jack London's Call of the Wild get rejected so many times. I think Harry Potter was rejected 16 or 18 times, and Jack London's book even more than that. I mean, think about it. He's pitching a book and they say, \"What are you talking about here? You're saying a dog becomes a wolf? I've never heard of anything like that.\" So, we really do have to help people think about, \"It's not about the past. You're actually creating the future.\" And we really talk to people and emphasize the idea, \"This isn't a name you're creating. We're creating an experience for you. We're going to work together.\"\n\n(00:10:54):\nAnd our conversations always start with, \"Talk to us about how you behave now and how you want to behave in the future,\" as opposed to, \"Tell me about your positioning, tell me about your values, tell me about your mission.\" That's really kind of old thinking. It's very traditional, and that did work 25 or 30 years ago. But this is a far more complex, interconnected world, a digital world now that stuff just doesn't create... It doesn't create names like Sonos or some of our other credentials that we probably will talk about today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:34):\nYeah, we're going to talk about just the process you guys go through, so stay tuned for that. But before we get to that, is there's another story you can share that shows this idea of being bold?\n\nDavid Placek (00:11:44):\nI'll talk about Microsoft's Azure. So when Microsoft came to us, they were pretty much stuck. And Microsoft does... And in many ways, to their credit, a lot of things don't need to be named. They don't need trademarks. They don't need brand names. They need descriptors. And so they came to us to develop a name that started or ended with cloud. Made sense to them because it was a cloud service. And our reaction was, \"If you do that, you're going to be in an ocean of other cloud this, cloud that. And you have an opportunity as Microsoft here to really emerge as a leader in this.\" And so, there was a discussion about, \"Okay, we'll take a look at those, but we'd like to see some cloud names.\" Which is easy to do, by the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:44):\nClassic.\n\nDavid Placek (00:12:42):\nSo, we did that. And along the way, we came up with this word azure, which is another word for blue. And so there was a link to clouds, blue sky clouds, things like that, but we really presented it based on its linguistic qualities. It's a noisy word, that Z in there. It starts with an A, and it ends in a nice smooth flow. So, we really strive to do create names that are balanced. And in a very busy competitive world, having a strong signal, which is generated by noise is a good thing.\n\n(00:13:27):\nThe reaction wasn't good. One of the clients said, \"That's just a dumb idea.\" Remarks like that. At this point, after these four decades, it just rolls off my back like water off a duck is what my grandmother would say. But I think along the way, as we talked about it, they began to warm up to this. And now of course it's, I don't know, a $100 billion brand or something like that. But that's an example of, \"I haven't seen that before. I'm very comfortable with cloud. Cloud is what it is. We're describing it.\" But that's a statement. And I think that... Well, I don't think I know that's what I said in one of the presentations is, \"You don't want to make a statement here. You want to start a story.\" And Azure is going to behave differently in the marketplace than Cloud Pro, which is I think one of the names that we presented to them on the other site at their request.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:34):\nI'm glad they went with Azure. Let me actually ask this question. I know you're biased, but just how important is a great name? If you had a better name than a product that was better than you, does that make a big difference? Just anything you can share there to help people see this is the power of a great name.\n\nDavid Placek (00:14:49):\nLet's look just at the reality of this. Your brand name, whether it's a product name or a company name, nothing's going to be used more often or for longer than that name. Design will change, messaging will change, products will change, but that name is there. So, I like to talk about this idea of cumulative advantage. Over time, as people buy more and more of the product, they see it more often, that their bond between you and that brand, or them and the brand I should say, becomes stronger and stronger. So you want that name to stick in their mind to be distinctive, because distinctiveness is what creates that cumulative advantage.\n\n(00:15:35):\nThe second thing is this notion of what I call asymmetric advantage. It makes perfect sense, and most clients agree with this when we say this is that even before you launch this brand, why not start with an advantage in the marketplace? And you won't get an advantage if you're descriptive. If you are Cloud Pro and there's 10 other cloud services, you're not going to stand out in the marketplace. You won't have the ability to create necessarily that cumulative advantage in the marketplace.\n\n(00:16:09):\nSo, those are my two reasons why names are, I think, done right. And we do talk about our mission is not creating good names. A lot of people can do that. Our mission is to create the right name for clients, because the right name does deliver asymmetric advantage and cumulative advantage for you. And that, for us, has almost unlimited value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:41):\nThis is a great answer. Essentially what you're saying is it's not going to necessarily make or break you, but it gives you an advantage. A great name gives you an advantage, especially if you're just getting started. You need every advantage you can get.\n\nDavid Placek (00:16:54):\nExactly. And this is maybe a little bit off a tangent, but one of the best books on marketing I've ever read, which is not a book on marketing, and you may have read it along the way in college if you studied any Greek or classics. It's called the Melian Dialogues. And it's a dialogue... It'll take anybody listening to this maybe 25 minutes to read it. Between the Athenians and the government of Melos, the Athenians had decided that they needed that island. And they went and approached them very nice way, that, \"We want to take over the island. Nothing will change. You'll be taxed a little bit, but we'll protect you.\" And the Athenians had thought every aspect about how to take that island before. So by the time they got there, they had created asymmetric advantage in terms of ships, and men, and all of this other stuff.\n\n(00:17:57):\nBy the way, in the book, there's no mention of marketing or brand strategy or any of these things, but if you read it, you begin to see that it's marketing, really, is about a symmetric advantage. And so, why not start from the very beginning with an advantage? That's the value of a name.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:12):\nLet's dive into the actual process you guys go through, and I want to read a quote that Guillermo Rauch shared when I asked him about what it was like working with you. He's the CEO and co-founder of Vercel, which you guys worked with. I definitely want to hear that story, by the way. So he said, \"Before David, the ability to name something was like charisma. You either have it or you don't. It was so surreal to watch his team distill it down to a science.\"\n\n(00:18:35):\nSo let me just ask you, what does that science look like? What are the steps to coming up with an amazing name for your product or company that you guys go through?\n\nDavid Placek (00:18:42):\nThat's very nice of Guillermo. He is a very impressive innovator in this category and we greatly enjoyed working with him. Well, our process is real. I break it down in three steps. First, we have to identify, then we invent, and then we implement. It's just three things. It's not rocket science, but it's a combination of creativity and discipline. And obviously, talented people and experience in these things. So, let's just go through those things. In the first section of identify, it's really trying to find out from the client, let's talk about behavior. So, how are you behaving now and how do you want to behave in the future? That behavior is bidirectional. In other words, the marketplace behaves towards a Vercel, that's the name we created for Guillermo. And they behave towards the marketplace. And that's an important point because everything... Buildings are bidirectional. Look at a building, you behave differently towards a temple than you or a church versus a Holiday Inn in terms of how that architecture states. So, we focus on that. Behavior is closely aligned for us with experience. How do you want the experience of this brand?\n\n(00:20:11):\nNow, when we listen to those things, we begin to think about rhythm of the name. So something like Dasani has a lot of rhythm to it, right? It's kind of calming. And so, we'll begin to extract things from that discussion on experience. We will then, also, as part of this first phase, look at the competition. We call that developing a landscape. And we're looking for what are the words... What are the brand names, first, and then what language are they using in this space? Because we have to be distinctive. If a brand name isn't distinctive, you lose. Then, you're imitating. And that's a form of suicide. That's a famous quote from some... I think the president of P&G 50 years ago or something like that. So, that's that first phase which allows us to create what we call a creative framework. And we don't even use the word objectives here because that gets too logical.\n\n(00:21:16):\nActually, framework for us is a metaphor for a window for us, and our teams, and our linguists to travel through. To open things up so that we're not coming back with a narrow list of names. We're coming back with names that have depth, and breadth, and have different experiences and personalities to them. And clients will sign off on that. And then, we get going. So now, we're moved to the invent stage.\n\n(00:21:44):\nAnd in the invent stage, we do really two things. You can look at this as two layers of our process. I think the second layer is probably what makes us quite unique in the marketplace. It's the result of millions of dollars of R&D on our part. So the first thing is, no surprise to anyone, we work with creative individuals. And we don't use... This will be contrary. We don't use large brainstorming sections. I did. When I first started the company, I used freelancers, I used large brainstorming groups. And along the way through some analysis, we really discovered that that was not really working for us. That actually, the names were coming from employees and from small groups. And so we've moved our process to, at least, two or three small teams of two people.\n\n(00:22:41):\nAnd each of those teams... So let's say on significant projects, we always use three teams. And each team gets a different briefing. One team knows everything about the project but the other teams don't. If we're working for Microsoft, the second team thinks they're working for Apple. I mean, they know it's disguised. We're not keeping this from anyone. And then the third team, we take it out of computers, and they might be naming a bicycle or a car or something like that. What we're trying to do is open up the coffers of creativity for this. And so when people are working on what they know is not the real assignment, they are now free to make all kinds of mistakes. And so, most of our names have come out of the second or third team because they're-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:29):\nWow.\n\nDavid Placek (00:23:29):\nYeah. I think the process, at some point, I will hopefully write either a good article on this or maybe even a book. But this process would work for, I think, a lot of things. I know it would. All right now, what's that second layer that I talked about? Well, we have made significant investments in this area of linguistics and cognitive science, and it's in two ways. One, building proprietary knowledge. So we know through research that we funded, an extensive amount about an area in language called or linguistics called the sound symbolism. So, what are the sounds of the 26 letters of the alphabet and what do they do? How do they evoke things? Well, it turns out that each of those letters sends out a signal that creates a certain sort of vibration, if you will, or experience.\n\n(00:24:31):\nNow, there's been research on that over the years but there were some gaps, and we decided to fill this. And over the years, we've had a very good relationship with Stanford University, with their Department of Linguistics. We've hired linguists from MIT, from Berkeley. We have a linguistic internship here. I actually just ran this number, preparing for this discussion. We have employed, over four decades now, 253 linguists. Most of them PhDs, some of them contracts, some of them actual employees. That's a lot of intellectual knowledge. So we really have, what I call, a linguistic engine here. And then we now have an operating network of... I just checked on this figure yesterday. We have 108 linguists in 76 countries that help us. Some of them do creative work, others will do just the analysis of names for us. So now, we have that creative framework, we have creative teams working on this.\n\n(00:25:39):\nNow, we're tapping into databases that have over 18,000 small word units, technically called morphemes. So, we also can tap in from a sound standpoint. What are the sounds of reliability? What are the sounds of aliveness? And so with Sonos, by the way, we wanted things that are somewhat noisy. And so S is a noisy letter, like a Z or even a V. And so, you begin to set priorities about what letters we're going to use. And that work from that, we call it an engineering layer floats up into the creative teams. And so, it's a mixture of things at a certain point in time.\n\n(00:26:27):\nAll right. Now, what happens to all that? At a certain point, usually 3 to 4 weeks into this, we might have 2 or 3,000 ideas. I say ideas because they're not all solutions, they're not all workable. They may be just beginning ideas, concepts. And we sift through those. And now one of the major challenges that we face, and certainly our clients face, is the need to clear a trademark for it to be not in conflict with a marketplace that is... We're almost reaching a tipping point in terms of difficulty of clearing names here. And so we have paralegals here, and we have a trademark attorney, and we'll analyze those names. That gets us to a much smaller set. And then, we'll do our linguistic work with our linguists, and we end up with a set of names to show our clients.\n\n(00:27:22):\nWe'll do this twice with most assignments. Sometimes, we'll do just one time depending on timing and budget. But we really try to get two cycles here, partly because humans love to compare. If you're looking for a house, you don't just look at the first house and say, \"Okay, let's sign us up.\" You look and you learn that we don't need a swimming pool, but we do need a view. It's the same with names. And so, we get feedback from our clients. And sometimes, that's a co-creative process where a client will come up with a word or a solution and we'll then run that through our screening mechanisms for them. And that's really the process. The final phase is implementing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:08):\nLet's actually pause at that because I would, so much, I want to talk about with the second step, but we'll get to the step three. They're just blowing my mind, all the things you guys do here. This is incredible. There's so many things here that are so unlike what I expected.\n\n(00:28:23):\nFirst of all, the creative folks that are actually coming up with these names, what's the background of these people? Who are these people?\n\nDavid Placek (00:28:31):\nSo, the fundamental quality is they're going to be curious and they're going to be hardworking. This is... And hopefully... And this is hard to screen for, but lower egos. This is unlike the advertising business which I came from, so I've six years at a large agency. Where a creative person or a copywriter can think about something and come in with 3 or 4 alternatives in terms of a headline or body copy. And that might be refined a little bit and maybe sent back to the drawing boards altogether, but it's a relatively simple process. And no disrespect intended there.\n\n(00:29:19):\nHere, I can't just sit down and say, \"Okay, we're naming a new car here. And so, I'm going to generate 100 names and you generate 100 names, and something will fall out.\" Those names will not... There's not enough in that list to clear through our screens. Of legal screens, our linguistic screens. And remember, we start with a creative framework and a criteria that the names need to meet. So, we're looking for people who can churn out a lot of work. And when that's rejected, they just keep going. So, we look for tenacious people. Now, we have... And we'll probably get to this later, but we have software here that helps people generate names. Not really... Maybe five years down the road, it'll actually spit out solutions, but now it's helping us to generate ideas and directions and what I... Sound symbolism, ideas, word unit, prefixes, suffixes, things like that. So, it's relatively easy for anyone that works here to develop a list of 2 or 300 names over a 3 or 4-day period.\n\n(00:30:41):\nWhere do we find these people? More who are writers from newspaper reporters because they have to work fast. Their stories get rejected. People who might have written a novel. We have hired people from agencies over the years. They work a little less effectively than others who have a speechwriter from... I wrote speeches in Washington. Those people have to work hard, crank out a lot of material, get rejected. Candidate says, \"I don't like this, start over.\" Those are more resilient people. That's where they come from. It's not easy to find these people. It really isn't.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:25):\nLet me just throw out here. I'm going to ask you after we go through this process, what people that don't have the resources and time to do this, what they should do to come up with a good name. I'm just going to let people know as they're listening because-\n\nDavid Placek (00:31:26):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:36):\n... I imagine many people are wondering, but let's not go there yet.\n\nDavid Placek (00:31:38):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:39):\nHow long does this process usually take? What's the ideal length the company should expect when they want to come up with an amazing name?\n\nDavid Placek (00:31:44):\nFor us, the ideal link is pretty short. It's eight weeks. For larger corporate projects where you have boards and a little more politicking to do, and a few more presentations, it's a three-month churn. And sometimes by the time they approve things and clear, it's a four-months process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):\nOkay, cool. So eight weeks mostly if you're a big company with a lot of red tape. You have to work through then longer.\n\n(00:32:11):\nOkay, this point you made about three different teams with different almost context is so interesting. So say, let's use Windsurf as an example, which is an amazing name, killing it, that you guys helped come up with. So is the idea there, okay, here's we're naming this AI IDE. One of the team has told, \"No, you're building a bicycle. Here's all the same brief, but it's a bicycle. And then another team, you're building a...\" I don't know, lap. I don't know, something non-technical essentially, right?\n\nDavid Placek (00:32:42):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:43):\nLike, a cup. Say more about that because that is amazing because. And you're finding that most of the best names come from the groups that aren't... Let's name an amazing AI IDE.\n\nDavid Placek (00:32:54):\nThis is a good example. So in technology, there are some things that if someone hands you a new phone and you look at it and it's tangible and it's got a shape and color, things like that, easier to name. But the name of Windsurf, before it was Windsurf, was Codium. So, it's all about a type of code or a process for coding. That's intangible. And even though we do an awful lot of technology work, it is still hard for us to really get ahold of what that is. So our rule here is if there's something that is intangible like that, we have to make it tangible. And sometimes we do that not by giving a team, sometimes it's an individual, the assignment to create ideas for the brand itself, but to just dive into a particular context.\n\n(00:33:49):\nAnd in this case with Windsurf, this is about flow about giving people that are coding something much more of a flow process, a smoother process, a more dynamic process. So in that case, One team was just given the task of we want to look at a list of all the things that can communicate either in a real word like flow or metaphorically or in a sport about that kind of dynamics. That kind of movement. And there was Windsurf sitting on a list. I mean, sometimes, this is really just that simple. Of course, you have to have the right framework and you have to give the right directions to someone. And Windsurf, for us and particularly for me, it checks all the boxes. It's a wonderful image, it's an experience. Literally, a physical experience. It's a compound, right? Two words put together. We know from the research we've invested in that compounds like Powerbook or Facebook are multipliers of associations because there's wind and there's circles around that, and then there's surf images around that. So 1 + 1 = 3, right?\n\n(00:35:16):\nIt's interesting that when we present compounds to clients, we often get the comment, \"Well, it's a little bit long and it's a compound. I'd rather have a shorter single word.\" And then that's why we actually did research on just how effective our compounds so we could pass that information along. We passed that along to the team at that time. Codium, by the way, could not have been a more intelligent, nicer, more respectful team that we've worked with. I'm so glad for their success. But we explained to them about the multiplier effect of compounds. We showed them imagery that they could use. I mean, it's simple to execute on something like that. And so, that's how that came about. I'll stop there and see if you need more information or not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:11):\nLet me actually follow this through real quick. It's going to be kind of a tangent. You guys have been working with AI companies more and more recently, which is so interesting. What's different about naming AI products from traditional products, not AI, I guess?\n\nDavid Placek (00:36:25):\nFirst off, we are working mostly with engineers, and engineers who haven't delved into the world of creativity and necessarily marketing. And that's their strength. And what we have to do is we have to balance their strength with our strength. So there's a little bit of a challenge there, but I think we deal pretty well with that. Secondly, this is the fastest moving progressing category I have ever experienced. And I have that perspective, right? I went through the early days of the internet and the World Wide Web, and that was moving pretty fast. But the internet compared to this looks like a daycare school or something like that. We're challenged by just keeping up with developments. Third thing, and this is the creative challenge here, is that engineers come to us wanting more sophisticated names where they are likely to end up with another Codium or an Anduril or an Anthropic.\n\n(00:37:42):\nAnd when we saw this trend of that AI is going to take off, and it was an intuitive feeling on my part. I could have been wrong. I said, \"Let's find out what's going on here.\" So both, not only who's developing the products, but how do people think about AI? And we did a series of research. I probably invested $20,000 or so. And we interviewed consumers in Europe, South Korea, just picked out one country in Asia, and in America, and developers in those three. And they really have different views. Developers are all totally positive on it. They see the future, they see a big future, not too concerned, some are, but most aren't. Consumers are skeptical, worried about it, worried about their jobs, see the hope in it, those types of things, but haven't got the handle on it.\n\n(00:38:41):\nSo Codium is an example where we said, \"We think what you're doing needs to be much more tangible, and something that people can grab onto, and much more natural as opposed to a Codium.\" And they listened to us. Very simple as that. And in this case, we were right. And by the way also, I have to say, there's some luck to this. Windsurf happened to be available and they sought right away, not exactly right away but it took about a week going back and forth to select it. So, let me stop there and see if that answers your question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):\nAbsolutely. And it feels like most AI companies end up having a different name for their product than their company. I've noticed this funny trend cursor was any sphere bold with stack is StackBlitz, Windsurf is Codium. Basically, everyone.\n\n(00:39:37):\nWhen does it make sense to change your name? Windsurf just officially changed their entire company name to Windsurf from Codium. It was just a product. So, let me just ask you that. When does it make sense? It feels like a huge deal and a very challenging thing to do.\n\nDavid Placek (00:39:48):\nIt is challenging. And the larger you are and the more customer base you have, it becomes a significant project. So the first thing is you have to make an argument that it's worth the change. That we're going to be better off by changing our name. So, there's a couple situations where you want to change your name. First one is let's focus first on startups. Startups get going early, they get into Y Combinator or something like that, they're raising money. And they just need a name. And although they know what they're doing, and that may change by 10 or 15 degrees, it's almost like, \"We just got to have a name.\" And that is the absolute expression I hear from when a startup calls and says, \"We want to change your name. We started off a year and a half ago. We just needed a name for the documents, and so we chose X.\" And it's not a very good name. So, that's example number one.\n\n(00:40:53):\nNumber two is the company actually has pivoted. And so, the name that they have no longer really reflects who they are or who they're becoming, and which makes that name ineffective. And the third is that a company has merged and it is time now to create a new start and reflect to the marketplace that we're... We're new now, maybe bigger, but certainly we have more capabilities and we want you to know about it. And because of that, we're changing our to blank, which reflects those capabilities at some level.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:38):\nI'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Luo (00:41:45):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:47):\nSo, what is new with OneSchema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launched a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing, and mapping, and integrating CSV in Excel files.\n\nAndrew Luo (00:42:03):\nYes. So, we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV in Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:29):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema.\n\nAndrew Luo (00:42:37):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:58):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co, That's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:43:12):\nI want to come back to this linguist piece, which I know is really unique to the way you guys operate, and it's so interesting. So you employed, you've said, over 250 linguists over the course of your business career. This linguist step, the way you described it is they're not coming up with names, they're more kind of like a filter for, \"Here's all the names we've come up with. Here's the ones that are good linguistically.\" Is that right? Or is that team also suggesting names?\n\nDavid Placek (00:43:35):\nYeah. Some of the people there, depending on the assignment, will actually help us create names, for sure. And so, we have linguists here. And in the network, we have linguists. And those linguists are contracts to us, not full-time employees. So, there's a little bit of both. But the preponderance of their work in our linguistic network is to evaluate names. Not only just does it mean something negative or positive, but are there cultural implications to it? Political implications? Or even things that a natural disaster that would've happened somewhere that no one here would know about. Even if we had, if.\n\n(00:44:21):\nThis was in Italy, and there was a bridge or a flood that killed a lot of people. Someone that speaks Italian very well here, say at Berkeley University, but has lived here for 20 years, wouldn't know about that. And we don't want anything linguistically that would slow our clients down. And so, that's why we've invested in building this network. We have a woman that runs the network for it. So, it's not an insignificant facet of our business that we have to run and manage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:52):\nIs there a name you love that didn't pass the linguistic filter, that ended up being like, \"Oh, shit. That's a really bad name in this culture\"?\n\nDavid Placek (00:45:00):\nIt happens frequently where we will find something that isn't really terrible but it's worrisome to us. It's interesting cultures like Australian or people in Australia, they have a lot of interesting expressions. And so, we do find things that this sounds like it's a certain kind of shrimp and things like that, and we eliminate those things. And then we find things that have sort of sexual connotations, we eliminate those.\n\n(00:45:39):\nI would say it happens every third or fourth project we'll find something that we will eliminate and never show the client.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):\nAnd something you love and you're like, \"Okay, I guess we can show that one\"?\n\nDavid Placek (00:45:52):\nThat's true. That happens. It does.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:55):\nYou also said this really interesting thing about how every letter of the alphabet has a vibrance in an experience. Can you give a few examples of that? I know you're not the person doing that work specifically, but just what are some letter feelings?\n\nDavid Placek (00:46:11):\nThe work is from the linguist, but at this point, I'm pretty adept in it. So, let's look at... I'll start with the letter V because it is so illustrative of what this is about. V, from our research that we've done, is the most alive and vibrant sound in the English alphabet. And that's whether you were born in Rome or in Sausalito, California. So if you know that, if you know that as you go around the world, there are going to be some exceptions to it. It's going to have that vibrancy. Look at Corvette. They probably didn't know about V, but it's a perfect name for a car that's fast and has a big engine that roars. Think about Viagra, same idea. And there's been surprises to us. B, the sound of the letter B is one of the most reliable sounds in the English alphabet. That was one of our rationales, by the way, for Blackberry. Because that's another example of a client who thought we were... I mean, the founder actually said, \"I thought the people at Lexicon were crazy,\" when they presented Blackberry.\n\n(00:47:29):\nAnd we said, \"Well, let's stop and look at some of the assets here. First off, black color's technology. Yes, not everybody knows the word berry, but we have those two Bs.\" We talked about the nature of a compound. And all of a sudden, people at least lean forward to consider it as opposed to rejecting it too fast. So, those are just two examples. I mentioned Z in Azure, that's noisy letter. X is fast and crisp as a sound. And of course, there's semantic value to all of these letters, too. X is about innovation from aircraft to computers. And so, you have to look at the semantics of it and the sound symbol of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:15):\nThis is so fascinating. I could listen to this stuff all day. Just thinking about Vercel with the V, that very aligns with what they're trying to do. Just very strong, opinionated way of working. And Guillermo, he feels like a V person.\n\nDavid Placek (00:48:29):\nHe is. And there's an example of a group that had a lot of confidence, and what their product is is very innovative. And so, we had permission there to create something new because Vercel is a coin solution., right? But notice that we put some very simple, easy to process things together there. Or ver, in this case. So we have in vino veritas, truth in wine, things like that. You have verde, green. So, very familiar. And then their cel, like accelerate, something which is really what they do. They accelerate a client's performance. So, that was a relatively easy name for us to present and we were excited about for them to grasp.\n\n(00:49:26):\nBy the way, that's known as processing fluency, which is when you think about how the brain processes information. We're told by a number of cognitive science that our brains are a little bit on the lazy side. We don't like complex things. And so, we really strive to make all of our solutions relatively easy for the brain to process. So it wants, it leans in towards them as opposed to, \"I'm too busy. I'm walking past that.\" Names that are complicated, it's a liability. And we really avoid that. But Vercel, perfect fluency.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:13):\nOkay, let's go back, actually, to the three steps. So we covered two, and it took us on a long tangent to dive into a lot of the stuff you shared with the second step, which you call invent. So, it's essentially the three steps are... Was it create? What would you call it? The step?\n\nDavid Placek (00:50:26):\nYeah, it's identify. Invent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:27):\nIdentify.\n\nDavid Placek (00:50:29):\nAnd I use the word invent with intention because it's more than creative. And then the final thing is implement. Now for us, we're not a design firm. We're really focused on brand names and the nomenclature that supports the name. But for us, implement is helping the client team, if they choose, for us to help them with the presentations as it goes up the chain. To help them write a longer rationale for why these names, if they're presenting three names to the president of their company or the CMO, why these names make a lot of sense, and to help them develop what we call prototypes. So we'll put the name on a baseball cap, on a T-shirt. We'll put the name in a mock-up ad in the Wall Street Journal. Something's very positive. Because of Procter & Gamble's new blank product. P&G shares, they gain 10% this year. So that executives can see that the lift that that name can have. That's our implementation phase for them.\n\n(00:51:44):\nAnd we also do consumer research or customer research at that stage, and we do that probably about 50% of the time on our projects where we're going out and we're really talking to their customers, and putting the names in a series of drills. Drills that make them not the marketing person for the day, but we're really making these customers feel that this is a new brand. And then, we're asking about expectations. We're seeing how these names fire their imagination. And that's the most important thing in research, not is the name popular, are they comfortable with it, does it fit to concept. If you're asking people is this fit to concept, you are inevitably always going to get a descriptive name.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:31):\nYou make such a good point about how you need to arm the people working with you with ammo to win over other folks internally. Because if the person working with you is on board and the name is bold and not an obvious winner, I could see it being important to be like, \"Here's what you should all show them to help them see the story, and the mock-ups, and all of that.\"\n\nDavid Placek (00:52:53):\nYes. And what's really important is to help their management see this in the context of the marketplace and their customers. This is a very human thing, but people want their boss to be happy. They want to be okay with their boss. And so they're thinking about, \"I don't know if my boss would like this.\" He's more conservative or she's more conservative. We try in a very diplomatic way to say, \"This has nothing, really, in the end to do with your boss. It has to do with the marketplace.\"\n\n(00:53:27):\nWell, that's easy for me to say because I'm not working at a P&G or an Intel, but we really try to give that advice for it because it is about being successful in the marketplace. And so first of all, we try to separate the clients that we work with. We really want to work with clients that play to win, that want to win, not just want to not lose in a marketplace. And so, we try to encourage our direct clients to lead the process to really say, if a manager or a CMO or a president says, \"Look, we're the team that's going to execute on this and we believe in this. We can make this work,\" they usually rally around it. They usually do. But if you're just taking names up to a manager and saying, \"What do you think?\" There's a different outcome offered.\n\n(00:54:28):\nSo, we like to be in that implementation phase because we have so much experience. And usually, credibility with people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:37):\nAnd you said that you come up with 3 to 4,000 names. That's the top of the funnel?\n\nDavid Placek (00:54:41):\nYeah. And just to clarify that, it's ideas, directions. It's not-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:50):\nComplete ready-to-ship names.\n\nDavid Placek (00:54:51):\nYeah, not ready-to-ship names at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:53):\nGot it.\n\nDavid Placek (00:54:54):\nThis is a very inefficient process and a little chaotic. So in that list of 3,000 names is probably 250 potential diamonds that have to be fractured and examined.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:10):\nI really want to see just a documentary of this process at some point. This is the closer we're going to get for now, but this is so interesting.\n\n(00:55:17):\nI want to ask about how you would approach this if you're just a startup that doesn't have the time or resource to do this. But before I do that, is there anything else around the process that you guys go through with clients that you think is important to share or they think might surprise people?\n\nDavid Placek (00:55:30):\nI think we've covered it. I do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:31):\nOkay, great. Awesome. Okay, so most people listening to this, there's a lot of founders, a lot of PMs on product teams. They're working on a new feature, they're about to launch a product, they got accepted into YC and they're about to launch a product. Then they have, I don't know, let's say they have a couple of weeks. We've got to come up with a name. What should they do?\n\nDavid Placek (00:55:50):\nSo the first thing I do is to say, okay, let's forget about developing the name for right now. And I will have them, and I think this is a good exercise for anybody. We do it here internally when we think about our business. So I say, just... Because most of this now, because of COVID, is on video. And I will say, \"Just draw a shape of a diamond on a piece of paper in front of you.\" And I said, \"On the top of that diamond, put the word win. How do you define winning is really it?\" I said, \"Now on that other next corner of the diamond, what do you have to win? Write that down. On the bottom, what do you need to win? And then on that final angle on the left-hand side, what do you have to say to win?\" Then I said, \"Now, let's go all the way to that final thing of what do you have to say to win.\"\n\n(00:56:49):\nAnd that's where you just get people thinking about, \"Well, what we really have here is... And we're better than this.\" And then I'll just say, \"Okay. Now, what you want to take that this really should be about experience and behavior. How do you want to behave in the marketplace? How do you want the marketplace to behave towards you? And what kind of experience are you creating?\" And then they'll start talking a little bit. I'll say, \"Now, you just need to probe on that. You need to keep going. You need to look at metaphors because this is about experience.\" And I'll just give them some of our examples that we've talked about, \"Blackberry, it says to the marketplace, they're not like the other guys.\" Think of something like Google versus Infoseek, right? Google is an experience. Google says, \"I don't know what these guys are going to do, but it's not this practical mundane Infoseek.\" And that's what attracts people.\n\n(00:57:54):\nAnd so I'll do a little coaching like that, and then that usually kind of sets them free. And they're now thinking about it not as a word, which has maybe limited value, but as creating an experience which has the potential for unlimited value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:12):\nOkay. So, let me try to reflect this back for folks. So the advice is draw triangle. So, you're coming up with a name. Draw triangle. At the top, win. At the bottom-left, was it how do you win?\n\nDavid Placek (00:58:25):\nYeah. So, the diamond is two triangles.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:27):\nOh, diamond. Okay, I see. I have triangle in my mind.\n\nDavid Placek (00:58:28):\nI got you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:30):\nOkay, got it. Diamond. Great.\n\nDavid Placek (00:58:31):\nAnd so on that next angle there on the right side is, what do you have to win already? Right? Because they wouldn't be either in a Y Combinator or getting some seed money if they didn't have something to win. And often, people, startups don't appreciate how much they actually do have to win because they're so busy and so stressed on what they're doing. And then, what do they need to win? And then finally, what do you need to say? And then back up to defining what is winning to us? Which, by the way, we start with that question usually on an assignment that we've been awarded. And if we're in a room with five people, all five people have a different definition of what... Their definition of that company winning. And that's good to sort that out because we can move down different avenues from a creative standpoint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:31):\nLet's just make sure people have these phrases because this is awesome. And I imagine many people are going to be taking notes and like, \"Cool. I'm going to do this.\" I hope so say the four points of the diamond again just so folks can write it all down.\n\nDavid Placek (00:59:42):\nAt the top of the diamond is just the word win, and underneath that is how do we define winning for us as a company. And that can start off being simple, like we want to be the dominant player here. But you really have to work at that. What does that really mean, right? The second on that right-hand tip there of the diamond is what do we have to win? What are we doing now that makes us a winner? Then we go down to the bottom of the diamond, and it's what do we need to win? There could be technical things there. People talk about talent and resources. Often there, they'll say, \"We need a good name.\" We always correct that. It's not the good name, it's the right name.\n\n(01:00:28):\nAnd then finally is what do we need to say? And that's where I say, that's where you want to spend some time in really thinking about all the things you need to say, that you can say or you would even like to say, which maybe right now you can't say. But you want to a name that actually is going to have the flexibility as to when you can say that, it still works. And that gets them into behavior and experience. And that usually launches a really a good discussion with founders internally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:03):\nWhen you say you have to win though, what you're thinking about there is what is it that you have that will help you win? And then what is it you need to have this win?\n\nDavid Placek (01:01:10):\nYes, that's right. And all companies are in that same situation. They have a bunch of stuff, but they need... A P&G might say, \"We need a good distributor.\"\n\n(01:01:19):\n\"Okay. All right, we'll put that on the list.\"\n\n(01:01:24):\nAnd then you might say, \"Well, we need in...\" When it gets to what do we have to say, we have to say the right things so that a distributor is interested in us. And then you go down an avenue there. Well, what is that? And if you work at it, this is not a one-hour exercise, it may be an exercise repeated over the next 4 or 5 days.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:49):\nOkay. So, you have this diamond. And then the idea is just sit and put names down in a Google Doc, let's say.\n\nDavid Placek (01:01:55):\nYeah. And then you start. But there is this... And maybe, it's naivete. I guess, that's probably the best word for this is that, because I do hear this all of the time. \"Hey, we've worked at this, we got a list of 200 names, but we don't think there's something there.\"\n\n(01:02:19):\nAnd I'll say, \"Well, 200 names is not enough. Get to 1,000, 1,500 names and directions. Don't evaluate them. Just generate names, and directions, and ideas, and then have a meeting. And don't evaluate but speculate.\" What could we do with this name? What's the potential here? There's a lot of overevaluation in our industry. It makes sense. We survive as humans because we figure out what's wrong with this picture. If I want to cross the street, is it safe to cross the street? What's going on? Those kinds of things. You have to counter that. You have to say, \"Let's just suspend judgment for a while. And let's do an exercise here where we take these 10 names that we think might work and what are we going to do with it.\" Because it's how you execute.\n\n(01:03:21):\nGoing back to windsurf, as we showed them pictures of people windsurfing and waves and things, if they said, \"Ah, that just doesn't work for us at all. I'm very uncomfortable with.\" Well, then it's not their name. But they leaned into it, \"Okay, I can see this. It's easy for us to execute. It's dynamic, it's different.\" So, that's why we build these prototypes for people. And that's what... I think the best advice I can give to whether it's a startup or someone starting a new cookie company, is it's not just a list of 200 names. It's 10 or 15 lists of 200 names. And it's thinking about what do we have to say here? What behavior? How do we want people to feel in the marketplace about us? I imagine with Google, people felt relief that it wasn't a descriptive name. That there was something new out there in the marketplace.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:20):\nYeah. Infoseek, that's such a descriptive name now that I think about it.\n\nDavid Placek (01:04:23):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:24):\nOkay, so one more question along these lines. So say, you have a list of let's say 2,000 or 1,000 names. There's this tension between choosing something... Like, as a person that is doing them themselves. Your advice is choose something bold, not something descriptive. You won't know it when you see it. Very hard to do, obviously, when you're doing it by yourself. And you just advise for not losing sight of that piece. Just throwing out things that feel too scary, finding a name that's actually bold as you suggest.\n\nDavid Placek (01:04:55):\nFirst off, we disappear... Human psychology, humans only pay attention to what is new or what is different, I should say. So if you're looking at shoes and they're all black, black, black, black, and then the next pair of shoes is red, that's the first thing you focus on. And so, that usually gives people permission. They'll say, \"Okay, I get that.\" So, look for what is really different between the names that you have on your list, but also what's different from what's out in the marketplace. Then you get a client like Microsoft saying, \"Azure is different. There's going to be a lot of cloud stuff and...\" There's a relevant point there, Azure is blue. And so, there's a slight logical connection that I think gave them more permission to move forward with it, frankly. But listen, this is not an easy task. I mean, that's why we're in this business, and why I felt we should be specialized because if you start doing design and/or advertising or other things, you can't have the intellectual engine.\n\n(01:06:16):\nYou can't acquire the intellectual engine that we have. So I know it's difficult, but it can be done, and you just have to give yourself some time. But stop evaluating. Suspend judgment and speculate. That's my number one advice to people trying to do this on their own. Now, how can you get help? You can talk to your employees, but it's not so much, \"What do you think of this name?\" It's, \"What do you think this name could do for us?\" That's a much better question. If you go out and talk to friends who don't work for your company, there's a fun drill that I suggest. I said, \"Listen, go out to them and say...\" They'll know what you're doing. And say, \"You know what? We just have a new competitor and their name is blank. What do you think about that?\"\n\n(01:07:10):\nWhat happens there is you're not asking them to give you an opinion to evaluate a name. You're asking them then what does that name do for you? The information you're getting is that name, they're telling you what that name does for them, how it helps them to imagine, which is a fundamental role of any name. Slight tangent, but I'm going to go to our kind of research. We do mostly quantitative research now, but for years, we did qualitative work. And we still do. But what we found in, we were always looking for the...\n\n(01:07:49):\nI'll set it this way. We were always looking for this answer from consumers. If a consumer said, \"I don't really know much about that new product, but I know that they're not like the other guys.\" That's when we knew we had a good name because they were... Now what happened there? I mean, the technical term that we use is that name will create a predisposition to consider this product because they're not like the other guys, as opposed to, \"I already have something like that. I'm busy. I don't need another one of those things. I need something new and different, and hopefully better.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:30):\nThat's awesome. That's a good reminder. There's a quote that I found of yours that's exactly along these lines, \"If your team is comfortable with the name, chances are you don't have the name yet.\"\n\nDavid Placek (01:08:38):\nYes. And by the way, the opposite of that is we look for polarization. We look for tension in a team about arguing about these things, because we think that polarization is a sign of strength in the word. And interesting story, the person who taught me that, honestly, was Andy Grove over the Pentium name, because... And I learned a lot from him. I always say this, I just was very fortunate to work with him on Pentium, and Xeon, and a few other things. But when we went to an executive committee to present Pentium... And by the way, internally, one of the names that... And makes sense here, descriptive, bunch of engineers, ProChip. \"Hey, it's professional, it's premium, and it's chipped. So, it should be Prochip.\" So Andy had me give a presentation about the strengths of this thing, and he said, \"Now, let me tell you why I think this is the right name.\"\n\n(01:09:56):\nHe said, \"Because I see the polarization here in it amongst people. There's this ProChip over here, there's the Pentium thing.\" He said, \"That tells me there's energy for Pentium here.\" And he said, \"That's why I think we should go with it.\" And I've never forgotten that. And so, we do look for that. And when we tell that story, people say, \"You're right. There is... I mean, we are arguing about this, and there is an intensity with the name.\" And that's what you want. You don't want to go out in the marketplace, into this very competitive marketplace, regardless of the category, with something that doesn't have a level of boldness or intensity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:33):\nThat was an amazing story. Just again, so kind of a tip here is if half of your team or, I don't know, some percent of your team hates it, some percent of your team loves it, that's a good sign.\n\nDavid Placek (01:10:43):\nYeah, it is. It is. Look for that polarization. That's what we look for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:47):\nI also love this tip of asking people if, \"Hey, our competitor just launched. They're called Windsurf.\" How your team reacts? If they're just like, \"Oh, wow, that's a great name. I'm interested in that product.\" That's what you want to look for?\n\nDavid Placek (01:10:59):\nYes, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:02):\nHow important is the .com for the name you come up with? I imagine it's really hard to get these days. Just what do you think about domain name when you think about naming?\n\nDavid Placek (01:11:10):\nI am so glad you asked this question because at this point, it doesn't really matter at all. The .com or URL address has become an area code. And whether you're in 415 or 615, it doesn't really matter to people. And now with AI, SEO is going to be less important. And so, I just think the principle in play here is you got to get the right name first. And then if you can get the .com, sure, go ahead. But if you can't, there's ways around that. You can put a prefix in front of it or a little word in front of it or after it, or you go to .ai or something like that. But the principle in play is let's get the right name first.\n\n(01:12:02):\nFor those who really... And there are people who really get hung up on the .com, they tend to older by, the way. And have, in their mind, sort of the hotness of the internet and having a .com, which did make a difference 25 years ago. But it's 25 years now or 30, right? The good news is because they're less valuable, you can typically buy a URL if you negotiate the right way and have time for 15, 20, 25, $30,000. And we say, \"Hey, if you can do that, have fun. I'd put the $30,000 into market.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:42):\nAwesome. That's reassuring. I imagine many founders are just like, \"God dammit, there's no names available anymore.\" Let me zoom out and just ask you this question as a, maybe, a closing thought to our conversation.\n\n(01:12:56):\nSay you were just in an elevator ride with someone, and I'm sure this happens to you of just like, \"Hey, David, I got to come up with that name. What's your biggest tip for coming up with a great name?\" What would your answer be?\n\nDavid Placek (01:13:06):\nI'd go back to forget about the word, think about behavior and experience. And then the second thing from just a creative help, I'm a big believer in synchronicity. And we try to force synchronicity here, and I'll give you a couple examples of that. But this idea of connecting dots, two unrelated ideas together. And so I'll say, \"Look, if someone says we make sailboats and I'm trying to...\" I'm here in Sausalito. I guess, that's why I thought about that. And I am trying to create a new name for my company that builds sailboats.\n\n(01:13:49):\nI would say forget about sailboats. I would go and pick out some magazines about hunting or flying magazines. And I would just look through those, get a notepad out, and put out words that you like. Things, expressions that you like. And then that synchronicity, I said, \"I would bet you $5 that out of those two magazines, you will get a word that you never would've thought of, but somehow it would relate to sailing.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:25):\nThat connects very much to your story of how you have these different teams, and the teams that end up coming up with a winning name are the ones thinking about a very different version of that product.\n\nDavid Placek (01:14:35):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:36):\nSo interesting. Okay. David, this was everything I was hoping it'd be. I feel like we're going to help so many people. Is there anything that we haven't covered or that you want to leave listeners with as a final nugget or piece of advice or story before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nDavid Placek (01:14:55):\nI'm going to emphasize one point, I think, which is that I really would like the listeners to really begin to think about how valuable a brand name can be. That you're not just looking for a word, you're looking for this experience. And if you get it right, not just a good name but the right name, the value is almost unlimited. And so give yourself some time, give yourself a budget, give yourself the right resources to do that. Second thing is we try to really be helpful here, and so I am always happy to talk to people about where they are in a process and if we can help, or just give them a little bit of advice. And we schedule, we call them office hours here. We're judicious about it, but we are open to that. It's just playing a long-term game, so I'd like to leave that with the viewers also.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:51):\nWe're about to book out your office hours. I love that offer. I think a lot of people are going to take advantage of that. That is super cool.\n\n(01:15:58):\nDavid, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nDavid Placek (01:16:03):\nYes, I'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:05):\nThere we go. What are 2 or 3 books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nDavid Placek (01:16:09):\nThere's a book called Resilience, which was written by a former Navy SEAL that... And it's not about combat, it's just a tiny bit about being a SEAL. But it is about overcoming things and it's about tenacity. And I think everybody in the world, we all have challenges and things. And I do recommend that to people.\n\n(01:16:31):\nSecond book is Andrew Roberts latest book on Winston Churchill. Winston Churchill is, really, one of my heroes. He was one of the most unusual, provocative statesmen/politicians of the 20th century. And here's another person that talked about tenacity, and ups and downs, and stick with it. And so, I do like to recommend that. Some people just tipped their head and said, \"Ah, I don't know.\" It seems like maybe a boring book, but those are two books that I [inaudible 01:17:02].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:02):\nWho would ever say that Churchill's story is boring? That's absurd.\n\nDavid Placek (01:17:07):\nI think so. I agree. I agree It's absurd, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):\nHe's so fascinating. There's a recent documentary, I think, that really showed me the character. Incredible.\n\n(01:17:18):\nOkay. What's a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nDavid Placek (01:17:20):\nFor me, it's the Yellowstone series. We're very fortunate as a family, we have some property in Montana. And-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:29):\nOh, wow. You're living the life.\n\nDavid Placek (01:17:31):\nYeah, very... Listen, I can't tell you how fortunate I am. And I bought this property 28 years ago, so it was a lot cheaper then.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:31):\nWow.\n\nDavid Placek (01:17:40):\nIn a snowstorm, and it just felt right. But I think particularly the 1883, the precursor to Yellowstone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:48):\nI was going to ask if you saw that because that was incredible.\n\nDavid Placek (01:17:50):\nYes. And then the after one, 1923, which is the post-war. 1883 really gives people a sense of what it took by those early Americans to build a life in a place like... A beautiful place but a hard, tough place like Montana. And it's just phenomenal. The person producing and writing those things is incredibly talented. Taylor Sheridan, I think, is his name.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:19):\nI love that in the story, Montana was the easy route almost from the journey they want on.\n\nDavid Placek (01:18:24):\nThat's right. It's very, very true, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:26):\nOh, man. Yeah, you almost don't even need to watch Yellowstone. Just starting with 1883 totally works.\n\nDavid Placek (01:18:32):\nYeah. In fact, I recommend people. I say there's three. But if you really want the truth about the American West, it's 1883.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:40):\nYeah. I suggested that on this podcast a bunch, actually. So, I love that. That's where you went.\n\n(01:18:45):\nNext question, do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really love? Maybe one you named, maybe not.\n\nDavid Placek (01:18:51):\nI didn't name it, although it's got a very good name to it. Our whole family, I have two daughters and my wife, we're all fly fishermen, and last summer I really... I bought this for myself, but I gave it to my wife. It was one of those things that was present for her, but I knew I was going to use it more. And it's a Hardy. It's an old British fly rod, but it's a beautiful rod. It's just perfect for the big rivers of Montana. So, that's my favorite purchase.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:20):\nThat's the first fly-fishing rod of the podcast. Excellent choice.\n\n(01:19:24):\nNext question, do you have a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to, sharing with friends or family?\n\nDavid Placek (01:19:31):\nI do. And it's a little longer, so I wrote it. I have it written here somewhere, but it's the quote from T.E. Lawrence, Lawrence of Arabia, here. And if I can find it, I should be. I think it's a wonderful quote, so I think hopefully your viewers will like this. Here's what he said. He said that, \"All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men for they may act on their dreams with open eyes to make them possible.\"\n\n(01:20:14):\nI read that years ago and it just hit me pretty hard, so yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:21):\nThat is an amazing quote. It makes me think about the quote about the man in the arena.\n\nDavid Placek (01:20:25):\nYes. Yeah, it's same idea. It's just a little different. And I also think Lawrence of Arabia is a fascinating person, what he did. So, inspiring in some ways.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:38):\nAn amazing movie.\n\n(01:20:40):\nOkay, final question. Let me just try this. Is there a name that you didn't name that you're just like, \"Wow, that was an amazing name. I wish I had come up with that name\"?\n\nDavid Placek (01:20:49):\nI'll tell you there is one name, and it's DreamWorks. I think it's a wonderful name, and it's somewhat ironic that the entertainment industry in general has pretty mundane names. You have all of these talented people. And yet when you look at the names of production studios, movie houses, Comcast, things like that, it's very mundane. But here's DreamWorks, just like Sonos, check all the boxes. Compound dream. You expect something great from DreamWorks. They've created an experience, the experience of dreaming in a movie. I think it's a wonderful name. I wish I'd done it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:39):\nThat's such a cool answer. David, thank you so much for doing this. This was incredible. I learned a ton as I imagined. I feel like a lot of people are going to have a much easier time thinking about approaching this topic.\n\nDavid Placek (01:21:50):\nWell, I certainly hope so. I do. It's been very, very enjoyable, very thoughtful, and I have nothing but or respect for the way you do this and the talent that you have. So, very fortunate that we've come together. And we live in the same place, so maybe we can get together for a cup of coffee or something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:10):\nWe do. Northern California for the win. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nDavid Placek (01:22:14):\nYou're very welcome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:16):\nBye everyone.\n\nDavid Placek (01:22:17):\nTake care.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:19):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Building a culture of excellence | David Singleton (CTO of Stripe)\n\n## Transcript\n\nDavid Singleton (00:00:00):\nThe way we think about product development at Stripe, it really is to find the correct set of early users to kind of co-create the product with. Maybe the best example of that is Stripe billing. When we got to starting the Stripe billing product, we realized that there were a number of our existing users, these were companies like Figma and Slack, were already using Stripe for payments, but had these subscriptions business models. And we figured that there were going to be many more of these kind of companies into the future. And we could see that they were really kind of pushing the boundaries of what was possible here.\n\n(00:00:32):\nSo we decided to co-create the product with them. So we had shared Slack channels, we'd actually show them product on a very regular basis, get their feedback on it. And only when that original kind of Alpha group was super, super happy with the product did we then think it might be ready to go to a broader audience. So that is just how we build product at Stripe. And that means that every engineer building product at Stripe really has many of the kind of attributes and will exercise many of the attributes that'll you often find in PMs in other companies.\n\nLenny (00:01:04):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard experiences building and growing today's most successful product. Today my guest is David Singleton. David is chief technology officer at Stripe where he's responsible for guiding its engineering and design teams, a role he's had for over five years. Prior to Stripe, David was VP of engineering at Google where he spent over a decade. And in hearing from David, you'll quickly be able to tell how passionate he is about the craft of building great products and building great teams. We dig into Stripe's unique approach to hiring, how they built a very product oriented engineering team, which allowed them to hold off on hiring their first product manager for many, many years, how they operationalize their operating principle of be meticulous in your craft, including a number of fascinating internal processes like engineer occasions, walking the store and something called friction logging.\n\n(00:01:59):\nDavid also shares what it takes to run an engineering culture with the uptime and scale requirements of Stripe, plus how AI is already impacting how they work and lessons around leadership management and planning. I'm so thankful David carved out time to come on the podcast and I know that you'll learn something valuable from it. With that, I bring you David Singleton after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:22):\nThis episode is brought to you by Mixpanel offering powerful self-serve product analytics. If you listen to this podcast, you know that it's really hard to build great product without making compromises. And when it comes to using data, a lot of teams think that they only have two choices. Make quick decisions based on gut feelings or make data driven decisions at a snail's pace. But that's a false choice. You shouldn't have to compromise on speed to get product answers that you can trust. With Mixpanel, there are no trade-offs. Get deep insights at the speed of thought at a fair price that scales as you grow. Mixpanel builds powerful and intuitive product analytics that everyone can trust, use and afford. Explore plans for teams of every size and see what Mixpanel can do for you and mixpanel.com. And while you're at it, they're hiring. Check out mixpanel.com to learn more.\n\n(00:03:13):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo's the next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams, companies like DraftKings, Zapier ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.\n\n(00:03:40):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage.

David, welcome to the podcast.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:04:25):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. It's great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:27):\nI know Stripes Sessions is coming around the corner in later next week and I imagine it's a pretty hectic time for you. And so I just want to extra appreciate you making time for this in the middle of all that.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:04:38):\nThank you. Well, it's a pleasure. It's a lot of fun. Stripe Sessions is our annual user conference, so we get together a bunch of folks from businesses building on Stripe and it's a great opportunity both to share what we've been up to over the last year, but also just learned a lot from them about what they would like to see us doing. And so I find it very energizing. It is of course a lot of work to put it together. In particular, I'm spending a bunch of time getting some demos together today, which I love building demos so, but it's a real pleasure to join you today.\n\nLenny (00:05:05):\nSo as I was preparing for this conversation, I kind of realized that the Stripe alumni are just killing it on this podcast, both in terms of the number of people that have come from Stripe and also just in terms of the quality and the popularity of some of the episodes. So folks like Claire Hughes Johnson, and Shreyas Doshi and Eeke. And my first question essentially, what is it that you all do that allows you to attract hire, close, keep people of that caliber? And I'm not going to accept just we keep a high bar or we just spend a lot of time on hiring. I'm curious just like what is it that you all do that other companies don't do that's maybe unique to the way Stripe finds and hires?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:05:44):\nWell, yeah, I'd love to tell you more about how we find and hire people. I think it makes sense to kind of zoom out for a second because it's material here. So think about what Stripe is doing. Our core thesis is that the internet economy is going to be much bigger and more important in the future than it is today. And that's certainly played out over the last 10 years. And so we are really a business full of product minded builders who are seeking to make it easier for businesses to get started and to operate against that backdrop. And so we got started building a credit card payments API. Before Stripe came along, accepting credit card payments online was way too hard. You had to go talk to your bank, you had to maybe sign a contract with Visa, MasterCard. You then had to kind of string together all this very complicated infrastructure and it then put a bunch of kind of restrictions and requirements on the business.\n\n(00:06:37):\nAnd John and Patrick are our co-founders at a previous business and they tell this funny story actually, which is while they were building that company, they assumed, it was an internet company, they assumed the hardest thing was going to be putting together hardware in a data center. But it turned out because there were services like AWS around by then, that that was actually quite easy. However, when it came to accepting payments in that business, it was just as hard as they had expected building hardware to be. They had to actually deploy some physical hardware, they had to do a whole bunch of these partnerships and it was very difficult, especially as an upstart, folks that didn't have any reputation yet to kind of be taken seriously and be able to correct into that. And so that's kind of the inspiration behind Stripe. So we started out solving a really kind of important and profound problem for these businesses getting started and scaling and obviously taking a very developer-centric approach to that in the early days.\n\n(00:07:24):\nI think what's exciting to know about and important to know about next is as we've scaled, we really kind of figure out what to do based on paying really close attention to our users. Those are the businesses building on Stripe. What are they getting out of the products as they are today and what are the problems adjacent to the ones that we're already solving that they have to put a lot of their own energy into but really feel like they shouldn't and they'd like us to help. And when we find that confluence of kind of need and then adjacency to what we're already doing, that's usually our invitation to go and build the next layer of our economic infrastructure. So we think about what we do today is building economic infrastructure for the internet and beyond.\n\n(00:08:03):\nSo to bring this back to how do we attract the right talent and why does this matter? First of all, a lot of people, most people I think come to Stripe because they see that there is this great opportunity to help businesses at scale. So it really is about taking part in a mission that matters and are really motivated by that idea that we spend a lot of time with our users, the folks that actually need our help and are guided by them. And that mindset I think attracts a certain kind of person who wants to take a lot of agency, wants to understand the problems deeply and come up with their own ideas about how to solve for them. Because we're building infrastructure, it's also our approach that we really do think that we can do the best work kind of behind the scenes. We don't have to be out having the splashy launch, but hopefully all of our users can and we are quietly working behind the scenes to make their businesses better and more effective over time.\n\n(00:09:02):\nAnd I think that attracts folks with a certain kind of mindset, which is the interest and kind of tenacity to dig into difficult problems that may not be obvious and obviously kind of attractive to everyone in the world then really plug away at them until we've made a tremendous amount of progress. And so it attracts folks that are long-term thinkers, that care about building and also actually want to work very collaboratively together. So when I think about what makes Stripe different to other companies, it really is this singularity of purpose. Our mission is increasing the GDP of the internet and building this financial infrastructure to do that and a tremendous amount of teamwork and collaboration to get that done. And so that attracts a certain kind of person. When we think about finding those people, we don't hide any of that. You have to care about that in order to, I think be excited about working at Stripe.\n\n(00:09:55):\nAnd so we work very hard to make it very clearer as we're bringing people in that that's what this is about. And to that end, we're often very patient when we're hiring. So especially for critical roles, leadership hiring in particular, we're happy to take our time and meet tens or hundreds of people. And then in particular, sometimes we'll meet someone that we think is a really good fit for a given role, but they're not available right now. And then we'll be patient. We'll keep building the personal relationship with them and oftentimes the moment in time comes when it makes sense for them to join. And in order to pull that off, it's also the case that hiring at Stripe is a very personal activity. So look, there are lots of other companies where recruiting is kind of like this machine. And by the way, we have an awesome recruiting team, but folks across the rest of the company partner very closely with our recruiting team.\n\n(00:10:47):\nSo it's not like it's a machine that delivers new hires, then you're like, oh, well maybe this person is here and I can put them to use on that thing. Our managers spend a lot of time identifying exactly what they need for the various roles that we have and then getting to know the potential candidates, the people out there in the world that could do these jobs actually really go quite deep with them on why it might make sense for them to feel like number one, they can feel very personally fulfilled against that mission here. And then also why it represents a bigger opportunity for them than maybe anything else they can spend their time and attention on. And to that end, another thing that I think Stripe has definitely delivered for many, many people who join here is just, and I care about preserving this in the culture, is just tremendous learning opportunities.\n\n(00:11:35):\nVery, very many people at Stripe today are doing a quite different job to the one that they join for. In order to do that they've often had to learn a lot and stretch themselves into new areas. It's also the case that when you think about that financial infrastructure we're building, the space really rewards people who want to go and learn a ton of detail in how these systems that are not that popular or well understood in the broader world, how they actually work and assimilate just a lot of context. And then in particular, you can build better stuff. Right. You're sharing that context with each other and helping other people learn. And so I think that all ladders up to this kind of group of folks that you mentioned. And all the folks you mentioned are wonderful Stripes or former Stripes that come together in service of our users.\n\nLenny (00:12:22):\nI always love to hear what people call their people internally. So Stripes. Good to know.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:12:26):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:12:28):\nSo just to summarize what you shared, which I was just writing as you were talking about the things that essentially help Stripe build this incredible team. A strong mission and a mission that draws people in that are incredible and people may be hearing that and be like, yeah, yo, sure. But in my experience, having invested in a bunch of companies and working with a lot of founders, there's such a dichotomy between how hard it is for companies to hire when they don't have a mission people really care about versus a mission that's really meaningful. So there's something so powerful there and so it's 100%, I could see how that works so well. And then the other things you mentioned, patients, personal connections between the hiring manager and the people they're hiring. And I see that on Twitter, a lot of PMs are just doing things, like basically it's like they're writing on a little startup on Twitter like Jeff Weinstein,\n\nDavid Singleton (00:13:12):\nYeah, so,\n\nLenny (00:13:12):\nAtlas.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:13:13):\nJeff is the PM for our Atlas product, and he's a great example of someone who cares a lot about learning exactly how the world works. So I mean for instance, one of the things that that team and Jeff really has driven this himself have done recently is recognizing that when you're starting a new business in the US, one of the most frustrating steps is that you have to apply for this Employer Identification Number from the IRS. And it used to have an extremely long backlog and it's really hard. You can't start running your business until you have it.\n\n(00:13:42):\nAnd Jeff dug into the details, the team dug into the details and we're just like kept asking, does it have to be this way? Does it have to be this way? And eventually we work with the IRS to make it possible for us to issue those numbers much, much more quickly, like instantly as you sign up. And I think that's exactly a great example of how being curious, having this relentless passion to solve problems for users and then just keep plugging away at a problem delivers this great result and in a environment where you can learn a lot from each other.\n\nLenny (00:14:11):\nI hope he got a big promotion for getting the IRS to do something that he needed. That's incredible. I'm going to ask, try to go one layer deeper on the hiring piece and then move on to a different topic, but,\n\nDavid Singleton (00:14:11):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:14:22):\nWhat is just the interview process like? I don't know how involved you are with the product management hiring process, but just I'm curious what that is like, high level and engineering hiring process, however you can share.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:14:32):\nYeah, there are a couple things that are very common across hiring for all roles at Stripe and in particular engineers and PMs. One of the things is we do have structured hiring loops. So we put everyone through a very consistent process, so very personal as we help folks figure out why they might want to be here. But then we have a consistent way of evaluating talent. And I think that's important because it means that you can, as an interviewer, as a hiring manager, you can actually really start to understand what is the broad spectrum of responses you might get here and what do I actually learn about individual candidates when I'm asking similar questions. The other thing that these loops have in common is nothing is a trick question. We try to put people into an environment which is as close to doing the actual work together as we possibly can.\n\n(00:15:18):\nSo I mean for engineers for instance, we've got several different coding exercises that they do. They share their screen with the interviewer. It's actually kind of pair programming welcome to use Google to search for Stack Overflow to search for answers. We don't care. We just want to see the outcome. We're happy for you to ask your interviewer questions as you go along. And we've created these exercises that is close to real problems as we need to solve at Stripe as possible. The same is true on the PM side. One of the things, for instance we do with PMs is we have a written exercise, we've got obviously a variety of different problems and we find that very valuable for actually just seeing how does someone attack a real problem that they would be solving at work and will they want to do that in a way that is curious, digging into the details, collaborative with their interviewer and so forth. So that's the point. Structured loops that are consistent. And then questions that are as close to the real job as we possibly can.\n\nLenny (00:16:13):\nAnd for the questions on the PM side, do you have them do it at home or do them do it in the office?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:16:18):\nIt's a variety. Right now at Stripe, we're very much in a hybrid mode, so a lot of our interviews are still happening over Zoom, although we have plenty of great activity going on in our offices as well. The written exercises tend to be something that you do in your own time. We suggest a time bind so it's not an unreasonable demand in the rest of your life. And then the other exercises are with an interviewer on Zoom.\n\nLenny (00:16:40):\nOkay. So speaking of product managers at Stripe, Stripe is kind of famous slash infamous for waiting a long time to hire your first product manager. From what I understand, it was like around the 200th employee and maybe five years in, which to me tells me that you're really good at building product minded engineers and or hiring and building a product minded engineering culture. How do you do that? How do you go about doing that? And then I'm also just curious what PMs ended up bringing to the table and how they kind of collaborate now.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:17:06):\nYeah, so I mean at Stripe today, we have lots of product managers, lots of engineers, product management's an extremely valuable and important job family. I'll talk more about what folks do today. It is true that our original team, and I think we hire our first PM a little bit earlier than you said, but our original team was really an engineering team. However, they were extremely product minded. And I would honestly say that of all of the very early team that I've worked closely with and know well over time, every single one of them could also have been and essentially also was acting as a PM. If you think about the nature of the first Stripe product, and again today we solve problems for businesses from the very small to the very large across a whole range of financial infrastructure. But the initial product was very developer focused and we still have a developer focused at the core of many things that we do.\n\n(00:17:56):\nThe best PMs for developer focused products I think are usually very technical. They're mostly former engineers themselves or maybe kind of current engineers still tinkering on the side, but bringing a lot of user insight and strategy to the problem. And every single early member of the team at Stripe had to act like that in order to work the way that we do and that we want to. So remember, again, that is to get to know our users very well and then bring those kind of personal insights into our product development loop. So I mean, in fact, the way we think about product development at Stripe, it really is to find the correct set of early users to kind of co-create the product with. So maybe the best example of that, or at least an example of that is Stripe billing. So it's our solution for subscriptions and invoicing.\n\n(00:18:43):\nAnd when we got to starting the Stripe billing product, we realized that there were a number of our existing users. These were companies like Figma and Slack. We were already using Stripe for payments, but had these subscriptions, business models, and we figured that there were going to be many more of these kind of companies into the future, and we could see that they were really kind of pushing the boundaries of what was possible here. So we decided to co-create the product with them. The early team working on billing got a bunch of those companies included Slack and Figma, but a bunch more as well, got to know them. But the individuals who were operating those systems at those companies personally understood exactly what their challenges and hopes and dreams for the future were, and then brought them into a kind of shared product development loop.\n\n(00:19:28):\nSo we had shared Slack channels, we'd actually show them product on a very regular basis, get their feedback on it. And only when that original kind of Alpha group was super, super happy with the product did we then think it might be ready to go to a broader audience. So that is just how we build product at Stripe. And that means that every engineer building product at Stripe really has many of the kind of attributes and will exercise many of the attributes that you'll often find in PMs in other companies.\n\n(00:19:57):\nNow, that doesn't mean that there isn't a really important job for PMs to do here as well. So something else that I think is worth knowing about Stripe and is somewhat unique is building products is also a much more kind of team sport at Stripe across functions. So there are the obvious functions that most companies have, engineers, engineering managers, product managers, designers, and those folks all get involved throughout the entire lifecycle of product development at Stripe. But also, if you think about the nature of our products, it turns out that a lot of our products are about abstracting over what the financial system does at large.\n\n(00:20:31):\nSo sometimes there's a capability in a certain country and there's a different one in another country, and we want to make it all work consistently. So our financial partnerships matter. So sometimes folks from our partnerships team are part of the kind of early development phase of a product. Similarly, when you think about product legal and many of the other functions around risk and compliance and so forth, we actually need their creative thinking in order to build the right stuff for our users. So the point is it's a way more cross-functionally collaborative process than I've seen in a lot of other companies. And PMs play just this absolute linchpin role across a lot of that. So PMs are very frequently the ones that are providing the kind of look motion to bring all of that partnership together. They're very frequently the folks that are synthesizing what we're learning from our users.\n\n(00:21:19):\nNot everyone is talking to users across all those job families, but the PM is probably the person talking to folks the very most and probably the one who's synthesizing the very best. They often and usually also bring a lot of the product strategy, okay, this is what we're doing today, but what does it ladder up to and therefore how do we make the right choices to make sure that we're taking the right longer term path. And so it's a super important and valuable role. And I mean, you've mentioned a couple of great ones on the call here already, but I think that the PMs at Stripe embodying a lot of the culture I talked about in our operating principles just contributed a tremendous amount to what we get done.\n\nLenny (00:21:56):\nPerfect segue to where I was going to go with the next question, which is, one of your operating principles is to be meticulous with your craft. And I know this is something that you focus on a lot. What I'm curious about is that sounds great. Everyone would love for that to be a focus of theirs and a core value in the way they operate. But there's always this trade off of we just got to ship stuff. How do we wait until it's perfect? So what I want to ask is just how do you operationalize this principle, first of all? And then I'm going to have a few follow up questions.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:22:25):\nYeah, great question. Before I talk about this one operating principle, let me just set a little bit of context of,\n\nLenny (00:22:30):\nYeah.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:22:30):\nWhat are our operating principles at all. So at Stripe we have operating principles and they're kind of like corporate values, but they're not just values, they're much less abstract than that. So actually, we were just talking about the early Stripe team. I think one of the best things that they did, I mean they did a bunch of great stuff, finding early product market fit, but one of the most foresighted things that they did was to kind of take a little detour and think about what is it about how we've been working so far that we think has made us successful and is going to be important as we continue to scale. And we capture those as a set of operating principles so...\n\nDavid Singleton (00:23:00):\nContinue to scale and we capture those as a set of operating principles. So their behavior is distilled from the most effective Stripes and we really care about them. So we talk about our operating principles a lot internally. I'll often see individual Stripes kind of celebrating each other's work in terms of which operating principle is kind of best represented. We frame a lot of our feedback processes and so forth around them, although not exclusively. The very first operating principle we have by the way, is users first. So we've already on this call, touched a bunch on how we put our users at the center of understanding what we should be doing at all. And that idea that we've formed these deep personal relationships with our users to guide everything really comes from and is captured by that operating principle. We also have operating principles. They're kind of segmented into how we work, who we are, and then a bunch that leaders must execute.\n\n(00:23:52):\nSo I mean another example of one of how we work ones is move with urgency and focus. We really believe that even though we're building infrastructure that will persist for decades, it is important that we solve the needs our users just have right now, relatively rapidly so that it actually makes sense, is delivering value for them. So anyway, there there's a range of them. You asked about being meticulous in our craft. So this is another highway work principle and it is very important at Stripe and you also call it Lenny, a challenge of being meticulous, which is, well, there's so much to get done. So where can I be meticulous? Because well, if you do it across everything, maybe a lot of progress would grind to a halt. Well first of all, let me tell a couple of stories.\n\n(00:24:37):\nSo before I joined Stripe, I spent some time and it's a big part of deciding to join, playing with the product. And something that really delighted me was that when I started integrating the product, there were parts of the experience where I was stuck. So I made a mistake with how it integrated API. I was getting an error message back, but I wasn't stuck for very long because something that the team at Stripe had done was we made the error messages coming out of our API link to the piece of the docs that told you how to solve the problem.\n\nLenny (00:25:12):\nGenius.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:25:12):\nAnd that is a really good example of being meticulous in the craft. So it's pretty uncommon, it's certainly very uncommon back then for companies to do this, like your error messages or your API, who's ever going to look at them? Well, turns out developers while they're building and if they're running into problems, they will look at them. It's actually a really high stakes moment because it's a time that matters. So that is an example of where we've been meticulous in the product.\n\n(00:25:37):\nAnd the way that we kind of figure out where to be meticulous, where to really sweat the details and go above and beyond is again, we try to be as user first as we possibly can. So we have a process that is widely used across product teams that even like folks building stuff internally for Stripes to use, which we call friction logging. The way this works is you need to put yourself in a particular user's shoes. It's actually important to have a very clear idea of who is the person I am kind of modeling the friction for right now.\n\n(00:26:09):\nSo for instance, I might be integrating the Stripe billing API and I might put myself in the shoes of an engineer at, I don't know, let's say Atlassian, which is one of the world's largest SaaS platforms and using actively Stripe billing for automating all the revenue today, I might put myself in the mindset of that person. I might have met them recently and kind of understood a little bit better than otherwise doing this particular thing.\n\n(00:26:35):\nAnd then I will go through the process of actually using the product, starting off in the dashboard, hopping over to the particular page in the docs that I need to follow, starting to write code and so forth in order to do my integration and make really careful and meticulous notes of what the experience is. So stream of consciousness notes, but paying particular attention to the places where I ran into friction that I think that particular user mental modeling would find difficult. And then those are the places where we will tend to go and invest a tremendous amount in really thinking how could we solve this problem? And then putting a lot of attention into detail into making it right.\n\n(00:27:16):\nAnd by the way, the example I gave you on the error message is there's actually more code in the jobs that serve the Stripe API to handle those edge cases than in the actual main flow. And I think that's quite remarkable. Most people wouldn't do that, but it turns out not only was it something I was impressed with, but when I talk to Stripe users, this is very frequently something they tell me and delights them about the product. It's a reason that they can adopt it more quickly and it's a reason that they keep adopting other Stripe products because they know that it's going to be easier than doing anything else. So it really matters. So the point is like we are intentional about where the places where being particularly meticulous matters and then when we are, try to do it in quite a systematic way. It's great business as well.\n\n(00:27:57):\nSo for instance, we actually just earlier today put a blog post up that explains we've been tuning both what we call our payment element, which is our kind of morph kind of batteries included UI for putting payment integrations directly on your website. You can style it to fit with the rest of your page, but it has a lot of powerful features. And we also have a set of hosted services called Stripe Checkout. And the point here is we've gone and scarred a whole bunch of checkout flows on the internet over the course of many years and we look out for all of the little broken edges and we've been working hard on these products to tune those and then not, we don't just stop there. We've also been really obsessing about what are the things that we can do in the flows that we've already built that will remove latency or remove a click or whatever.\n\n(00:28:48):\nAnd what we found, we've recently measured the difference between, so with a bunch of actual users who've migrated from a fairly vanilla integration where they built their own checkout flow to one of these surfaces to our payment element or to Stripe Checkout, it turns out that it increases the average user's revenue by 10.5%. And that's huge. So this is an industry where little changes that you might go about making or even big changes that you pour blood, sweat, and tears into will typically deliver uplifts in that you measure in basis points that's hundreds of a percentage point and this set of small changes compounding over time ladders up to 10.5%, it's huge. And the point is you only get there by knowing that this is a thing that might ultimately matter and being meticulous in every single step along the way and that it compounds to a dramatic impact in the end. So I think that that particular set of experiences is one where this operating principle has really mattered.\n\n(00:29:49):\nThinking about those kind of flows is what led us to build Link, which is our product for making one click checkout available. And that has had a tremendous impact both on convenience for customers of our users and also on their conversion rate and so forth. So it really matters.\n\n(00:30:07):\nAnd then one final other area, if I may, I think Stripe is relatively well known for putting a lot of care and attention into our website, a lot of our marketing or product explanation pages. And I think for a business like ours, it's not immediately obvious that it makes a tremendous amount of sense to be super meticulous in building those experiences. But we are, and again, I think it really matters for us and for our users. So the way that we got into this mode was we recognized that we are building a lot of infrastructure.\n\n(00:30:42):\nSo we build what we call our global payments and treasury network. It is literally our product infrastructure for moving money into Stripe, holding balances on behalf of our users, moving money out, all of the automation between moving money between different businesses and all of the kind of regulatory stuff we have to handle, all handle in this big payment engine. But as a user, it's very hard for you to come in and inspect that and say, well, is it good? I mean hopefully you can go and talk to a bunch of other Stripe users, but it's very hard to know from the outside. So if we put a lot of care for detail and attention into the experiences that we use to explain the value and the power of that, it actually helps our users understand exactly how it is that we are trying to operate for them.\n\n(00:31:24):\nAnd that's where all the meticulousness that we put into our site have come from. There are lots of features like we have a spinning globe on our page that shows you what payment methods you can use in different countries and we have this kind of big animated wave on our homepage. And in general, Stripe is kind of known for these great internet moments when we launched products. And so we did it because we wanted our users to be able to see the care and attention that we were taking. It's turned like to have this wonderful kind of side benefit to some extent because those experiences tend to get shared a lot on Twitter and LinkedIn and elsewhere because they're worth looking at just because they're beautiful and they often push the web platform forward. And that then means that folks are likely, folks who themselves want to push internet business forward, are likely to know about Stripe and know about our capabilities.\n\n(00:32:11):\nSo meticulousness plays out with impact in so many different ways at Stripe and I enjoy working that way in many different areas.\n\nLenny (00:32:22):\nI have a few follow up questions along those lines, but before we do that I want to double click on this friction logging process.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:32:28):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:32:28):\nJust understand how you actually do that. So maybe two questions there. Is this a regular task people have on their plate say or is executives or just PMs in general? And is there a template that you share just like you talked about who we are, what company are you working for, what problem are you trying to solve? How do you actually kind of tactically operationalize that?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:32:50):\nYeah, great question. So it's a practice that is quite valuable generically. There are many places where you can apply friction logging in order to really shine a light on what is the most effective place to invest time and effort.\n\n(00:33:04):\nSo we use the practice across lots of different functions and in lots of different ways at Stripe, but it is the case that almost every product team has someone, it's often the PM, sometimes it's the engineering manager who has a regular repeating loop of going through the end-to-end flow of the product and writing a friction log. For years and years, I have gone through the process of onboarding [inaudible 00:33:28] user to Stripe once a month, writing a friction log and then tagging in the right people across the company that might need to take action on some of the things that we're observing.\n\n(00:33:37):\nAnd one of the reasons that that kind of process of taking a big step back is useful is at this stage we have many people, we have thousands of engineers who are working in parallel. And while everyone cares a lot about being meticulous, paying attention to detail, getting the details can have to end up with experiences that diverge and going through this process of looking at it all together on a regular rhythm with friction logging really helps us maintain a cohesive whole while we all operate in parallel. And so therefore senior leaders, executives, I guess of our larger areas will often do this as a practice themselves in order to make sure that everything that they're responsible for is coming together well. So it happens kind of recursively at different layers.\n\n(00:34:20):\nTo your question about is there a template, so relatively simple process. So yes, there is a template and in fact there's a Stripe talk dev article that maybe we can put into the show notes that has the template, but it literally is say what you want to do, be very explicit about the user that you are trying to have a mental model for because that helps you make the right choices as you go through the flow. And then really just keep a very clear stream of consciousness log of what you're finding as you build.\n\n(00:34:46):\nBy the way, also really important, praise the stuff that's good. So I'll often send these docs around to a lot of folks inside of the company. It's a great opportunity to recognize great work done. So if I ran into that error message that links to the documentation, that's a great example where I'd be like, this is awesome. Nice work.\n\nLenny (00:35:02):\nBeing a PM that has received emails from the CEOs of companies with all the problems they ran into and they're trying to book, it's often like, oh God, I have so many goals I got to hit and I have this timeline, I have these things I'm working on. What is the culture like slash how do you give teams space to do these things that are just like, we're just going to make the experience better? How do you actually do that so that PMs aren't stressed out when they get these things?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:35:26):\nIt starts with our operating principles. So because we have operating principles of users first and being meticulous in our craft, we actually tend, all of our ways of building plans tend to be wired quite well around this idea that we're going to reserve enough time to really make the experience good. Maybe the most pronounced version of that is not even the issues we identify in friction logs. Maybe in a bit we can talk about how we invest in reliability and so forth, but things go wrong.\n\n(00:35:54):\nAnd one of the things that's very important to me is that we are a learning organization. We need to understand why they went wrong and then take action to stop the same thing going wrong in future. And so that means that we identify instant remediations, that's what we call those and we prioritize those carefully and most of them, the ones that matter actually get prioritized before other work on the roadmap, which means that as a PM when you're building your roadmap and your plans, you do have to think about, well approximately how much bandwidth do I need to reserve in this area in order to address and polish stuff that might come up through friction logging and also to take care of those kind of operational things as well?\n\n(00:36:30):\nIt varies by team and varies by stage of product. So there is no Stripe kind of like we will reserve 50% of our time to do this stuff. That wouldn't make any sense. But we do encourage and ask every team to think hard about how much should they be setting aside for those kind of activities. Does that make sense?\n\nLenny (00:36:47):\nAbsolutely. I was going to ask you if there's a percentage and basically you trust the teams to set aside the right amount of time.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:36:52):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:36:53):\nAwesome. Okay, so along the same lines, I actually asked Shreyas Doshi what I should ask you.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:37:00):\nOh cool.\n\nLenny (00:37:01):\nYou had no idea I was going to do this. And what he said is I should ask you how you did UX reviews pre shipping right after you joined Stripe and you just said you were very good at this. And so what is that like and how should people learn from your experience?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:37:20):\nThe way that I did UX reviews very early on in my time at Stripe and the way that every group at Stripe does these reviews is employing some of the techniques we talked about already. So that act of friction logging, it's very often done asynchronously. So someone will sit down and reserve an afternoon and go through the product and make meticulous notes and that's super useful.\n\n(00:37:40):\nWe also find it very valuable to go through that process together. So we will bring together both the team that built the product that we're looking at, but also a lot of their cross-functional partners. So things like the support folks that are going to be handling or are building the process to handle questions from users about it. Executives in the org that they're a part of to do these walkthroughs where we're taking exactly the same approach as I described with friction logging so imagining we're a particular user and experiencing the product together. And then just discussing very openly actually the way that we do this today is we have a log of issues that we want to talk about that anyone can type into while the PM usually is walking us through the flow. And then we'll get together at the end and actually talk about each issue and does this need to be addressed? What do we really think about it? So that that's the approach both that I took early on and that we take in at general at scale today.\n\n(00:38:36):\nThere's a lot of benefit to doing this together. So someone once described this to me as if you were a chef, you're going to taste the soup and you're going to talk to your kitchen staff about what went into the soup when it was good and wasn't so good. If you run a movie studio, you're going to sit down and watch a lot of movies together. And so actually kind of looking at product together I find extremely energizing and also really valuable in actually teaching some of the kind of bar for craft and values around how we want the product to interoperate for our users at scale across the company.\n\n(00:39:10):\nAnd building on that, there's something that we do occasionally and I've done occasionally a Stripe called Walk the Store where we'll actually do that process of looking at the product together with the whole company. So we have a weekly meeting called Friday Fireside where you don't have to attend, but the majority of the company does attend and we've done a few series where we'll actually go through some really, really interesting critical product flows together and talk about how this is reflecting various priorities that we have and shifts that we're trying to make, but in particular with the user experience and a particular user at the core. And that turns out to have a tremendous amount of benefit and value in helping just everyone have a shared language, we're talking about things and get on the same page about everything.\n\n(00:39:58):\nSo yeah, those are some of the techniques that Shreyas might have been thinking of.\n\nLenny (00:40:02):\nIt's amazing how many directions you all come at to create this high quality end product walking the store, friction logging these entire company meetings, looking at the product, UX reviews, this is how it's possible to build something so high quality. It's not just we have this value and we're going to be building great stuff. It's like you have to come at it from so many places.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:40:24):\nYeah, that's an interesting observation. I think almost anything that you talk about is a value. I mean, being a value matters, but you need to have a practice behind that. That means that the value becomes real for everyone. So we very frequently find that for any product development team, so long as they identify the right metrics that actually represent the experience that they want to deliver for their users and then get together frequently like predictably to look at how the team is doing against those metrics. But then everything else just happens naturally because you understand what you're trying to move and every little micro decision you're making within your own time prioritization and then in terms of the actual work you're doing will ladder up to that. And so why do I say that? It is like you have to have the predictable and regular thing that ladders up to the value you're trying to deliver in order to make it happen.\n\nLenny (00:41:17):\nComing back to the UX review, just a question there. Presenting to the CTOs often very stressful in a review like that. What advice would you give PMs and designers and just leads of a team for how to prepare for a meeting like that, whether it's Stripe or anywhere?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:41:33):\nI personally try to be as friendly and unscary as possible, but I know that no matter how much I do that, these can't be high stakes meetings. At Stripe, and I think it's probably goes for most companies, but at Stripe, the main answer here is put your user's hat on and if you understand your user well and what they're seeking to get out of the experience and anchor any questions you get asked or wobbles you may feel of like, oh, that was an out of the blue question back to well here's, remember what we're trying to do for our users, that usually makes any meeting like that go really well. And so that would be my main piece of advice.\n\n(00:42:12):\nSo I mean a risk that exists in any company as you get to run a bigger team or whatever is that individual contributors, individuals will have a very small amount of time with you in general. So there's always a risk that you might make a kind of fairly unimportant remark and it will be taken out of context to be something very important. So I personally also try very hard to anchor feedback I'm giving in what's the user experience we're trying to deliver? Does this actually matter? Recognizing that that is a risk and yeah, it definitely takes constant practice.\n\nLenny (00:42:51):\nYou've touched on a couple of these things, but just if someone's trying to get better at building product, either a PM, designer, engineer, what kind of advice do you often give for helping people just build better product?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:43:03):\nAlmost always goes back to things we've already talked about here. So remember at the very top I talked about iterating very closely with users? If you have a mechanism to listen to users, get something in their hands quite quickly and then get their feedback on it to run it back through a feedback loop, you're very unlikely to go wrong. Especially if you put a lot of thought into these being the right users whose needs you want to focus on because they ladder up to your strategy. It's actually very hard to go wrong if you have that feedback loop working really well.\n\n(00:43:34):\nSo if you don't have that feedback loop, and actually it's remarkable as I talk to folks across the industry and so forth, it's remarkable how frequently that feedback loop doesn't exist in product development cycles. So if you don't have that, go figure out how to create it and if you do have it, but you can't get something into user's hands very rapidly from you having the idea that this might matter to getting their feedback on it, figure out how to make that go faster as well. And at Stripe, we focus a lot on all of our developer tooling and infrastructure on making it possible for changes to get delivered continuously to production so we can get them in front of users very rapidly and that's really important.\n\nLenny (00:44:10):\nThis episode is brought to you by Braintrust, where the world's most innovative companies go to find talent fast so that they can innovate faster. Let's be honest, it's a lot of work to build a company and if you want to stay ahead of the game, you need to be able to hire the right talent quickly and confidently. Braintrust is the first decentralized talent network where you can find, hire and manage high quality contractors in engineering, design and product for a fraction of the cost of agencies.\n\n(00:44:37):\nBraintrust charges a flat rate of only 10%, unlike agency fees of up to 70% so you can make your budget go four times further. Plus they're the only network that takes 0% of what the talent makes so they're able to attract and retain the world's best tech talent. Take it from DoorDash, Airbnb, Plaid, and hundreds of other high growth startups that have shaved their hiring process for months to weeks at less than a quarter of the cost by hiring through Braintrust network of 20,000 high quality vetted candidates ready to work.\n\n(00:45:07):\nWhether you're looking to fill in gaps, upskill your staff, or build a team for that dream project that finally got funded, contact Braintrust and you'll get matched with three candidates in just 48 hours. Visit usebraintrusts.com/lenny or find them in my show notes for today's episode. That's usebraintrust.com/lenny for when you need talent yesterday.\n\n(00:45:29):\nSomething that I've heard about you is that you get into the weeds, you get really deep as a CTO of a company at the scale of Stripe and I came across this term engineerications, which I think connects to this. Can you talk about that and how you think about just getting in the weeds?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:45:44):\nFirst of all, in terms of how much getting in the weeds matters. At Stripe, we find that it's very important for engineering managers in particular, but really all managers to really have a very detailed understanding of whether their teams are kind of on the right track and where they're getting stuck in order to make sure that we make the most progress in unit time for our.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:46:00):\nWe're getting stuck in order to make sure that we make the most progress in unit time for our users. So we find that, again, the nature of the problems we're solving, really reward domain expertise, like assimilating a deep understanding. And we ask all of our managers to be kind of the editors in chief of their teams plans. And I think the only way to do that is to get the right loop for yourself to understand what is actually going on the ground. Now, it would be really damaging if I was only doing work at the IC engineering level every day. That doesn't ladder up to someone who's able to help guide the team or whatever. So it's important to just judiciously but done on the right cadence. I think it's very, very valuable. So engineer occasion is something that I personally do. So it's obviously a port man of engineer and vacation, but it's not a vacation.\n\n(00:46:47):\nThe way we get to the name of the tower, at least the way I think about it is what you do on engineer occasion is I'll clear, other people track do this as well. I'll clear several days in a road, three or four days actually join a team, pick up a small task, hopefully a small feature that we can get all the way from start to finish in production and do that going through the exact experience the team has. So you get to understand the developer tools, the build infrastructure, how you get stuff reviewed, how good is the documentation, how long did I have to wait in order to actually see my thing live in order to start that feedback loop that I talked about with users. So you're actually going and joining a team and doing some work.\n\n(00:47:26):\nWhile one does that, it's really valuable and important to keep a friction log because then what you want to do is write up the experience both as an aid memoir for yourself because it then helps you go and for all of the next year's worth of conversations I might be involved in around making trade offs and helping set priorities, that context really helps. So I actually reread these reports periodically and it's also really valuable to actually share them work with the team, which then demonstrates, well I understand what it's actually like and here's how we're going to make sure that we're carrying that information through prioritization. So that's what you do. The name is, it's the often the hardest thing about these is finding the time to clear your calendar for that many days. So the reason I think about it is a vacation is of course people go on vacation.\n\n(00:48:12):\nBy the way, I work very hard to use all my vacation days every year. I think that taking a break and recharging your creative juices is valuable. So the point is when you're on vacation, the world goes on and it's all fine. So I treat it like I'll decline every meeting in order to clear my schedule and have a maker schedule in order to do that. And so I've done this many times at Stripe. I advise engineering managers at Stripe that they should do an engineer occasion sometime in their first quarter to six months at the company. It gives you a tremendous amount of context for what your teams are actually experiencing and then for folks who do it once a year on an ongoing basis and it provides a tremendous amount of context.\n\nLenny (00:48:50):\nThat is insane. I've never heard of that process. How do you stay knowledgeable and up to date on the infrastructure and the code that you have to code and all of a sudden things move so fast?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:49:00):\nThe process is literally to help you do that. I guess maybe something I left out in explaining it is we'll often identify a buddy on the team who's going to help you through. So for what it's worth at Stripe, we write a lot of code in Ruby, we write a lot of code in other just Java type script as well. But our kind of core infrastructure is mostly implemented, core product infrastructure mostly implemented in Ruby. When I started I had never written a line of Ruby in my life and I knew I wanted to do this thing and actually done something like it before joining and I was really scared. How much credibility might I lose if I show up and I can't write a line of Ruby. But my first buddy was a guy called Ajhja who's still at Stripe doing great stuff and he helped me learn Ruby during these three days and they [inaudible 00:49:48] me a little bit, but ultimately everyone really appreciated that I've done it.\n\nLenny (00:49:52):\nImagine being the engineer has to review your PR.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:49:55):\nI tell them this is an important part of the process. Please don't treat me any different to anyone else. And obviously to make this work well you have to set the expectation that you're not going to take me action if something isn't exactly the way you want it to be. It is a moral kind of longitudinal process.\n\nLenny (00:50:11):\nIs there something that you found in this process that comes to mind that was really surprising or interesting or just kind of lasting in the past set of couple years?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:50:19):\nOne of the most interesting things that I think I've run into is there are a lot of places that as we scale, we know that it makes a lot of sense to invest in automation and there were a bunch of places in our development process where while we've done that, we were working hard to help each other out and actually saying, hey, please come talk to this other team if you want to use this thing. And if you're working for instance, a different time zone from someone else, it's often the case that actually it would be much better just to document it well and automate it and then maybe make the consultation available. And so running into those kind of pieces of friction and then having a good conversation about it has really helped. But one good thing about Stripe I think is that kind of change doesn't depend on me doing anything.\n\n(00:51:02):\nSo we really care about making Stripe a place where engineers can do some of the best work of their careers and that means being enabled with good tools and good developer productivity. So we invest a lot in developer productivity. We have a team who work on our dev tools and they actually run exactly the same product development process that I just described for our external users internally. So understand your users really well. Talk to them a lot, as so for instance, we do a monthly survey. We operate in enough scale where we can ping enough people once a month that we get a statistically significant sample of the entire organization without having to get everyone to respond. Every individual respond once every six months. And we ask very directly, what's the experience you're having? And then we use that to prioritize the roadmap of our developer productivity team. We also measure everything so we know where people are getting stuck and when we compare both the kind of free responses and the data, it helps us invest in the best places to make everyone else more productive.\n\nLenny (00:52:03):\nOkay, that's exactly where I was hoping to go next. And let me set this question up. So I saw a tweet of yours recently where I have some notes here I'm going to read that you deploy changes to your core, API 16.4 times a day on average. Your uptime has been 99.999% and one in 10 people in the world have transacted with a business powered by Stripe at this point. And so my question is just what does it take to achieve something like this, especially in terms of tooling and culture and everything else you're just talking about?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:52:33):\nWell I think it's worth saying at Stripe we are trying to do something I think relatively unique, which is what we power for the businesses to build on Stripe our users, it's really business critical to them. We're literally talking about money coming into your business to help you run your operations or make it even possible for you to run your operations and maybe pay your employees and so forth. All the revenue automation that we do around billing subscriptions, our financial automation products, helping you close your books, this stuff matters. You cannot get it wrong. And we also operate, Stripe today, we move as much money as all of e-commerce was when Stripe got started. So we operate very significant scale and so business critical significant scale, we just have a tremendous duty to our users to get this right and be extremely reliable and available for them.\n\n(00:53:23):\nSo we do think about that a lot. Now there's one way to be very reliable, which is to try to change things as infrequently as possible. Never change anything than you have many fewer opportunities for things to break. But we don't take that approach. The needs of our users are evolving so rapidly, the number of ways that we want to serve them and can serve them is evolving rapidly enough that it matters a lot that we can operate in a kind of constantly changing environment. Hopefully I've explained why that matters like that type feedback because it's only possible if you can actually get something in their hands. So we choose to design the way we work to hold those two things true at the same time and it does take a lot of care and attention and it takes a lot of systems. So maybe just kind of build this up.\n\n(00:54:12):\nFirst of all, there's a lot in our development process and the ways that we take changes into our product that makes this possible. One of those is we really care a lot about having really good test suites. So we believe in automated testing. We don't have manual testers because manual testers couldn't possibly cover the vast array of API endpoint and configurations that we offer but automated test can. So we work hard to have a lot of automated test coverage and then every single change that an engineer produces gets run through this battery of tests before it can even possibly go towards production. And then we work very hard as changes end up in production to put them through increasingly realistic and then more broadly exposed environments. So we have a bunch of staging environments where we'll send a battery of more realistic end-to-end tests. Then finally when something actually goes to production, it starts at very small percentage of the traffic and then wraps up to the hole.\n\n(00:55:10):\nSo we can detect problems before they become huge problems. There's a number of things that we had to do to make that all possible. So for instance, every change that Strip engineer submits [inaudible 00:55:23] test, it actually ends up in production automatically over the course of the next 45 minutes or so. And I don't think there are a lot of financial services companies, at least not until maybe the last few years that have operated that way. And so that takes a certain mind shift. You actually have to assume that that's going to happen and put the right systems and processes in place. And then the other thing that's important is to recognize that we have to obsess about getting very systematically good at addressing anything that can go wrong. So I mentioned earlier it's really important to me that we are a continuously learning organization.\n\n(00:55:59):\nAnd I mean something else that matters of course is things will go wrong. Sometimes there is a downstream partner where something breaks, other times there is a particular kind of network outage side of our control or whatever. So things will go wrong. So it's important that we have the right systems in place that minimize the damage that any individual thing going wrong can cause. And we work hard on that. We have redundant systems in a bunch of places. We think hard about how something that breaks for one user wouldn't kind of carry over into other users and then we actually very actively work hard to put things right when they are wrong. So that's called instant response at most companies including Stripe. I actually think Stripe is very, very good at instant response. We've got very good tools for both declaring incidents and then pulling the right people together to put them right.\n\n(00:56:45):\nBut we don't stop there. We really obsess about reviewing them carefully and identifying not only what would've stopped this thing happening, but how could we prevent this whole class of issues in the future. And as I said earlier, we prioritize working on that stuff ahead of anything else on the roadmap that's because of remember what it is we're trying to do, how important it is and how if we don't do that well, we can't move quickly for our users. So that's how we do it.\n\n(00:57:09):\nBy the way, I don't want to come across here and sound like we've got it all figured out. Of course all of this is always entirely influx. We're always anxious to figure out how we can make it go better. For instance, in recent years we realize that we could get a lot of benefit from what we call chaos testing. That's like injecting errors and making sure that the systems respond in such a way that it doesn't cause any impact on users. So it's constantly evolving and we really enjoy learning from other companies and learning from our users as well. But it's something we care about and think very rigorously and systematically alone.\n\nLenny (00:57:40):\nDid you say that it takes only 45 minutes from pushing code to it going into production?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:57:45):\nTypically yes. So that battery of tests that I described, that gets run on every change, that gets run in parallel to when you send it for review by another human. So it's run once, typically takes about 15 minutes and then once the changes merged into our code base, we run that same test suite one more time. So another 15 minutes then typically takes about 30 minutes for the systems to automatically deployed in production. That's how we run and think about establishing that tight feedback loop with users, that means you can get feedback from a user in the morning, you can figure out how to address it and you can actually put something back in their hands by the end of the day. And that loop running inside of 24 hours I think is pretty important.\n\nLenny (00:58:26):\nThat's incredible. I remember times that Airbnb where took hours for tests to finish because there's a lot of them and they fix that over time. But I'm used to more on that scale.\n\nDavid Singleton (00:58:37):\nIt takes constant effort to hold. Those numbers by the way are important. Those are about the right numbers I think for a company operating our kind of scale. Of course as you add more stuff, you add more tests. So we've had to work on, we had to invent mechanisms to make it run more in parallel, we now have a thing called selective test execution where we figure out for not the battery that runs before it goes into production that we run everything and just run it in more machines to make it parallelize. But for the changes or the tests that we run for individual changes, we actually have systems that figure out, well which tests are the ones that might be material for this particular thing? And that's been a real source of innovation. In fact, our distributed change and test environment at Stripe is the biggest distributed system that we actually run. And so running that requires just as much energy and effort and rigor and craft as everything else.\n\nLenny (00:59:29):\nWhat are some of the things you've done that have had the most impact on developer productivity?\n\nDavid Singleton (00:59:34):\nWe've touched on a couple of these already. That auto deploy mechanism definitely had a very significant individual impact. So before we introduced that, sometime within the last five years each deployed to production required an engineer to actually babysit it, to watch it as it, make sure all the charts look good. And it was a bit of kind of game of roulette because you always wish that your change would get bundled in with someone else's so that they were paying attention to it for you. So literally being able to be fingers on keyboard on something else while your change is going live and it's going to automatically monitored, that was a big improvement in our productivity. Also, very small things. This is just like optimizing checkout, very small changes really compounded in a big way. So for instance, by eight months ago we made it possible, we use a tool for code review.\n\n(01:00:24):\nIt's quite popular, it's GitHub enterprise, but we've built a bunch of our own experiences and controls around that and we have a little tick box that you can tick on your pool request. That's what you call an individual change that an engineer produces that is auto merge, which means once the reviewer says this is good, I don't need to come back and look at it again, the system should just take over and that just cuts out one whole kind of human distraction step and that laddered up to a big change in productivity as well. So these very small changes can if you're deliberate with them, ladder up to a big impact.\n\nLenny (01:00:55):\nI'm going to go in a different direction now. AI very hot right now. Has AI impacted the way you all build product yet? And if not, where do you think it starts to go in the next few years?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:01:06):\nYeah, we're very excited about AI. Now to just take one step back, Stripe has been using machine learning and advanced machine learning techniques at the heart of our products since the very early days. Radar is our solutions for payment fraud and it has used, I mean this is the very core of our products and has used machine learning since we introduced it. We also, if you think about the nature of Stripe, we operate in an environment where we have to do a lot of work to kind of catch bad actors in the system, fraudsters or fraudulent businesses. So we've been employing a lot of machine learning techniques there again for years and we couldn't operate the company without them. So the difference between ML and AI, I think when we think about AI today we're mostly talking about the applications of large language models, but those are really based on this new technology called Transformers.\n\n(01:01:55):\nIt was a paper that came out of Google a while back about four years ago, five years ago. And we put transformer technology into those systems at some point more than a year ago. And it's proved to have a very profound impact on our ability to solve those problems for our users, which is great. But we are also excited about the applications of large language models. I mean there's really two dimensions to this. Number one, we feel privileged to be able to help serve and power a lot of businesses getting started in this space. One big difference between AI startups and others is it's actually quite expensive to operate an AI startup in terms of the compute resources. Like running this stuff in these GPU machines is quite expensive. So typically these companies need to have a monetization model from day one. And I'm really excited to say most of the AI on these is running on Stripe and we're working very hard to make sure we serve all their needs.\n\n(01:02:51):\nOpen AI, for instance, using us for monetizing chat GPT plus and all their other products. But they don't just stop there. We're actually helping power all of their subscriptions and revenue tracking and financial operations around the business. And the point about that is we've been putting very large engineering teams on this stuff for years and that means anyone who wants to build a reconciliation product and a subscriptions business model, if you want to do that yourself, you have to put big engineering teams on them. But if you can use Stripe instead, you can actually focus those really precious engineering resources on keeping up with the rate of breakneck innovation in this space. So we're excited about that, but we're also really excited about the applications of these AI techniques on our own ability to serve our users better. And so for instance, at sessions we'll be talking about a few of these.\n\n(01:03:44):\nWe started working with OpenAI when they had the beta. It was a kind of private beta of GPT four available at the beginning of this year. The first thing we thought of was we've got a lot of documentation on Stripe and we put a lot of care attention into making it good. But if you want to achieve something with your Stripe integration, you're typically going to spend quite a lot of time reading docs and kind of synthesizing them as an end user. We realized we can have GPT four read all of our docs, store them as embeddings and then answer questions for developers. And so we now have that available in kind of early stage release inside of our documentation. It's turning out to be pretty valuable. We've also been able to apply these techniques to other areas of our products. So something that we're going to show an early version of IT sessions is we have a really powerful product as part of our revenue and financial automation suite, which we call Sigma.\n\n(01:04:36):\nIt allows you to write sequel queries across all of your Stripe data so you can interrogate your Stripe data to understand your business and really fine grain detail. Which country has the fastest growing sales, which segment in which country has particular attributes to it? Very powerful product, but it's one that is potentially challenging for non-developers to adopt. You do have to know how to write sequel queries unless you just use the ones in the menu in order to get the full value out of the product. Well it turns out with large language models, we can apply this technology where you can ask questions in natural language and our engine will actually write the sequel query for you. And we've had to do a lot of work to kind of tune that to make sure that it's reliable and understandable and it's going really well. And we also see great applications in actually applying these technologies to make us more efficient internally, answer users questions faster, help each other out more quickly. And so we're doing those things as well. One concrete thing that we did, which I'm pretty excited about is not long after we saw chat GPT come out, we realized it would be really awesome if we could apply that to many use cases inside of Stripe. But as you can imagine, a lot of the data that we are dealing with on a daily basis is very sensitive to our business, to our users and we care a lot and we have a lot of governance around this, but we wanted to make that technology bill. We couldn't say, Hey Stripes, go and use chat GPT. So we stood up an integration to GPT four and an internal UI to use models like that. But here's the thing that I want to kind of relate to all of your viewers. We find that we built presets into that.\n\n(01:06:12):\nSo when you work with large language models, you want to write a prompt that then helps get the model into a state where it's going to be able to solve the particular problem at hand. And we find that writing prompts is something that's accessible to folks across lots of different job families, not just engineers. Folks in our marketing team, folks in our user support team have been able to use this as well. But you can put a lot of care and attention to getting a prompt that works really well and we not make it possible for those to be shared across the company. So I can grab the preset to help me write a blog post with the right kind of tone and I find it extremely valuable in helping me and many other people across the company. So I think there's a lot of innovation in high companies serve their users and operate is possible right now and we are working hard to employ all of that on behalf of our users.\n\nLenny (01:07:03):\nWhat about as engineers? Are pro co-pilot, is there some along those lines that you find useful weary of? How do you think about that?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:07:12):\nWe're excited about co-pilot. We've made co-pilot available to our engineers internally. We ran a fairly rigorous trial to make sure that we felt good about its actual impact on our ability to write code and the code it was actually generating and find that it was very effective for us. Both in productivity but also just in helping our engineers feel like they could direct their energy towards some of the bigger problems. How should this stuff fit together rather than some of the micro problems. So because we had such great feedback on that, we've made it available very broadly internally and we'll be very excited to see where that space develops over time.\n\nLenny (01:07:56):\nDo you have a sense of the productivity gain that say imagine you have a lot of 10X engineers, the gains that an amazing engineer gets out of a co-pilot versus a newer engineer?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:08:07):\nIt's honestly too early to tell because we've only recently made it available at scale. What we're typically seeing is that the kind of tasks that it accelerates are, remember I mentioned how much energy we put into having comprehensive test suites. It's actually using co-pilot to generate your test cases, turns out to be extremely valuable. There's a reasonable amount of boiler plate that is kind of like repeated code and concepts that goes into writing good tests. But you also have to reason very carefully about is this actually testing is exactly what I want? So co-pilot takes a lot of that boiler plate generation out of the way. So you're actually thinking about the stuff that really matters. And I think that is going to have a profound impact on quality of code that we write as well. But it's a little too early to say, because we literally just folded out what kind of actual measurable impact is having.\n\nLenny (01:08:54):\nI was talking to an engineer and he's just like, I like the active writing code and it makes me sad that this is doing this for me. So he turns it off.\n\nLenny (01:09:00):\nThis is doing this for me, so he turns it off. I think over time people will be like, \"Eh, that's true. I never really enjoyed this part of it.\"\n\nDavid Singleton (01:09:07):\nYeah, I'll speak from personal experience. I love writing code. I really love writing code. It's pretty much what I do for fun. I also love writing code with Copilot, because as I said, it means that I can focus on the parts that really matter. I think that's been a fairly consistent experience across Stripe as well.\n\nLenny (01:09:24):\nAwesome. You run a massive engineering team. I don't know if you shared the numbers of engineers, but I know there are many. What are, and this is a broad question, just what are some lessons you've learned about managing people and/or managing engineers, whichever direction you want to go?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:09:41):\nWow, big question. There are so many different directions we could take that. I'll share a few observations. They don't necessarily all have a particular theme to them. I think as I've been responsible for bigger and bigger teams over time, one of the things that just I repeatedly learn is I personally will not be involved in really any of the decisions that matter and happen. There are thousands of decisions that an organization of any skill is making every single day, every individual engineer or PM is making hundreds of small decisions and some big ones every day that affect the kind of general trajectory.\n\n(01:10:17):\nThe most important thing is to really focus on hiring the right people, and that means hiring people that you can trust with a tremendous amount of autonomy. If I try to get involved in lots of decisions, everything will grind to a halt. How do you do that? It is important, obviously, to be rigorous. We've described already what our hiring process is. I really lean into getting to know folks in very, very well as we're hiring them. By the way, something I didn't mention earlier that is I think important here is we pay a lot of attention at Stripe during the hiring process to references.\n\n(01:10:49):\nThis is typically later in the process, but if you put someone through an interview process, you've probably spent what, eight hours total with them? If you talk to people that actually have worked with them before, you're probably benefiting from thousands of hours of direct experience. We take this very seriously, and we try to ask smart questions that will help get real signal out of that. I certainly find when it comes to hiring folks that have then gone on to really make a transformative impact, that references are often the time that you get the best conviction on the hire or not.\n\n(01:11:22):\nHire the right people, and then you have to trust them. Now, trust is interesting. Is actually quite challenging to trust people that you've just hired, right? Well, you've got no stake really on you yet. What I find is you do actually just have to be generous in giving trust and assuming trust by default at the beginning. Then you do need to hold people accountable enough that they are proving that they can handle that trust. Sometimes, that means hiring someone who you think quite plausibly can end up in a very big role into a smaller role to begin with. Other times, you just have the big role that you need to fill, in which case, it's important to be quite conscious about really trusting and delegating to them with a lot of support.\n\n(01:12:02):\nI'm always working hard to delegate sometimes a little bit more than I'm comfortable with, because that's the only way to really operate at significant scale. I think something else, and sorry, this is really a smorgasboard is what a lot of differences.\n\nLenny (01:12:17):\nPerfect.\n\nDavid Singleton (01:12:18):\nSomething else I've realized as the organizations I work with and been responsible for have grown is that you have to be extremely conscious about managing your own time. There are hundreds or thousands of people who, quite legitimately, might want to get some time with you. If you just let the places that you spend your time and energy be controlled by the stuff that comes into your inbox, or the stuff that gets put on your calendar, that's going to be random. It's quite likely that that's not laddering up to the biggest impact. I personally have been running a loop for, I don't know, maybe 10 years, where on Sunday evenings, and usually, well, it usually starts on Sunday afternoons, I read a lot of what happened last week.\n\n(01:12:59):\nThen on Sunday evenings, I actually write a list for myself of, you asked me a question at this podcast, which is like, what would be great success for this podcast from your perspective?\n\n(01:13:08):\nI basically think about that for my week every Sunday night. I make a list of if we got these things done this week, that is a good week, but obviously, we need to be dynamic. Things will surprise you through the week. Honestly, then, that drives a lot of just where I decide to spend my time. I try to encourage everyone to think that way throughout the organization. I think it does ladder up to more impact over time. I think the final thing I'll say here is I mentioned how important operating principles are to the culture. I think for any manager and any leaders, that includes ICPMs as well, but for any manager, any leader, how you show up really does set the culture that is around you.\n\n(01:13:50):\nI try very hard to show up very consistently every day, even though there will very frequently be things that are going wrong and are bad and are hard. It's actually very important to show up quite consistently. Certainly, in line with all the values that we have and the culture that we want to set, in order to really kind of model that at scale. Different days, that can be easier and harder. The final thing is, I think it's quite important to manage your own energy.\n\n(01:14:17):\nThere are some tasks that I do that are maybe not the most important thing, but I know that I get a lot of joy and energy from them, and then that carries over into the other stuff that also needs to get done.\n\nLenny (01:14:30):\nJust two more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. One is just I feel like Stripe is incredibly good at planning and organizing, prioritizing. I know every inside, it's always not as beautiful as it may seem on the outside, but what have you learned? What has Stripe learned about planning and prioritizing that you think other companies might be missing?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:14:50):\nYeah. Well it's funny you say that. I would say planning inside of Stripe does not get the highest net promoter score that you might imagine. I do think it is actually quite effective. By the way, the reason I think that planning, the way we do planning at Stripe doesn't always get the best internal rep is we have grown very rapidly. That means that almost every time we come back around to planning, we actually, and this is kind of a theme at Stripe, we think about a lot of the ways that we work internally from First principles.\n\n(01:15:19):\nWe will tend not to by default just pick a system off of the shelf that some other company has run or that we've used before. We'll think hard, considering what we are doing for our users. How should we do this? When we're thinking even first principles, we'll often go out and talk to a lot of other companies, and try to learn from their experience. It's actually something I've really appreciated and enjoyed at Stripe. A lot of the learning I've done here has come not only from folks that are at the company, but also talking to a bunch of folks that we have the privilege to work closely with because their business is building on Stripe, or they're a similar stage of scale to us.\n\n(01:15:56):\nA good example of this is Amazon. Amazon is a Stripe user. Because we work with them, in my first couple of weeks at Stripe, I was actually able to meet with Charlie Bell, who then ran operations at Stripe. A lot of the things that, sorry, who then ran operations at Amazon. A lot of the things that we actually now do at Stripe have come from learning from that experience. It wasn't just, oh yeah, we'll take this thing cause Amazon did it, talk to him. Lots of other companies hard to learn. The point is we care about learning from others and then we apply it.\n\n(01:16:21):\nBringing this back to planning, because we tend to think a lot from first principles and we've been growing rapidly. The right planning process for us as a company has actually changed quite dramatically and quite significantly over the years. We do planning in a relatively deep way once a year, and then in a slightly lighter way halfway through the year. If you imagine doing someone once a year and you're growing rapidly, you're going to want to revisit exactly how you do it. I think for anyone who has the privilege of running the same planning process again and again, you can really iterate it and tune it. We've had to make more deliberate and more sweeping changes as we've gone along. There are a couple things at the core of how we do this. One is it's really important to focus on who are the users that we are seeking to serve for any given product area that we're working in? Kind of holding their needs front and center in your plans is important. Again, at Stripe, we do something that is, it's not unconventional, but it's not the most common practice in the industry, which is we work very hard to serve companies from the very, very small. The folks that are literally just starting their company on Stripe, with Stripe Atlas, all the way up to multinational, 10 Fortune five companies, fortune one companies, I guess.\n\n(01:17:39):\nThere's a very different set of user needs across those businesses. For any given area, it's very important for each team to be clear about who are they serving. Then we run a kind of inverted W process. We typically have teams surface what their immediate thoughts are on the most important things to do. We'll then have a group of product leaders get together and try to synthesize the most important parts of that into a kind of draft overall company strategy, and then take that back down to teams to figure out, \"Well, if that's where we're making a big push, should that tweak my plans at all?\"\n\n(01:18:13):\nWe bring it back up for synthesis, and then back down for everyone to really distribute with a lot of context within their orgs. We find that at our current scale, very, very effective.\n\nLenny (01:18:24):\nI haven't mentioned this yet, but I actually, Stripe for my newsletter, I check the app many times a day, so I'm probably in the Fortune 1 million, somewhere in that.\n\nDavid Singleton (01:18:32):\nDo you have any feedback? Genuinely, I'd love to hear your Stripe feedback.\n\nLenny (01:18:36):\nIt's great. The app tells me that I'm ...\n\nDavid Singleton (01:18:36):\nNo, no, don't tell us it's great. What bugs you?\n\nLenny (01:18:40):\nWell, it's interesting for churn, for cohort retention, which I care a lot about for the newsletter, I actually use a different tool that feels like gives me better, a table of per cohort, how many people are still around? There's an opportunity to have better cohort retention metrics.\n\nDavid Singleton (01:18:57):\nCool. Okay. Well, maybe we can email about that. Quite genuinely at Stripe, anytime we talk to a Stripe user, we are always looking for feedback that goes for any occasion. We often bring users into the beginning of our Friday fireside I already mentioned, and we're always asking them for their feedback and we really, really want to act on it.\n\nLenny (01:19:15):\nWell, I wish I had more. It's works great. Final question, Stripe Session's coming up, it's going to happen before this comes out. What should folks be watching for? What's next for Stripe?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:19:26):\nWe've touched on a few of the things that we're sharing broadly for the first time at Stripe Sessions on this call already. Per our development process, these have been in the hands of some Stripe users for a significant amount of time and we've really kind of crafted them with them. I'm super excited about a number of the things that we're going to be talking about next week. One is I've mentioned our revenue and financial automation suite.\n\n(01:19:48):\nWe've really been crafting the features there for some time, and really nice example actually of how building closely with users really, really helps build things at scale. We've a set of features that we work with companies like Atlassian and CloudFlare to enable their businesses on Stripe Billing. They have relatively complex models. For instance, you might sign a deal where it has a discount in the first year, and then there's another product that's being used in the second year, and then something else happens in the third year. You can now model all of that in Stripe Billing, and we're going to be showing how you can do that in the dashboard at Stripe Sessions next week.\n\n(01:20:23):\nIt's now going into general availability for all Stripe users. It's giving all of our users from the very small to the very large, the same power that the world's best SAS platform might have. Excited about that. It's also the case that we didn't talk about it in this call, Stripe Connect is our product for platforms of marketplaces. If I may actually just take one second, it's a really good example of how focusing on the needs of our users in one area took us into a really valuable space to solve for many users in other areas.\n\n(01:20:55):\nThe ideas behind Stripe Connect came from working with companies like Lyft and Shopify. In the very early days, they were using Stripe for pay-ins, but we realized, \"Oh, these companies are operating these multi-sided marketplaces, and there's a ton of heavy lifting you have to do to make that work really well.\" We have to have a bunch of regulatory licenses in place, but also there's a lot that you need to do to actually make the money move and kind of account for it in the right way. Connect is our product for platforms and marketplaces.\n\n(01:21:18):\nOne of the things that we've done over the course of the last year or so is actually taken a lot of the features that we've built in the Stripe Dashboard to help folks manage things like gathering the right documents from their users, or handling refunds and so forth. We've actually made them available as embed-able UI components that are also completely customizable, which these platforms can take and put inside their own dashboards so they can present a lot of the power that Stripe is enabling to their customers, without having to do a ton of engineering work themselves.\n\n(01:21:53):\nLook, generating engineering leverage for our customers is just very frequently the main thing that we can do to help their businesses. We're going to show a bunch of that stuff next week, which I'm excited about. Then finally, we touched on it already, but it'll be great to show some of the innovation we've had around AI and large language models. Again, I think it's going to make a big impact over the coming years.\n\nLenny (01:22:10):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:22:17):\nMost means that you have to integrate under the curve, so I'd say High Output Management by Andy Grove is definitely the book that I've recommended the most. It was a book that really opened my eyes to how to get the most out of teams over the whole course of my career. Definitely check that out if you haven't read it already. Recently, we talked about being meticulous in our craft. I've really enjoyed Build by Tony Fidel. Tony worked on the iPod, and then the iPhone, and then was the founder of Nest.\n\n(01:22:47):\nHe puts a tremendous amount of thought into his users and how to build really great crafted experiences. I had the privilege of working with him very briefly at Google, but I thought the book was excellent in terms of helping provide some practical pointers there. Then I would be remiss if I did not mention Claire Hughes Johnson's book, Skilling People. Even though it only just came out, I've recommended it a lot. There's actually some stuff in here where I'm sharing some techniques that we've used at Stripe, so you might enjoy that. Then if I may share one ...\n\nLenny (01:22:47):\nHere's my copy.\n\nDavid Singleton (01:23:17):\nYou've got it too.\n\nLenny (01:23:17):\n... it supports ...\n\nDavid Singleton (01:23:18):\nAmazing.\n\nLenny (01:23:18):\n... Supports my laptop on here, and ...\n\nDavid Singleton (01:23:21):\nI hope you've read it.\n\nLenny (01:23:22):\nI've had her on the podcast. I've read, I've skimmed it as much as I can.\n\nDavid Singleton (01:23:22):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:23:26):\nI'm not building a business right now. She was in the top 10 bestseller list on the Wall Street Journal, I saw.\n\nDavid Singleton (01:23:31):\nThat's right, that's right. It has a ton of very practical advice, so I recommend that one a lot.\n\nLenny (01:23:36):\nWhat's a ,favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:23:39):\nOkay, I'm going to cheat here because I'm going to interpret that as what's the best video content you've seen recently?\n\nLenny (01:23:44):\nSure.\n\nDavid Singleton (01:23:45):\nI have fallen in love with YouTube for learning about the really fast moving AI space. It has been remarkably valuable, and Andre Carpassi has a bunch of really good seminars, but not just that. Across the whole spectrum, I think there's just so much gold on YouTube if you want to learn a new skill these days.\n\nLenny (01:24:06):\nIs that the channel you recommend, Andre Carpassi's channel?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:24:09):\nHis channel is awesome if you want to learn about AI.\n\nLenny (01:24:12):\nHe's the ex-Tesla AI?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:24:15):\nThat's right. I believe recently, gone to OpenAI, but was doing this kind of on his own for a few months and has produced a bunch of great YouTube content.\n\nLenny (01:24:23):\nGreat pick. Most people pick White Lotus or something like that and you go with a AI YouTube channel. I love it. What's a favorite interview question you like to ask?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:24:32):\nOkay, well, actually, you will find some recommended interview questions from me in this book. One I really like actually, because it sounds like a softball and then it's not, is I often ask people, especially for leadership hiring, which leader that they've worked with they admire most and why. It sounds like a softball, but it actually tells you a lot about what this person really cares about in leadership.\n\n(01:24:55):\nSometimes, I'll follow up and ask, \"How does that manifest in your own leadership style?\" Then, and this I think is really quite telling, I always ask folks, I'm going to spoil my interview question, I'm revealing it in your podcast, but I always ask folks, \"Okay, so imagine you were their manager. Tell me the performance review or the development feedback you'd give them to help them be more effective.\" I think everyone always has things that they could improve, certainly myself included.\n\n(01:25:22):\nFolks' ability to think critically about someone that they kind of admire or lionize, and how they could actually be more effective, I find quite telling.\n\nLenny (01:25:30):\nWhat are some favorite products you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:25:33):\nThe products that I have recently discovered and definitely love is Mid-Journey, also building the business side of their business on Stripe. For folks who don't know, Mid-Journey is an AI tool for generating images using stable diffusion, but it's really pretty awesome. I've been using it a lot with my daughter. We'll come up with stories and we'll generate beautiful looking images with Mid-Journey, and then she'll drop them into books and she'll write the pros. The reason I think it's pretty cool is I was very surprised and skeptical at its UI to begin with, because its UI is Discord.\n\n(01:26:07):\nThey drop you into Discord and you are in a channel where you have to prompt the artificial intelligence. I find it very confusing at the beginning. It's like, this is not the right interface for this tool, but actually, it's very smart because you learn from other people on Discord, how they're prompting the AI in order to get the kind of results that they're looking for. I find that made it possible for me to get a lot more power and value out of the tool. I definitely subscribe to Mid-Journey and have had a lot of fun playing with it.\n\nLenny (01:26:36):\nWhat's your favorite image that you've created, if there's one that comes to mind?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:26:39):\nWe made a cover for a book that my daughter is writing. My daughter is nine years old by the way, so we're talking here, good children's stories. She made an image of a wolf wearing a purple velvet cloak, sitting in front of a campfire with a shack in a forest and a nebula behind. It's beautiful. We actually built that with by combining two images, the wolf and the shack. Actually getting the wolf out of one image and putting it onto the other, we used the new Apple image segmentation copy and paste thing, which worked great. It's also fun combining these AI tools, but that one has been pretty good.\n\nLenny (01:27:17):\nWhat a world. Two final questions. What's something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a tremendous impact on your ability to execute as a team?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:27:27):\nWe talked a bit or about this already, auto deploys and that auto merge feature, but probably the most profound thing is we put a little button in every single developer tool at Stripe. It is an emoji of an octopus that is crying. If you click it, it makes it possible to just type in what's gone wrong. Then we have our developer productivity team read all of those and use them to prioritize what they're up to. Just like frictionless problem recording turned out to be really valuable. We call those paper cuts.\n\nLenny (01:27:56):\nCrying octopus. I love that.\n\nDavid Singleton (01:27:58):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:27:59):\nWho else from Stripe or Former Stripe should I have on the podcast is my final lightning round question?\n\nDavid Singleton (01:28:05):\nI see how this works.\n\nLenny (01:28:08):\nThis isn't how this works.\n\nDavid Singleton (01:28:09):\nTwo Stripes I think you should have on. Emily Sands is our chief economist and leads our information org. I think includes data science, but also the teams that build all of our, a lot of our internal tools. I think Emily just has great frameworks for thinking about how to translate what's really going on for users into great sets of metrics that you can then use to get the right action happening. As I described before, that's super important.\n\n(01:28:31):\nThe second person would be Michelle Boo. Michelle joins Stripe as an engineer in the very, very early days, and has been with us for obviously a long time. She's really our principal product design architect in terms of the actual abstractions that we use to model our users' businesses on Stripe. I think she has very deep insight into how to think about getting those things right. I think you would enjoy talking.\n\nLenny (01:28:55):\nDavid, I so appreciate you making time for this, especially during this hectic period ahead of sessions. Two final questions.

You're director at eBay and PayPal. You're on the board of Intuit. You've been the CEO of Ancestry now for the past three and a half years. This is a career path that a lot of people dream of.\n\nDeb Liu (00:00:11):\nSome of the best PMs I have ever worked with are terrible PMs for their career. They just drift from job to job. \"Hey, should I take this role or this role? How do I think about this?\" But if I said you had to write a spec for your career, what does success look like? How are you going to get there?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):\nYou wrote this awesome post about introverts and how hard it is to be successful as an introvert.\n\nDeb Liu (00:00:28):\nThe workplace is really favoring people who can speak up. It looks like self-promotion. I wouldn't want to do that because it's self-promotion. But instead, what if I called it educating about all the great work your team has been doing? Helping people see why your team should get more resources, you have to actually share what you do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):\nIs there something that you believe that you think most other people don't believe?\n\nDeb Liu (00:00:49):\nThe most important career decision you make is who you marry. Is this person lifting you up or pushing you back? You will have a much more successful career if your home life is in balance. It's like a yin and a yang.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):\nToday, my guest is Deb Liu. Deb was VP of product at Facebook where she spent over 11 years and while they're created and led Facebook marketplace, which is now used by over 1 billion people monthly, she also led the development of Facebook's first mobile ad product for apps and its mobile ad network. Also built the company's games business and payments platform, including Facebook Pay.\n\n(00:01:23):\nPrior to Facebook, she was director at both PayPal and eBay. She's on the board of Intuit and for the past three and a half years, she's been the CEO of Ancestry. I actually generally have a rule of no CEOs on this podcast, but to me, Deb is a great exception because she's a product person at heart. In our conversation, Deb shares a ton of tactical career advice, including why resilience is so key to career success, how to PM your career like you PM your product, how to be successful in business as an introvert, what she's learned about building multiple billion dollars zero to one businesses within a large company like Facebook and so much more.\n\n(00:01:59):\nDeb is so full of wisdom and I'm really excited to share her insights with more people.

With that, I bring you Deb Liu.\n\n(00:02:18):\nDeb, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nDeb Liu (00:02:21):\nIt's wonderful to be here, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:23):\nIt's wonderful to have you here. You have had such an incredible career. You're VP of product at Facebook. You're director at eBay and PayPal. You're on the board of Intuit. You've been the CEO of Ancestry now for the past three and a half years. This is a career path that a lot of people dream of and honestly just like one of those roles is a dream for a lot of people. And so I wanted to start with just this question and I want to see where the conversation takes us. If you could give one specific piece of advice to someone that's looking to do well in their career or to do better in their career based on what has worked well for you, what would that be?\n\nDeb Liu (00:03:02):\nAlways be learning, and I tell this to everybody, so I often tell people, someone who's always learning is always going to exceed someone who's the expert today. You're going to find people... The one thing about school is that we go to school and there's such a thing as getting a hundred on the test, a perfect score on the SAT, graduating with a 4.0. Well, there's nothing like that in careers, right? We think it's actually a non-linear experience and there's always something better than you at speaking or presenting or strategy or execution. But if you're always learning, learning from the best, getting feedback, you're always going to get better every single day.\n\n(00:03:35):\nAnd that's what I have always held, which is each job I took, I didn't necessarily qualify for it. I wasn't necessarily the very best at it, and so it became the student of being better at that job. And once I mastered that, I was a student for something else, something else and something else. And so I always balanced learning and impact, which was you can have the most impact, the job you know the best, but then you stop learning. And if you're learning all the time, you're not necessarily having impact.\n\n(00:04:00):\nSo how do you keep going back and forth and back and forth so that you're not going straight up a lot or you're actually laddering back and forth into different things where you're having an amazing time where you know everything and then you're the newbie again and learning new things, and you're incorporating what you used to know into what you're learning and the impact that you have today and so on and so forth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:21):\nThis episode is brought to you by Pendo, the only all-in-one product experience platform for any type of application.

If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired warrant, the Fine Grained Authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube.\n\n(00:06:31):\nThis enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop in replacement for auth zero and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.\n\n(00:07:03):\nYou talked about you got into a new job maybe you weren't ready for and you had to learn on the job. So either maybe share story one of those experiences or just like how do you actually do this? So someone's listening, they're like, how do I learn? What am I learning?\n\nDeb Liu (00:07:14):\nWe'll start with my career in tech. So I had worked in consulting before business school. I went to Stanford for business school, came out to California, didn't know that much about tech, but I really loved using eBay. So I interned there my first year in business school and then when it came to finding a job, I really wasn't sure what we wanted to do, but we wanted to move back to the East Coast. And so I wasn't looking and I couldn't find a job. I think it was really hard. It was 2002. And so I ran into Tim Wenzel and Catherine Wu. So Catherine Wu was from Airbnb as you might know her. And Tim Wenzel put together the PayPal Mafia. He was the recruiter for PayPal.\n\n(00:07:51):\nWent to this table and I said, \"Absolutely love PayPal, use it all the time. I'm a big seller on eBay,\" and he's like, \"Do you want a job?\" I'm like, \"No, I'm actually going back east. \"And he's like, \"Just come in and talk to us.\" And so I said, \"Okay. Well, what kind of jobs do you have?\" And he's like, \"I have jobs in product and I have jobs in marketing.\" Now, I've taken marketing class obviously in business school, and I said, \"I wonder what this other product job is.\"\n\n(00:08:12):\nSo I look over at Catherine and I've seen her around Stanford before, so she was a year ahead of me and I said, \"Well, what do you do?\" She said, \"Product.\" I'm like, \"That sounds good. I'll do that.\" And that's actually how I fell into product management. Well, I actually, and I'm embarrassed to say faked my way through those interviews, because during the interviews they're like, \"Well, what would you build?\" And since I was an avid user of both products, I could really richly say, \"Here's the product feedback I have. Here are the new products you should build. Here's my feedback on things that we should be doing differently.\"\n\n(00:08:39):\nAnd they said, \"Congratulations.\" And they gave me the job. And embarrassingly I went to the first day of work and I said to Amy Clement, who was the VP of product at the time, and I said, \"Okay, I literally have no idea what this product job is.\"\n\n(00:08:54):\nShe showed me the ropes and she was so incredible. She actually showed me, she said, \"All those ideas you had, all that energy you've had around building these things, we go do that. Let's go do it.\" And I said, \"Well, how do you do that?\" And she said, \"Well, you write down what you want to build and you work with the engineers to do it.\" And I just remember thinking, \"This is crazy. I have no idea what I'm doing.\"\n\n(00:09:14):\nIt was such an incredible adventure though. Those first few years, I just learned so much about the craft of building, how to really think through product use cases, how to think through what customers wanted, not just the customer of one, myself, but really what true customers and customer cohorts wanted. And so it was really a time when I felt like I was really blossoming, but I didn't come in with mastery. I came with a curiosity and I think that's what made me a great product manager was that I didn't have a set way of doing things. There wasn't some playbook I was trying to play. There wasn't some framework, but instead I was willing to learn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):\nSo one takeaway might be from this, the phrase, fake it till you make it. Any thoughts on just how to... I imagine many people right now are like, \"Oh, I'm trying to get a job as a pm. How do I do this? That sounds great. I'm going to pass this interview, figure out the job after I joined.\"\n\nDeb Liu (00:10:02):\nComing in with humbleness was really important, but during the interview process, actually, I didn't realize this, but they asked me questions as if I was a product manager, as if I knew what I was doing. I think when you have passion around a product or passion around a company or around a business model or around something, it shows. And so it's not necessarily faking the enthusiasm or faking the idea that you want to work there, but you don't have to know how to write this spec or PRD or briefings or anything like that. You don't know how to do customer research or do data analytics or read reports, but instead show your passion around the product itself, around the use case, around the customer.\n\n(00:10:41):\nShow who you are and why you care. I think sometimes people just say, \"I want a product job.\" But you have to be able to fall in love with the problem. You have to fall in love, not with the product, but I said the problem, right? The use case. What problem are you trying to solve? And if you can do that, you can be a great product manager even without a lot of experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:00):\nThat's an awesome piece of advice. So just lean into the passion. First of all, part of it is you have to be excited about the thing you're trying to work on or thinking about the company you're thinking about joining. Sounds like that's a prerequisite here. We have a podcast episode with Uri Levine who has a whole book called Fall in Love with the Problem, which is all about that same idea actually for startup founders.\n\nDeb Liu (00:11:20):\nI'll have to read it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:20):\nYeah, he always wears a shirt, fall in love with the problem, not the solution.\n\nDeb Liu (00:11:23):\nYes, is absolutely the most important skill for a product leader.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:27):\nSomething else I've heard you talk about in terms of something that contributed to your success is being okay with failure and just bouncing back quickly versus avoiding failure. Is that something that you can come back to a lot?\n\nDeb Liu (00:11:40):\nWell, here's what I noticed about everybody. I've coached a ton of people in my life. I have managed big teens and the people who are most successful are not the people who had no failures, who were lived charm lives, head up into the right careers and got promoted every cycle. The people who were most successful were the ones who actually through adversity, learned to turn stumbling blocks into stepping stones. They were the ones who got hard feedback and then came back stronger because now they learned what to do differently.\n\n(00:12:09):\nThey were the ones who products failed, but they said, \"You know what? I'm going to turn this failure into success. I'm going to take those lessons and make this company stronger.\" When you live a charmed product life, you always work on everything that's easy. You don't actually... Trees are strong because they bend in the wind, because they're tested, because it's cold, because it's windy, because there's conditions.\n\n(00:12:31):\nAnd that's how a tree goes grow strong and tall over many generations. And I think sometimes we think, \"Oh yeah, I wish I lived a charm life.\" And that is not what we want. You want to have enough adversity that you learn to overcome so that you can build stronger over time and build resilience in your career.\n\n(00:12:50):\nI've seen that so much, which is the best product leaders I ever worked with are the ones that have the toughest stories, that had the hardest feedback, but also the ones who were able to bounce back quickly and make it happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:02):\nWe have a segment on this podcast called Failure Corner where people share a failure they went through kind of along the same lines and something we learned from that experience. Is there an example of that from your career where a failure made you stronger?\n\nDeb Liu (00:13:13):\nYeah. I remember there was a job that I really wanted at Facebook and I'd been there for a long time. I had been leading different teams. I was a VP of product and then GM. There was one job that I never got to do, so I got to do all the jobs I wanted and Mark gave it to someone else. I told him at the time when he gave it to the first person who was amazing at it, I said, \"If this job were open, I'd like to be considered for it.\"\n\n(00:13:37):\nThe job opened up later, gave it to someone else. And I said to Mark, again, \"I really wanted that job.\" And he said, \"Not only will I not give you that job, you'll never have that job at this company.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:49):\nWhat?\n\nDeb Liu (00:13:51):\nHe didn't say it harshly. But he was giving me feedback about something which he did not see me in that role, in a role that I really wanted. And I had to decide each time like, \"What do I do with this information?\" This is my dream job. Actually, I decided I was going to turn the job I had and the job I wanted, and that's a choice. I could have said, you know what? I can't have that job. I could go do something else, but I didn't. I took the job I had with the team I had and I turned it into this thing that was going to be something we wanted.\n\n(00:14:20):\nAnd so I think sometimes it's not... I think that that experience was a very humbling experience because to be told no and then to say that this will never happen was really hard. But at the same time it was a reminder that you're not right for every job even if you think you are. And that you can take the raw materials of what you have and turn it into what you want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:40):\nAre you able to share what those jobs were that you wanted to get that you never got?\n\nDeb Liu (00:14:44):\nI never actually shared it publicly, but it's something which I had always had a role where I did new things for the company and there was a role where it was running something which more of an existing business, but I had always been kind of the innovator, the new stuff person. I had taken over so many new things. And so maybe that wasn't the right thing at the right time for me, but it was something that was really incredible and a turning point for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):\nGreat segue to an area I wanted to spend some time on which is building zero to one stuff within a larger company. So from what I can tell you built 2 billion businesses within a large company, Facebook marketplace, and then the ads platform within Facebook and maybe more. I don't know, the payments stuff, the games. I don't know. Maybe there's billions of dollars there I don't even know about. And this is very rare and very hard, and it's something we talk a little bit on this podcast, just the skills to build something new.\n\n(00:15:38):\nI know with marketplace it was not something people believed in for a long time. It took a lot of work to convince people to actually give it a shot. So I guess the question here is just what have you found are key tactics to start something new and allow it to continue to exist and get to a place where people start to believe it? What has worked for you?\n\nDeb Liu (00:15:57):\nSo first, I didn't build the ads platform. I actually built the first direct response ad product company ever had. But we'll talk about how that led to why direct response is a vast majority of the ads revenue for the company. But one thing that it was really interesting is that I really saw my opportunity in Facebook to be somebody that zigged when other people zagged. There were amazing people who did a lot of the really core products working on feed, photos, videos.\n\n(00:16:25):\nI came in actually on the payments team and we worked on payments and eventually built games, which was the first billion dollar business. It was very successful. We worked with the likes of all the game companies that were on the Canvas games platform. And it was just an incredible opportunity to start from scratch and built something really cool. We built Facebook credits, which eventually became the Facebook payment system.\n\n(00:16:47):\nAnd then from there on I built the first direct response ads product. And again, leveraging the skills that we had, we had a lot of relationships with game companies because of my time and payments. And so we just said, \"Hey look, what ad product do you want?\" And they said, \"Actually, your biggest challenge is the shift to mobile. Build us a mobile acquisition engine.\" And we said, \"That's doable.\"\n\n(00:17:09):\nAt the time the company was very brand oriented. Most of the ads... Actually almost all the ads on the platform were brand and we were not even on the ads team. So we actually worked on this team called the platform team. We said, \"Okay, we'll build an ads product for the Facebook feed, the new mobile Facebook feed.\" And suddenly it became a billion dollar business within about 18 months, which was such an incredible journey.\n\n(00:17:30):\nWe worked on the mobile advertising platform, so basically the mobile ads network. That was a great experience. And so each time I worked on something, it was just... The thing that you have to remember is the failure rate for something like this is very high. You start something and the amount of iteration... People think, \"Oh yeah, it's easy.\" You start something and it's linear because you have all the resources of this company behind you. But actually everything in the company is like, \"Let's do the most important thing.\"\n\n(00:17:58):\nThese are seeds and we'll just let them... And so if you do that, you have to know that you don't get a lot of resources, you get a lot of attention. And I appreciated that because I think I work best when people aren't... There is not a lot of scrutiny. I think sometimes large companies, they say, \"Well this innovation team,\" and then they check in on them way too much. They're like, \"Week to week progress, where are you going? What's your strategy?\" But so much as you know of building something new is the iteration process. It's the failing a lot.\n\n(00:18:27):\nWe actually tested five or six versions of the ads product before we got it to take off and it took months, and then we were on the verge of death multiple times. In fact, I actually went back to run the payments team while I was working on that product because the team we had gathered still want to continue working on it, but I needed a second job back on the payments team because they asked me, \"We don't think this thing is going to work. You should go run your old team again.\" And I thought, \"Well, I will do both.\"\n\n(00:18:52):\nAnd so I did both for a while until it really took off. The thing that I think a lot of large companies don't realize is that you can love something to death. And so with every new product, I'd rather do it out of the limelight, do it with the minimal resources and have the freedom to fail because success and failure really is... In startups, failing fast is really important or succeeding fast.\n\n(00:19:18):\nIt's the long slog that makes it really hard. In a company, you end up getting cut if you're the long slog product. And so being able to just say, \"You know what? We're pruning this. We're doing the next thing, the next thing.\" And then having the time to iterate and grow is really critical.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):\nSo as a leader trying to do this and create space for this, is there something you've learned about how to allow for, \"Don't over scrutinize us, don't look at us too carefully. We don't want to be in the limelight. Don't put too many resources on this yet.\" Is it just like, \"Hey, Mark. Here's what I think.\" I imagine it's not as easy as that. There's a lot of influence and that kind of work. Is there any tactics that you could share to create this sort of environment?\n\nDeb Liu (00:19:59):\nI think the most important part of the environment is really patience. And again, this is a portfolio strategy and I tell every PM who... I used to do a new hire PM class and I say, \"Look, a lot of you are going to go into the core product and your job is to grow X by 3 to 5% every six months. Growing engagement or growing sessions or maybe growing video views or whatever your metric is, you're trying to grow something 5% and then you exceed expectations.\"\n\n(00:20:27):\nAnd I said, \"And then a bunch of you are like, 'I want to do something new. I want to build something from scratch.'\" And I said, \"By the way, a very, very successful company for a new set of products has a 50% hit rate. So half of you are going to come back in a year and have a different job because that did not work out. Do you have the resilience to do that?\" And I think somebody, you enter a large company... By the way, you can have an amazing career building core products because that is an incredible journey within... Because you learn so much about the mechanics of what that takes.\n\n(00:20:59):\nAnd yet at the same time, I found a lot of energy from doing something that someone hasn't done before. And so I really enjoyed the, \"Hey, this thing could fail. Let's pivot. Let's try to figure out. Let's prune this. Let's try that.\" And not everything I did there succeeded, but a lot of the things that are the lasting products are once that gotten really big. And so for me it was a greater reward and it made a journey so much more interesting.\n\n(00:21:24):\nBut for others, I think work on the core product, learn the skills. It is absolutely respectable as well. But if you choose to be the person who works on innovation new products, expect in a year, you might literally have nothing to show for it, but the lessons that you learned. And I think those lessons are really precious and we often underestimate that too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:42):\nAlong those lines, do you think it's a good career move to do a zero to one thing within a bigger company? Or is it often a bad idea? Do you have any advice there for folks?\n\nDeb Liu (00:21:52):\nIt depends. It depends on your personality in the company. So the one thing I realized about my role was that I did a lot of... I had five different careers at the company over 11 years. And so most people don't realize that when you work on new things, you're constantly adding to your portfolio, subtracting from it, growing things, pruning them. And so you could just work on so many cool things except everything has similar... It's like it rhymes, but it's not exactly the same.\n\n(00:22:19):\nSo you learn the lessons of how to get things done, how to get resource, how to get support when the product is not working, how to not get prunes in the next culling. And those are really, really important skills. But I think for people who are just starting out of the career, it is a very high risk thing to do. So if you're very early in the career, I encourage people just learn the core skills first. You can learn the core skills when there's a lot of stability. This product is growing X percent, like 5%, and you're going to grow at 10. That's amazing.\n\n(00:22:47):\nThat is because you are there, you're going to change your trajectory of the product, or this thing has a hundred thousand users, you're going to get it to 200,000. Those are the kinds of things that are going to be successful for you and you can put on your resume. But I think it reaches a point in your career where you have to decide, when am I going to take the big swing? Because the big swings are the things that you write your career stories about. They're not just, I moved this metric X, but I changed your trajectory in this way.\n\n(00:23:17):\nAnd so the big swings though have a lot of failures along the way. And so you have to understand you're making trade-offs in that. I encourage everybody to take some time, two, three years in their career when they're ready for the big swing, where if it doesn't work... If it works, you run the team, you run this amazing product. It doesn't work, you can always go back and go back to the core products.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:39):\nIt's interesting how your strategy here is very similar to a product portfolio strategy where as a team should have a few big bets and then a lot of incremental stuff. And it reminds me about this awesome post called You Are in Control of Your Career. And the argument in your post is you should PM your career the way you PM your product. So there's a lot of synergy here. So maybe just diving into this post and advice around this, how should someone be PMing their career, the way they PM a product? What's your take there?\n\nDeb Liu (00:24:05):\nBy the way, for your PM audience, I want to say this, which is a lot of the greatest PMs are the worst PMs of their careers. They love products. They love the crafts. They love the customer research, the data. They have plans, they have timelines. And then when it comes to career, they have none of those things. They just drift from job to job. \"Hey, should I take this role or this role? How do I think about this?\" But if I said you had to write a spec for your career, what's in there? What are your milestones? What are the skills? What are the features that you want to have of your career? How are you going to get there? What does success look like?\n\n(00:24:41):\nYou actually have metrics for your product, and yet you don't have metrics for your career. I coach a lot of people and when I coach them, I ask them, \"Well, where do you want to see yourself in five years? Where do you want to go?\" And half the people have no idea. I think that's really tragic because when you PM your career, it's about intentionality. But I'll tell you the story of my career and how I was the accidental PM and then eventually... I told you how I accidentally fell into PM, but also fell into so many of the things that happened in my PM career.\n\n(00:25:10):\nAnd if I had to go back, I would think much more deeply about what I want to accomplish. So I ended up at PayPal working for a guy named Dave Lee who reported to Amy Clement, and then he left. And so she offered me his role. I had only managed people for, I don't know, 15 seconds. I was two years out of business school and I was definitely not qualified to do his job. He was the director of product. I wasn't even a director and I was running the team for eBay.\n\n(00:25:34):\nSo basically the PayPal part of eBay, which was basically half the company's revenues and profits. Totally unqualified. I ended up in this job and I do a good job. I ended up doing it for several years. I built up the team and we have a great relationship with eBay. Our team was very close and we were able to actually build something really lasting that worked really well. And then I had a baby. And so this happens in a lot of women's careers. I was turning 30, I had my son, and I had to leave for six months.\n\n(00:26:08):\nSo I handed my product to my successor, Mike Woo and he ended up taking over. He did such a good job while I was gone, I didn't want to displace him when I got back. And so I thought, \"Well, I'll go and look for another role.\" I couldn't really find a product role I liked, I mean, because there weren't that many product director roles. And so I ended up in corporate strategy. So I worked for the amazing Rajiv who was CEO at the time. He since passed and I wrote his speeches, worked on strategies, I worked on digital goods and charity, and ended up building that into a vertical for the company. So charity, social commerce and digital goods.\n\n(00:26:40):\nAnd I thought, \"Okay, this is an interesting job.\" So I create the job, have a couple product managers, wasn't really sure where this was going, and then one day I was like, \"You know what? I'm not feeling this. I have a child at home.\" I had gotten into what Cheryl Sandberg calls that kind of between kids situation where I was bored of my job.\n\n(00:26:59):\nI was working one of the VPs I worked with and I resigned. I said, \"I'm leaving tech, just I'm going to stay home and maybe start something small.\" He convinced me to hold off and he said, I'll find you a job. He calls me a week later and he said, \"Found you a job with Stephanie Tilenius leading the buyer experience at eBay product.\" And I said, \"Oh, that sounds interesting.\" So I said, \"Sure, as you notice, I do not have a plan. I'm just drifting. I'm so fortunate that I had amazing mentors who gave me opportunities, but end up working for Greg Fant and Stephanie Tilenius at eBay for two years.\n\n(00:27:34):\nI led the buyer experience. We did some really good work there. And then went on maternity leave again. And I get a call from a friend, my old engineering manager from PayPal, \"Hey, I'm at Facebook. Do you want to come? You can't come into product. You need a CS degree for that, but we have a product marketing job open.\" I was like, \"Sounds good.\" Drop into Facebook. And so again, no idea what I'm doing back in product marketing. So I spent a few years doing that. Eventually was invited into product and so on and so forth.\n\n(00:28:02):\nAnd each job that came along was organic, but also kind of accidental. I see that happen in a lot of careers, which is my story when you look back, looks great. It looks like it all worked out, but I had almost zero intentionality in any of these. And I think that had I had more agency and I thought about what I wanted, I could actually measure is this the thing that would get me further or not?\n\n(00:28:24):\nI ended up extremely lucky, but not everybody does. And so I think having a plan allows you to compare every decision. It's not like when you're offered an admission to college, we're looking at three different offers maybe with financial aid or not, and you can make a decision, \"Oh, they're offering me this department, but I can't get into this department.\" This is how far it is from home. But jobs and roles or nothing like that. Someone calls you one day, \"Hey, I'm at Facebook. Do you want to come? I'm actually on maternity leave.\" And he's like, \"Just come talk to me.\" I'm like, \"Why not.\"\n\n(00:29:00):\nAnd you end up dropping into different parts of your life and I think sometimes by saying, \"Here's where I want to go and here's how I want to get there,\" you can have such a better career. And so I do encourage everybody to do this and to think about what does success look like in five years and how far am I from that and am I heading in the right direction?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:20):\nWhat's interesting is I also had a similar path to you where I had zero plan or intention or goal and also just follow things and things worked out. I wonder how often that happens and I wonder if this idea of having intention and planning a roadmap is something you do if things aren't working out because maybe there's some good to not overthinking it and just following pull. I don't know.\n\nDeb Liu (00:29:45):\nWell, I think the problem is this with you and me, Lenny, is that hindsight bias is a problem. We made it because we weren't intentional in a lot of ways, but for how many people, is that true? For how many people who aren't... You don't have a plan and you get there. I always tell people, if you are sure what your destination is, that's definitely where you're going to end up. But if you actually aim in the right direction, you can shape your learnings, you can shape your roles you take, you can shape your skills towards the place that you want to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:16):\nWhen you talk about getting this offer from Facebook, usually those are like you have three days to decide.\n\nDeb Liu (00:30:21):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:22):\nAnd it feels like that's when the things you've done ahead of time of here's what I want would be most helpful.\n\nDeb Liu (00:30:29):\nAlso, I think the thing about job opportunities in particular is they tend to come serially. It's only you presented these offers. It's like one role is so different from another and they often don't happen at the same time. They might say, \"Well, you have to decide in two weeks.\" And then you say, \"Well, there's this other company I'm talking to and you get a lot of pressure to say yes to this versus this.\"\n\n(00:30:49):\nAnd to really having a measuring stick is this getting me closer or further away from where I go? Can allow you to actually take serial decision making to a place where you're measuring against a long-term goal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:01):\nI did a meditation retreat once and when you're meditating, there's this kind of guidance of don't try too hard, don't push yourself to go into a direction, \"Oh, I'm not doing a good job. I need to get to this enlightened state.\" And instead their advice is just push your cart in a direction and think about that's the direction you want head, but you don't need to grasp on to here's where I need to land, here's where I need to go. And I wonder if just having a thought of here's where I want my career to go. I want to be on boards in the future. I want to start a company in the future. I want to become a designer in the future. At least start there maybe just like a direction that you're heading.\n\nDeb Liu (00:31:40):\nYeah. There's a woman who I worked with in product and now she's the founder, very successful founder, and she said to me, \"I want to join the board of this Fortune 100 company.\" She told me the company, and I said, \"Okay, that's a lot.\" So she said, \"How can I get there?\" And I said, \"First, it's probably going to take you 10 years because look at who's on the board. I happen to know a couple people on the board.\" And I said, \"Why don't I introduce you to one of them? And they can tell you how to get there.\n\n(00:32:04):\nBut the point is she knew where she wanted to go and she said, \"I'm willing to take it first step today.\" And I said, \"First, you've never been on a board. You were very successful, but this is not... There's so many steps before you get there. It's like before you go to Harvard, you have to graduate from elementary school to middle school. You have to take the SAT, you have to apply. I said, \"Let's start from the first step and let's break this problem down.\"\n\n(00:32:29):\nBut I love that she knew where she wanted to go and she's like, \"Even if I don't make it there, I'll be happier having made this journey.\" And I love that for her. And I think she's still earlier in her career, she has so much time ahead of her, but it's really incredible to see her kind of on this path and to know that that's her dream, and that I can help her a little bit along the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:48):\nIt also relates very much to your idea of thinking of your career like a PM thinks about their product where one of the tactics is to imagine the ideal scenario and work backwards from that versus incrementally what's the next thing? What's the next thing? So in this case, she was thinking, \"Here's where I want to head. Okay, what's the next thing to get to that direction?\" I love that.\n\n(00:33:07):\nThis episode is brought to you by Webflow. We're all friends here, so let's be real for a second. We all know that your website shouldn't be a static asset. It should be a dynamic part of your strategy that drives conversions.

Learn how teams like Dropbox, IDEO, and Orangetheory trust Webflow to achieve their most ambitious goals today at webflow.com.\n\n(00:33:53):\nOkay, going a slightly different direction, I'd say the post that you've written that has most resonated with me was about introverts and how hard it is to be successful as an introvert, and that basically have to learn to be an extrovert as an introvert because in business extroverts are most valued. Can you just talk about of your insight, what you've seen around this and how and your advice to introverts like me about how to be successful in business, what you need to change?\n\nDeb Liu (00:34:22):\nWell, first, I love the book, Quiet by Susan Cain. She talks about the power of introverts. Unfortunately, the world doesn't see the way the world the way she does. I wrote this post. It was the secret bias no one talks about, which is the workplace is really favoring people who can speak up. And I tell the story of somebody on my team who's just an amazing product manager, and yet every time she came up for promotion or calibration, people were like, \"Oh, what does she do?\" And it was because she was not good at broadcasting or explaining what she does.\n\n(00:34:54):\nI would take her to executive meetings and she was really bad at answering questions or talking. And so we would prep and prep and prep. I just knew her skills and I could see her every day moving the product forward. But for some reason people... Because your peers also have influence over people's ratings and their promotions, and I was constantly just trying to figure out how to get them to see her brilliance. I asked her once, I said, \"I noticed that you never answer questions when we do these presentations.\" She's like, \"Yeah, because I'm a processor. And by the time I process, I feel like the conversation has moved on.\"\n\n(00:35:28):\nAnd so I really feel like the world, it's not built for somebody like her who's a brilliant product leader, but people couldn't see it. And I realized that so much of what products and just general leadership is, is not just doing the work, but actually... It's not just having the product, it's having great product marketing to go with it. Let's call it that. Okay, so I've been in product and I've been product marketing. You make a light bulb, but you're selling light.\n\n(00:35:53):\nI really think about how that she was making amazing number of light bulbs. She was lighting up all the houses, but she was not marketing the light. And I think that was the thing that was really missing. Is that fair? Absolutely not. There are a lot of people who are born introverted. Is it fair that a product manager who isn't introverted, isn't extroverted is struggling with that? No, but that's the world we live in. And so it's one of those things where you get to choose what you do.\n\n(00:36:21):\nFirst, I think for the individual is realizing that you are your own best marketer. You have to actually share what you do. If a great product is out in the world, but no one is told about it, did it exist? And so one of the things that's very important is really to get that product marketing.\n\n(00:36:39):\nThe second part is we should change our workplaces so everyone can be successful. And I think that that's a really important skill. As more introverts get into leadership, they need to actually change the world to make more space for people like them as well. So one of the things that I found was in my leadership teams over the last several years, we had this thing where we all vote, but we vote offline in a document and we put a number in and then we put our comments in.\n\n(00:37:05):\nAnd that way everyone has an equal voice in this document. And then when we talk about it, usually, of course the extroverts speak first, but everyone has a vote and we can actually see what people's point of views are. And I love that. I love that when there's something we used to do at Facebook is we used to go around in a circle and everybody would give their opinion in a meeting. I do that still today. I ask every single person as a business leader at this company, would you do this?\n\n(00:37:30):\nAnd even I joke with our chief legal officer, Greg, I say, \"You are a business leader and the lawyer. You can't just say, well, legal advises X.\" I'm like, \"But what would you do?\" And so nobody can take a backseat to decision making. Everybody has a voice. So there's so many of these kind of bias interrupters, things that we can do to actually make the world easier for those who weren't speaking up and taking 80% of the air in the room. And I do think that we have to craft a workplace where everyone can be their best.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:59):\nIn the post, you also talk about as much as we want to change the way people run their companies and think. I love your advice of you also still have to learn how to speak up and act more extroverted even though it's not natural to you. Is that right?\n\nDeb Liu (00:38:14):\nI think we do a disservice when we say we're not good at speaking up because it's a skill like any other. And if I told you the difference between your product being successful and not being successful is you giving this presentation, they're going to kill your product if you don't sell this to the executives. You would figure out a way to stand in front of those executives and defend the freaking heck out of your product. But why aren't you doing that every day?\n\n(00:38:35):\nAnd I think sometimes we forget that not everything is as essential as they're going to cut your product if you can't convince them to keep it. But every day you're actually building credibility for your team, getting more resources, getting more people to talk about your product inside your company, getting more press for the product outside. All of those things combined into momentum for your product. And don't you want the best thing for your product and your customers?\n\n(00:38:58):\nSo if you think about it that way, it's not, well, I'm uncomfortable. I hear this a lot where people say, \"Well, you wouldn't understand. I'm an introvert.\" And I'm like, \"So was I.\" But instead I just said, \"Okay, this is a necessary skill and it's a learnable skill. You don't have to be comfortable with it. You don't have to love it, but you just have to do it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:19):\nWhat about from another perspective of why people don't do this, which is it feels like self-promotion and it feels like icky like, \"I'm just sitting around promoting myself. I don't want to be doing that.\" Anything there that helps people get over that piece?\n\nDeb Liu (00:39:31):\nWell, I just remember I was talking to this ERG group and I was asking about... There was an upcoming calibration and self reviews were due in a couple of days. And I said, \"Well, what are you doing for your self-review?\" And somebody raised their hand and said, \"Well, I'm really bad at self-promotion. What advice would you have for me?\" And I said, \"If you think your self-review is self-promotion, you're just not going to do a great job at it.\"\n\n(00:39:56):\nWhat if I called it educating your manager about all the great work your team has been doing? What if I called it helping people see why your team should get more resources? Suddenly you're cracking open, you're changing the question right from, \"Oh, I was self-promoting to actually I'm helping my team get more resources and support.\" And suddenly she was like, \"Oh yeah, I never thought about it that way.\"\n\n(00:40:22):\nBut I think often if you frame it one way, it looks like self-promotion. I wouldn't want to do that because of self-promotion. But at the same time, if it's education, what if I said, \"I was talking to a PM who's really incredible. I've mentored him and sponsored him for a long time.\" And I said, \"I don't understand why you don't have more of a voice. You've learned so much about the craft. You've done this at multiple companies.\" And he said exactly what you said which is I'm not really self-promoting.\n\n(00:40:46):\nAnd I said, \"If you see it as self-promoting, you will never do it.\" And so let's talk about why you don't actually do this. And he said, \"I've seen a lot of people who are really great on LinkedIn write these articles, but they have nothing to back it up.\" And I don't want to be like them. And I said, \"Okay. Well, you read my blog, you follow me on LinkedIn, do you think I have nothing to black back it up?\" And he's like, \"No, of course not.\"\n\n(00:41:07):\nAnd I said, \"Well, then why do you put yourself in his category instead of mine?\" And I think it was just a moment where we just came to an understanding where he in his mind was like, \"I don't want to be that person. It's an empty vessel that has no substance behind it.\" And I said, \"Do you think the things I write have no substance?\" But it was an interesting conversation because he had taken this mantle that it was self-promotion and that behind what if people think I'm nothing behind it?\"\n\n(00:41:32):\nI'm like, \"I know you have something behind this. I have been your manager. I have worked with you for many years, but you see how just reframing it has really changed his way of thinking about it.\" Still working on him. But I actually think he has so much to give and I think he has learned so much about the craft, and I wish that more product managers feel comfortable that they have something to give to the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:53):\nI think what you're saying right now will resonate with a lot of people when they see people posting. I feel the still of just like, \"I don't want to be this guy that's just posting nonsense on LinkedIn just to get likes,\" even though it's kind of what I do now full time. Hopefully it's not nonsense.\n\nDeb Liu (00:42:08):\nBut it is all substance. So, Lenny, we know the substance behind it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):\nI tried, but I think there's posting on LinkedIn, posting on Twitter. There's like an innate just doing this because I want to get attention when often... And the way I started this is just like things I've learned that I think are useful, I'm just going to put them out there. So just to double click a little bit, I think this is a really powerful point. What actually have you found helps people get over that? Is it someone like you and his corner being like, \"You have really great stuff to share, you should actually do it. Don't be as worried as you are, as you think you might be.\" Is there anything else that works there?\n\nDeb Liu (00:42:41):\nActually what worked for me was I was working with Bos and I talk about our relationship in my book, but we made a contract when I started reporting to him. And Bos, for those of you don't know, is currently the CTO of Meta. At the time he was the head of ads and then our team moved into his team. And so I was reorged into his organization. And as I said we did not have the best relationship before that. And so we made a contract to work together and I had written like, \"Here's how I want you to take care of my team. Here's how I want you to support our products.\" And I wrote them this long, my part of the commitment.\n\n(00:43:13):\nThen he wrote back, \"Here's what I'm asking of you. I want you to write and publish something every month.\" I was like, \"What are you talking about? Why would you say that?\" He said, \"You have so much to teach people. Just do it.\" I said, \"I don't really have that much to say.\" And he's like, \"Just trust me on this. You'll figure it out.\" His advice was write what you repeat. If you say something more than once, just write it down. And then the next time someone asks you, you can just hand them.\n\n(00:43:40):\nHe has a great blog if you have read it. I just normally thinking that is a weird thing for your new manager to say after you had a lot of conflict together before that. But he took my contract, which was... By the way, he's like, \"Oh, do you want to codify this in some way?\" I'm like, \"No, I just...\" But every month from then on, I would literally just write something and it was my promise to him. And I did it faithfully and I published it internally. So I didn't publish it externally for a long time.\n\n(00:44:04):\nAnd then sometimes they would ask me if I want to publish it externally for the company and I would say yes. And so I did it for years. I reported to him for years. And then we switched managers. He moved over to Reality Labs and then I had a new manager and I continued and I continued this. Then I started doing a publicly, and then obviously I wrote a book. Because of him and his encouragement, it got me to a totally different place. And part of it was just the commitment. I now had accountability because I knew he was watching. I'm not actually sure if he was actually watching every month. But I felt the accountability to do this and I've done it every single month since.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:37):\nSo it's interesting that that's another example of your manager giving you the space slash forcing you to share publicly being a really good lever to get someone over this fear.\n\nDeb Liu (00:44:48):\nI think sometimes just doing it gets you over the hump. For example, my friend, Ami Vora. She writes an incredible blog. You have not read her Substack, you should. But she's an incredible writer. She'd write all these things internally and I said, \"You should publish this externally.\" Now she does that and it's really great. And I think part of it was just seeing her just put it out there because she is one of the wisest career coaches that I have and managers that I have ever worked with. And so I'm like, \"You have so much to say and to share.\"\n\n(00:45:16):\nSo to see it out there, I feel like for years we all got the benefit of it because we knew her. But the world was not getting the benefit. So in some ways just having accountability. So we created a little accountability group to help each other write, and it was just a reminder, \"Hey, did you do it?\" And so I think it's sometimes what's necessary to get over that hump is either having someone forcing you, like your manager who you made a commitment to, or just having a friend to say, \"Hey, by the way, where's this month's post?\"\n\n(00:45:41):\nThose things matter because now you got over the hump of, \"I have to do it.\" And now it's just about how good you're going to make it and how much time you're going to put into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):\nAwesome advice. And by the way, folks don't know we've had both Bos and Ami on the podcast in the past.\n\nDeb Liu (00:45:55):\nAren't they both amazing?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:56):\nAmazing. And Ami's episode is one of the most popular episodes. More popular than Bos, CTO of Meta.\n\nDeb Liu (00:45:56):\nI know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:56):\nWho would've thought?\n\nDeb Liu (00:46:06):\nShe has a lot of coaching wisdom I think that everyone should hear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:08):\nYeah, she's amazing. She has a great Substack. We'll link to it again in the show notes. We'll link to your Substack as well.\n\nDeb Liu (00:46:13):\nYeah, please do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:15):\nGo Substack. I want to move in a slightly different direction. Talk about growth for a little bit. You have a really nice perspective on how to think about growth. I think a lot of people think of growth as like, \"Here's a magic bullet. We're going to do this thing. It's going to go, \"Wow, we're going to win.\" And your approach is, you talk about it, it's a game of inches. Growth is a game of inches. Can you talk about your perspective there?\n\nDeb Liu (00:46:34):\nYeah. Sometimes we think it's like what is the huge step function? But actually most companies are like... We call it points of growth, right? It's like if you can move things 1% a little bit faster every single week, think about the amount of growth you get at the end. And so it's not just, \"Okay, what's going to get you the 3X? You can get to 3X 1% at a time, 5% at a time. Single digit growth. And sometimes it is the small things that matter the most. And so we think about product-led growth, it's really about finding the aha moments, the opportunities. And sometimes opportunities are things that seem really silly.\n\n(00:47:10):\nI heard the story at Facebook that one of the big things was just adding the, next to ads, they put the word create an ad, was one of the biggest growth drivers. And that was it just putting a link because people just didn't know how to get to the ads flow. It was things like that where you can actually bend the curve of choices that you make. Same thing, each of the growth teams I've ever worked on, it's like really the small things adding up. It is a list we used to work on payments growth and we had a list of a hundred things we were working on hypotheses.\n\n(00:47:42):\nAnd then we would pick and we would grow them by picking the first 10 and we would start working on them, the next 10, the next 10, and we would go through these sprint cycles. And the same thing when we were growing the ads product as well. Marketplace, each of them were just like, \"What are the small things that add up to big things?\" And I think sometimes we overthink it.\n\n(00:48:00):\nInstead, you probably have a hundred ideas. And by the way, it is absolutely okay if the 80% of them don't work. I tell people sometimes we overthink as product manager if we just had the perfect plan, the perfect battle plan, but instead imagine you're a team and you can ship, I don't know, let's say four things. But what if you're a team that can ship 20 things with the same with a 20% success. You get just as much output and yet you know what doesn't work also.\n\n(00:48:30):\nWhat if you can move it from 20% to 30%? Suddenly six things work, not just four things. And so in the same amount of time you have all the lessons of what didn't work, plus you're getting 50% more output. And so you thinking about growth as this engine of, it's a learning machine of what doesn't work, what you reiterate on, what you change, and you're constantly getting better and better and better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:50):\nI think what you're saying will resonate with a lot of product people where there's always this like, \"We're just doing a bunch of optimization, incremental work. Still sucks, boring. Let's take some big bets.\" And in my experience, and sounds like in your experience, a lot of the wins actually... And Facebook is famous for this, just relentlessly looking for ways to grow, optimize, optimize, optimize because that's where a lot of growth comes from.\n\n(00:49:14):\nAt the same time, obviously you need to take some big bets and take some swings and look for step function changes. But I guess for someone that's just like... I don't know. Is there any advice on just creating that culture of like, \"It's okay to optimize for a long time, there's a lot of opportunity optimizing\"? Is there anything you've learned there or is it just bringing in a Deb and it has to be a top down?\n\nDeb Liu (00:49:32):\nI treat growth like, let's say, a product marketing team. It is an augmentation for a product that works. So if you have a core product that works, you have a team that's working on... So for us at Ancestry, it's like search and hints of the core. What is the mechanics? You want people to add people to their family tree. You want them to add stories, okay? There's teams that make sure that the uptime is good, that the hints are working, the search delivers results.\n\n(00:49:57):\nAnd you need those teams, you need those core teams kind of functioning. But growth is actually optimization on top. It is making it so that you get to the search flow faster. The hints are surfacing better, that people are accepting them, that if we put the button here versus here, that people are going to discover things faster. And so it's really taking the core engine and actually wrapping it around the user interface around the experience, around the flows so that people can get to it faster, they can have more satisfaction, they can have more impact. And that's what I see growth as. It's not the core product. It is the cherry on top, making that product more accessible and more usable and better every single day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):\nAlong these lines, I think it surprised people to learn. There's at least a hundred people at our Airbnb just working on pricing, optimizing pricing recommendations. There's endless opportunity to just make all these core components of an experience better and better and better over time. Okay. Last thing I want to talk about, and this is completely unrelated to everything we've been talking about mostly, which is your 30, 60, 90-day plan.\n\n(00:51:00):\nSo you wrote this post a while ago, just like, here's a great 30, 60, 90-day plan when you join a company. I've heard that many people use this. It's really effective for helping someone onboard and be successful. And I think it's mostly for execs or is this for just anyone joining a company?\n\nDeb Liu (00:51:16):\nIt's for anyone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:17):\nOkay, anyone.\n\nDeb Liu (00:51:18):\nI created, it's actually when I joined Ancestry because I hadn't started a real new job in 11 years. And I thought, I'm going to be a student of how to land well. So I read a bunch of things, I read and I decided I was going to adapt all of those things into a summary and then I was going to try it real time in my blog.\n\n(00:51:38):\nSo in my blog I write, \"Here's what I'm going to do,\" and then I tell you what I did and how it worked and some things. And then I actually do a look back as to all the mistakes I made. And so I did this live. It was not planned quite as well as I would thought, but I put it together and I wrote the 30, 60, 90-day plan and I have a template. I always tell people it's focused on listening and learning first and then doing. So that's the crux of it, which is in those 90-days it's like you got to get used to the environment. You want to have some impact at the start. You want to have a couple quick wins, but you want to understand the lay of the land and you want to listen because you have something to contribute.\n\n(00:52:19):\nBut if you don't understand the language, you don't understand the culture, you might actually make huge mistakes. And so for the first 30 days, I did a listening tour. I talked to over 60 people in 30 days and then I summarized a state of the union. Here's what I'm hearing, here are the challenges people feel like we're facing. Here's what people's wishlists are. And by the way, one person sent me a wishlist of five things and at that year, I think it took me till year two to finish his five things. And then I sent him a note. I said, \"By the way, the first time we met, these five things you wanted to see, we just finished the last one.\"\n\n(00:52:50):\nAnd he's like, \"I can't believe you remember.\" I took extensive notes and I summarized it. I think it's important because people want to hear that you hear them. And you don't have to be a manager or CEO to do that. I think people on teams often feel like there's no outlet for the things that they want to say. I encourage, especially product leaders, especially if you're joining an existing team, to listen really behind what people are saying and then offer to help them do one thing.\n\n(00:53:17):\nSo especially when you're meeting with a new engineering team for the first time, actually ask them, what is one thing I can do to help you this week? I always say one thing, it's limited. This week, so getting 15 new headcount. Probably not going to happen. And it's like, how can I give back? And suddenly you're building a reciprocal relationship. And so a lot of this 30, 60, 90-day plan is really to help you find your footing and then to start having impact immediately.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:43):\nSay you join a company and you're like, \"I'm going to do 30 days listening,\" and then your boss is like, \"No, we need to ship stuff. Get on it, ship this stuff.\" Is there any advice for trying to push back on that, create space for listening when there's deadlines, things aren't [inaudible 00:53:56]?\n\nDeb Liu (00:53:57):\nI encourage everybody to get on the same page on this 30, 60, 90-day plan with their manager. So actually don't just keep it to yourself. Share it with as many people as you can. So I think it's very important that everyone sees what you're trying to accomplish and what your output is going to be. Because if you don't know the output, is success there? The second part is with your manager say, \"Okay. I would like to carve 20% of my time listening and I'm happy to do this work 80% of the time.\" Therefore every morning from nine to 10, I want to talk to somebody in the organization.\n\n(00:54:28):\nJust make sure you say, \"I will do a better job and have more impact if I have this time to make sure that I'm not accidentally making mistake or I don't get a chance, I'm asking something of somebody, but I've never met them.\" And to really carve out space because it's really important. Once you're in it, people give you the new person card for maybe a month or two and then suddenly it's all the problems are your problems.\n\n(00:54:53):\nBut what if you don't know what the problems are? And so I always say diagnose before you treat. So make sure you understand so that you can help and deliver what your manager is actually expecting of you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:04):\nI'm looking at your template. So just to share the bucket. So first 30 days learning focus, second 30 days is aligning on vision for the future, and the last 30 days of the 90 days is executing, setting up, actually starting to get stuff done. Awesome. Anything else along these lines of this?\n\nDeb Liu (00:55:23):\nThe one thing about having a plan also is that you don't feel rushed to do something that you're not ready for because I do think sometimes you feel like you need to have impact. I always tell people, \"Do something small, give back in some ways that people see you making.\" But when you actually reflect, one of the biggest things I could do was actually reflect back to the organization, \"Here's what I heard from all of you. I'm listening, I hear this and here's what I want to do about it.\"\n\n(00:55:53):\nAnd then in aligning it's like, \"Do we agree this is a set of problems we want to tackle?\" And then an execution is like, \"Do we agree that this is how we want to move forward?\" And I think that is such an important part of building into a team. When you enter an organization, you're also entering a team and you're part of a dance that's going around. What role do you play? And people are dancing around you and if you actually make a mistake, you could trip other people up as well. So really finding your place in the dance is really important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:21):\nAnd as a PM, the way I always think about is people won't assume they should trust you. You're just this person that's coming in to tell them what to do and so much of your first month, two, three is building that trust with people so that they can actually feel comfortable listening to your guidance and not just like, \"Oh my god. This person is getting in my way.\"\n\nDeb Liu (00:56:40):\nAnd earning that trust, sometimes people really... You'd be really surprised, a lot of people feel like they're not heard and even just coming in and listening is a trust building exercise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):\nSuch a good point. As we wrap up our conversation, just a couple more questions here. So first is I want to take us to Contrarian Corner, which is a segment on this podcast. And my question is there something that you believe that you think most other people don't believe? Something that you think is a contrarian perspective?\n\nDeb Liu (00:57:10):\nI don't know if this is a contrarian perspective, but I go to speak in a lot of universities. So I speak at Stanford and I'm going to speak at Duke. And I always tell people, especially young people, the most important career decision you make is who you marry. And it's not something we think that much about, especially I started dating... I met my husband when I was 18, my first weekend in college. Started dating when I was 19. We had no idea what our life was going to be like and yet every single day like this week we had our board meeting, I was in Utah the whole week. I come home and he's taking care of everything.\n\n(00:57:43):\nYou will have a much more successful career if your home life is in balance. It's like a yin and a yang. If something is out of balance, it engulfs the other side. Both your job and your home life. And especially, we have three kids. Really balancing that is very hard over both of us having demanding careers. It's not something that's contrarian, but it's something which we don't think about at all when we make that decision. We think is this person fun to be with? Is this person somebody we see ourselves with? But my question is what is the impact of this relationship on your career?\n\n(00:58:14):\nIs this person lifting you up or pushing you back? Is this person someone who's going to be your greatest cheerleader or are they going to be the greatest weight on you? How do you think that that's going to manifest itself 20 years, 30 years from now? And I think it's just something I wish we thought about more and I encourage especially young people to think about that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:33):\nSuch a great point. What I want now is a guide for vetting these things when you're dating. Deb's guide to dating.\n\nDeb Liu (00:58:44):\nI need to write that. Although I've only really dated him, the one person, so maybe I am like the worst person to tell.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):\nBut it worked, so you're maybe the best person and now you look back.\n\nDeb Liu (00:58:49):\nThat's right. That's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:53):\nAnd here's the questions I asked that worked. That's so funny. Okay, so before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think might be helpful to share, something you might want to leave listeners with? Any other nuggets of wisdom or advice?\n\nDeb Liu (00:59:08):\nWell, there's one quote which I share, I thought about when you were speaking earlier, which is about people who are resilient, which is life... This is a quote from Chuck Swindoll, he's a Christian writer I used to read a lot and it was, \"Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.\" And I just looked him up recently and he actually published a book with that quote. He actually had that quote in a previous book from 20 years ago.\n\n(00:59:34):\nAnd I just think that's so important. You don't get to choose everything that happens in your life. So much is just, it just happens, but it's the people who choose a way forward to turn stumbling blocks and the stepping stones. As I said, \"Somebody who actually says, 'you know what? I didn't get the job that I wanted and I'm just going to figure out another path,' those are the people who have the most successful and satisfying careers.\" They're thinking when other people are zagging vice versa. And I think that there are the ones who are the most resilient and happy in the long term.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:06):\nIt's such a good circle back to one of your first pieces of advice of just most successful people are people that are resilient and don't avoid failure, but embrace it and find a way to turn that around. I think it's such an important point. It's so hard to do. I guess just, I don't know, just to follow this thread a little bit, is there anything that has helped you build that? Has that always been the way your mind worked? I imagine coaching helps this, helps people with this.\" Is there anything just like that?\n\nDeb Liu (01:00:29):\nCoaching is incredible for that. We joke it's work therapy, but really I think it's... For a long time I saw failure as this catastrophic thing. I was one of those kids who's like, \"You never got a B until...\" Then I got to college and I was like, \"Wow, this is harder than I thought.\" And so I got two B's in college and I'm like, \"I'm never doing that again.\" But I was that kid who always got the A, who got the great scores. I just thought that my life would end if I got a B which by the way is super unhealthy.\n\n(01:01:00):\nAnd looking back, I realized that work is not like that at all. And every time I got bad feedback I'm like, \"This is catastrophic.\" But if you look at feedback as an opportunity, then it's very different. It's like this is a gift. I would be crushed. Every time I get a review no matter what rating I got, I would read the things that people would say and I was like, \"Oh my gosh, I'm a terrible person.\" And I had to really rethink that. And I think coaching, leadership coaching has really helped me through that to say, \"No, how do you process this and how do you get to the other side?\"\n\n(01:01:33):\nAnd that has been so transformative for me is to have that outlet to actually talk through. No, no, no. What they're saying is not that you're a bad product person, it's that you need to do a better job communicating or connecting. And I really struggled with that. I was very transactional. I was not a connector. I was not warm. I really struggled with relationships. And a lot of the feedback I received for many years is this relationship issue. And it took me a long time to realize that people aren't saying this because I'm a bad person or that they hate me, but because they want to connect.\n\n(01:02:03):\nI was actually making it hard. And I think sometimes we take things so personally that it becomes kind of this thing. It is your white whale. It's like the thing you're chasing, but then what if you say, \"You know what, I don't need to do that. I don't need to chase that. Instead I need to figure out what's behind the feedback and what are they trying to say?\" And then actually change yourself over a long period of time towards that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:26):\nI had similar challenges where I had this pretty real imposter syndrome for a while when I started doing well. And a coach was the key for me to help me get over that and see that if I made a mistake. Things wouldn't crumble. And that it's very normal to make mistakes. Nobody will-\n\nDeb Liu (01:02:43):\nAnd by the way, I think perfectionism is a curse we place on ourselves. And it's a very dangerous thing, particularly for product leaders because product managers, you know things are going to go wrong. That's literally part of your job. And yet when we have perfectionism, it is a lack of trust in our ability to bounce back and our ability to actually adapt. But the more adaptable you are, the less you have to be perfect every single time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:09):\nJust to leave people with a tactical piece of advice, say they are like, \"Oh man, I need a coach,\" do you have any advice for how to find a coach? How to explore that route?\n\nDeb Liu (01:03:17):\nSo I actually wrote an article, because one of the things I struggle with coaching is very expensive often, and not every company provides it. My husband actually works at a coaching company called Sounding Board to make it more accessible. But one of the things I encourage people to do is there are other ways to get coaches. I'm in a lean-in group and we are just like, we support each other. I'm in a coaching circle in YPO, so that's a group of CEOs. And I'm in a number of these coaching circles, which give you an opportunity to learn from each other and to get pure coaching. And I think that's a great place to start, especially early in your career when you're seeing the same people making the same mistakes.\n\n(01:03:54):\nI think as you get more senior, having an individual coach helps because the situations are so much more unique. But I do think that having that outlet, having a place to say, \"Hey, is it me or is this situation not right? And how should I think through this?\" That's so incredibly important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:10):\nI'm listening to this book, or reading a book called Listen right now that a previous guest recommended. It's a parenting book and it's about just the power of listening and how much that solves many problems with your challenges or with your child. When your child is having a problem just listening to them. There's a lot of power. This came from a coach that was on the podcast recently. [inaudible 01:04:31]\n\nDeb Liu (01:04:30):\nSounds great. I'll definitely, I'll read it or listen to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:34):\nI know it's weird. I'm like reading, it's called Listen. He's like, \"This is the only parenting book you need really. It solves all the problems that we deal with.\" So anyway, that was an awesome final nugget that I'm glad we got there. With that though, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nDeb Liu (01:04:52):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:53):\nLet's do it. First question, what are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people?\n\nDeb Liu (01:04:59):\nSo I love the book from Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer. I speak in his class now that I read it way before that, it's called Power: Who Has It and Why. I love the book. He actually has the more practical one, 7 Rules of Power, which came out more recently. And so it's a book that reminds us that power is not accidental, that people often get it for different reasons and how you should think about the playing field.\n\n(01:05:23):\nAnother book is The Conversation, Dr. Livingston wrote that about race in America, and I just love that it's a very honest assessment of race in America. It's hard to have that conversation and I love that he uses a lot of facts and encourages people to open up and have conversations around it. And then the last one I would say is, well, Susan Cain's Quiet. I adore the book because I do have introverted kids. I myself am introverted and just to read the power of introverts as a reminder that we do have amazing people who don't communicate the same way.\n\n(01:05:59):\nI love that it's a tribute to the success of those. Even if our workplace is not adapted to it, I do think we need to adapt to it so that we can bring the best in everybody. But her book is a reminder that there's so much power even in silence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):\nThe first book you mentioned Jeffrey Pfeffer, he's been on the podcast. I think he may have mentioned you in our conversation or-\n\nDeb Liu (01:06:17):\nI love Professor Pfeffer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:19):\nThat was a fun conversation because I came into it very nervous for what his advice would be and then came up with it being like, \"This is great. This is-\"\n\nDeb Liu (01:06:28):\nHe is very wise,\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:29):\nHe's very wise and just very, \"I don't care what you think, I'm just going to tell you the reality of the world.\" Oh man. Okay. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nDeb Liu (01:06:41):\nOkay. I know this is a fandom thing, but I love Fallout. So I played the game Fallout 4 last year, and then the show came out and it was amazing. And I know that sounds so nerdy, but it was incredible. And I know that video game movie annotations tend to be terrible, but it was so great and having played the game it was even better. Is that super nerdy?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:06):\nNo, I watched Fallout. I don't know anything about the game, but the show itself was really fun. Just I had no idea what I was even getting into. So no. Acceptable nerdy level. I don't know if you can get too nerdy on this show. Next question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you just really like?\n\nDeb Liu (01:07:26):\nWell, so actually what's really interesting is I never got into Twitter. I just couldn't figure it out. Recently I really got into Threads and I didn't think I would. I was like, \"Well, just post some stuff on it,\" but really I just love... I could never figure out Twitter. You follow the wrong person and the whole thing, it's terrible. If somebody is posting too much or too little, but there's something about the Threads algorithm that's really worked. The first few months wasn't quite there, but I just feel like it's spot on and now I see the magic of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:59):\nThat's so interesting. I've seen some stats that it's bigger than X now slash Twitter and I wonder if that's true. I got to look that up, but I've seen more activity on Threads. So maybe I need to go back there. I spent some time around-\n\nDeb Liu (01:08:10):\nCheering from the sidelines that it's successful because I use it a lot now. And I guess I had never had a place for realtime news and it's not exactly meant to be newsy, but maybe it's just who I follow, but I love just seeing like, \"Here's five headlines you probably missed.\" And I was like, \"Oh.\" I know they're trying to downplay politics, but I just love that it feels like you get a glimpse of what's going on in the world in five minutes.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:35):\nOkay. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to, share with friends or family find useful in work or in life?\n\nDeb Liu (01:08:42):\nOoh, that's a good question. Well, actually, I would say that it's very similar to the Chuck Swindoll one about life. So we can use that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:52):\nGreat. That's what I imagined because you shared that one early on. And I imagine that was going to be your answer. Final question, you started Facebook Marketplace, you built it. Now, it has a billion users, more than that. What's the most interesting thing that you have bought or sold on Facebook Marketplace?\n\nDeb Liu (01:09:07):\nThe best thing I ever sold on there was I sold my minivan on it and in four days. I made my husband do it because I wanted him to test the product. We were selling our minivan and I'm like, \"Just try Facebook Marketplace.\" He's like, \"I don't know about this.\" And he's like, \"There's too many people contacting me. I needed it to stop.\" So it worked really well for us. I think I have bought so many things on there. It's actually sort of embarrassing.\n\n(01:09:30):\nRecently, my daughter wanted the same desk as I had for her new room and they no longer sell it at Costco. And I found it for half the price from a woman who was moving and she's like, \"Here,\" and I love it. So I bought probably way too many things on Facebook Marketplace actually. But it's a great thing. I actually use it as a great rental for kid stuff because you buy a kid's bike and then when they outgrow it, you sell it back.\n\n(01:09:56):\nAnd the rental fee is almost free and I don't have the store all of it. So I love every part of it. I still am an admin user and I send a lot of feedback back to that team still.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:06):\nThat's amazing. Deb, this was amazing. I'm so happy we made time for this. Thank you so much for coming on. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, maybe read about stuff you're doing? Where's your Substack and anything else people can check out?\n\nDeb Liu (01:10:18):\nYeah, so debliu.substack if you want to look. I post probably about once a week. I'm on LinkedIn, I'm on Threads, so please do find me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:27):\nAnd then the actual final question, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nDeb Liu (01:10:33):\nWell, I would just love to hear what you heard from today that resonated with you and what you're going to do with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:37):\nAnd how would they share that LinkedIn or at Threads?\n\nDeb Liu (01:10:41):\nI'm happy to read your comments or send it if you want to-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:41):\nThere we go.\n\nDeb Liu (01:10:43):\n... send it to me. If you've actually subscribed to my Substack, you can just reply to the first email and then I get it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:48):\nAwesome. But the easy way, as you said, are replying to YouTube comments. There we go. Get people to YouTube, click that subscribe button. Deb, thank you so much for being here and thank you.\n\nDeb Liu (01:10:59):\nThank you so much, Lenny. It's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:00):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
