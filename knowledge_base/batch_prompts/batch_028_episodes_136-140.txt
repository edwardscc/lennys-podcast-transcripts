Not to be morbid, but just again, most of us just aren't really tuned into an awareness that our lives will come to an end. We try to pretend like we're going to live forever and just not think about it. And the horror of it is that we succeed, right? We mostly manage to just go live our life and eat ice cream and go to work and go on vacation and do what we do. To me, an awareness and mindfulness that our lives will come to an end punctuates reality in a way that requires me to rethink my priorities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):\nToday my guest is J.M. Nickels. J.M. has been a product leader at Waymo, DoorDash and Uber. He's also an engineering manager at Groupon, and before that an equity trader at Getco. At Uber, he built and launched the very first version of Uber Pool and then went on to lead the team responsible for the infrastructure and algorithms powering the economic and logistics brain behind Uber's matching and pricing systems. At DoorDash, he was head of product for DoorDash platform. At Waymo, he led product for the commercialization of autonomous ride hailing and last mile delivery. And he recently returned to Uber to lead product for the mobility team.\n\n(00:01:30):\nThis conversation is a unique and beautiful mixture of hard skills, soft skills, tactics, and emotions. I won't give away too much about the conversation, but this is a powerful one. Tears are shed, stories are shared, and I'm confident you'll become a better leader and human having listened to J.M.'s insights and lessons.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:02:08):\nThank you, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I'm thrilled to be here. Really appreciate your dedication to helping product managers improve their craft and up-level. We've done a lot of great researches out there for that, and coaching and development, as I'm sure we'll get into, is a passion of mine as well, so we have a lot of shared interests there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:26):\nOh, I really appreciate that. I want to start with a phrase that came up again and again when I ask people what to talk to you about from your colleagues, and this phrase is conscious leadership. What is conscious leadership? What does this phrase mean?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:02:42):\nTo me, leadership is broadly defined as having influence in the world, and so by that definition, to me, everyone is a leader because we all have influence in some way. It's not about whether you're a manager or not, it's like I have influence on my kids or my partner or my community, or the world, the way I vote, the way I show up. So we all have influence. We're all co-creating influences of each other. So that's the leadership piece. The conscious piece then is becoming more aware, waking up. To me, it's like learning more about my interior world, what my background is, my biases. We all inherit certain belief systems from our parents or our church or our community, and a lot of times they kind of go unquestioned and then they end up in conflict. And so it's really just about becoming more aware and then taking responsibility for the influence that I have. So yeah, taking responsibility for my influence in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:42):\nAs you talk about this, something that came up and something that I thought about as I was preparing for this episode is this idea of soft leadership, the power of soft skills and just how important that is in success. Is there something there that comes up when I say that? Just the power of soft skills and the importance of those in being successful.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:03:59):\nYeah, it's, what was it? Theodore Roosevelt, speak softly and carry a big stick? Yeah, I think I've evolved in that department. I think when I was younger in my career, I thought it was really important that we got to show up to the meeting and have the right slides and be the loudest, rightest voice in the room, and that's the way to have influence. And there's certainly a place for having leadership in a meeting and presenting a point of view and helping guide the narrative, but to me, yeah, I would say I've evolved more towards sitting back. It's also as I've become a more senior leader, I'm aware that there are power dynamics there. There's imbalances where junior folks don't feel as comfortable speaking up or I say something's not a good idea and then, \"Well, I don't want to disagree with J.M.\"\n\n(00:04:45):\nSo it's like, back to being more aware of my influence in the world. I really try to spend more time being mindful of that and say, I want to hear from other people first. I want to create space and I don't need to win the argument in the meeting. There can be a follow-up. It's not like this is my last chance to say something, but that's also more true when you're more senior because when you're more junior, it's like, well, this is the one presentation I have with Dara for the next six months. I really got to nail it. And so the pressure is a little bit different. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:14):\nThis episode is brought to you by Pendo, the only all-in-one product experience platform for any type of application.

And I know you were there early and then you joined again. Was that ever like a, \"Is this a place for me?\" Did you ever go through that struggle or is it just, yeah, I don't know?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:07:55):\nYeah, yeah, I mean, I would say I have been fortunate to experience probably three Ubers at this point. We joke about Uber 1.0, the Travis era, and you hear a lot about in the media the kind of bad parts of that, but there were some really good parts too. I mean, I think there was a lot of... Like when I joined in 2014, there was this mission of making transportation as reliable as running water for anyone anywhere, which is bold, audacious, and maybe a little bit pretentious from a little bit of Silicon Valley edge, but you could feel the electricity in the air. There was this energy and excitement like we're doing something transformational, autonomy is coming, car ownership will change. And it just like, feel, like my vibration.\n\n(00:08:37):\nAnd then, yeah, the good parts of that era were, Travis was a very great visionary product leader, and we started ATG and Elevate and these future-forward things and the way he would conduct product reviews, I learned a lot. It was stressful at the time, but looking back, I was like, wow, I learned a lot. But yeah, I would say it was not a very conscious leadership sort of place. You're right, it was like many organizations that run on fear because you can do that, carrots and sticks do work. But actually that's kind of how I found this work is it was in 2015 and I was a very junior product manager at that point, in over my head in a fast-growing place. And in these weekly reviews with Travis as we were building out Uber Pool, and I had a six-month-old daughter, my firstborn, and we had just moved to San Francisco from Chicago. So my whole life was in flux and it was a very stressful place, and I was like, \"I think I'm going to snap. I don't think I can handle this.\"\n\n(00:09:31):\nAnd that's kind of what led me to start to explore this sort of inner work and meditation and sort of finding a way out of that. And that's what got me interested in bringing it to teams too, is because I remember I was in one meeting where we were working on this future pricing thing, which is rider pricing, driver pricing, incentives, and how we bring surge pricing and all that together. And it gets very, I'll go heavy, and we have all these PhDs in the room, some of the best minds in the world. We were able to hire people like Garrett van Ryzin, who was the foremost [inaudible 00:10:04] more person from Columbia and other people.\n\n(00:10:06):\nBut everyone's back to lizard brain, everyone's arguing. They're like, \"Well, no, I think we should do it this way. We should do it this way.\" And I was like, huh. As much as I enjoy the content of this, believe me, I'm an algo PM end to end, I love that stuff. But I was like, I don't think this conversation actually needs another PhD, or I'm not even PhD, but content expert. It's like what we need here is a way to shift again, back out of that fear, threat, righteousness sort of state into a more co-creative, collaborative, open-minded, curious, trusting sort of space. And that got me interested in pursuing more skills in coaching of individuals and teams.\n\n(00:10:49):\nBut yeah, to your Uber question, yeah, the Uber 1.0 was crazy. Uber 2.0 was kind of like, Travis is out, the board is feuding, is leaking to Mike Isaac, whatever. And then Dara comes in and the peacemaker and then tries to stabilize, but the IPO is rocky. And so now I would say we're in Uber 3.0, which it's full pirate ship to navy, in Reid Hoffman's words, a profitable company. We're printing free cashflow, we're in the S&P 500, we've established the independent contractor model in a lot of states and jurisdictions, and it's like there's less risk of that model changing.\n\n(00:11:28):\nAnd yeah, I would say we're in an era now of Cambrian explosion of different types of transportation. The company really just built the UberX model and scaled it out to the world. That's primarily how we got here. And now it's like we're going out for all these different new sort of modalities, whether it's reserving a ride in advance or shared rides or renting a car or buses, and then different supply types too. It's not just contracted, we have a lot of fleets in the platform, we now have a lot of taxi drivers in the platform. You've seen we've signed deals with Waymo and Cruise and other autonomist players. So I feel like we're now at the beginning of another era of Uber and transportation, that the next decade or two, it's going to be super exciting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:12):\nOne quick tangent, UberX, a previous guest shared that the name UberX came from... it was just like the internal code name, UberX, we'll figure out a real name later, and then it stuck and no one had a better name. Is that true?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:12:23):\nYeah, that's right. I think that's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:24):\nAmazing.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:12:26):\nWhen I joined, we were already scaling UberX rapidly. I joined in early 2014. That's amazing. But I did help name Uber Pool, Uber Pool, which I selflessly like to bring back. It got renamed to Share during my external APM rotation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:42):\nOkay. I want to come back to the thread that I pushed us off of, which is you talked about, you made this really interesting point about emotions, and this is something I've been learning myself recently with having a kid and also a couple of previous guests. So you say that when you have... so you're in this meeting, you're stressed, there's a lizard brain kicking in. Something's like, \"Oh, Dara's going to think I suck and it's going to really screw my career if I mess up this presentation.\" Your advice there is very counterintuitive, I think for a lot of people, which is accept that emotion. Because when I feel stressed and nervous in a meeting, I'm not, \"Embrace the nervousness, let it out.\" It's more I'm just like, \"No, it's fine. Going to be okay. Don't worry about it.\" Talk about why that is actually more effective.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:13:28):\nYeah, yeah. It's like my daughter the other day had some nightmares and she was like, \"Dad, how do I stop thinking thoughts about the nightmare or whatever?\" And I said, \"You can't. Don't try to stop the thought. Just allow it. Let me show you why that doesn't work.\" I said, \"Don't think of a pink elephant. What did you just think of?\" And she's like, \"A pink elephant.\" And then now she thinks it's hilarious and she tells her sister, \"Don't think of a pink elephant.\"\n\n(00:13:55):\nBut yeah, I think you're right. It is a little counterintuitive, but one of my first coaches actually had a great phrase, what you resist will persist and what you fear will appear. And so in my experience, this is another reason why becoming more aware of my internal world has been so important. I have more agency than I realized on the outcome of my experience. And so when I think a thought like, Dara might think I suck and then I have a thought that I suck, that can become a self-enforcing negative feedback loop where I have a thought that creates stress, anxiety, fear, and then that triggers more thoughts and we call it cognitive emotive loop where you're kind of in this cycle of thinking stressful thoughts and then having unpleasant, anxious, fearful feelings. And so one way to break that is to just allow it and not try to fight it with other thoughts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):\nSo the advice is very tactically, so you're in a meeting with Dara, you're stressed about something. Just allow it, let it be. Don't try to pretend like it's not there or don't try to convince yourself-\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:15:00):\nWell, that would be the first step, is just to allow whatever's here, thoughts and emotions are rising. They come, they go, they're transient. It's not permanent. There's a lot of wisdom I think in the Buddhist lineage around those concepts. And then the next piece for me, once I can take a breath and relax a little bit, is coming home to the fact that I... and this is a little more radical for some people, I don't actually need Dara to approve of me in my presentation in order to be okay. What I'm up to over here is trying to force self-worth and self-love from within. And so we talk about approval, control and security. It's very easy to look for that from the world. Do you approve of me? And if not, can I control outcomes to get approval or get security and get the job, the bank account, the house, whatever it is?\n\n(00:15:52):\nBut what I kind of woke up to at one point was that as long as I was going out there looking for all that stuff to try to complete something inside of me that was missing, it's like I was a hungry ghost. It's like, it doesn't matter how many Michelin star meals and promotions and money and title and whatever. It's like it's never enough. It's like you kind of enjoy it for a little bit and then you get back to like, hm, you know? So it's like a never ending sugar addiction. And so that's the next step for me is allow it. Yes, allow the emotion, allow the thought. Come home to, \"I am okay even Dara does think I suck.\" And then also it's not permanent, right? It's like sure, there might be some high stakes things in life where you only get one shot, but for the most part it's like if I didn't do a great job on this presentation, there'll be another one. It's okay.\n\n(00:16:45):\nAnd think of it as practice. The other thing is from the fear threat state, I'm like, uh-oh, this is a risk, alarm bells, my career could be over. Whereas if I'm in that trusting, curious, open space, it's like this is an opportunity for feedback. How can I learn? How can I get to become a better presenter? It's like the feedback from others is no longer a threat. It's actually a gift. It's like information that I can use or not use to alter how I show up in the future and the skills I develop and all that good stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:21):\nI imagine some people may hear this and feel like if Dara or Travis or whoever thinks I suck, my career is at stake and that really matters and everything's going to fall apart in my life because I get fired, there's stakes involved with messing up. Is there anything that helps you get past that and not worry so much about just this trickle effect of all the things that could go wrong if you mess something up in an important high stakes meeting or presentation?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:17:46):\nYeah. Again, and maybe it is a little paradoxical, but what I found was the more I focused on how I show up and optics and having a good deck and all this, the less I got promoted and then the more I dropped focusing all that. Because for my first few years of Uber, I was a senior PM and then I finally got my groove and started kind of moving through the product ladder. And it was really correlated to me at least, maybe causal, with dropping a lot of the focus on the presentation and how I show up and whether people like this or not, and just really focusing on the work. It's like, you know what? I am here to be a conduit from what wants to happen in the world of transportation and mobility and shared rides is one that I've always been particularly passionate about, so that's a good example, and then how can I get present and listen to what wants to happen next in the world of shared rides? And there's lots of different ways we can take the product and all that.\n\n(00:18:45):\nAnd it's really about, I want to make a fucking awesome product, right? And it's like, whether people like me or think I'm a good PM or presenter, as long as I manifest a great product into the world that makes riders better off, drivers better off, cities better off, less congestion, all these things, that to me is the reward. And sure, in order to manifest that, it is often helpful to communicate things, present, align, all those sort of things. But those are a means to a more powerful and transformative end than just my career. I'm tapping into a larger purpose and sense of belonging and identity and sort of meaning. And from that place, it's like I've just dropped the kind of egoic, self-centered focus on whether I did good in the presentation or not. And then yeah, maybe paradoxically, by doing that, it actually goes better and we do great work and it gets recognized.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:41):\nWow, that is fascinating. To make that work, you need to really connect with the mission of the company you're working at. You really need to believe this is very important and very meaningful. So maybe that could be an issue for people if they don't really care about what the company's doing, it's going to be hard to allow for that approach.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:19:58):\nTotally, totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:00):\nIt's interesting that you say that optics aren't as important. I think the reason I think about this as you talk about, a lot of people feel like there's the work and then there's talking about the work, making the work, the optics of what you did is really, really important. And I love to hear. Nobody wants to do that, but they always get this advice. So important, optics, how you share the impact you've done, how you represent yourself. I guess, is there anything else you can share there about just helping people relax about that aspect of their job and without being so critical?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:20:31):\nYeah. And to be clear, I do think it's important. It can't be all work and no optics or all optics and no work. There does need to be a balance there, and I think it does change depending on the size of the company and the level of seniority. When you're an IC, you're probably hopefully doing more actual work, and leaders are supporting them and presenting and communicating that work so that they get.\n\n(00:20:56):\nI mean, the optics does matter, right? At some senior level, you do spend more time on that, and it does have influence, back to the influence piece, which is like, how will I communicate an idea and the need for engineering resourcing and so forth might mean that team gets more engineers or doesn't get more engineers, or we do this project or we don't, right? Because at the end of the day, executive resource allocation is largely based on the, quote-unquote, \"optics layer\". So it does matter. I want to be clear. I'm not saying it doesn't matter, but to me, again, it's more about that's a means to an end. It's not about the optics itself. It's like say what the Buddha is saying, don't mistake the finger pointing at the moon for the moon. And the finger pointing at the moon could be the presentation, the OKR, you know, whatever. And it's like, that's not the actual outcome we care about. That's an input to the output that really matters, which is the work, the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:47):\nOkay. I'm going to shift this to hard skills and another kind of direction. So another thing that came up a bunch when I was asking people what you're amazing at and what you're really good at is strategy and vision. I had this quote from one of your colleagues, Brent Goldman, \"J.M. thinks big, has lots of great ideas, will 'yes, and' to other people's ideas, will inspire everyone around him to be more creative, ambitious, and hardworking. He doesn't climb hills, he finds bigger mountains and will bring you there.\" So along these lines, say someone comes to you and wants to build these skills, wants to get better at strategy, wants to get better at vision, which is something basically every product leader is trying to get better at and every leader wants to get better at, what advice do you generally share? How does one improve in these areas?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:22:35):\nYeah, thank you. I appreciate the compliment. Thank you, Brent. That is a great quote. Wow. Yeah, I mean there's no magic toolkit or manual. I've long ago given up on the notion that I'm one book away from the perfect elusive answer to whatever plagues you in life. And there's obviously lots of books about strategy and you get into all that. I guess for me, a couple of things have been helpful. One is you mentioned earlier finding a mission that you're really passionate about. I think it would be hard for me to come up with a strategy for improving the healthcare system. It's like, sure, it's important. I hope someone does it and figures out how to deal with HIPAA and whatever, all this stuff, but it's just not for me. It's not my purpose, mission and vision in life.\n\n(00:23:24):\nAnd so step one is, am I working at a place and in a product area in which I have a tremendous amount of passion? Because for me, that is the fuel and the motivation that helps me break through to getting the strategy. That's the first step. So that's where I feel enormously lucky because again, this revolutionizing transportation and car ownership and what happens with autonomy and form factors and future of cities is something that I'm super excited about. I think about my daughters growing up and having a different world to live in that's safer and more environmentally friendly, all this stuff, and I get really jazzed when I think about, wow, the work I do could actually impact their future lives and other people. It's like, whoa, I can feel the chills right now. It's just super motivating. So that's the first place, just getting myself fired up.\n\n(00:24:10):\nAnd then the next thing I guess that's been helpful is I've deeply immersed myself. I haven't really jumped around between crypto and gen AI, this stuff, and a lot of people do that. It's great, nothing wrong with that, but I've been in this largely focused on mobility space for 10 years now with some stints over in the restaurant tech and delivery side, but very related in terms of last mile logistics. And so I think it's hard to come up with a great strategy if you've only been working in an area for six months. Especially things like this, they're super nuanced. Shared rides is another a good example where it's a super hard problem to crack and it's going deep on that for a long time is a precursor to being successful.\n\n(00:24:55):\nThe other thing I would say though is people always talk about first principles thinking, but if there's truth in it, I think that's like when Elon's like, \"Well, why does the rocket cost a gazillion dollars to launch? And there's no reason they have to throw away the materials and blah, blah, blah.\" One example might be, why do we need a 4,000 pound vehicle to move a human three miles? Okay, well... Or even a couple of humans. We do an Uber Pool or a Share, and you move two humans or three humans, even then that's pretty inefficient. If you think about just the physics there, the energy expenditure.\n\n(00:25:32):\nAnd that's where I think you might come up with bikes and scooters and little other things. And sure it's not always, it's raining or you want the car, but that's sort of an example of why questioning why are things the way they are, and then is the way they are super inefficient or not optimal in some sense? And that is often a doorway to opportunity to see, okay, well maybe things could be different. And so I kind of extend that at a larger level to the future. My general thing is just like, yeah, that's the mountain thing is I try to just close my eyes and imagine the future as far out as I can.\n\n(00:26:09):\nIt's like five years from now, 10 years from now, whatever. And it's develop a really salient picture of what that looks like. It's like, we could do this right now, it's okay. 10 years from now, what could San Francisco look like? Or some city? What happens to the parking spaces? Are there still parking garages? Are those parks now? What are the modes of transport? Are there bus-like things that are autonomous that are connecting people to bikes and scooters? And how are people living? Do they live in the far suburbs even more because autonomy and they have a nicer house and they come in, or is all the space repurposed and actually it's cheaper to live in the city because we compact things, blah, blah, blah. It's not even about having the right one, it's more just developing some sort of picture of the future that gets you fired up.\n\n(00:26:57):\nAnd then yeah, you got to go articulate that and communicate it and get people to come on the journey with you. But from that picture, it's like, well, first principle, what's going to be true 10, 20 years from now? Well, autonomy is a given. I think most people would probably agree with that, and we'll probably solve it with just cameras and won't need lidar because humans don't have lidar. The cost of vehicles and sensors will come down, remote support will come down, and at some point it'll be super cheap and it's like, okay, I can extrapolate, that will be a thing. Separate from which player wins. I'm not saying I can predict the ecosystem of companies that will win here. It's more about just the underlying dynamics. And then that would be one, and another one would be sharing. It's like, well, a lot of people are like, \"Oh, well, once we have cheap autonomous cars, everyone can just have their own super cheap Uber, Tesla or whatever it is here in the city.\"\n\n(00:27:45):\nAnd you're like, \"Well, that doesn't work because then we're going to hit this induced demand concept,\" which is what economists call it, and you used to, when text messages cost 50 cents a piece, how many did you send versus now when it's free, it's in the millions. Same thing when they add a lane to a highway, the traffic just gets just as bad as before because more people drive and so forth. So if we flood the streets with super cheap autonomous cars with single occupancy, we're just going to have even more good luck than we do right now. Maybe we'll do The Boring Company thing and dig tunnels, but that seems unlikely.\n\n(00:28:16):\nSo then for me, it's like, well, from first principles, shared rides is going to continue to be an important part of the future of transportation. And other modalities where yeah, back to the three mile thing, it's like, well, there probably will be various form factors of bikes, scooters and little mini golf cart things and whatever we end up building. And so that's hopefully an example of how I try to think about what are the likely things to be true in the future, and then how does that lead to a potential ecosystem and strategy around what we might build towards that future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):\nThis is great because this is something everyone can do, and there's all this talk of creating a vision, painting a vision, communicating a vision, and what you're describing is how to actually sit there and think about what it might look like. Sit there, close your eyes and in your head visualize in the next five or 10 years, what does the future actually look like? And do you do this in a state of if we were to do this product and change, or is it just even if we're not around, here's where the future is going to go most likely, which direction do you usually take?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:29:20):\nYeah, that's a good question. I think you could probably do either. I typically like to start with the former, which is just like, what will the world move towards absent of me? Just trying to pick a bird's-eye view of what I think the trajectories are and trends and what's going to happen. And then yeah, you could apply a lens of, okay, if we were to build product XYZ or have the strategy, how might we influence the outcome or benefit from it, or is it in congruence with that or is it rubbing against that and trying to change that? Either could be good, you might say it's a tailwind or a headwind, both are overcomeable, but having some awareness of the relationship between those things is good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:00):\nAnd I think transportation, Uber, Waymo, in theory it might be easier to visualize that future and how exciting that might be versus a B2B SaaS payroll app or some photo sharing thing. But on the other hand, not necessarily, right? What in the future in 10 years, how are people going to be paid? How do people work at companies? I think there's an opportunity to do that no matter what you're building. Is this something you actually do? You just sit there in the office, close your eyes and just imagine? Is this more of an iterative process where you get with your team, how do you actually practice this?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:30:31):\nYeah, it's not like something you can just schedule 30 minutes for in the middle of your day of packed OKR reviews and random one-on-ones and meetings. It's like, I like to do it on my own at first unless it's something that I already have an outline for and I'm ready to move into a team space. So for me, it's like, yeah, can I get into a quiet contemplative space? So yeah, I like to go for a run and that obviously gives me ideas, or I'll go for a hike up in Marin and sometimes I'll just think of stuff or jot something down or make a voice note while I'm doing that to get things going. But yeah, the first step for me is just getting out of the craziness of day-to-day. To me, it's still insane how many product manager, leaders of all kinds just run the schedule of back to back meetings, 30-minute review, big meaty topics, you run out of time, run to the next thing, answer a bunch of emails, and then cram some PRDs in there. It's like, it doesn't work.\n\n(00:31:27):\nAnd so I'm a big fan of carving out time, again, first for myself, a couple hours, whatever, where I can just get out of the day-to-day craziness and get into that head space of five, 10 years from now. It's just a different place. So you need to transition to that. And then bring that to teams. If I have an outline of that kind of future of transportation in my head, I might share that with a group of folks and we'll come together also for some extended period of time. We recently had an all-day Monday thing where eight of us came into the office to talk about future of marketplace, and it was super productive. It was like, laptops down, we're going to spend all day together on a whiteboard. It's like a lost art. People don't use the whiteboards anymore.\n\n(00:32:10):\nBut yeah, and then from there it's getting more people and then you can kind of iterate on it. It's like I had some vision of the future and someone points out something that is a little bit off with it or has a better idea. Then you move into co-creation. But I love that. It's like Pixar calls the brain trust. If you read [inaudible 00:32:28] book, how they come up with a Toy Story and Inside Out and all these things, is they have this group of people that just sits around riffing on ideas. And again, there's no judgment, there's no attachment to being right. They're in a co-creative sort of space where they're just like co-exploring and riffing with each other. And I love to be in that space with other PMs and engineers and data scientists.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:52):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

I don't want my brain to just go... you don't trust your brain to go to a place that's fun, but it always does. It always ends up being like, oh, that was so interesting just to think of this idea that just came up. So I've been trying to do that, and that's such a simple thing to do. Just don't turn anything on.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:34:13):\nWell, it's not really good for your podcast business to tell people not to listen to podcasts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:16):\nOkay, everyone, we're cutting this. What I find really helpful is playing Lenny's podcast every time I'm out and about.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:34:25):\nNo, but there's something to what you said, which is there's always a lot of content out there to pursue, and I've been in that mode where I'm like, yeah, more content, more... But yeah, actually similar to you, spend a lot of time now not listening to anything. Go on a hike where you don't listen to a podcast or music on your commute and see what happens. You might be surprised.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:45):\nYeah. And it always ends up being like, oh, that was cool. And that's where shower ideas come from and all these things. Maybe just to see if there's something here, in this meeting that you have, this ideation brainstorming meeting, is there anything that came out of that that was really surprising or new from a recent experience? Is there anything there of just like, oh wow, we really uncovered this potential wrinkle of the future that we really need to think about differently?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:35:08):\nWell, it wasn't maybe a specific wrinkle, but one of the things that we're thinking a lot about, like I'm fortunate to be involved in trying to help develop and articulate a multi-year three-year product or even overall tech strategy for the mobility business at Uber. And one of the, I guess big ahas for us is as we move away from the, in some ways simpler world of UberX being the predominant product, which is it used to be pretty simple. It's kind of like a taxi meter on the driver's side. There's a time and distance rate that everybody gets, and then on the rider's side it's like, sure, there's some surge pricing based on supply and demand, but it's one product, it's pretty straightforward. And so this future of multi-modality and on the both demand side and the supply side is what makes the marketplace even more complex and challenging to build.\n\n(00:36:00):\nAnd so it was kind of all this around, okay, well now that we have taxis in the platform and we have fleet providers and we're starting to add Waymos and Cruise and other things, we have to have a marketplace that's aware of those different types of supply and which one might be available for what trips and how to think about cost and quality and allocation of trips and all that. And then on the demand side, it's like, yeah, we've got all these different products like shared rides and reserved rides and comfort and X and priority, and it's like how do we think about how to price those relative to each other? How do we think about which one's to show which user? How do you think about the ranking and so forth? And then that all has feedback loops into the pricing and matching itself as well.\n\n(00:36:45):\nSo the dynamics of the thing, when I think about the future of marketplace, Uber, is like, whoa. And I don't think anyone's ever built that. That's the super cool thing about it. I think we have the best logistics marketplace tech on the planet and we built something that no one else has ever built, relative to digital marketplaces, for example, just different physical world requirements. And then this next arc of what I described of thinking about different types of supply and different kind of demand channels just adds even more complexity to that. But the aha was like, I guess, yeah, we got to think about all that stuff and think about how the supply and demand relate to each other and yeah, it's going to be cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:26):\nIt's just an infinitely cited marketplace now. That's wild. One last nugget I wanted to just reinforce that you shared about how to become better at strategy and vision, developing great and interesting and innovative strategy, and vision is going really deep on a topic. So you've been in the space for a long time. There's this idea that Paul Graham talks about, I think, called your top idea or something like that, that when you have... Whatever your top ideas, the more you can just think about that and keep that top of mind as you go about your day and just have one core focus, the more likely it is you're going to come up with new interesting ideas because your brain's going to keep working on it when you're driving around listening to Lenny's podcast. Just kidding, or going on hike.\n\n(00:38:09):\nSo I think that's a really important point is if you're finding you're not coming up with a great strategy or vision and just having struggles, part of it might just be you're not spending enough time in that space, you're not going deep enough in the problem area. One approach is just spend a decade in that space. Is there anything else just comes up as I say that of just how to do that?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:38:26):\nYeah. Well there's also, that's at the macro level, maybe spending 10 years in a space, but at the micro level, back to kind of like defrag your day, don't just do the 20, 30 minute meetings on 20 different topics. Sure, sometimes you do that first and you got to do that. You have a large team like I do, obviously reviews across teams. I'm not saying I don't do that on some days, but it's like, yeah, what are my top few things, right? I think, you're right, I think it was Peter [inaudible 00:38:52] or PayPal guys talked about that too, going really deep and having a person or a leader really responsible for one core, deep thing for the company, and that's something they immerse themselves in. And so in the micro, that to me again translates to, yeah, I don't have a to-do list of 20 things. I try to have a to-do list of three of the most important highest leverage things that could have impact broadly across the company and then try this, like you said, let that one top thing marinate and chew on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:22):\nI love that. And I recently had a post about all these productivity tricks, and one of the things that I find really helpful is at the beginning of each day and also at the beginning of each week, just write down, here's the one to three things that I need to do and get done. And everything else, I might have this really long list, but here's the three things if I get done, life will be good. I've done a lot. I've accomplished really great, important things.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:39:42):\nTotally. I tried to do the David Allen GTD thing once, the super complicated organization system. It was too much structure for me. I couldn't do it. At the end of the day, what you said is right. There's basically three things that I need to do next, and then there's just some random backlog that I can just scan through periodically and that's it. That gets you most of the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:01):\nIt's crazy. I read that book 20 years ago at this point, and there's elements that still make things, like I leverage and benefit from. Even if you don't do the whole thing, that book I recommend people read because there's just like, if you pick a couple things from there, your life gets better. The things that have stuck with me, the main one is this waiting for concept of if you're waiting, if you email your designer and like, \"Hey, I need you to review this product,\" just note, \"Waiting for Dan to review design.\" And just having that thread written down and not in your head really helped me.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:40:36):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:36):\nYeah. Anyway, I'm not going to go on that tangent.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:40:41):\nYeah. It's the core concept of like, whatever steps you use. I think the most powerful takeaway from that book for me was if it's in your head, you're screwed because it's like you're trying to keep track of stuff and be creative and come up with the future of transportation and remember to pick up something from the pharmacy. It's a recipe for disaster. This whole idea of empty mind, beginner's mind, well, you have to empty the mind of all the to-dos first. Just get that out of the head.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:04):\nAbsolutely. I think it was mind like water, that's the one that stuck with me, where nothing you need to remember can be in your head. It needs to be written down somewhere Anyway, let's not go into a whole productivity podcast here.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:41:15):\nPerfect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):\nSo we talked about vision strategy. So there's classically two problems people have with vision strategy. One is how do I get better at it? The other is just like, I need to actually get shit done. I can't spend all my time thinking about vision. You have a really good take on how to find this balance and you've seen it work well and not well, just vision versus execution. When do I go big vision, how much I spend on vision versus just get shit done, execute, execute, execute? What could you share about just what you've learned about how to find that balance and what you've seen work and not work?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:41:48):\nYeah, I think you can go too far either direction, right? It's like everything in life is about balancing the polarity between two opposing forces. And so in this one it's like, yeah, you go too hard in division and theory land, I've seen that go off the axle, early Uber where again, back to the future of pricing, it's like we have all the data scientists and PhDs locked in a room for two weeks and there's a beautiful whiteboard diagram. What did it look like? And then it's like, why don't we actually build this thing? And engineers are like, this is like boiling the ocean. And you just get wrapped around the axle of like, well, that sounds really good in theory, but I have no idea how to even start executing on this. So that's probably an example of we tilted a little too far towards the vision theory land.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):\nAnd this was, you're describing the original plan to make a really good surge pricing algorithm?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:42:39):\nYeah. This was a plan to try to bring together, say how we do driver pricing, time and distance rates, but also we do incentives for drivers where it's like if you drive this many hours a week, you get a bonus. And there's also surge pricing and how to tie all those systems together in a very sophisticated sort of way. This was back in 2017 or something and it winged a little too hard into theory land.\n\n(00:43:03):\nAnd we still have that bias sometimes. We joke about marketplace, especially when we talk about with other teams that are trying to integrate in the marketplace, let's say they add fleets or teams with a big new product. And then marketplace people would be like, \"Well, have you thought about this one random problem that could happen two years from now if teams become this much of demand and blah blah blah, whatever.\" And it's just like we do get wrapped around the axle on that sometimes. But yeah, so the future of pricing is a good example, we winged a little too far into theory land. But you could probably go too far into execution land too. And I'd say DoorDash in my experience would do that sometimes where we used to actually even half joke there, some of us leaders would be like, \"It's ready, fire, aim.\"\n\n(00:43:49):\nAnd it was like, people would be like, \"I'm just going to run through a wall. I have no idea if that's the right wall to run through, but at least I know I'm running through a wall.\" So yeah, I think it's about balance and can you adjust. Again, it's dynamic. I think there's times where you're in a soul searching sort of, \"What is our product strategy? We got to pivot.\" Maybe you're a startup and it's not working and you want to think about... And then it's like, okay, well pull off the gas a little bit, ease up on the execution and let's lean into the strategy vision piece. And there's times where the strategy and vision's pretty baked at least for the next whatever, six months, a year. And it's like, okay, pedal to the metal. Let's just go execute. Let's get it done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:34):\nI just went to this Acquired Podcast event at the Chase Center. Zuck was there, and the CEO of Spotify was there too. And there's two quick anecdotes that you remind me of. One is, Zuck talked about how once Facebook and Zuck and the team align on here's where we're going, no matter how many walls appear in front of them, there's going to be a Mark shaped hole in the wall very soon because they're just going to run through and get things done that they need to get done. And I really love that mentality of once we're sure where we're going, we're going to bust through these walls.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:45:11):\nThat's awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):\nThe other is a really interesting value at Spotify. So Daniel Ek shared this. He said, \"At Spotify we have this core value, talk is cheap.\" And when you hear that you think it's saying talk is not valuable, and it's actually they look at it as a virtue. Talk is cheap, we can talk and it costs us no money, very little money compared to building something. So they actually spent a lot of time at Spotify refining their ideas and discussing until they're really sure something is right. And I guess any reaction to that? Because I thought that was really interesting.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:45:41):\nYeah, I love that. It's almost a different flavor of, I think the base of saying of he's like, I like a crisp dock and a messy meeting. The whole Amazon thing, if you have the three-page or seven-page narrative, it's written with the clarity of angels singing from on high, at least describing how the problem statement or feature or whatever. And so it's super crisp and organized and well articulated. And then you might have a meeting where you pick it apart and you talk a lot. That's what made me think of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:12):\nYeah. Awesome. Okay, couple more things I want to spend some time on. One is you've worked at a lot of really interesting successful hyper growth companies, DoorDash, Uber, Waymo. You were also in finance for a while. I want to pick on a few of these and just see what's a lesson you took away or what's an experience from that time that might be interesting or helpful to people?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:46:34):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:35):\nSo you talked about DoorDash a bit. What did you take away from your time at DoorDash? What's something you saw there that either is like, wow, that's a really cool thing I want to do in the future, or here's something they weren't amazing at that I learned to try to avoid?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:46:47):\nYeah, yeah, it's really amazing to get to see different places and pick the best of what you like. And also the other thing is back to like, for me, there's no right or wrong, it's just differences have pros and cons. There's always two sides of the coin. So what's interesting I think about Uber and DoorDash is first back to the mission and the strategy. They started with different DNA, right? So Uber started with it was to utilize blocked cars at the airport that were not doing trips, but it was more about the riders. It was like whatever origin story you believe, Travis and whoever can get a ride in Paris. And so then it was about better than taxi and all this stuff, but it was very rider centric. It was consumer centric in that sense.\n\n(00:47:31):\nAnd so for a long time, I think Uber kind of took that too far. We got to the polarity of drivers are a commodity, blah, blah, blah, and they had to flip that back and start really investing more on the driver's side of the marketplace. But you look at DoorDash and it's like, Tony grew up in his parents' restaurant kitchen and the DoorDash thesis was how can we help small businesses be more successful? And delivery was just the first instantiation of that sort of meta purpose of DoorDash. And so they're much more merchant centric as opposed to consumer centric. And by the way, the consumer centricism of Uber that started with rides than translated to Eats. I think when Uber started with Eats, it was like, \"Well, we just want Lenny to have some great Thai food and sushi and have some options. But selection is a means to Lenny having a great eater experience.\" Whereas DoorDash with their merchant focus is like, \"We want every Thai restaurant in this city to be successful and be on DoorDash.\"\n\n(00:48:24):\nSo their motivation for selection is, \"We want all of the merchants to thrive and survive.\" So that happens to give you better selection as a result. But the motivation was very different. So the analogy I use is Uber is to Amazon as DoorDash is to Shopify, if that makes sense. Amazon has always been more consumer focused, Shopify is obviously very merchant focused.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:46):\nInteresting.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:48:46):\nAnd by the way, either of those, again, there's no right or wrong, is a fine strategy. They're both great companies. And I actually don't know if you could do both. Is it possible to be Amazon and Shopify? To really focus on consumers and build all the merchant restaurant tech? And maybe with enough resources and time, but that would lose focus. So it's like there's a trade-off there. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:08):\nYeah. Like at Airbnb, there was always this, \"Should we optimize for hosts? Should we optimize for guests?\" And there's always this like, \"This time, guests are most important. Right now hosts are more...\" Make these trade-off decisions in the marketplace. So it's interesting that at Uber, your insight there is Uber is always very rider focused, and DoorDash from its DNA was very merchant focused. You also talk about at DoorDash, there's this mentality of just going before figuring out where to go. Is there anything more there that might be helpful, either as a cautionary tale or as a lesson?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:49:37):\nYeah, I think it's a balance. It's back to I don't want to deliberate and pontificate for weeks on end about which door I should run through. And I don't want to go to the other extreme and just spend 30 seconds thinking about what to do and just go, go, go. So it's finding that kind of happy medium. If I had to pick one, I'd rather bias towards running through a wall than not doing anything, because you still get learnings from that and you either make progress or you don't, and that gives you feedback and you can run through another wall as a result. So I think the biggest failure case is probably erring on the other side of deliberating too long without action.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:15):\nWhat about Waymo? What's something that you took away from that experience as a thing that you want to do more of or something you want to try to avoid?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:50:22):\nWaymo is, you've probably seen people in San Francisco, they're quite prolific now in terms of they're all over San Francisco and you see them all the time. And I'm not sure, I can't remember the last time I saw one towed, I don't want to say that they've solved self-driving, but they are obviously driving at scale with very minimal, at least real world intervention. You can't tell by looking at the cars how many humans behind the scenes might be helping provide guidance of the car or whatever. But yeah, I would say what's really interesting about Waymo is they've largely solved the self-driving piece, however they've done that, and in a complex environment like San Francisco, and you see them driving in fog and rain and puddles, and it's like, wow, that's pretty cool.\n\n(00:51:07):\nBut I think what Waymo was learning, and I was trying help them learn is that building a self-driving car on a test track is a very different problem statement than scaling a fleet of thousands of cars. And how do you operate them, clean them, charge them, maintain them, and then how do you build the ride share network? It's like, okay, well we got to build an app and we got to acquire users and do classic growth stuff and think about that marketplace and matching and pricing and those are very different skills. And so it's like a warning that those are different things.\n\n(00:51:41):\nAnd trying to hire for that and build culture around that was hard, honestly. It's just like you're kind of a different thing than the host organism. Most of the host organism is just obsessed with perception and planning and all the core autonomy pieces and you're like, the commercialization people there, \"Well, now we've going to make money with this thing.\" That's why I think that's an example where your overall vision would say Waymo is to build Waymo One. Just be mindful that it's more than just one. There's multiple pillars of that. There's the self-driving piece, there's getting a lot of cars at scale, financing them, operating the fleet, getting the demand, filling the cars with people, and then it has to all come together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:31):\nRight. Yeah. It's so interesting that your title is Lead Product for Commercialization of Autonomous Ride Hailing at Waymo, and now it's come full circle where at Uber, that's going to be in a sense the way that people call Waymo. And so it's so interesting that you've seen both sides of this.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:52:50):\nYeah. Well, we'll see what happens. I think Uber, it got out of the autonomy business when it divested Autonomous Technologies Group or Advanced Technologies Group. And right now our stated strategy is to be an aggregator. So it's like, we are partnering with Waymo, with Cruise, Motional, others in China, et cetera. And then the idea is to have every vehicle on the platform really, right? Autonomous or not. And then use the power of the platform, we have this big demand base, we have a lot of riders.\n\n(00:53:22):\nAnd so I think what you're seeing is, Waymo and Cruise and others are like, \"Okay, now that we've developed autonomy, what's the path to profitability for us?\" And so they can go it alone and try to build a ride-share network. And Waymo is doing that with Waymo One, but it turns out it takes a while. It's funny, I feel like engineers too are always skeptical of why other people's engineering problems take so much work. There'd be engineers at Waymo would be like, \"Why does Uber have so many thousands of engineers? How hard can it be to build a ride-share app?\"\n\n(00:53:59):\nBut when you look at what made Uber successful, what we've been perfecting for the last decade, A, the marketplace tech that I alluded to earlier, but also how we manage a large rider base and doing rider support and driver support and logistics and all of the helping finance electric vehicles and working with regulators and cities and making sure we have safe and accessible pickup points and on and on and on. And those are all the depth of the iceberg that you don't really realize or think of when you're like, \"Oh, I can just build a ride-share app.\" Right? Tesla publishes their sigma design and some earnings report and everyone goes crazy like, \"Wow, okay, well I don't want to bet against Elon because that sounds scary,\" but there is more to it than just the app and the autonomy.\n\n(00:54:46):\nSo yeah, I think these companies will have an interesting question. Do they go alone, build their own ride-share network to capture all the value, or do they say, \"Well, I could just work with Uber and have a faster path to high utilization of the vehicles,\" which unlocks financing and more vehicles and that gets them to scale faster? And so if you look at the landscape right now, it's a bit of both, right? Waymo is obviously working with Uber in Phoenix and we just announced Cruise will come back to some city next year I think, but Waymo is also still building their own thing, so they're kind of hedging their bets at the moment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:18):\nI want to take us to a recurring segment on the podcast that I call Contrarian Corner. I feel like you're going to have a good answer here. What's something that you believe that most other people don't believe?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:55:32):\nOne is back to being aware of your internal state and allowing emotions and thoughts is... Emotions in the workplace, a lot of people have the thing of like, \"Well, there's no need for emotion in the workplace. We're going to be logical. We're going to be data-driven. Keep your feelings at home. Just show up and presentation J.M. Mode.\" And I guess in my experience, there's this thing around whole body intelligence and whole body, yes, which is yes, there is signal from the head and logic and data and left brain reasoning are amazing and it could be great, but there's also heart and gut. And to me, what is an emotion? It's just energy moving on the body. Often it's correlated with a thought too as well. I might have a thought that creates fear and so forth.\n\n(00:56:23):\nBut to me there's wisdom in emotion and I can start to access noticing them more. Like where do I feel sadness in the body? I notice I feel fear in the kind of center of my chest, and then sadness is like a sinking feeling in my stomach. And I notice when I'm angry, my jaw gets tight and my eyes furrow a little bit. And so those are common ones, but you may have your own little signatures of you pick up where is joy, where is creative energy? Where is fear or sadness, anger? And then noticing those in a meeting or in a conversation or review. And actually if you're willing, even just voice it to other people, that's like the next step. But start with just acknowledging it to yourself.\n\n(00:57:02):\nAnd so for me, the wisdom of emotions is fear is something wants to be paid attention to. There can be the saber-toothed tiger is not really Dara disapproving of me, whatever. I shouldn't be afraid of that. But there are times where fear is applicable. There might be fear around, let's say back at Waymo, you want to be really intentional about safety and you want to be super... That's one of the things I love about Waymo is they're very committed to having a super strong safety record. And so there might be fear around did we really consider all the edge cases of what might happen if a dog runs in the street or a ball or child or whatever, and you might see wow, fear. It's great. The wisdom of that is something wants to be paid attention to and listened to. Okay, great.\n\n(00:57:46):\nSadness for me is something wants to be let go of. There's a mourning, there's a letting go of I had an idea or vision for the future that will no longer be because whatever, something happened, other people don't want to do it, this or that. But it could be a vision of a relationship, it could be a vision of what you thought your life would look like, whatever. We all go through those sorts of things.\n\n(00:58:07):\nAnd there might be micro-moments of sadness of like, wow, that feature didn't work. It's like I really wanted it to be successful. I just let go of that, welcome the sadness. Anger to me is something is not of service to me or my people or my mission or whatever I'm up to. And so again, that can be a great signal to like, okay, I pay attention to that. I want to change something. And then joy is something that wants to be celebrated. We had a great win. We nailed the OKR, we had a great product launch. A lot of times we spend too much time moving back into the next, okay, let's set another goal. It's like, it's okay to stop and celebrate.\n\n(00:58:45):\nAnd then creative energy is something wants to be born into the world. It's like it's almost like I'm going to birth an idea or a vision or some new product thing and then just tuning into that. So yeah, I would say welcome emotions, maybe even talk about them, god forbid, in the workplace. Imagine that instead of having a OKR review where you're behind target and everyone's blaming other people, and you could tell when it's kind of fearful, if someone was just like, \"Wow, I noticed that I just feel fear around this.\" Everyone was like, \"Wow, I feel fear too.\" That would just totally change the tone of the conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:20):\nThe advice here is bring your emotions into work. Don't let emotions... What most people believe is leave your emotions at home, don't bring your emotions into the workplace, and what you've found is they actually can make you more effective and make your teams more effective. And you even talked about it helps you make decisions in a more intelligent way because your gut and lizard brain almost tells you things that you should pay attention to.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (00:59:46):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:47):\nI love that. Okay, so I'm going to close with a question that is rooted in something that you shared with me when we were chatting about this podcast that I think is going to be helpful to a lot of people. What have you found to be keys to a successful, impactful, rich, fun life?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:00:05):\nIt's a great question, and I think lots of people have different prescriptions for that, and I don't claim to have the one truth around that, but the first thing I would say as a meta observation is I spend a lot of time thinking about objective functions. We design algorithms to do matching and pricing and think about short-term effects and long-term effects. And so I really am ingrained in this idea of we have an objective function for our life. And then the problem is that a lot of us aren't conscious of it. It's just like an implied OF that you inherited values from your church or community or what your parents valued or what you learned to be good at, and I do this for work and blah, blah, blah, and I'm just kind of bobbing along.\n\n(01:00:49):\nThat's why I love Ray Dalio's principle thing where it's like, Hey, write down your values and your principles and get clear on what they are. Or Clayton Christensen wrote a great book that he's less known for, he's obviously known for Innovator's Dilemma, but he wrote a book called How Will You Measure Your Life? And he was trying to answer this question of, he teaches whatever, MBA students at Harvard, and he's like, \"Wow, all these executives are super successful. They're like Fortune 500 execs. They're most super successful, but they're all divorced and their kids hate them and their personal lives are a mess. What's happening?\" And so one of the key insights he comes to is like, it's Sunday night and you have the choice of playing with your daughter, or you're reading a book or playing a game, and you have a presentation to Dara on Monday. And he's like, \"Well, I could make those slides a little bit better and I could go practice or knock out some emails,\" or whatever it is you want to do.\n\n(01:01:49):\nAnd so what he basically found was the type A exec, successful people are very short-term OF driven. They're like, \"Well, presentation's tomorrow, and that can either go great or okay based on Sunday night.\" Whereas like, \"My daughter will be here, I'll play with her next week.\" And the problem is that he's getting in this cycle where it's like, okay, you start working every Sunday night and then years and years go by and suddenly you don't have a relationship with your daughter who's now a teenager.\n\n(01:02:16):\nBut I think we're just not conscious of that. So to me, the first piece of advice would be get clear on your objective function. And one way that I've gotten clear on it is trying to think about it from future me. Because five years from now, I'm not going to give a shit if I made the presentation slightly better, but I'm going to care a lot about what kind of relationship I have with my daughters. And that means that the next action, the next thing I do today and tomorrow, those will translate into the relationship with her. And I think a lot of us aren't just tuned into that.\n\n(01:02:49):\nI love the stoic stuff, being mindful of death, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, all those great ones. Not to be morbid, but just again, most of us just aren't really tuned into an awareness that our lives will come to an end. And we try to avoid that and we try to pretend like we're going to live forever and just not think about it. And the horror of it is that we succeed. We mostly manage to just go live our life and eat ice cream and go to work and go on vacation and do what we do. And that can lead us to doing things that ultimately don't matter in the long run, and focusing on the wrong things.\n\n(01:03:28):\nAnd so to me, it's like an awareness and mindfulness that our lives will come to an end punctuates reality in a way that requires me to rethink my priorities, stop wasting time on things that don't matter with people who matter. This relationship, this journey, it will come to an end. I'm actually tearing up and feeling tingly just saying that. It's like even right now, come back to it. How am I going to spend my afternoon? Am I going to hug my daughters? Am I going to spend time with them after work or am I going to do email all night? What would I wish I had done when I'm in my last breath?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):\nThere's a quote that I heard once that really stuck with me that I think is going to hit a lot of people really hard, which is that the only people that will remember you working late every night is your kids.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:04:32):\nWow. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:34):\nYeah. An important reminder. J.M., we've covered a lot of stuff. Is there anything else that you think might be helpful for people that you want to leave listeners with? Or we're going to have a lightning round coming up, but before we get that, we ended on a really powerful, impactful note. Is there anything else along these lines that you think might be helpful for people that you want to leave them with?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:05:01):\nThe one thing I'd encourage folks to do out of all of these we talked about is to see if you'd be willing to commit to breaking out of victim consciousness and mentality. And it's not to say there aren't victims in the world, there are real injustices and things happening, but most of us, I've experienced, I often can fall into the trap of living my life at the effect of, right? I'm at the effect of other people and what they do. I'm at the effect of circumstances like COVID or Trump or whatever. I'm at the effect of the conditions and circumstances of life, and I feel like life is happening to me.\n\n(01:05:39):\nAnd so to me, the most empowering and radical transformation that I've been able to cultivate and develop is shifting from that to a state of I I am willing to take responsibility for how I see the world. And I may not be able to change the weather or the election or all that, but I can change how I'm being in relationship to it and choose to see it as a growth opportunity, as learning, how am I co-creating it, even things that I play a small part in, injustice in the world, how am I perpetuating that and being willing to see the world as I'm the painter of my existence?\n\n(01:06:11):\nI think Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is probably the best example of that. He's in a super oppressive situation that is very horrific and tragic, and the way he described his relationship with the people in the camp and the guards, and he given he gave a talk after he was free, the amount of compassion and empathy he had for his oppressors was just amazing. So I'm like, well, if he can do that in the face of those conditions, I can show up differently in a product review or in a conversation with my partner or meeting or whatever it is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:46):\nYeah, I think just that skill alone is such a powerful unlock for a lot of people instead of, here's all the things that I don't have and here's all the things that are setting you back and all the things that are hard for me versus other people. Shifting to, I need to take responsibility for my own success and no one else will. And just taking agency is a really powerful thing. It's easier said than done. There's a lot of hardships. People have a lot of things that they don't have that other people have that are hurting their career and hurting their ability to be successful, but still, the more you can take responsibility and have agency and the less you have this victim mentality, I 1,000% agree, there's so much power there. So that's an awesome lesson to end on. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round jam. Are you ready?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:07:34):\nI'm ready. Let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:35):\nOkay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:07:41):\nIn the realm of the soft skills and conscious leadership, the best one is the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership by Diana Chapman and Jim Dethmer. And those were my early coaches and teachers almost 10 years ago, and Diana is still my coach. So I think that's a fantastic book that we'll go into more detail about some of the things we talked about around fear and threat versus trust and drawing a triangle and all that great stuff. That'd be one that I'd definitely recommend first. Another one more in the content world is I think you had Nancy Duarte on your podcast one point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:41):\nYeah, Nancy Duarte. Yeah.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:08:17):\nOr Duarte, sorry. I love her book Resonate. I know she has some other ones too, on slide design and stuff. But what was so cool about that, I gave it to PMs all the time when I'm trying to help them develop their communication, storytelling, and presentation skills. And she goes through those TED talks and Martin Luther King, I have a dream, and going to the Moon, and basically make the spark line against it to understand this concept of resonance with the audience. It's actually a great skill for, back to vision and north-starring, she said what all these things do is they alternate tension between the world as it is and the world as it might be. And it's like, here's that beautiful future of transportation, San Francisco, blah, blah, blah, but here's why it sucks today, all these problems and this and that, but here's how it could look in a few years.\n\n(01:09:05):\nAnd then you're creating that tension and the audience at the end is like sweaty palms and like, \"I want to help build that future.\" What do you need? You need money, you need time, resources, join your company. Great. So anyway, Resonate, Nancy Duarte, great book. Those would be some of the top two that I recommend. There's not one specific book, but I really love Alan Watts' books if you're into... He was one of the first people to articulate and kind of import Buddhism and that sort of Eastern thinking into the West, and he just has a very satirical, comical sort of not taking myself too seriously style and just like the way he explains a lot of those concepts. So that'd be another one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:47):\nHe also has an amazing voice if you listen to recordings of him with music, it's just so fun to listen to.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:09:52):\nTotally. Actually, Sam Harris's Waking Up app now has the entire... he worked with I think Alan Watts' son. So the Waking Up app has all 80 or 100 hours of recorded Alan Watts lectures.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:03):\nOh my god. There's YouTube videos.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:10:06):\n[inaudible 01:10:06]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:06):\nThere's some awesome YouTube videos of him that are worth watching, we'll link to some of those. And then Nancy Duarte, she shared exactly that lesson on the podcast that we had together. So if you don't want to read the book and listen to her give this tactic of this way to communicate a vision, you can listen to that episode, we'll link to it. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you have really enjoyed?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:10:28):\nYeah. The last movie I really enjoyed was Inside Out 2 with my kids, which is very-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:34):\nI could see why you'd love that.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:10:36):\nYes, consistent with the emotional awareness and allowing the different emotional parts and don't want to spoil the movie, maybe everyone hasn't seen it, but it's very simpatico with that lesson of you can't just let one emotion run the show, they all have wisdom. On the first one, Sadness, Joy learning that Sadness is necessary. It's all about integration, but it was beautiful the way kids understand it and it's a way to teach emotional literacy to your kids. So I think what they've done there with those Inside Out movies is just brilliant.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):\nDo you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? It could be an app, it could be something physical.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:11:11):\nYeah, so Eight Sleep is a smart mattress company. They're on their third or fourth rev now, but it's like a Tempur-Pedic mattress, or you can put their cover on any mattress, but it has a cover that has little tubes of water, and then it has a little computer thing and you fill with water and then an app. And basically what you do is you program it and it learns, it has sensors, it can measure your heart rate, your HRV, body temperature, all that, but you're basically trying to program a temperature curve to help you maximize your kind of REM sleep and deep sleep and get more value out of the sleep that you do have.\n\n(01:11:41):\nAnd so for me, it's super cool early for deep sleep, and then it warms you up as you want to wake up, which is... or an alarm and all that. But it's back to my thing about wanting to show up with the right mindset and energy and aliveness. Having really high quality sleep has been a really key part of that, is like if I don't sleep well, I didn't get enough sleep or didn't sleep well, you're already starting off on a bad foot. So yeah, if you haven't checked out Eight Sleep, great product. No endorsement fee for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:12):\nWhat's also cool about it is it tracks your sleep. It gives you all these stats. Instead of wearing a ring, and it gives you all these stats about your sleep quality. And there's this guy, Brian Johnson, I don't know if you follow him, he's like this guy that's trying to stay alive as long as possible, and he had a perfect sleep score for six months in a row to set the record.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:12:30):\nWow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:30):\nYeah. He knows what he's doing over there. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, think of, find useful in work or in life?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:12:42):\nYeah, I probably have had different ones over the years. The one right now that really serves me is there's this track called Sit Around the Fire by Jon Hopkins, but it's on Spotify, Apple Music, but it's basically music with one of Ram Dass' talks, lesser known talks. And so the mantra that's been really serving me recently is the very first part of that, which is he says, \"Beyond all polarities, I am. Let the judgments and opinions of the mind be the judgments and opinions of the mind. And you exist behind that.\" So sometimes I have an abbreviated version of that where I'm noticing I'm activated, I'm clinging to an opinion, I'm arguing with somebody, and I'm just like, \"Beyond all polarities.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:44):\nAn abbreviated version.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:13:45):\nI do that in front of my kids and they laugh at me like, \"Daddy is so weird sometimes.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:47):\nBeyond all polarities, kids. That's so funny. Oh man. There's another Ram Dass line that I often use with my wife, Be Here Now, which is the title of his book that everyone sees with the blue cover. And I do that when she's on her phone and we're doing something. I'm like, \"Be here now.\" And she's like, \"Okay, okay. I'll put my phone away.\" Yeah. Final question. I was going to ask you about the line tracking and what you learned from that. You already shared an awesome lesson from that time. So let me ask you something else. I'll ask you about Travis. Any crazy, fun, memorable stories of working with Travis Kalanick? However you say his last name, Kalanick, Kalanick?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:14:27):\nTravis Kalanick, yeah. Yeah. I'll share a quick one that's short but sweet or hilarious to me, and maybe lesser known. So we used to have the Uber office at 1455 Market, and so there was one conference room where we'd often do reviews with Travis, and it wasn't the war room, whatever whenever room it was. That was interior and no windows. So this room had windows overlooking, what was that? 11th street. So 11th and Market. And so we'd have a presentation up on the projector, some big screen we're about to go through something with Travis. And reliably, every time he'd come in, he would close the blinds of the windows. Everyone like, \"Travis, what are we doing?\" It's not because there was glare. They were orthogonal to the screen. And then one time I was like, \"Why are you doing that?\" He's like, \"I'm pretty sure Lyft has drones outside the windows of our office and they're spying on our presentation.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:19):\nOh my gosh.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:15:23):\nI was like, whoa, your competitor paranoia runs deep, man. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Anyway.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:32):\nIt's hard to mention Lyft doing that. I could see Uber doing that to Lyft.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:15:36):\nOld Uber. Uber 1.0\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):\nOld Uber. Yeah. Wow. That's amazing. It's like coaches in the NFL that are covering their lips always when they're telling and giving plays, just like, I wonder if people actually do that. That's amazing. Yeah, I get that. It's like high stakes. You never know. Might be a drone out there.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:15:54):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:54):\nAmazing. J.M., what a roller coaster of a conversation. We covered so much ground. I can't even name all the things we covered. So let me just ask you two final questions. Where can folks find you online and reach out if they want to work with you? I know you work with folks, talk about that. And then finally, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:16:13):\nYeah, yeah. So I am occasionally on Twitter @NickelsJM, but I don't tweet a lot, but maybe I should start. But the best way to find more about my thoughts and thinking on the soft skill stuff is a website called rhythmofbeing.com. And I've got some blog posts and stuff there that go into detail on some of these things. And yeah, I do a little bit of coaching on the side with folks. I do very little now. My day job at Uber and my night job with my kids takes up most of my waking hours. But for the right person and a few select spots, I can make time. But yeah, that's the best place to find me, is rhythmofbeing.com.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):\nAnd then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:16:57):\nWell, in the spirit of welcoming and embracing feedback, you could most be useful by reaching out, telling me what resonated, what didn't, what was useful, where did your energy go up when I talked, and where did your energy go down? Because that to me is a signal of where I'm back to tracking the life, where's the juice? And then that way in the future when I do other versions of this or other conversations, I'll pay more attention to the energy up stuff and go more there, and the energy down was like, okay, maybe that wasn't as interesting or didn't resonate. Great. No problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:35):\nJ.M., thank you so much for being here.\n\nJohn Mark Nickels (01:17:38):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:39):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:17:42):\nThank you so much for listening.

The effect ultimately that we've seen from a human capital point of view is displacement. We have more people now than we've ever had, but the nature of the work that they do is more strategic. It's more about modeling, validation, asking the right questions, being focused around creative levers. And less so the like trench work of implementation and bid modifiers at the keyword level on Google search, and some of the really hardcore manual analysis we had to do.\n\n(00:00:35):\nOn our creative group, we can come up with mockups, in literally, 1% of the time that it took. And so you still have to understand what questions to ask of the AI and be capable of iterating, but these rough drafts that you might show the artwork of to a client to say, \"Do we like this more or do we like this more?\" That's AI generated. It's really interesting.\n\nLenny (00:01:01):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Jonathan Becker. Jonathan is a legend and an OG in the world of performance marketing. On this podcast, we've done deep dives into the many aspects of growth, including SEO, sales, conversion optimization, retention, product led growth, product led sales. But this is the first episode where we get super deep on paid growth. For the past decade plus, Jonathan and his team have planned, built, and executed more than $3.5 billion in paid acquisition budgets for companies like Uber, Asana, Square, Masterclass, Tempur-Pedic, and many more. And they've built their agency, Thrive Digital, into one of the preeminent independent digital marketing agencies. In our conversation, we get real deep into all things paid growth, including what's changed with recent privacy shifts, why focusing on creatives is the new biggest opportunity within paid growth. How to think about attribution, and what's changed there. What to look for in people you hire to run paid growth for you, how AI is already changing how paid growth teams operate, and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Jonathan Becker after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:16):\nThis episode is brought to you by Brain Trust, where the world's most innovative companies go to find talent fast so that they can innovate faster.

What we're going to be doing with this episode, is we're going to be digging real deep into all things paid growth, which we've never done on this podcast yet. And normally I actually skip this part, but I thought it'd be actually helpful for you to spend a little bit of time to give us a little bit of background on your experience in the space of performance marketing, AKA paid growth, AKA paid ads. You tell us what the right term is for this genre. But yeah, just tell us what you've been up to in this area over the past decade and a half, I think.\n\nJonathan Becker (00:05:20):\nSure. No, that's a great way to kick things off. And again, thank you for having me here. If I think about it, my experience goes back about 15 years into this space. I started off as a web developer. And as I built and structured websites for people, I became pretty obsessed and fascinated with the fact that you could build landing pages or homepages, or whatever it was. Basically the content on a website, and structure it in a manner where you had the chance to surface in organic, so SEO results more prominently. And as I became a practitioner of SEO, SEO really being my first love of marketing, I started attracting attention and people wanted to hire me on as a freelancer. And what I noticed is that as people started asking me questions like, what was the ROI of our SEO campaign? Or, how do I scale this, or whatnot? The answers to their questions ended up being a lot more aligned with what then was the biggest driver in the paid acquisition world, which was paid search.\n\n(00:06:25):\nAnd so I started experimenting with paid search. And what I found was that it was a tangible format and lever through which we could basically give people the types of results they were expecting from SEO, but that were obfuscated in terms of Google's analysis algorithm from an organic point of view being somewhat intangible. And Google slowly removing a lot of the data early on that allowed you to guess and test more easily. 10 plus years later, what started off as this freelancer consultancy that I started running in a walk-in closet in my old apartment, became 130 people. And we manage about $500 million a year in ad spend for small and large companies, including Uber, Asana, Tempur-Pedic. We've worked with Lululemon. Very exciting companies, mostly from the United States, even though we randomly happen to be based in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nLenny (00:07:26):\nThere's a number of threads I'm going to pull on there over the course of our chat. But you mentioned Uber and you told me that you had a crazy story about how you actually landed Uber as a customer. Could you share that?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:07:35):\nI had been running Thrive for a couple years, and it was a very excellent regional agency in Canada with really cool local clients. In 2013, I got invited to go down to the TED conference, which was in Long Beach, California. And my friend Andrew Wilkinson asked me to join him at a dinner that night. I didn't know anybody from the TED community at the time. So we have dinner, and then afterwards as it goes at conferences, there's an after party. And so essentially I hop into a taxi, everybody else sped off in their cars, or however which way they were getting there. And as we're talking to the driver saying, \"Hey, we're going to this place, can you take us?\" There's a knock on the window and the person outside says, \"Hey, I think I'm heading to the same destination. Do you mind if I hop in this car with you?\"\n\n(00:08:25):\nAnd so we're like, of course. And I turn to him and I'm like, \"I'm Jonathan. I run a 10 person agency out of Vancouver.\" And he says, \"Hey, I'm Garrett Camp. I started a company called Uber.\" And so ironically, I meet the founder of Uber, the company that is in the process of disrupting the entire taxi industry worldwide in the back of a taxi cab. And what happened next basically changed my career forever. We end up at this party. At the time I was spamming Uber's referral program. Kind of a long story, but essentially I was using paid search to camp out on their branded keywords. And as people would sign up with my confusingly similar snippet to Uber's organic snippet, I was essentially siphoning off referral credits. So I would get $20 every single time someone signed up.\n\n(00:09:18):\nAnd I ended up making tens of thousands of dollars doing this. And so fast-forward, I'm getting a drink at the bar next to Garrett, and in my head I'm like, should I tell him about this? Maybe I can land them as a client. This would be really interesting. And essentially I tell him, I'm like, \"Hey, I'm doing this. I'm adding zero value, but this is a loophole in your marketing system, and someone should close it.\" He essentially is like, \"I need to report this to the board, but here's my card, write me what you're doing and we'll contact you.\" And so I get contacted by a bunch of his lieutenants. If you've read the book, Super Pumped. All the people that we dealt with at the time are in the book, and [inaudible 00:09:58]-\n\nLenny (00:09:58):\nI watched the show.\n\nJonathan Becker (00:10:00):\nYeah, exactly. And they were like, \"Hey, this is bad, you have to stop doing this. But can we hire you to solve the problem?\" And so what started off as me running projects for local bars in Vancouver, or clothing stores, or whatever it was. Turned into me landing early stage Uber as a client, and really graduating us from competent professionals to leaders in our sector. And so it was a fascinating project, and we worked with Uber for 10 years.\n\nLenny (00:10:32):\nThat is an incredible story. I love the arbitrage game you're running there. It's basically siphoning VC money out of Uber. And I guess the lesson there a little bit is just sometimes it's this interesting combination of hustle in terms of just make some money, and also taking advantage of this opportunity you were plopped into.\n\nJonathan Becker (00:10:53):\nYeah. I think people often talk about entrepreneurs who have been successful and they comment that they're lucky. Whereas, I actually look at that situation and I think that you have to make your own luck. I could have been like, oh, cool, I met this guy in the back of a taxi and that was it. But I decided to take a risk, being that I could get embarrassed or nothing could happen, or they could shut down this referral gimmicky thing that I was doing. I had very little to lose, I guess, ultimately. But a lot of people just don't make these moves in life because they're nervous, or they're worried too much about what the downside might be. And so I very much was like, I'm going to shoot my shot here. And you put yourself in situations where everybody has luck, but you have to capitalize on it basically. And so that was an example of being willing to take a risk, and it paying off pretty big time I think.\n\nLenny (00:11:46):\nAlso, being at Ted, that seems like a good move. Networking, paying off. Love that he was in a taxi, that's hilarious. I was going to ask you about that. And clearly, he's doing some research [inaudible 00:11:55].\n\nJonathan Becker (00:11:54):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:11:58):\nLet's start diving into the world of paid growth. And if you think about just paid growth.. And again, actually, what do you refer to this area as? Paid growth, performance marketing, paid ads?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:12:08):\nThere's a lot of interchangeable terms. Performance marketing is a common term. Paid acquisition is a common term. Some people think of those two things as growth marketing, whereas I see growth marketing as a bigger practice area within which paid acquisition sits. And then of course there's subsets, there's social ads, there's paid search, there's programmatic. And so there's a lot of different ways of saying the same thing.\n\nLenny (00:12:31):\nI'm going to use performance marketing. I like that term because it really describes what it is. It's like marketing with you can measure performance. Let's see how that goes. As a channel, it's such an interesting mix of, on the one hand it's this incredible growth lever that allows basically any company to spend money and understand the ROI and acquiring the users. This thing that never existed before. Essentially Facebook and Google created these platforms. On the other hand, there's this sense that it's this drug that you start and then you get hooked on and you can never leave. And there's a lot of advice of just, avoid paid growth. That's just not a good healthy way of growing, especially as a startup. And so my question to you is just, how do you think about that element of it? And then even more specifically, what products do you find paid growth as a channel is right for and not right for?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:13:24):\nYeah, it's a really great question. And so, I think there's a couple different things that need to be unpacked here. Paid acquisition or performance marketing-\n\nLenny (00:13:33):\nPerformance marketing. [inaudible 00:13:35]-\n\nJonathan Becker (00:13:34):\n... you can call it, can be seen as a drug, I suppose, when you are entirely reliant on it to fuel the revenue of your business. The analogy that I try and use here is that it would be very dangerous if I was advising you with your life savings and I told you to put it all in a single stock in the stock market. Stocks can be volatile. And as a result of that, your net worth would fluctuate quite a bit in the short-term and the long-term based on a lot of things that you don't control, like the external markets, or things that are happening within the performance of that particular company that you invested in. When I think about all of the marketing mix, so email, direct mail, linear television, performance, marketing, whatever it is, I think about it as investing capital with the expectation of a return. And in the same manner that I would not take all of your life savings and dump it into a single stock, I don't recommend putting all of your money into a single performance marketing channel, and then somewhat exposing you to the volatility of fluctuating CPCs or changing market conditions. I would agree with you that it is a drug, in a sense, if you have all of your eggs in one basket, and that basket takes you on a very intense rollercoaster in terms of performance. But when I think about the fact that Thrive manages $500 million a year, I think of myself to a extent as a fund manager, we are managing people's money with the expectation of a return. And part of the strategy is to diversify across channels. And so we decrease the reliance of any individual project on a singular channel and its performance.\n\n(00:15:26):\nAnd similarly, I always say to people that the first rule of performance marketing is not to forget about offline marketing and the classic marketing that works for organizations. In other words, direct mail can really work, email marketing works beautifully, SEO can really work. There's all of these wonderful things at your disposal. The real crash and burn scenarios that I've seen are these, not fly by night brands, but brands that figured out... Just like with Uber, I figured out this weird tie-in where I could make free money from their referral system. Sometimes people find shortcuts, hacks if you will, to scale rapidly because of one specific nuance of the Facebook ad platform, or something like that. And what they fail to see is that those loopholes come and go.\n\n(00:16:19):\nAnd so if they scale massively and their entire business is predicated on the performance of this one loophole that they found, or investing everything in a single channel, and then the conditions change, they're not going to be very happy and the business will suffer dramatically. And so when I think about this, it's a responsible channel mix, diversity, and understanding that you can't be overly reliant on performance marketing for the success or failure of your business.\n\nLenny (00:16:48):\nWhat about the second part of that question of when you think about when companies come to you. What do you look for to help you understand this is going to be a really good fit for performance marketing and this is going to give them a lot of opportunity to growth, versus maybe not, maybe it'll be a small sliver but it's not going to be a massive success for them?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:17:06):\nYeah. I would say that the answer to that question is different at different stages of a company's life cycle. Early stage, look at what the company is doing, look at your own company. Have you established product market fit? Is this an idea that has yet to be tested, and are they entirely looking to performance marketing to scale everything? Are they at risk of it becoming an over-reliance on performance marketing? At a later stage we look at certain criteria that they might or might not possess. Typically, that will come down to resourcing.\n\n(00:17:43):\nThe question at a later stage is not, does it work? But, to what scale can it work? And so we are looking at things like, do they have adequate creative resources and buy-in? Does creative resourcing tie into performance, and can we create a feedback loop there around testing? I'll talk to you about that in a bit. Do they have professional marketers on staff? Are there people who have experience doing what we do, that speak our language so to speak? Or is part of this an organizational educational, and creating buy-in through stakeholders process that needs to take place? Do they have technical resources? If we say, \"Hey, tracking and attribution is broken, here's how to solve that.\" Can you implement it? And so on and so forth.\n\n(00:18:27):\nThere's no one magic formula for what works or what type of company will be successful on performance marketing channels. Just as evidence of this, Google, which I think had a down quarter reported sales this week, and it was $70 billion in three months. And Facebook similarly just recorded yesterday evening, and it was $32 billion. That's $100 billion on just Google and Facebook in three months, and the majority of that revenue is from ads. This works really well for lots of different companies, it's just a question of at what scale.\n\nLenny (00:19:06):\nJust to pull an thread a little bit more. Something I've heard from other guests is that paid ads are best for products where you get basically payback really quickly, basically to feed the flywheel of spend so that you're not sitting around waiting for someone to buy something in the future, or it's a small trickle of pay. How important is that, I guess? Do you find that you could just do paid growth for any company, it doesn't matter their business model? Or is there something you're like, okay, this needs to exist for you to invest serious resources? And even hire that team that you just talked about.\n\nJonathan Becker (00:19:37):\nIt's always nice when there's a quick turnaround on investment and return. And that's wonderful for like D2C or e-commerce style businesses where they're essentially taking the revenue to fuel additional inventory and operating costs. However, not all businesses work that way. And so, in a B2C or B2B lead generation scenario, we have to undertake pretty sophisticated modeling around these abstract concepts, like lifetime value. Which is difficult, because most businesses are relatively new that we work with, and so the idea of lifetime value is a misnomer. They don't know what that is yet.\n\n(00:20:15):\nBut we have to model things like LTV to CAC, so cost per acquisition costs versus lifetime value and the period within which the payback occurs. You end up getting to a pretty sophisticated place where you can build out things like a lead scoring model, which predictively can determine in a statistically significant way the likelihood that one lead will convert to revenue over another. And so there are ways around the slower payback period that still end up being pretty accurate based on what you're bidding on today versus the latent revenue that will be accrued to those campaigns through attribution.\n\nLenny (00:20:58):\nDo you have any just rules of thumb for someone listening and trying to decide, is paid a real model for us, either on LTV or CAC, or payback period? Or something just like, here's what you probably should have, especially early stage for you to feel like paid growth is going to be a great lever for you to use, and maybe a primary lever.\n\nJonathan Becker (00:21:18):\nProduct market fit. If you know that your business sells into audiences. Let's say you are a social media influencer or you had a really strong email marketing game, or organically your content surfaces within Google search results. Or, you did a lot of direct mail and linear television and billboard advertising and that worked. If other things work, it is highly likely that paid acquisition will work. The issue for most companies is in this incorrect assumption that the data that is provided through paid channels allows you to have full end-to-end understanding of attribution. Which is wrong, it's never been that way. And the other aspect of this is the patience to understand that every business is unique, and these metrics that we know are important are different for every business. Lifetime value, like propensity to repurchase, ROAS, which is return on amount spent, CPA, CAC, all of these different things are different for every business.\n\n(00:22:24):\nEven if I worked with two hotels in the same city, they would have different results based on the nuances of their budget, their brand, the market that they sit within, the services that they offer, and so on and so forth. I think that everything else, the main problem here is that nobody should expect an overnight turnaround with performance marketing. It is a very difficult channel to manage, and that's why people hire experts like us to help them with it because it's a never ending problem with constantly changing issues. It's always been like that, that's not a new thing since pandemic, or whatever. And it will take some time to work out what works.\n\nLenny (00:23:07):\nI have this framework of there's these four growth channels, basically growth engines is what I call them. There's paid/performance marketing. There's SEO, there's virality in their sales. And essentially there's some companies whose growth is almost primarily paid. A few that come to mind are booking.com, which we know well at Airbnb, which is almost all paid growth driven. Credit Karma comes to mind as a classic paid performance marketing. I keep coming to paid growth as my term, so I'm just going to stick with that. TikTok initially was very performance marketing, paid growth oriented. Wish was another one I think about.\n\n(00:23:42):\nAnd I want to talk about how much things are changing within this realm. But before we get there, do you think there's still an opportunity for startups to emerge where they get to scale almost exclusively through performance marketing? And this question actually came from Twitter, someone tweeted this randomly the other day. And I was like, oh, that's a great question for Jonathan. And by the way, her name is Liz.\n\nLenny (00:24:00):\nAnd I was like, oh, that's a great question for Jonathan, and by the way, her name is Liz Georgie asked this question, so there you go.\n\nJonathan Becker (00:24:06):\nI'll put it this way. Every unicorn from the 2010s era that scale did performance marketing, but not everyone during that time who did performance marketing scaled. So I want to remove the bias here that just because all the successful organizations did this didn't mean that it was a magical channel for everyone. We had plenty of projects that we worked on that flatlined during that period. And so the sense that there was a period of time where this was easy or it worked on any project is not correct in my opinion. With that said, we see companies that are spending millions of dollars a month on performance marketing channels like Google and Meta still, despite all the ups and downs that they have faced and they do so profitably.\n\n(00:24:55):\nAnd I think there's some really great examples of companies that have scaled in relatively recent times, almost exclusively through paid. Grammarly is a really good example of this. They have been good at solving for this problem that exists around understanding the cost per acquisition versus lifetime value, how sticky customers are, predicting how much revenue can come from a customer and backing out into therefore how much we can pay per click and per lead and so on and so forth. Athletic Greens is another good example. So Athletic Greens is actually a pretty old company. I think they've been around for 10 years. I think they have retail distribution. I think they have done a lot of the more classic marketing things that are important in terms of developing that channel mix. But I think the amplification of that brand really, really gained traction quite recently where now everybody knows what Athletic Greens is, and that's because they're buying loads of ads on TikTok. They're buying loads of ads on other social channels like Facebook. They're investing in podcasting partnerships. But this is all digital paid acquisition.\n\n(00:26:07):\nAnd so it had a wonderful effect on this really interesting business that they had already built. So yes, it's still doable. We still see people doing it, and I think that there's been a bit of a reckoning in the performance marketing industry pertaining to things like privacy and the changes that Apple made and people being very creeped out at how their data is being used rightfully so. And then obviously the economy in 2022, we had a terrible macroeconomic shift where interest rates rise and inflation's out of control. And so of course the first thing that people cut are typically marketing budgets and we see Facebook and Google and other ad channels directly suffering from that. So all of that said, these storms pass. And so when the economy improves, generally speaking, I imagine people will go back to trying to find as much inventory from a pay per click point of view that they can purchase as possible and figuring out the economics of how to do that.\n\nLenny (00:27:08):\nI was definitely going to ask about that, and I love that you touched on it, just clearly a lot is changing in paid growth/performance marketing recently. You talked about the privacy stuff, you talked about COVID kind of shifted the way people spend and kind of dropped and then came back. So my question is who are you finding has the most success these days in performance marketing? And I will plant one seed, which from the examples you just shared, it feels like it's mostly companies that are very efficient. I think Grammarly, they're just super efficient as a business. And then I think Analytic Greens, they're a sponsor and their negotiations for sponsoring is just like, okay, here's the number that makes sense for them financially, and they're not going to go anywhere above that.\n\nJonathan Becker (00:27:49):\nYeah. Because they know, they understand how many impressions they'll get and on average what the quality of impression is and how many dollars they can put behind that before it has a cliff in terms of ROI.\n\nLenny (00:28:05):\nExactly. So broadly, who do you think is having the most success now with the changes and then generally, what should people know about what has changed in the past say year in the space of performance marketing?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:28:18):\nI'm not going to really be able to point to this company is really getting it right and I think that you can do that, but it's like saying, a friend of mine who recently on Twitter tweeted this funny thing where he was like, this is the number that I used to win the lottery said every successful founder ever trying to give advice to other founders. And so in other words, just because they won the lottery doesn't mean you're going to be successful picking the same number.\n\n(00:28:43):\nTo that extent, there is a bit of a playbook around modern day performance marketing, and that includes everything from really stringent and rigorous creative testing and thinking about that correctly to understanding the subjectivity of attribution and its strengths and weaknesses, doing a lot of work around validity of these campaigns. So really just the measurement and whatnot. Companies that can do those things and then understand their own marketing economics, in other words, quite basically how much can we afford to spend in acquiring a customer on any channel before that acquisition is no longer profitable. So really focusing on the profitability of the bottom line and not just break net growth, for instance. Companies that have those capabilities and see the world that way tend to be successful in performance marketing.\n\nLenny (00:29:39):\nWhen you were giving your intro, you talked about how you initially started doing SEO, that's where you started, and then you moved to paid growth. Well, how do you think about those two investments as a founder trying to decide which direction to go? What would your advice be of spend your time here versus there if X, Y, Z?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:29:56):\nWhen I'm asked a question of should we put money into organic search or paid search? My response is often that they're actually not mutually exclusive to one another. So it's a great idea to do both, and that backs into my strategy of diversification of channels. So don't build up exclusively in one area and create volatility within your marketing mix essentially. SEO is a wonderful marketing capability when it's built out correctly. I think the issues that you run into are cause and effect related. So one of the things that people really like about performance marketing theoretically is that we can spend a certain amount and then if we're modeling things correctly, we can essentially determine how much revenue is generated from the actions that we took. Finance teams love that, C-suite teams love that, they can build projections, they can budget around it. There's some degree of predictability around it if it's done properly.\n\n(00:30:52):\nSearch engine optimization is different in that the attribution can be tough. It's difficult to determine whether ultimately the actions that you took contributed to a rise in organic traffic. You have to essentially correlate that. And the reason is because when you build clusters of content and it's grouped thematically and you're targeting buckets of keywords, whether they're long tail or head keywords, whatever it may be, you can publish all of that on your website. Google still has to crawl it. They run it through their analysis algorithm, which is comprised of 200 different signals, of which maybe 20 to 30 have been publicly disclosed. So it's a bit of a black box.\n\n(00:31:37):\nWe don't really know ultimately what ROI comes off of that unless you're very sophisticated, like probably one of your other guests, Ethan, in terms of measurement. Whereas paid, the ROI is still a difficult problem to solve, but there was a lot more of a linear relationship as it relates to attribution. And so paid being tangible was the reason why I leaned heavily into paid and ultimately away from SEO. But I do think that if you do SEO properly, the payoffs are indisputable and it is certainly an important part of a modern media mix.\n\nLenny (00:32:18):\nYou mentioned this earlier, I've heard this more and more recently that one of the biggest levers these days in paid growth is around creatives. It's not tooling or smarter data, or you tell me if I'm wrong, but it's just getting better creatives. And so I'll let you actually explain, what are creatives? There's a term creatives that people outside the industry don't really necessarily get. And then broadly, what should people be doing to optimize the way they approach creatives?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:32:46):\nCertainly. So when we say creative, we're referring to the assets that power typically visual programmatic or pay per click campaigns on social channels or display networks. And so literally the motion graphics ad that you see on Facebook, the user generated content that you see on TikTok or a static ad that you might see that has a pretty picture in it or whatever. And so I think that when we talk about creative as a big lever around efficiency and optimization, the underlying conversation there is that over time our industry has been heavily automated. So a lot of the levers so to speak around performance have been automated by Google and Facebook over the last seven to 10 years. That's because originally when you ran these campaigns, you needed to have a rocket scientist in front of them. It was so complicated and there were so many different things that you could get wrong, and their solution, the channels like the big tech company solution to this is figuring it out for you. So eventually Google wants you to say, hey, I'm Google, give me your credit card and I'll take care of everything else. Facebook-\n\nLenny (00:33:57):\nAnd the URL to point people to, and then we'll do the rest.\n\nJonathan Becker (00:34:00):\nYeah. I don't know if that's a great idea for consumers, by the way. But in the meantime, there's certain things that have just been fully automated. In the context of creative, it's still one of these things that for now is not auto-generated in the world of AI and all the changes that we're seeing. Maybe that's something that will change. But for now, essentially creative directors and their teams are concepting and producing different types of assets. And so there's a bunch of problems that we typically see when people come to us. So number one, performance marketing and brand marketing in a lot of organizations are two different things. And the designers that occupy brand teams bandwidth and whatnot often don't have a sense of how paid acquisition works.\n\n(00:34:48):\nAnd so one of the pitfalls of working with certain companies or the mistake that they make is the design team will hand off a file full of random assets for paid acquisition without any sense of how the channel works. And what I mean by that is these days we're using the analogy, the classic analogy of the funnel to organize our thinking around creative assets. So you can think about this as generating intent at the top of funnel and capturing intent at the bottom of the funnel. When I think about an experience that I want a consumer to have on Facebook, audience targeting and creative, I think about us beginning a conversation at the top of funnel creatively with an audience, having that conversation change as we say different things, and the audience that we're targeting ultimately graduates through different behaviors on our website from one to another, and then ultimately it resulting in an end to the conversation where they take an action hopefully that the brand that we're working with is looking for.\n\n(00:35:56):\nAnd so there's a clear beginning, middle and end to that. And one of the major pitfalls that we see is that certain brands just dump one homogenous message into all of their targeting. You see the same ad over and over again. It creates banner blindness and it's a total lack of efficiency. The antidote to that is to have resources dedicated to paid and essentially iterate upon the creative assets themselves based on the data that we see coming from ad sets and campaigns in various channels. And so what that means is that you have to experiment. You have to take a bit of a scientific approach, although it's a bit of an art and a bit of a science. You have to try and isolate variables, maintain similar conditions across targeting, and then determine which style and feature of an ad performs best at which stage of the funnel versus which audience. And the results that we see are dramatically different from brand to brand. But if you are not undertaking rigorous testing in conjunction with how you are driving the iteration and design of your ads, then you will not make progress essentially.\n\nLenny (00:37:11):\nIs there a specific example that comes to mind here as something we did that just dramatically changed the impact of a change to a creative? Or if you can't think of one, are there just specific tactics that you can suggest for people to improve the way they approach creatives?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:37:28):\nYeah. So I think from a testing point of view, let's say I was running ads on Meta, beneath the campaign level when I create a campaign, the structure that my testing might take would be that I would have an audience, a single audience at the ad set level, and then I would have two nearly identical creatives within that ad set. The only thing being different across those two creative assets is a single variable. So it might be the copy, it might be an image or whatnot. That allows us to isolate a lot of variables and really test into one singular change across two creative assets. There's a lot of nuance to this. So sometimes the ad-serving algorithms, even when we set up a test structurally in that way, we'll serve one ad a different number of impressions than the other ad, in which case we then have to say, what is a leveling factor that allows us to look at these two ads equally, even though one received dramatically more impressions than the other?\n\n(00:38:31):\nThis becomes where it becomes subjective in terms of how you want to determine success. But a good example is looking at the click-through rate, which is essentially a ratio or a metric like impressions until conversion, which is a leveling metric that allows us to determine, even though in a scenario where two ads facing the same audience within the same campaign received different numbers of impressions, we can still measure the efficiency or effectiveness of one ad over the other using metrics like that. And so from a testing point of view, I think that this is one way that we might look at trying to assess ad performance so that we can gather learnings, send that back to a creative team and say, hey, it turns out that when this copy is used at this stage of the funnel, it converts 50% more frequently than this other copy.\n\n(00:39:26):\nSo let's now take that copy, use it as our base copy and challenge it with a different type of copy and see if we can continually iterate and refine. So that's a very practical example of how ad creative testing might work on a channel like Meta. You asked for specific examples where we've seen an unlock. There's two that come to mind. Several years ago we realized that highly produced ads from brand teams, and there's nothing wrong with brand teams, we work with them all the time. They do amazing work. I think we're just trying to work as a singular unit as opposed to being fragmented. But a lot of the brand guidelines of different companies would end up yielding these highly polished assets. And when you launch those on Instagram back in the day or something like that, what we found is that they would always underperform next to user generated assets.\n\n(00:40:23):\nSo a brand that essentially has an influencer in front of it that says, I tried this product, I love it, I'm filming this ad from my iPhone. Look, check it out. Here's the product, here's me, I'm better off for it. Whatever it is that they're talking about. The unpolished iPhone, mobile phone creative, suddenly we realized massively outperformed these other channels because there was an authenticity to it. And rather than the brands themselves saying, hey, trust us, our product is great, here's a third party essentially validating what is so great about these brands, basically. So I can't speak to specific clients because I'm not allowed to talk about the work that we've done in large part, but that would be one example. And another example is we worked with a furniture company several years ago, which scaled dramatically, but they were having difficulty early on thinking through how to scale social ads.\n\n(00:41:21):\nAnd so paid search worked really well for them. Social ads, again, they had these highly produced styled rooms and one of the owners had their dog in the office all the time, and so they have these models sitting on furniture or whatever it was, and they would take these beautiful styled shots of their furniture in a room and one of the art directors was like, put the dog on the couch and let's take some photos of dogs on furniture, which made it more playful and approachable. That one change resulted in a total unlock of their performance on paid social channels. It would double or triple the ROAS that we were seeing type thing. So it's these minute differences that you can test into that ultimately can drive performance.\n\nLenny (00:42:04):\nThat reminds me of Airbnb. The photography team found, and actually the photography team was initially including people in the photos of listings, and that was the [inaudible 00:42:16] images of listing photos. And it turns out when there's no people in the listing photo, much higher conversion. And the theory basically people don't want to see other random strangers in a place they're going to sleep, and that was not expected.\n\nJonathan Becker (00:42:29):\nThat's a really great example. And so the question becomes, as a company and as a brand, do you arrive at those learnings anecdotally by accident? Is it the brilliance of one person on the team that the whole brand is predicated upon in terms of performance? Or do you put a very rigorous structure around testing and the iteration of assets and how to determine whether something works over another thing that is a process that yields the outcomes that you're looking for? And so a lot of times with agencies, people talk to us about the obvious hard skills that we have, but the soft skills are around process that can be deployed, that can actually be the difference between being highly sophisticated or unsophisticated. Internal teams do this too, but that Airbnb example is a great illustration of how if you put the right testing in place, you can yield an outcome that becomes an unlock for performance.\n\nLenny (00:43:28):\nGetting even more tactical with that idea of testing a bunch of creatives makes me think about a story from chatting with a guy from Wish who's had a growth at Wish about how they uploaded hundreds of variations. And I think Wish is the epitome of the opposite of brand highly polished ads or it's just the most ridiculous looking product with just banners and numbers and prices and crossouts and all kinds of stuff, just anything that would take to get people to click. Is there a tool or process that you can point people to to help them do this testing on creatives or is it mostly built into the existing tools now and there's nothing really fancy about it?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:44:04):\nWe get asked this a lot and I think there are tools for different types of functions that we undertake in the process of running paid acquisition for different brands, but these days most of the testing that we do is within the channels themselves. So Meta ads, Google Ads, I keep touching on those two specifically because they're the most advanced in my opinion. They're really powerful. The good news here is that you don't necessarily need some exotic tool to do sophisticated creative testing. You can do it in platform and you can use the structure that I just kind of outlined as a starting point.\n\nLenny (00:44:43):\nYou mentioned Google and Facebook. What is your take on TikTok and YouTube and maybe Snap? Do you recommend people go there and there's a big opportunity? Do you think it's overblown? Do you think people should just take Google and Facebook basically at this point? What's your general advice?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:44:59):\nSo when I say Google and I say Facebook, I'm talking about the Google ecosystem of channels inclusive of YouTube. And when I talk about Facebook, I'm talking about Facebook, Instagram, and probably eventually WhatsApp, which I think will probably launch ads later this year. With all that said, some interesting opportunities these days really exist on channels like Amazon and TikTok as well as a number of other challenger channels I think. Snap I'll talk a little bit less about because I think really there's just fewer and fewer people potentially using Snap. There's no knock on Snap. I use Snap, I like it a lot, but at the same time, most individuals or organizations tend to want to place ads where there's a lot of views and engagement and the king of this right now is definitely TikTok. And so TikTok faces its own set of challenges and arguably there is as much an opportunity there as a barrier at the moment.\n\n(00:45:58):\nI love TikTok. I'm a consumer of content on TikTok, not a producer of content on TikTok. Their ads platform kind of reminds me of where Facebook ads was like six, seven years ago. It's not super sophisticated and attribution is not great yet, but you can get cheap CPCs because there's just fewer organizations advertising there. Fewer companies have figured out how to make that work. And same thing with Amazon. Amazon is a bit of a bespoke channel. It doesn't work for a B2B SaaS company. It's more specific to D2C I would say. But essentially those channels are wonderful. They're not at the point yet where they're kind of ubiquitous. Every single advertiser that has ever worked with us I think in the last 10 years is for sure on Google. Everybody does that. And then the question is, what else can I invest money in with the expectation of profitability?\n\n(00:46:53):\nAnd so TikTok and Amazon, and even if I want to break out YouTube, they tend to be a little bit more specific and they definitely work, but not for everybody yet. And so the question becomes, will TikTok become as prominent as a social ads platform like Meta Ads? And we just don't know yet. What we see working very nicely on TikTok, by the way, are these founder led brands where the founder is the ambassador and they're doing those handheld videos with their iPhone. They're talking about the merits of the products that they make. They're talking about the problems that they solve. They are great at cultivating a following. Their content is highly engaging. Those types of organizations crush it. Also, companies that got really good at partnering with influencers. So we haven't talked about partner marketing that much, but affiliate marketing companies got into this early, and then influencer marketing networks are all over this. But essentially having these third parties be an ambassador for your brand in an authentic way, partnering with them, having them generate the content. And that's the nature of the partnership. Stuff like that seems...\n\nJonathan Becker (00:48:00):\n... And that's the nature of the partnership. Stuff like that seems to work quite well.\n\nLenny (00:48:05):\nAwesome, I love those bullet points of just what is likely to work on TikTok.\n\nJonathan Becker (00:48:05):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:48:09):\nJust broadly, would you say TikTok advertising today is underrated, overrated, or just right?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:48:16):\nIf you are e-comm based, if you're wholesale, retail based, anything direct to consumer, you have to investigate TikTok and try and figure out whether there's a way of promoting your products there, basically. It's a massive, highly engaged audience with somewhat specific demographics. It's a very exciting opportunity. Other brands need to pay attention to this and figure out what their entry point is going to be. And just because the innovation hasn't happened for B2B SaaS yet on TikTok doesn't mean it won't. TikTok wants that to happen, and so the question becomes how. And so someone will unlock that, and they'll make a billion dollars because of it.\n\n(00:48:59):\nBut I wouldn't recommend that channel to everybody yet, and at Thrive for instance, we don't have a huge amount of people coming to us yet saying, \"Hey, I'm spending $750,000 a month on TikTok, can you help me?\" Type thing. The other problem with TikTok is that it's extraordinarily creative, asset dependent, and heavy. And so you are launching net new assets several times per week, it is hard for creative teams and brands to produce that much content. It takes a machine, and that's expensive, and so that all factors into the cost of not only just the ad dollars, but the creative resourcing and investment that's required to power that. So it can be done in a more nimble manner if you're spending less, but you can't really get to a million dollars a month on TikTok without having a huge amount of creative being pushed to that channel.\n\nLenny (00:49:56):\nAwesome, that's really good advice. I want to chat out about AI soon, just because I imagine that could help with some of these things. But you mentioned B2B SaaS, and I wanted to ask, I imagine Google is the primary channel for B2B SaaS, and if not, or if it is, where else do you find there's value in spending money to drive growth through B2B SaaS, which channels and ad networks?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:50:20):\nSo I'm agnostic here in terms of where people should be spending money. I see this world in terms of impressions and clicks, and does that conform to the marketing economics of a project that needs to be achieved in order for it to grow. It's less about where to place your money and how to think about the placement of those funds. And so the common mistake that we see as people build out a funnel, so to speak, for B2B lead gen projects, or B2C lead gen projects, is they'll be overly reliant on the first of a sequence of metrics that ultimately yields a sale.\n\n(00:50:57):\nSo typically it's something like cost per lead, marketing qualified lead, sales accepted lead, there might be a couple more metrics there, and then eventually a sale occurs. And so that the thinking is that, okay, for sales to occur, I need more leads at the top of the funnel. The more leads I have, the more marketing qualified leads I'll get, the more sales accepted leads get, and ultimately the more opportunities there will be and the more revenue will generate.\n\n(00:51:24):\nAnd so if I think about this world of lead generation on performance marketing platforms as a function of cost per lead in that sense that I just described, then the tendency is always to want to drive down the cost per lead, thinking that that's the efficiency, I can get more cheaper leads and that will yield more revenue. When in fact it turns out that if you flip that conversation on its head and say, not all opportunities and sales are equal, and instead of focusing upfront on a cost per lead, I now want to focus on what is a high value customer, so the cost per lead is actually higher, but the ROI of targeting those people is also higher. And so to get the higher quality leads, it's not a function of CPL.\n\n(00:52:15):\nAnd so that is a very common pitfall that we see when people come to us. The antidote to this, it's interesting, so Thrive developed an ETL tool, an extract transfer load tool called Thrive Stack. It's not commercially available, but if you wanted a commercially available version of this, you can use something called Supermetrics. Basically Supermetrics is a data connector. There's a world of different data connectors out there, but it allows you to pipe, via an API, revenue data from your CRM into a third party database that can then be joined with data from the channel itself. You can build tables within a database and normalize them together in a manner where you can start to determine the relationship between, again, the audience that a particular cohort of opportunities came from and whether a sufficient degree of revenue is derived from those opportunities.\n\n(00:53:08):\nAnd then you can build upon that what is known as a lead scoring model, which allows you to bid in real time on the audiences that have a higher likelihood to convert to high revenue generating customers. And so the magic there, we talked a little bit about rates of return and instant gratification in the performance marketing world, lead generation inherently is a slow gratification process. And so the problem is that if my pipeline is full of opportunities that yield revenue in two months, six months, sometimes 12 months, how do I determine how heavily to bid on different leads today in order to predictively have an outcome where I'm maximizing revenue? And a lead scoring model basically solves for that.\n\nLenny (00:53:59):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request, head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming.\n\n(00:54:20):\nAnd while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on. For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming using sticky notes, reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, dry ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research, to product roadmaps, to customer journey flows, to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro. com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.\n\n(00:55:06):\nYou talked about attribution, and I thought this would be a great time to get into that. So the way I think about this is oftentimes the biggest challenge in driving growth isn't the actual work you do to drive growth, it's measuring what impact your work is having and understanding where dollars are spent effectively. And things are changing heavily in attribution land with privacy shifts and ATT and iOS 14.5.1, or maybe whatever the version was that came out that changed everything. And so my question is, what changed, is one, in terms of being able to do attribution. Maybe even explain what attribution means for folks that are just like, what the hell are you even talking about? And then finally, just what do you recommend people do now to do attribution well in this new environment?\n\nJonathan Becker (00:55:57):\nYeah, it's a really, really great and pertinent question in the industry, and it has a lot of focus on it now, but attribution has always been a conversation that's been very important. So just to kick things off, attribution essentially is how we determine the relationship between what we did and what happened. In the context of performance marketing this means what ads did we serve, what campaigns did we launch, and generally what was the revenue ultimately that was derived from these campaigns? And so there's a funny quote that I love, someone named John Wanamaker in 1919 said, \"I know-\"\n\nLenny (00:56:33):\nI bet I'm going to guess what it is.\n\nJonathan Becker (00:56:34):\nDo you want to guess?\n\nLenny (00:56:35):\nIt's, \"Half my marketing dollars are wasted, I just don't know which half.\"\n\nJonathan Becker (00:56:41):\nExactly, I love that you knew that. He said this in 1919. The world was a very different place there, but oddly enough we still have these types of problems today and it's because the world of what I did and what happened because of what I did is very complicated. There's so many variables, some of which we know, and then some of which we don't know that we don't know, type thing. And so attribution, as it stands in our industry, is still an incredibly subjective art and somewhat of a science. It doesn't mean that it's impossible, and it doesn't mean that there aren't varying degrees of sophistication as it relates to attribution, but we're still in a place where we have to understand the business and its goals, and then start to work on an attribution model.\n\n(00:57:32):\nAn attribution model is probably something that is never solved, but I'll give you a couple of examples. So number one around attribution, it's important to determine whether an organization, a company, a client, is focused on profitability or growth. Whether I use one attribution lens or another will drive those outcomes. And so these days, for a number of different reasons, you mentioned iOS 14.5, in addition to third party cookie deprecation, and whatnot.\n\n(00:58:02):\nThere's no one way necessarily of approaching attribution. The most classic and commonly held version of attribution used to be a cookie-based form of attribution called last click attribution, meaning that the last click in the sequence of clicks that yielded a conversion would be attributed with all the revenue from that conversion. Other models in a cookie-based world involved first touch attribution, so it's actually the first click. So I launch an ad, it's in an audience that doesn't know about my service or my brand, and so the first click that I get should be given all the credit for that sale. And then there's multi-touch attribution, which can take several different forms, but essentially is saying it's not one way or the other of the two first versus last click options, it's somewhere in between. So I'm going to create a weighted attribution model where the first touch gets so much of the credit and the last touch gets so much of the credit.\n\n(00:58:59):\nThis is very subjective, as you can see. I am essentially looking at my business model, determining what my goals are, and then I'm backing out into an attribution methodology that I think adheres to both the economics of my business and the capabilities of these platforms. And again, we live in a world where a single brand might do television advertising, they might buy media in magazines, they might buy billboards, they might get impressions from Facebook, they might do paid search, so there's a big argument over how to ultimately model this.\n\n(00:59:34):\nSo there was something called an IDFA that Apple allowed advertisers to use, and essentially what that was, it literally means ID for advertisers, and it allowed Facebook, Google, and other advertisers, Snap, TikTok, whoever was essentially selling ads that were predicated on being displayed on a Apple mobile device or a desktop device, it allowed the advertiser to provide attribution metrics and certain types of customer match metric metrics in their own platforms. And so when Apple ultimately launches its privacy changes, I believe in mid-2021, overnight it allows users to say, \"Well, I don't want to share that information, I'm not going to share my IDFA anymore.\" Or, \"Yes, I do want to share my IDFA.\" And so what you see as a result of that is less of the core data that Facebook in particular would've required to make attribution more airtight and ultimately validate its advertising.\n\n(01:00:43):\nSo because we can no longer validate attribution on Facebook as seamlessly, we are in a situation where we're not sure any longer which audiences to target, and we're not sure how to run all of our creative testing, and ultimately we can't even determine the degree of revenue that's coming from particular campaigns that we've launched, and whatnot. And so it created quite a stir in the world of attribution, which is obviously this core discussion to is it working or not? People want to answer John Wanamaker's question, but the modern methodology now is through a number of different approaches to validation.\n\n(01:01:25):\nSo the cookie based attribution, which had been probably the most popular version of attribution in the 2010s, really up to this point, is now one of the ways that we would look at this, but we would also include things like various forms of statistical modeling, customer surveys, population surveys, there's a number of different ways to the same place here. Statistical modeling, by the way, one thing that's very popular these days, which I think was originally created in the 1950s, is a form of statistical modeling called media mix modeling. It's essentially regression analysis, and it is trying to determine the causal relationship between, again, what you did and what the effect was on revenue. That's very topical in the industry these days. If you're looking for a tool off the shelf that can help with this, Recast is something that I see people using. But a lot of organizations build these highly customized bespoke models that ultimately feed the algorithm inside of an MMM model in a customized manner.\n\nLenny (01:02:27):\nWhat is it, or is there a recommendation of just like, hey, if you're trying to do attribution today, here's what you should do. Is there a clear, do this, piece of advice, or is it super personalized depending on what you're trying to do?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:02:42):\nThe advice is that there's no single source of truth. Anyone who claims that they are a single source of truth, whether it's an individual, a model that they've created, or a tool that they've created, is not being accurate. I believe that the approach that works to attribution is that it's an ongoing investigation and it never stops, and essentially what you're doing is looking for evidence that validates the outcome of your performance marketing campaigns one way or the other.\n\n(01:03:12):\nThere have been plenty of incredibly sophisticated attribution models that we've helped build and invalidated with MMM or other types of tools that have indicated that the campaigns do not work. So I will repeat that, we, a very sophisticated organization, have stood up campaigns that we measure and ultimately determine do not work, and that is an important finding in terms of an organization's determination of whether they want to continually invest, take budget out of these channels, or invest into other areas.\n\nLenny (01:03:49):\nAwesome. You mentioned a company called Recast. I don't think you knew this, but I'm actually an investor, and so obviously a big fan, so check it out. I don't know what the site is, recast.com maybe. I think if you Google Recast attribution, we'll also have a link in the show notes.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:04:02):\nCool. Yeah, they're working with a couple of our clients right now and it's interesting, I like their approach.\n\nLenny (01:04:06):\nYeah, they're basically, they're building the model as a SaaS tool to do attribution in a really clever way. Amazing. Okay, just a couple more questions, one is around AI, one is around agencies, and just how to start down this road. How has AI in any way impacted the work you're doing today, or the work of paid growth, performance marketing, and then where do you think this will go in the next few years?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:04:29):\nInterestingly, and I think I alluded to this earlier, but our industry has been influenced by AI for over a decade. So Google, Facebook, even Microsoft, these are some of the organizations that historically have been at the bleeding edge of artificial intelligence, and their goal was always to automate as much as possible within these platforms. And so the effect ultimately that we've seen from a human capital point of view is displacement. So we're actually, we have more people now than we've ever had, but the nature of the work that they do is more strategic, it's more about modeling, validation, asking the right questions, being focused around creative levers, like some of the things that we've talked about, and less so the trench work of implementation and bid modifiers at the keyword level on Google search, and some of the really hardcore manual analysis we had to do.\n\n(01:05:19):\nSo I think if we are the canary in the coal mine for other industries, what will be interesting is I assume that if you work in an architecture office that you'll be doing less of the drafting, and it's already been a change that's occurred in those offices, but you'll be doing less of the drafting and more of this strategic problem solving around what kind of building is necessary for the client in this scenario, type thing.\n\n(01:05:42):\nAnd so on a practical level, though, some of these conversational AI models are very interesting for us in that when I think about creative testing, for instance, we can have ChatGPT come up with all kinds of variants of copy that we would not have necessarily thought of. It can do a lot of drafting of things like RFP responses, so we can feed ChatGPT 100 previous RFP responses that we've done and have it spit out net new responses to net new questions in a net new RFP, and it's like 80% good and still requires 10 hours of work to massage to the point where we can send it off to a client, but that replaces a week of work with five or six people that it would've previously taken.\n\nLenny (01:06:33):\nAnd that's already happening today, you're saying?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:06:35):\nThat's happening now, literally right now, type thing, all of what I just said. And there's a lot of different ways that we are beginning to use AI to do more with less, basically. So that's how I see it influencing not just our industry, but other people's businesses as well.\n\nLenny (01:06:55):\nThat's amazing. So just to repeat what you said, your team now, because of ChatGPT is able to spend more time higher level, and leverage specifically ChatGPT to do this kind of, and RFPs are basically proposals, people are asking you to pitch to work with them, is that?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:06:55):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:07:12):\nOkay, yeah.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:07:13):\nSome of these AI-driven organizations that allow you to type in a prompt and it spits out an image, on our creative group we can come up with mockups in literally 1% of the time that it took. So you no longer have to draw the initial mockups for art. Suddenly what might have taken one person a week of work on a campaign takes an afternoon, type thing. You still have to understand what questions to ask of the AI and be capable of iterating, but these rough drafts that you might show the artwork of to a client to say, \"Do we like this more or do we like this more?\" That's AI generated. It's really interesting.\n\nLenny (01:07:55):\nWhat's the tool your team uses for that, is it MidJourney or Dall-E or something else?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:08:00):\nIt's Dall-E and it's MidJourney, so you got it.\n\nLenny (01:08:03):\nGot it. And so what you use it for is you're thinking about a concept and you just come up with a mock, coming up with a prompt to pitch what this could be.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:08:11):\nYeah, the interesting thing there is that these concepts often live inside of someone's head, and we do this thing as humans where we verbally discuss it, and I try and put the image in my mind's eye, in your mind's eye, which is an inherently inefficient process and actually hurts our ability to be creative leaders. Someone might just see it slightly differently than you do. Now that person theoretically can use Dall-E to output what is inside their head, and they can refine that easily through subsequent prompts in Dall-E or MidJourney, or whatever it may be, and then just say, \"Do you like this? This is my idea.\" And so in a way it's helped humans connect more easily in that context than we were capable of doing before, and then in the context of pitching a client on ideas, we are capable of generating more ideas faster and iterating upon them live. So I can have a Zoom call with you, I can present my screen, and if you don't like the output of Dall-E that I just prompted, I can re-prompt based on your feedback in real time.\n\nLenny (01:09:16):\nThere's this sentiment that AIs going to take away the fun stuff of jobs, like maybe being creative and coming up with a new concept and photography, setting up a whole photo shoot, whatever.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:09:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:09:30):\nDo you find that your team is excited about uploading this to Dall-E, or are they just like, goddammit, this is what I loved, and now I'm just sitting around in docs writing prompts.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:09:40):\nI am not an incredible artist, but now I can take those thoughts in my mind and output them just as well as someone who's pretty skilled in artwork. So in a sense, I'm excited because this technology democratizes the ability to do this across everyone. Anyone who can think a thought can generate an image on an AI image generator. How many scribes do you know?\n\nLenny (01:10:04):\nZero, I believe zero.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:10:06):\nBecause we invented something called the printing press, and the printing press took over what was a cottage industry for very specific individuals that allowed them to control the flow of information. Yet today it's not like we have fewer writers or creative thinkers, they're just using different tools to arrive at the same place. You could say the same thing of the loom. There used to be people who would stitch your T-shirt together, or your sweater together, and none of those people have work anymore. There's still people who knit, I suppose. But your clothes are made in factories with machines, and the quality of the clothing is arguably a lot better than it was, maybe I'm wrong about that point, but you can make more of it and more sophisticated clothing.\n\n(01:10:46):\nThere's no question that AI is going to displace and replace certain industries of people, certain roles. I'm not going to pretend like I know whether that's a good or bad thing, and I'm also not a poster child for AI, I am really just using the technology that's available to us to run our business the best way we can. We haven't let anybody go yet because of these efficiencies. The people who used to do the artwork are the ones using these tools, and I think they're excited that they're more productive. Is there going to be nuance around that? Of course. Are some people going to be sad about the changes? Yes. I think human nature is that people generally don't like change, but I think over time we've seen change has been a productive and positive thing for society, not a negative thing.\n\nLenny (01:11:35):\nAwesome. Yeah, so it sounds like the team is excited, generally, and that's a good sign, and that's what I find generally. I think some people will be really upset, but most people will be like, amazing, and they never wanted to do this part.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:11:47):\nThis generation of people will be upset, and then there will be a subsequent generation that never knew anything different. So the way that I think about this is the people growing up these days have always had the internet, whereas you and I probably remember a time before the internet existed. AI-\n\nJonathan Becker (01:12:00):\nYou and I probably remember a time before the internet existed. AI is a platform like the internet and just as when the internet was launched, you couldn't conceive of amazon.com or all of these wonderful or social networks or whatever it was. The permutations of what AI will become, even in the current GPT 4 context or Dolly context or whatever it may be. We don't know what people are going to create with this and so it's difficult for the generation that knew what life was like beforehand, before iPhone, before internet, before AI, but there will be people who know nothing but this eventually, and to them it'll just be normal.\n\nLenny (01:12:42):\nUntil we're all just replaced by AI and then it's AI writing ads to get other AI tools to buy products from each other.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:12:42):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:12:49):\nAnd then we're just sitting around watching Netflix and that'll be great. There's always this question when you're starting to invest in paid growth, performance marketing of should we work at an agency? Should we work? Should we hire someone junior to figure it out? Should we hire someone senior?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:13:03):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:13:03):\nWhat's your general advice for, say, an early stage startup when it makes sense to work with an agency versus bringing someone in-house?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:13:12):\nMm-hmm. We need people in-house to do our jobs properly. Agencies are not mutually exclusive to personnel in-house. If we don't have a point of contact, for instance, at an earlier stage company and we're supposed to report to the CEO, CEOs tend to be very busy people and we often just can't get the information and approvals that we need to be successful. If you think that growth marketing is an opportunity and that performance marketing is a subset of growth marketing that you want some focus on, the reality is you're going to need expertise and you probably should start in-house and then hire an agency.\n\n(01:13:49):\nAgain, there's different stages of companies and different examples of what makes sense at different stages and the nature of the work that we do at different stages changes. Very, very late stage, we're kind of doing a lot of this sophisticated production work. We're implementing sophisticated testing, we're working on attribution, we're building beautiful reporting, but in a sense, we're maintaining this machine that already exists. Earlier stage, we're doing a lot more of net new experimentation, trying to discover what is working and what sequence of audience targeting versus creative asset display will work, what channel mix works, and all of that. A lot of times the body of work that's required to nail that and the inputs to literally out front what questions to be asking isn't something that a small in-house team possesses and so they will work with an agency to scale faster, to get where they're going quicker, to bring in more resources quickly, basically. Then later stage, sometimes it's a permutation of the same thing or we're really just managing a whole bunch of different capabilities that they have because it's very complicated and difficult to staff.\n\nLenny (01:15:05):\nThat is really interesting. So it's not like agency versus in-house full-time person. It's you need both is what you're finding.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:15:11):\nI don't think we have any projects that we're working on where there's not a professional marketing person as our POC and generally the people that we report to have a background in what we do, whether they ended up doing something different and now they're a VP or a director level and not directly managing channels themselves is one thing or another. But yeah, we work with people that have in-house expertise all day long.\n\nLenny (01:15:35):\nI see. Sometimes it could just be a generalist marketing person that becomes your point of contact.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:15:35):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:15:39):\nThey don't have to be experienced in paper.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:15:41):\nThere's one more thing. As agencies, we're constantly solving people's problems in the market and as a result of that, I have a fairly large team of 130 people that think about performance marketing all day long. It's the first thing we think about when we have our morning coffee and it's the last thing we think about as we're leaving the office kind of thing. We have very sophisticated and built out capabilities as well as all kinds of software and processes and capabilities, I guess, that we've created that most in-house teams just don't have because they're smaller or newer or someone might be really sophisticated but they don't have the resources to implement it and stuff. In the same way that a really sophisticated organization might go to Boston Consulting Group or McKenzie to say, \"Hey, we did this, but you do more of this all day long and we need advice on how to be more efficient,\" people come to Thrive saying, \"Hey, we're top of our game. We have really strong people. They absolutely know what they're doing,\" which is always the case by the way, \"But we're looking for extra sophistication and additional capabilities that are very difficult to create in an in-house organization.\" It's why we worked with Uber for 10 years. It was tough to replace us.\n\nLenny (01:16:59):\nYeah, that's quite the retention. 10 years, 10 years going, I imagine our net dollar retention has gone up too.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:17:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:17:09):\nWhen you're looking to hire someone full-time to drive the paid growth channel and/or work with an agency, what do you recommend people look for specifically, especially things maybe they're not likely to think about when they're hiring someone that people often miss?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:17:26):\nThere's a couple of competencies that I think are very important. I found that, so I was a nerd as a child, if you can't tell, I don't know.\n\nLenny (01:17:35):\nNope.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:17:35):\nSuper nerdy, geeky kid. I would take apart-\n\nLenny (01:17:38):\n[inaudible 01:17:38].\n\nJonathan Becker (01:17:39):\nI would take apart my parents' computers, I'd try and rebuild them. I was fooling around with bulletin boards before websites existed, stuff like that. Then I became a web developer and as I transitioned into a performance marketing role, I realized that being technical and having technical aptitudes was extraordinarily helpful in terms of being on the front line of what we were doing and solving problems. If you're making your first hire, you probably want them to have the ingenuity and capability to solve a lot of the problems that you're going to run into within the context of tracking, attribution, data visualization, and then campaign management. Number one, do they have a technical background? That can be multidisciplinary.\n\n(01:18:22):\nAt Thrive, we have someone who is a nuclear physicist that left discipline and became a performance marketer. We have people who have left mathematics and become performance marketers, people who left finance, full stack engineering, all kinds of stuff. Those are technical fields where people tend to be good at math and good at problem solving, and so that's a strong piece of evidence that they might have a strong aptitude for performance marketing and managing this.\n\n(01:18:52):\nAnother thing is just literally do they have experience in this discipline? Have they managed on any level Meta ads, Google ads, TikTok, Amazon, some of the things we talked about? Do they have an appreciation for some of the inputs that we just discussed today that ultimately create the conditions for success within a performance marketing environment? Do they understand the role of creative? Do they understand the role of proper attribution and are they capable of understanding the mechanics of your business and so on and so forth?\n\n(01:19:29):\nI would say just fundamentally, those are some of the areas that when we are interviewing we're looking for. As an agency too, we are looking for the ability to work with people and be excellent at client services. One of the questions we might ask, I actually borrowed a Jeff Bezos question from early stage Amazon where I asked people without much warning in an interview, I'll ask them whether it's okay to do a bit of a thought experiment together and whether they are comfortable responding to a logic question. I'll ask the question of, \"How many windows are there in New York City?\" There's two things that I look for in this scenario. One is can they think on their feet? I'm not actually looking for the correct answer. It's a pretty difficult question to solve. But number one, do you realize that windows are not just building windows and windows are also in cars and trucks and stuff like that, so there's more than one type of window. Then can you just do the arithmetic of saying there's so many buildings per hectare or square mile or whatever it is and it's division multiplication type stuff.\n\n(01:20:33):\nBut also from a client services point of view, I'm trying to see whether in a scenario where I've asked them something that they obviously probably weren't prepared for, that is a strange thing to ask and probably makes them feel a little bit uncomfortable, how they react in that situation. Do they remain composed or do they lose their composure and get frustrated or even angry that I asked them something that's pretty weird to ask? Their reaction there is often a good leading indicator of whether or not in a client scenario working with our clients, they can compose themselves in a difficult situation.\n\nLenny (01:21:10):\nVery tactically, what level of experience do you recommend people look for in their first performance marketing hire year or two, four or five years, longer?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:21:23):\nI've seen people who have 10 years of experience in the industry not be that great and then I've seen people who have one year of experience be absolutely phenomenal. I would say that again, the years of service under their belt is one clue or piece of evidence to their potential aptitude. But really, you want someone who can clearly demonstrate to you that they can competently run the channels I suppose. If what you're asking is literally at the level where someone is managing pay per click and programmatic media buying, then you want to make sure that they can just do that and I would say it's less about the years of experience. A lot of times people only want to do those types of jobs for a couple years before they're like, \"Hey, what's your plan for me? I'm tired of running ads and building campaigns. I want to manage the people who do that now.\" The people who tend to really do that are often somewhat earlier on in their careers. That's just a reality that we see.\n\nLenny (01:22:25):\nOne more very technical question. What do you recommend the title for this role be? Growth marketer, something else?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:22:31):\nI've seen so many different names for this. I think again, if the intention is to grow out a growth marketing capability, which again is not exclusive to performance marketing, then you're looking for a manager role of growth marketing manager. I've seen paid acquisition specialist for people who just manage channels. I've seen paid acquisition manager, performance marketing manager, media planner and buyer. I've seen all kinds of different roles. But when we are launching a new role these days, there's such wonderful tools like everything from Glassdoor to LinkedIn to PayScale where you can essentially just look at what other people are calling it and borrow from their role descriptions and then create your own role description and then determine what role is meaningful in the context of your own organization.\n\nLenny (01:23:23):\nAwesome. Last question. We started with the story of how you landed Uber, and I know you also have an interesting story which I haven't heard of how you landed Snap/Snapchat as a client, so maybe tell that story.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:23:38):\nIt's a fun story and I think it's about ultimately confidence and knowing your craft. I believe it was like 2015 or 2016, we were essentially contacted to participate in an RFP down in Los Angeles. RFPs are difficult processes and essentially a department of a company is saying, \"We want performance marketing and here are all the questions that we're going to ask you and exercises you need to complete in order to vet you as to whether you are the right partner or not.\" Sometimes RFPs are incredibly thoughtful and they're run by people who have either done a lot of RFPs in the context of what we do or they know specifically what the outcome is. Then in other cases, they're very experienced marketing departments with senior people and an approach that they may take is every stakeholder within that department gets to submit one or two questions to a long list of questions and the respondents have to respond to all of this.\n\n(01:24:38):\nThe RFP process for Snap was somewhat complex and they asked a range of different questions and we find ourselves in LA at a hotel the night before, it's 2:00 in the morning, my business partner and another team member that we had brought down are sweating and we're like, \"How are we going to build a presentation out of this? They're asking so many well-meaning but difficult questions that are zigging and zagging.\" In a pitch situation you want to tell a story, it's important, and that story has to have a beginning, middle, and end. It was just difficult and yet here we were and we had worked with all these really cool organizations and I was very confident that we knew precisely what we were doing. I kind of had this eureka moment where I was like, \"Here's what we're going to do.\" It was Brent MacArthur, my business partner and I kind of arrived at this together, but we're kind of like, \"Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have a completely unique take on how to respond to this and we're going to build a deck that's bespoke around X, Y, and Z.\"\n\n(01:25:54):\nWe work till 6:00 in the morning, I think we get a couple hours of sleep and then by 10:00, we're sitting in their offices. Essentially the pitch is something like this. I stand there in front of about 20 different executives from their organization and I say, \"You have thoughtfully curated an RFP for us to respond to today, and you have asked us to respond to about 20 to 30 different questions. With the utmost respect, I am not going to answer any of your questions today. I'm standing here because you are looking for a marketing partner and you need expertise in this area and instead of telling you the answers to the questions that you asked, I'm going to tell you what I think you need to do to get where you want to go and if you agree with me and my logic and what I talk to you about here today, then you should hire us. If you do not agree with my logic and you think that we're out to lunch, then you should not hire us.\"\n\n(01:26:47):\nYou could hear a pin drop in the room. My own team I think was a little bit surprised. We had a whole bunch of technical difficulties that day. Someone who was supposed to Zoom in couldn't make it and so I have to ad lib part of the pitch that I wasn't prepared for, lots of zig and zags. They thank us for RFP response, lots of handshakes and smiling faces, but we don't know whether we're going to land the client or not.\n\n(01:27:12):\nThen about two hours later, I was driving to San Francisco with a friend, immediately leave LA for SF because I had a bunch of follow on meetings, and I get a phone call and they were like, \"We loved your approach. Congratulations. You're hired.\"\n\n(01:27:28):\nThese days I think Snap is still a really interesting organization, but at the time they were kind of bringing the future of a social platform or what a social platform could be in the same way that we think about TikTok right now. TikTok wasn't on the scene yet and Facebook was very worried about Snap and there was tons of engagement on Snap, so this was the it client of the day and it felt amazing.\n\n(01:27:55):\nEssentially the lesson was that you have to trust yourself and understand your strengths and weaknesses. In situations where someone is well-meaning but may not understand what they need, be brave and tell them what they need rather than just conforming to what they're asking for because sometimes inadvertently that leads you down the wrong path. We took a big risk and it had a wonderful payoff and we have, in addition to this story, we had a wonderful relationship with them for a couple years.\n\nLenny (01:28:28):\nI love that story. I love how dramatic all your new customers, your way of acquiring customers and I imagine not all of them are this dramatic.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:28:38):\nNot all of them are this dramatic, but there have been some pretty dramatic ones. I think part of running a business and running an agency has been the curation and experience around all these fun, crazy stories that have accumulated as we run this really interesting services business.\n\nLenny (01:28:55):\nAwesome. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready for the lightning round?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:29:03):\nI'm ready. Let's do it.\n\nLenny (01:29:05):\nOkay, great Looking, very excited. Okay, first question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:29:13):\nAs a marketer, Storyworthy by Matthew Dicks is a wonderful book. He is a world world-class storyteller. I don't know if you know him. He wrote this book about how to structure and think about the art of storytelling and every marketer should read Storyworthy. It was a huge contributor to how I think about what we do at Thrive. As an entrepreneur, I love startup stories, so Shoe Dog, which is the startup story of Nike. It's basically Phil Knight talking about all the ups and downs, and it's crazy. Nike shouldn't be a company based on all the turmoil and challenges that they overcame. Fascinating read about taking risk and doing what you think is right and ultimately succeeding and building Nike. Then a book by Nick Bilton called American Kingpin, which is the story of the startup of the Silk Road, which was like this dark web marketplace for some pretty bad stuff. But it is half tech story, startup story and half gangster kind of kingpin story. It honestly should be a Hollywood movie. It reads like a Hollywood thriller. So awesome, great book.\n\nLenny (01:30:30):\nFavorite recent movie or a TV show.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:30:32):\nI don't know how recent it is, but I love The Big Short, just love it.\n\nLenny (01:30:35):\nNot recent at all, but it's still great.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:30:37):\nIt's still great. The reason why I like it is because someone found truth in the data they were analyzing and then capitalized on it, which is really an analog for what we do in performance marketing. Then recently I have fallen in love with White Lotus for no particular reason. It's just raw entertainment.\n\nLenny (01:30:54):\nWhat's something you've changed in the way that you all operate that's been relatively minor in terms of how hard it was to change, but that had a tremendous impact on your ability to execute as a team or a company?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:31:08):\nThe tools that we use in performance marketing change constantly. The channels themselves change and therefore what problems exist and what SaaS companies or different types of platforms offer as solutions to problems change. I don't think it's one thing necessarily, this might be a bit of a roundabout answer here, but I mentioned that change itself earlier is something that humans seem to not love, whereas in our industry, and I don't think we're alone here, but there's a culture of change. A welcoming of change, aptitude around change, having a playful mindset with new technology and tools rather than being upset about the fact that AI exists or third party cookies are being deprecated or iOS 14 removed IDFA and trying to be creative around those types of solutions has been like a constant for us. I'm kind of sidestepping the question a little bit, but it is the cultural willingness to adapt that I think has been a strong suit for us as a company.\n\nLenny (01:32:12):\nSpeaking of tools, final question. What is your favorite most underrated tool for performance marketing work?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:32:18):\nIt's Thrive Stack. It's a tool that we built in-house that allows us to pipe third party data and anonymized customer level data into a database and then ultimately visualize it in a format like Data Studio, Google Data Studio, which I think now is called Looker Studio. That has been a profoundly powerful platform from which we're capable of delivering insights that are built upon the data as opposed to just regurgitated data, if that makes sense. We have not released this technology yet. It's basically a tool we use in-house with our clients. But to a certain extent, I mentioned Supermetrics, which is another ETL and has some of the same capabilities but isn't quite as powerful.\n\nLenny (01:33:05):\nAmazing. Jonathan, this is by far the deepest I've ever gone into the world of paid growth. I really appreciate you making time and sharing all of your wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out, ask some questions maybe, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:33:23):\nThank you for having me again, by the way. This was a lot of fun. I'm available through Thrive, so thrivedigital.com. You can contact us through our site by accessing the contact form. Personally, I'm on LinkedIn under my name Jonathan Becker or Twitter, JZBecker. Then things that would be interesting from the audience, always looking for feedback in terms of whether people agree or disagree with thoughts and feelings that we have about what we do. Obviously always looking for amazing people ultimately to join our team at Thrive. If you're a practitioner of growth marketing or performance marketing and you're looking for a top place to spend some time, would love to talk to you. Also, I suppose if you need some help making this stuff work within the context of your own organization, we'd love to be at your service.\n\nLenny (01:34:12):\nAwesome. What is the URL again?\n\nJonathan Becker (01:34:14):\nThrivedigital.com.\n\nLenny (01:34:16):\nSweet. You asked for feedback, be careful what you wish for. We get some hilarious C2 comments. We'll see. We'll see what comes in on this one.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:34:24):\nSounds good.\n\nLenny (01:34:25):\nJonathan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJonathan Becker (01:34:27):\nPleasure. Thanks, Lenny. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (01:34:29):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How a great founder becomes a great CEO | Jonathan Lowenhar (co-founder of Enjoy The Work)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nYou basically spend all your time working with founders, and through that studying, you create frameworks and training and you use that in your work. I think that's what many, many founders are looking for is how do I avoid pain?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:00:11):\nTo be a founder is a state of being, it's an attitude. To be a CEO is a craft. The more founders who can accept that those are two separate things and they're both equally important to build an ascendant startup, the better all of us will be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):\nI'm kind of tired of talking about founder mode, but it feels like what you're describing is founder mode and manager mode.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:00:30):\nFounder mode gets me angry. That article just got me hot. It really felt like an excuse. We were giving founders a permission to not learn the job. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:46):\nSomething you talk about, there's these two phases to a startup journey and most people focus on the first phase.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:00:51):\nPhase one is build something people want to buy. Phase two, the one we don't talk about is now you have to build a company around that thing people want to buy. Building a company is always the same. I don't care if it's MedTech or fintech or hardware or consumer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):\nYou've come up with this methodology that you call the Magic Box paradigm that helps founders think about how to lead to a successful exit long-term.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:01:11):\nThis is a traditional sales process. You build a list of the companies that might want to acquire you, you ping them and you hope you get a deal. Magic Box argues that the best outcomes for early-stage startups don't happen that way. You're never for sale. In fact, you have seduced a buyer. They see the fantasy, they fall in love.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):\nToday, my guest is Jonathan Lowenhar. Jonathan runs a firm called Enjoy The Work, which I've heard amazing things about from so many people over the years. Their firm has a singular mission, to help founders become great CEOs. They do this through a blend of mentoring and advising services, which are rooted in their study of how the best startups operate. They take these lessons and fold them into frameworks and advice and training that they offer their CEOs, their insight, which you'll hear in our conversation, is that most founders don't come into the job knowing how to be a CEO, which includes learning how to do hiring, how to manage financials, figure out growth strategy, road mapping, planning, people management, and so many other skills that nobody teaches a founder.\n\n(00:02:16):\nIn our conversation, Jonathan shares the most common CEO failure modes that he and his team have seen, the Magic Box paradigm for successfully selling your startup, a bunch of advice for finding and hiring the best talent, a framework for building a repeatable go-to-market motion, why and how you should learn to trust your intuition more as a founder and so much more. We could have gone on for so many more hours. Maybe he'll be back to share more advice. If you're a founder or hope to be a founder one day, this episode is for you.

Welcome to the podcast,\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:03:03):\nLenny, I am damn excited.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:05):\nSo am I. The reason I'm excited to have you in this podcast is that you basically spend all your time working with founders, and through that studying, what causes them pain, what causes them to fail, what causes them to struggle, and then you take that and you create frameworks and training and you use that in your work with founders, and I think that's what many, many founders are looking for is how do I avoid pain? How do I avoid these things that I'm going to probably run into? To build on that, briefly, can you just help people understand what it is you do, what it is your organization does with founders, how you work with founders?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:03:38):\nYeah, thank you. I'll tell a bit of origin story that I think ends up answering that question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):\nLet's do it.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:03:45):\nI had run a bunch of different types of companies and they were really different ones. I ran a big division for a public company, then I was a private equity CEO, then I did back-to-back startups. The first one didn't get very far, but we sold it, and the second one got really far. When I left the second one, I was like many founders, grossly unhealthy, 25 pounds overweight, wasn't sleeping enough, all the things. I took a few months to get healthy and then reflect on those parts of my career. One of the things that I noticed at the time was all of those companies, when they got to a good place, when they started to run well, they were all run well in the same way. How could this be? How could public company, private equity, startups, early stage, growth stage, when they were run well, they were all run well the same way?\n\n(00:04:35):\nI started to obsess about this question, and what it led me to realize is that every well-run company has a rhythm. It's unmistakable, you can't miss it. You can't not see it. You just spend a couple of days through a spy cam watching a business, you'll see the pattern. How come some startups get there and some don't? How does a founder learn the rhythm? How do they learn how to run a company well? I started to ask investors obsessively, and I asked them, Lenny, I asked them all three questions, same three over and over and over again.\n\n(00:05:14):\nFirst question was, well, describe to me your ideal founder. What's a great founder? The answers universally were the same. Investors would use words that meant grit and tenacity and courage and insight, and I'd say, \"Great. Question number two, describe to me a great startup CEO,\" and they use none of those words. How can that possibly be true? Instead, they describe skills. This is a person who knows how to build stuff and sell stuff and recruit people and raise capital and organize humans and financially plan. Question number three, my final one, well, how does a founder learn those skills while doing the job? I got blank fucking stares, over and over again. It led me down this path that I'm now 10 years into with my colleagues of, well, how do we help founders learn those skills so that their venture investors don't fire them, so that they can actually go build whatever company they want to build and stay in the job for as long as they want to stay in the job? That's origin, that's what got me going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:27):\nThis episode is brought to you by Pendo, the only all-in-one product experience platform for any type of application.

Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:07:57):\nYes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:59):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:08:15):\nYes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:37):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it but also to maintain it forever?\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:08:48):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:08):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us and if you want to learn more, head on over to OneSchema.co. That's OneSchema.co. There's obviously this new meme of founder mode. I'm kind of tired of talking about founder mode, but it feels like what you're describing is founder mode and manager mode. You basically have to be good at both. This latter part is almost manager mode. Is that a way to think about it?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:09:34):\nYes. Founder mode gets me angry. That article just got me hot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:39):\nDo share.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:09:42):\nIt really felt like an excuse. We were giving founders a permission to not learn the job. If we think about an ascending startup, there's this phase of I have to invent something. I now have to figure out how to get my customer in front of this invention and see if it works, and then I have to build a business model around that to see if there's some repeatable way to attract, win, deploy my customer and thrill them with whatever the solution is. Okay, now I have to go build an enormous amount of demand and then I have to build up an operation that can handle all that demand. Oh, and by the way, at some point, figure out how to turn positive revenues into positive cash flows. The idea that the founder who's writing code by themselves doesn't have to advance their skills to learn how to do all those things, and that in fact what the article even implies is learning how to do those other things is a negative is bananas to me.\n\n(00:10:52):\nThe things required to launch a company are not the same as grow a company as scale a company as exit a company, and the best startup CEOs learn them all along the way. There are lots of ways to learn them. I'm not suggesting there's only one path, but founder mode was almost an excuse not to. I do think what's unique about a founder that felt perhaps where that article was trying to go is that unlike the professional mercenary CEO that gets dropped in, the founder knows everything about what built this company and they can drop in at the most granular level and play anywhere. They can drop into a product feature, they can drop into a customer conversation or a partner conversation or with a long-time employee that's still in IC and be impactful and then rise back up if they've gone the training and get back into a cockpit to run the company again. That's to me the distinction. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):\nI love that. I'm glad we got there. I wasn't planning to talk about founder mode, but I think this is really helpful for folks to hear that are founders and people working for founders too. Along these same lines, you have a really helpful and really funny also mental model for how to think about common failure modes of founders. You have these labels that I love, and this is actually the first thing I heard about Enjoy The Work is these labels that you guys use, and you also, a similar mental model for failure modes for a startup. Can you just share these modes that you've come up with?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:12:31):\nWe do take a bit of a comical approach to some of this. As I've shared with you previously, the name of our company is not an accident. If we can't be playful, we can take the work seriously and not ourselves, so we do fuck around quite a bit. I think if I would separate failure modes for companies versus CEOs for a minute, the company ones are not quite as comedic, but they are ones we see all the time. One is you chose the wrong market. I don't think we need to belabor that one. Lots of your prior guests have talked about the importance of getting that part right or nothing else really matters.\n\n(00:13:05):\nSecond, back to what we were discussing a minute ago, build something people want to buy, got to go build the right thing. Cool. Third one, founder's function. We like to joke that more companies die from suicide than homicide, and it's grim, but also if the two or three people in charge of the business can't get along, nothing else matters. It's all going to break apart. Then fourth, execution, and execution now leads back to CEO. Okay, so now we have a bunch of playful ones here. We have the robot CEO, who believes emotion should not ever exist at a startup, at which point we train them on a very simple formula. Emotions are messy, humans have emotions, startups need humans, therefore startups are messy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):\nI love how engineering-oriented that advice is, which makes sense for robots. Yeah.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:14:03):\nAlso, a little bit more graceful of an answer there is also our CEOs want urgency and passion and excitement from their teams. They want them working enormously hard for below market comp more often than not with this promise of equity that might return value five or 10 or 12 years later. They want them to bring all of that emotion, but they're supposed to figure out how to surgically cut off the emotions that are inconvenient. That's the robot CEO who believes that we can just have several robots working for us and you just press a button and they do a thing. Second one is a pleaser CEO. This is the person who is far more concerned with being liked than running a business, so they can't tell anyone hard news. They can't break ties, they want a consensus on everything, and that's not possible.\n\n(00:14:56):\nIf you have a group of thoughtful people working for you, they're going to fight, they're going to debate and you want them to. Then at some point you have to call it and say, \"No, we're going left not right.\" Or, \"The two of you need to go get in a room and deal with something.\" Or, \"Hey, the way you just showed up is not the way I want you to show up.\" The pleaser CEO won't do any of that. They will simply hide and pray It goes away and it won't go away. Next one is a perfectionist CEO. I'd like to say that these are the CEOs with the most beautiful product to be delivered minutes before they file for bankruptcy. This is the person who is far more concerned with being right and believing that there's always a right answer than just moving forward.\n\n(00:15:36):\nIt creates two problems in a business. One is you're just slow and the other one is you'll never take any bets because you will build a team that realizes the CEO is not allowed to be wrong, so you can't disagree, you can't use intuition, you can't use gut. Everything has to be utterly factual and that is simply not possible. In early-stage startups, you have more questions than you do answers. Everything is circumstantial. It's not like watching CSI entrepreneurship and you get to see a video to say, \"Oh, look, the guy did it.\" No, we have a bunch of little data points you have to come to a conclusion. The next one is the angry CEO.\n\n(00:16:15):\nI had a founder of mine a bunch of years ago and we were seeing a pattern across the leadership team and he and I get on the phone one morning and I said, \"I have a theory for you. It might be a story, I might be wrong, but I want to share.\" He said, \" Okay.\" I said, \"I think you wake up in the morning angry and you don't know it, and then you get to the office and you beat the crap out of the first employee that crosses paths with you over something utterly unrelated because you're angry. You realize that a few hours later and you apologize and your team hasn't quit yet because they believe you're a good human who doesn't have good self-control.\" Then I shared with him, \"And you just had your first child. My guess is because I'm not a psychologist, I'm not a therapist, that you are modeling something that's happened in your life. Is this something you want to change?\"\n\n(00:17:09):\nHis answer is yes, and I said, \"Great. I have good news and bad news. The good news is because you said yes, we can do something about it, and the bad news is I don't know what to fucking do. That's not my job.\" The point being, no one wants to work for the angry person. I don't care what the equity potential is worth, no one wants to work for that person, and the moment they see greener pastures elsewhere, they're leaving. The next one is the one that drives me particularly crazy, it's the laissez-faire CEO, who insanely believes that I can just hire great people and utterly ignore them and let markets take care of themselves and they will do all the right things. I have never met anyone, Lenny, that didn't benefit from good management and the laissez-faire CEO believes that management is not required, and so what they ultimately find is they have really, really good people doing utterly disconnected things and goals are not achieved.\n\n(00:17:59):\nEvery CEO we can reductively reduce to one of two characters. They're either comfortable with the brake or comfortable with the accelerator. The challenge with those who are comfortable with the brake, what I mean by that is they don't want to spend any money, so they're driving this beautiful sports car and they're just leaning on the brake the whole time. Yes, they won't run any money, and yes, they will also get lapped by everyone else and miss the opportunity. Where their opportunity is, is where can you take bets? Where can you actually downshift that car in such a way where you give yourself a chance in the market? Separate, those who ride the accelerator, we've all met this one. They're going to run out of money really fast, and this connects to one of our other challenging CEO types, the ready, fire, aim.\n\n(00:18:49):\nMost CEOs are really bad at planning and that's because there's this little-known secret in the Bay area, most CEOs have never run a business before. Planning doesn't have to be some heavy bureaucratic multi-month exercise that begins in August and ends in February, but a little bit of bottoms up planning to say, what are we trying to achieve? How do we quantify it? What resources are required? What humans are going to do what? How do we shorten feedback loops so we know in a week, in a month and two months, whether we're on the right trajectory? The ready, fire, aim CEO says, \"I don't want to do any of that because they're improvisational and they just want to take bets and they want to take shots,\" and that's what got the company started, and that's also what will have the company go bankrupt. The micromanager one is the opposite of laissez-faire. They believe that no matter how many employees they have, they can do the job better.\n\n(00:19:42):\nThe challenge with this one is it is massively disrespectful to those who work for you. We think that, and this is a bit insulting, that everyone that works for a founder can be fit into one or two chunks. They're either an adult or a child. I have a three-year-old, my little girl is amazing. I'm utterly in love. If she doesn't have a lot of structure and a lot of supervision, she's going to run into things, man. Into things, off things, through things, but adults don't need to be given utter instruction and watched all the time. In fact, it needs to be the opposite. We agree on what success is, what resources are, and you let them go and they'll come back to you when they have questions. The micromanager CEO doesn't see the difference between those two humans. They don't trust anybody and that's actually the thing under the thing under the thing, so they want to do everyone's work and that will succeed right up into the point everyone quits.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:39):\nThis is amazing. Okay, so let me recap these labels that you have just for folks. I have them written down here. There's the robot CEO, perfectionist CEO, pleaser CEO, micromanager, laissez-faire, ready, fire, aim, riding the brake and then riding the gas, and as you said, the ever-popular angry CEO.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:21:03):\nYou got them all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:04):\nAs people hear this, I imagine people self-identify a few of these, like I have some of this, I have some of that, and it's not like black or white. No one is like, \"I'm a 100% robot CEO, and I need to fix that.\" It's like a pie chart kind of, I don't know, what's a visual of this? Everyone's got a little bit of this, basically.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:21:24):\nThat's right. I enjoy giving this talk on stage and watching different founders in the audience cringe at different moments, but it doesn't mean that they're all one or the other. If they were all one of these and then didn't want to even accept the possibility that there's a little bit of a lot of these that they could work on, they're probably not coachable and they're not going to be in the talk anyway.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:45):\nIt's like I imagine each of these is very particular and it's this journey you go on to work on yourself. Let me just ask, what's the most common issue that you've found across these labels of type CEOs? What's the most common one and what do you often recommend someone to work on specifically to help them through that?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:22:02):\nI think ready, fire, aim is the most common that we've seen, and that has been an affliction that's been growing in the last number of years. It wasn't long ago that CEOs could paper over poor execution with easy access to capital. Suddenly, over the last number of years, we're expecting founders to be better operators. Better operators means eventually being on a path when more cash comes into the business and out of the business. That doesn't happen by accident. The ready, fire, aim CEO has probably suffered this pain where they took lots and lots of bets. Maybe they measured the outcome after the fact and they were wrong and they were wrong and they were wrong in ways that were expensive, and they've raised their hand to say, \"I see it. I want to get better at this.\" Basic, basic business design and business planning is not some corporate effort. It's some thoughtful exercise that starts with what are we working backwards from?\n\n(00:23:02):\nBecause in any given time, Lenny, companies are working backwards from one of four things, whether they like it or not. I am working backwards from an exit. I'm working backwards from a next fundraise. I'm working backwards from profitability or I'm working backwards from winding down. We don't talk about the fourth one that much, but I got to choose one. I got to choose the top of the mountain. More often than not, they're choosing a fundraise. Then we'll ask that founder, you know your market, you know your investors, you know the next set of investors, we've done some intel. What has to be true to unlock the next fundraise? That's a qualitative and quantitative answer, but we write it down. We need to get better at go to market. We need to land our first partner. We need to launch next iteration of the product and show this level of efficacy, engagement, what have you. Can we codify that? Yes. Can we talk through what actions would be required on what cadence to unlock that quantified set of results? Yes.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:24:00):\n... that quantified set of results? Yes. Do we understand what resources would be required to do those things? Recognize we might have to squint through some of it, but again, the answer is yes. [inaudible 00:24:13] now aimed. If we have a culture that has some accountability, that has a communication architecture, so there's some rituals about how we meet and how we share information and how we talk through problems, and how we work through bottlenecks, well, now we have a plan and now we have accountability. I now no longer have to just guess all the time. And this only works for the CEO who says, \"My improvisational efforts got me here, but I don't think they'll get me there.\"\n\n(00:24:47):\nThere's a guy I worked for a long time ago, and he had this phrase... He had like seven or eight phrases, he would use them over and over and over again. It was hard not to commit them all to memory, and one of them was, \"If you keep doing what you're doing, you keep getting what you're getting.\" And for the ready, fire, aim folks who realize the weakness of that at scale, the way to counteract that, is to start with good planning.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:12):\nIt's interesting that's the most common type of CO, when with Founder Mode, it feels like it just accelerates that further. The whole meme of Founder Mode, which are what makes you upset. Makes sense. Great.\n\n(00:25:26):\nOkay, so I love that you talked about exiting as basically one of these four working backwards paths, because that's where I wanted to go next. I want to talk about some of these specific frameworks and skills and methodologies that you teach, and one of them... I want to almost go to the end of selling your company. And the reason I'm excited to talk about this, is if you think about, and tell me if I'm wrong, but it feels like most startups that succeed end up selling their company. That's the most likely success, right?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:25:58):\nYes, by far.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):\nGreat. Yeah, because the other option is IPO or just run this privately forever. Or fail, basically, and fold. So of the successful options, the most common is selling. At the same time, founders have never done this before, they don't know what they're doing. The other side, often, has done it many times, and so it's a pretty treacherous and scary and high-stakes thing to do and to learn on the spot. And you've come up with this methodology that you call the Magic Box Paradigm that I love, that helps founders think about how to lead to a successful exit long term. Can you talk about what this is?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:26:36):\nI can, and I want to give credit where it's due. There's a book by this name, it's called Magic Box Paradigm, written by an independent banker named Ezra Roizen. And the book's fantastic, and Ezra is fantastic.\n\n(00:26:46):\nWhat we've done, is we've operationalized it so that we could teach founders over, and over, and over again. If the founder wants to hire a banker for this particular process, because we're not bankers, we're not BD, we don't get paid that way, we're teachers. But if wanted to hire a banker, go hire Ezra. But the methodology itself is a inversion for how venture and venture boards have thought about startups being ready for sale for a long, long time. It's utterly counter to so much advice that founders have heard. There are two ways you can get acquired. This is purposely reductive. One is you put up a for-sale sign. This is a traditional sales process. You build a list of the companies that might want to acquire you. You figure out the categories of buyers, the companies there, the contact list within that. You ping them and say, \"We're open to a transaction,\" or some euphemism the like. You contact them and say, \"I'll give you some information now. Sign an NDA. Give me an indication of interest by this date.\" And you work through a process, and you pray you have more than one person at the end of the game, try and ratchet them up, sign a term sheet. They will then re-trade along the way, right up until the point you die and you hope you get a deal done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:05):\nSounds very familiar.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:28:08):\nAnd it's one that often will just hit the nervous system of any founder that's been through it a couple of times. Because man, is it a fraught exercise? What Magic Box argues, is that the best outcomes for early-stage startups don't happen that way. You're never for sale. In fact, you have seduced a buyer. You have brought someone in. And there are three stages to Magic Box work. There is learn the fantasy, there's prove the fantasy, and there's quantify the fantasy.\n\n(00:28:43):\nAll right, so what the hell do I mean by a fantasy? You're an early-stage startup, and you meet a company that is in your space, in your vertical, what have you, and they're much more advanced than you. It's a large business. Generally speaking, another oversimplification here, large companies are interested in small companies because they're technology. And small companies are interested in large companies because they're distribution. And there's someone at the large company who becomes fascinated with you.\n\n(00:29:12):\nWhat's the fascination? What they see in their head is, \"Oh, interesting. If I buy your company, this thing happens.\" The classic example of this is Instagram. This is the number one example of this. Lenny, do you remember how much revenue they had when they got acquired by now Meta?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:33):\nI think it was zero.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:29:34):\nI think it was zero.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:35):\nOkay.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:29:36):\nDo you remember the acquisition price?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:37):\nA billion dollars, which was absurd at that point.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:29:41):\nThere was no math Facebook could use, historically speaking, that would justify a billion dollars. It had to be a model on the future. This is Magic Box to a T. They had a fantasy that adding Instagram would expand ad revenue. They figured out some way to prove it. I'll explain more on what I mean by proof. And then their quantification was based on the future. And that's the difference between a Magic Box approach and traditional approaches. Traditional approaches are based on the past, Magic Box is on the future.\n\n(00:30:14):\nLet me tell a story. In one of our companies in construction tech, their technology was able to suck in video camera data from construction sites for project planning. No one was doing this yet. And the business was doing pretty well. We helped the founders launch the company. We got first product in market. We raised a couple of rounds of capital. The product mostly worked. But we weren't sure it was venture scale as we were going along. And we had some large construction tech companies and real estate companies and development companies leaning into us. And one particular company then said, \"Huh, we're really good at construction planning, and we've collected all of this video data that we don't use at all.\" And the champion on the other side in the product org, he has a fantasy. \"Oh, shit. We take your video analytics platform and plug it into what we do, and this is what happens to my business.\"\n\n(00:31:18):\nNow, the person on the other side is a person. And the reason I'm being specific about that, is because you don't sell to a company. Magic Box is about finding the person. You're finding the champion on the other side, the person who has motivated for their own reasons, career, money, reputation, what have you. They see the fantasy. They fall in love. And this person says, \"I am in love with this idea. If I can grab security data into my product organization. Now I have to prove the fantasy.\"\n\n(00:31:53):\nWhat's different about a champion in this kind of process, is they want to find a way to say yes. They're not looking for a way to say no. And this brings us to the four characters you're going to meet along the path of Magic Box. There might be a fifth. You're going to meet your champion, you're going to meet your advocates, you're going to meet your blockers, and you're going to meet your buyer. You might meet Corp Dev along the way.\n\n(00:32:20):\nLet me talk about each of those folks. The champion is the one who's fallen in love. They're the ones with the fantasy. They're the ones who are arguing on your behalf. They're the ones fighting for you when you're not in the room. They are texting you, they're telling you things about the business that they're probably not supposed to tell you.\n\n(00:32:33):\nThe buyer. All they care about is math. It might be a committee, it might be a group, the IC, the EC, the investment group, what have you. They're the ones who actually can sign off on a deal. They care about business case.\n\n(00:32:45):\nAdvocates... Lenny, do you play chess?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:49):\nI have played chess, yes.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:32:50):\nYou have played chess. So advocates are pawns. They don't matter at all until they matter enormously. These are folks that, like, you are the CEO doing a meeting with your potential buyer, and there are somehow 12 people on the Zoom call, but only two do the talking. The other 10 might be advocates. They're rooting for you, but they will take no political risk. Their value is in giving you intel.\n\n(00:33:16):\nBlocker. This is the person who can't say yes, but they can say no. This is OPSEC, this is Procurement, this is Legal. You're going to meet all these characters during the Magic Box dance. Your champion just wants you to get the deal done so in love. So what happens, is they've come up with a fantasy and you as a CEO need to lean into it. This isn't enterprise selling. I'm not trying to sell you this thing that I have. I'm just trying to find ways to say yes.\n\n(00:33:47):\nSo when, in my story, the person says, \"Could we provide you all of our video data that we've collected forever and you now could enhance our ability to predict whether large- scale construction projects are on time\"? I don't want the CEO saying anything other than, \"We can do that.\"\n\n(00:34:07):\nNow, phase two, I need to prove it. Okay, because I have a champion who wants to say yes, proof can be really easy. And the reason the proof is so important, is not to convince the champion they're in love with the fantasy. They're already convinced. It's because in almost all cases, big company is buying little company and your champion doesn't have unilateral authority. They're going to socialize the deal. They have to get buy-in from who? The aforementioned buyer. They have to be able to survive the aforementioned blockers.\n\n(00:34:43):\nSo eventually, when they pitch this to whatever committee is in charge, that committee is going to say, \"What proof do we have that it works?\" And we just want to be able to provide the champion with enough evidence that it works. So in this case, we said to the champion, \" Well, give us video data, and we will provide you the evidence that you need.\" Because we're dealing with a champion who's not a cynic, because champions aren't, we could tell them, \"And provide us the data in this way, in this fashion, and here's what we'll send you after. Are we in agreement?\" We know we're already going to win the proof, and it's critically important in these dances.\n\n(00:35:27):\nNumber three, quantify. At this point, we're not up for sale, but we're spending a lot of calories on somebody, and they know it. So we have our CEOs say the following phrase to them: \"My board is asking questions. They're wondering why we're spending so many calories on this when it's not really core and we're not selling you our product. I'm convinced of how exciting this could be, together, but I think we need to do some math. So I can explain to my board why this might matter. So let's imagine all this works, because it's going to work, and it's a year from now or five years from now. What changes about your business?\" And the champion will tell you, \"Retention does this, or deal size goes like this, or market share goes like this.\" And you'll say to them, \"Fantastic. Look, I'm going to build some shitty verse version of the model. You tell me what I got right and what I got wrong, but I have a board meeting in 16 days, and I need to be able to walk them through the justify why I am spending so many calories on this exercise.\"\n\n(00:36:34):\nYou build the model, you hand it to them. If they in any way respond to your model, you've won. Because you have now divorced history from future, and you are now playing in future, you are playing the Instagram game in this case. The ending of the story for the company that I was describing, it was a business sub 2 million in revenue. Our prospects of raising series B felt low. We were not yet profitable, and that was an exit that was generational wealth for the co-founders and their families. The CEO went on and spent two-plus years with the now public company that did this acquisition. The technology did get integrated, but it took a long time and they had to do a lot of changes to it, certainly beyond what was envisioned during the diligence process. But all parties are happy. And if we hadn't done it this way and we had just been up for sale, we'd get a dollar for that company.\n\n(00:37:40):\nA couple of other side points that are really important here. For any of you founders out there that are thinking about working backwards from an exit, there are two things that I really want to stress. One is the fantasy is beyond just, \"What is the business change you can have?\" The fantasy is, \"Your books are in order.\" Your fantasy is all of your investors will sign off on the deal and you will have unanimous consent, that the key members of your team are going to stick around, that you're a joy to work with. Please God, founder, do not puncture the fantasy at any time.\n\n(00:38:21):\nSo whatever is starting to shape in your buyer's mind, get to know it. Live that everybody wins from that game. Second, Corp Dev, they will probably show up in the stands. Corp Dev make deals. They're not deal sponsors, they're not a champion, they're not a buyer. They are an expert negotiator. Their job is to facilitate deals and get deals done. The most important things to understand is that they can be a leverage point to have a deal move with some process and some pace and some urgency. Because either deals have momentum or they die, and Corp Dev can help there.\n\n(00:39:04):\nSecond, they are way better at negotiating than you. So anytime dealing with a superior negotiator, the only thing you can do to try and even the scales, is move the negotiation async. So founders, repeat after me, I'm talking to you directly now. You'll say to Corp Dev, \"You know I'm not alone in this decision. I love what you just said and I'm excited about this opportunity. Once I see it in writing, I can socialize it with advisors, lawyers, co-founders, whoever.\" But don't negotiate live. You will lose.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:39):\nLet me just say that was extremely delightful to listen to. I've never heard like a M&A strategy be this fun. And it makes me want to sell a company. It's like, \"Okay, let's do this. I'm hyped.\" I think you got it all. I have a few questions.\n\n(00:39:56):\nInterestingly, the middle part is... It feels a lot like enterprise sales, which a lot of founders are used to. Understand the stakeholders move things forward. Here's your champion, here's your blockers, here's the buyer. Is there anything there you want to say, what's maybe most different from enterprise sales, which I think a lot of founders are maybe used to? Or is it pretty similar?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:40:14):\nYeah, I think three things. One is there are a lot of moments in enterprise sales where we're trying to push for a compelling event. That doesn't work in seduction. The playful metaphor that we'll often use, is you've been dating for a while, this person could be the person, but they're not quite convinced yet that it should be a life together, and you're sitting at dinner. And in enterprise sales, you're eager to get it done. You're eager to move the relationship forward and move in and get engaged, what have you. And so you might be inclined to say, \"Hey, either we move this relationship the next step, or there are a whole bunch of people eyeing me, and I'm going to go date someone else.\"\n\n(00:41:06):\nThat conversation never goes well, and in Magic Box founders are eager to do the same thing, thinking that competition will improve their deal size, when in fact I think more often than not, that is a negative signal until the very end of the dance. So instead in enterprise selling where I'm pushing, in Magic Box, I'm always trying to entice, I'm never, ever trying to push. So instead I might say things like, \"Hey, I'm going to raise my next round in Q1, because I've been intending to do this business independently. Now all I really want to do, is win. I just want my product in as many customers' hands as possible. Whether I do that on my own as I was planning, in partnership with someone, or under someone else's roof, honestly I don't care. But I have a company to run and I'm going to go raise my next round in Q1. And if I do that, probably too expensive for this deal to make sense anymore, and my board will want me to move on anyway.\" I'm enticing. I'm never trying to push.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:15):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

Any advice you could share for a founder that's like, \"We probably need to sell this company\"? What can they do to start creating these relationships, find this person, create this fantasy in their minds?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:43:28):\nEzra does this really well in the book. Again, it has to be not solicitous. So one of our companies, we had maybe 20 months of capital left, and the two co-founders and our team were convinced, \"This isn't a venture business. We thought it might be a venture business. It's not a venture business. It takes too long to do a deal that's not that interesting with each of our enterprise customers.\" It was disappointing, but at least we were honest about it. \"Okay, so who are we going to sell to? Let's go play this game.\"\n\n(00:44:04):\nSo we started with categories, categories of buyers. It could be, for this particular example that was in my head, ERP companies could be a buyer, large banks could be a buyer, the big software companies like Microsoft could be a buyer. There were a few different categories. And we said, \"Great. Who are the companies within those categories that make sense?\" They're acquisitive, they have the balance sheet for it. There's a Corp Dev department, so we know that they actually know what they're talking about here. Ideally, there's an existing relationship with core team or advisors or board members. Make a list.\n\n(00:44:45):\nNow, how do we meet them in a way without selling them? So one of the examples in the book, which I love, is small startup wants to meet the luminaries in a space, and they have their PR agency set up a panel where they contact the CEOs of the potential buyers and say, \"We're putting together a panel of the world's foremost experts in X. We're going to put four people on the panel, and it's going to be you and famous person number two and famous person number three, and this fourth person,\" that is a luminary to us. And it's our startup CEO. And suddenly you're at the table as a peer. It's a completely different conversation.\n\n(00:45:32):\nThe second one, and this is going to sound a little silly, but I am not exaggerating, it works. If you are a CEO founder and you have that title on LinkedIn, it's amazing the responses you'll get. So we made this list and we just started to send connection requests to the CEOs or CPOs or CFOs on our target list, and said something as simple as this, \"You're doing something really cool. So are we. You game just for a 30-minute chat? Because I don't know where it'll go, but I think it'll be fun.\" Keep it that informal. It's peer to peer. I'm not selling you anything.\n\n(00:46:10):\nIf you can draw a line to some post that they had or some speech that they gave, even better. But we found without fail, there would be math that would show up, one out of four, one out of five, or one out of six, \"Yeah, that sounds fun.\" There's a lot of those CEOs never talk to startups, and that's fascinating to them, especially when presented with the energy of, \"I just want to have a fun, intellectual discussion.\"\n\n(00:46:37):\nWhat you're looking for in that first conversation, and this is what we ask our CEOs to do, is to ask questions like, \"What do you care most about in the next year? What's the mandate? What about for your department? What are the things that keep you up at night? What's the break? What's the thing that could actually kill everything, if you had a pre-mortem for the next year?\" Those kind of open-ended questions, because what we want our CEO listening for, is the fantasy to see if there's some intersection between what they care about and what we might be able to squint and say we do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:07):\nIt's interesting, because it sounds a lot like there's a jobs-to-be-done framework here, or just like, \"What is the job they need done?\" What is the pain you're going to solve, and then create a fantasy around how amazing it'll be for them if you can solve that problem.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:47:19):\nAnd ideally they'll say it and you just reflect it back in active listening.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:25):\nChris Voss negotiation style. Okay, so you're the kind of guest, Jonathan, where the whole podcast could be about each one of these topics, and so I know there's so much more to talk about here. I want to move to a different topic, but to leave folks with, one is if they want to explore this methodology more, there's a book you mentioned, called Magic Box Paradigm by Ezra Roizen, right?\n\n(00:47:51):\nIf companies are in this process, starting to think about it, does it make sense for them to come to you and like, \"Hey, help me through this process\"? I know you said, \"Go to an investment banker.\" Or does it make sense to like, \"Hey, let's bring on Jonathan,\" or someone from your team to help them?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):\nIt makes sense to like, Hey, let's bring on Jonathan or someone from your team to help them.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:48:03):\nWe meet two types of founders. Founder one says, fix this part of my business, totally transactional. I want to raise the next round, or I'm hiring people badly or my founders aren't getting along, or I want to sell my company. Well, I need to be honest, that's not interesting to us. That's not our work. Go find someone who is, and I don't mean this disparagingly, but like a screwdriver, like fixes one thing, go fix one thing. Then we meet second type of founder and that founder says, most likely to themselves, 'cause it's the only safe audience. There's some gap between the CEO I am and the one my company needs me to be. There are a set of skills that I'm great at and there are these things where I know if I'm really honest with myself, if I listen to the quiet voice, I'm soft at these things or I'm not good enough at these things or I have some imposter syndrome about these things and if I don't get better at them, danger. That's the one we work with. And it's when they care that much about both the hard skill development and maybe the soft skill development in their path to become a great CEO.\n\n(00:49:10):\nHow to sell the company. It's one of the skills. We teach this to all of our founders as well as hiring and management and planning. I don't care what the thing is. For every one of our founders, we audit them and say, here's what you're great at, here's what you're shitty at, and here's what you've never done before, and which of these do you want to work on next given where the company is in its cycle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:29):\nGreat segue to where I wanted to go with this, which is hiring. So I hear all the time that a founder's core job is fundraising and hiring an amazing team. Basically that's their main goal. Just like hire amazing people. The people you hire make your company, create the culture. You got to get that right. But similar to trying to sell your company, most founders have never really hired lots of people, they've never hired for all these different skill sets they're trying to hire for and I know that you guys spend a lot of time helping founders hire and find amazing people. Can you just share some of the advice you share with founders for how to find and hire amazing people?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:50:06):\nYeah, so we actually think the CEO has three jobs. We agree with the two that you said, but we think there's a third. One is, make sure everyone knows where we're going. The second one, pick the right people for the team. Third one, give those people the tools they need to win. And you can abstract from those what they all mean, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:27):\nI love that.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:50:28):\n... most founders are really bad at hiring. They fall prey to all sorts of pretty common human biases. The lazy ones, back to laissez-faire, think it's just gambling like, oh cool, they worked at Meta and Salesforce already, so hire them, just gambling. There was work done by and then codified in a beautiful book. I'm going to make sure I get the names right, Geoffrey Smart and Randy Street. They had a consulting firm that dates back to the mid-nineties. Then they wrote a book in 2007 or 2008 called Who: The A Method for Hiring. We have operationalized that book and then expanded on it 'cause there are some parts of it that we found a little dated, but it's really still as applicable today as it ever was.\n\n(00:51:18):\nAnd I think there are three core mistakes that founders make all the time, that can be really easily rectified. The first one is, you should hire people who have already done the thing you need to have done next. And I know that sounds simple, but founders don't think of hiring that way. They start with a job description. We've been taught that for a long time. Start with the job description. It's a fucking mistake. Start with, it's 12 months later, you hired the person, they started today, 12 months have gone by, you're clinking champagne because of how great it's been. What's changed about the business? What does success look like 12 months later? Document it. And then when you interview people, look for people that have already done that stuff.\n\n(00:52:13):\nSecond, the notion of does the person in front of you have a history of creating raving fans? They talk in the book about this idea of you being pulled or pushed in your career. If you were an outstanding performer in Job A, it is a high likelihood that in job B, someone associated with you in job A is going to pull you into the next thing and then pull you into the next thing and pull you into the next thing and you'll never do a job search 'cause you were great. And if you see a history of that, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, really attractive candidate. Third, core values matter a lot. Culture is not an accident. Culture at scale is the codification of what matters to a business and the ritualization of living those values. It starts with whoever the founders are and then it will emanate across as long as the founders are super consistent. But that also means you need a methodology for evaluating the next human in front of you on whether they actually represent your values. We think of these interview stages in a way similar to the book, we use slightly different language, but we think that there is a culture interview, there is a functional interview, and there is a technical interview, but they're designed to get at these notions of have they actually done this kind of work before? Have they been pulled or pushed in their career and are they your kind of human?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):\nFunny on that last detail actually, [inaudible 00:54:03] at Airbnb, there was actually a core values interview team that was formed around studying what the founders Brian, and Joe, and Nate valued specifically and then they codified them to core values at the business and then there's this team that was a very select handpicked team that at every interview loop interviewed the person for their values.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:54:22):\nThat is a beautiful example of how interviewing for values is independent of title. 'Cause you'll find people in the company at every stage of a company that are the best ambassadors, the best embodiments of those values. Please use them for interviewing and in addition, they love it 'cause they're protecting their castle. They love where they work, they want to keep it that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:45):\nSo true that team is a real special team and it was really honored to be on that team. So let me summarize what you just shared, which I love. There's so much value here, it just keeps going and going. So when you're hiring, your advice is: look for people, one, that have done it before; two, that have been pulled from job to job by someone else that loves their work and wants them to be with them at this new company. And then three, their values match the values of the founder and the business essentially, right?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:55:11):\nYes. And for the recruiters out there, a really simple way to get rid of a lot of the crap that ends up showing up at the top of the funnel is just to ask the simple question even in the cover letter, of your last ex-bosses, how many would get on the phone and say, you're amazing? If there's any equivocation in the answer, great, move on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:35):\nSo a couple of follow-up questions here. One is, this point of hiring people that have done it, obviously this implies don't hire junior up-and-comers as much. Thoughts on just when it makes sense to hire someone more junior that's really ambitious, real smart, you think they can learn the job, thoughts there?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:55:53):\nSo one of our companies is hiring a team of reasonably junior account execs. We're looking for folks that have been out of school for two years. Now, that means they are highly unlikely to have had three years of quota achievements and a similar... you get the point. Okay, so how do you hire someone who's already done it? We know what success looks like 12 months later. For that role, they've learned how to hunt, they've been able to create pipeline of X and close Y in business, et cetera. What we are looking for then in their history, if they have any sales chops of any kind. They could be selling Girl Scout cookies, or tickets to some event, or they work for a non-profit for while. I don't care, but I want some evidence that they've sold. I want some evidence that they're comfortable getting on the phone or showing up at meetings or showing up at events. So, that they've done it before should be reviewed or thought of creatively.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:07):\nGot it.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:57:07):\nNow for more senior roles, I want an explicit. We think of, for example, for executives, Lenny, we think there are three types of executives that startups end up hiring over time. We call them the architect, the optimizer, and the scaler. The architect, let's use sales as an example. This is someone who has to build a playbook. So they're going to uncomfortably stay close to the founder, watch and listen, and listen to recordings and pick their brain to pull the magic from the founder of like, oh, here's the dance that she or he goes through to actually close a deal and they write first playbook. And the goal of the codification of that is so you can bring on a first account exec and the next account exec because account execs back to our language earlier in this adult children dynamic are children. You need to give them structure for them to win. That's the architect. The optimizer, this is someone who's now going from a few account execs to maybe 10, 15 and we now have targets we have to hit. The business is now reaching a different level of professionalism and expectation and you have to optimize that earlier playbook to try and find more efficiency and performance out of it.\n\n(00:58:21):\nThe scaler is saying, okay, now how do I find leverage? How do I have 10X more account execs or how to get other people to sell for me? They're all going to be called VP of sales or chief revenue officer. They're completely different archetypes, and that same person exists in engineering and in product, et cetera. In those cases, I only would want to bring on an architect if they'd been an architect before. If they'd only been an optimizer, they're going to fail because they've never written playbook from scratch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):\nIt touches on a conversation I had recently. It was a live podcast recording with Shreyas Doshi at my summit where he talks about a lot of people are really frustrated at work because they're in the wrong one of those buckets, essentially. Like you enjoy certain type of work and your job is not doing that type of work, whether it's in your case scaling or optimizing. And so, it just reminds that if you're frustrated at work, you're in the wrong job in terms of the type of output they're trying to expect from you.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:59:18):\nThe story in my head is that talking to me and my colleagues sometimes can feel a little like death by frameworks. We have one for everything and in this example, I think if you're going to be sustainably successful in any kind of job, I don't care what it is, three things have to be true. You have to be good at it, you have to like it, and the market has to give a shit about it. And if one of those is off, you're not staying in that job long.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):\nYeah. And this touches on the name of your firm, Enjoy The Work, got to enjoy the work to make it sustainable. Okay, one other thing. So one other follow up question real quick on the hiring and then I want to talk about one other bucket of work. And again, I think each of these could be like an hour, two hour long podcast conversation. I love that there's this recurring theme of working backwards to inform what you do today. So earlier you talked about working backwards from what the outcome you want next for your business, whether it's fundraising or exit or winding down. And for hiring, you have the similar advice, work backwards from what you want this person to achieve in the first year, whether it's drive this sort of growth in the product or drive sales. I guess anything else there of just the power of working backwards versus the typical approach for hiring, you talked about job descriptions.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:00:26):\nHiring is never the goal and it's often the first thing that we'll hear from a founder, \"I have to hire this person.\" One, that is so dangerous for confirmation bias. The hiring manager is always the one most burdened by that particular bias, but it's also hiring is never the goal. We will pull them back to over and over and over again, which of the three milestones matter, right? Fundraise, exit, profitability. What has to change about the business, for example, to get to that fundraise? How do we quantify that change? Some sort of goal setting framework. OKRs, EOs, I don't care. All goal setting frameworks have the same bones. There's some description of it, there's some quantification of it, there's some work that has to be done. There's some accountability rituals with clear owners and clear agreements.\n\n(01:01:18):\nSo once I actually have the quantification of here's what work needs to be done, I now know what resources I need to be able to pull that work forward and therefore now I know what kind of humans I need, whether I'm hiring or renting. And that should drive the conversation, not the, \"Oh God, I need another PM.\" It's no, here's the set of features that we've said matter most this year. Here's the gap in the resources we have and the resources we need, that's why we're hiring this role. And here's what success would look like 12 months from now or six months from now. So they're tying back to what would change about the business.\n\n(01:01:57):\nAnd this is this recurring theme of our work with our founders. They're so in it Lenny that they rarely have time to sit above what they're working on. This notion of working in the business versus on the business. And so much of our work is to separate them from the day-to-day, which is enormously important, not in any way denigrating it, and I need to know where I'm headed and why, and how I'm going to measure progress along the way. And so, so much of what we're doing with them is to say, I want to hear from you what you think success looks like. I'm going to push back and pressure test a bunch of things. Can we define that in a way? Can we agree on who needs to do the work along the way, and how we're going to keep checking on it to keep feedback loop short? Now we can go back into business and then we'll check again in a week or in a month.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:54):\nI love that. That's actually a great segue to the final bucket I want to spend some time on which is growth and go to market. Another area that many founders have never worked on before. A lot of founders are like, Hey, I have this awesome idea. I'm going to build this awesome product. I know how to do that. I know what market needs. But building a go-to-market motion to get it into people's hands is a whole different skill. We spent a lot of time on this on the podcast, you have a really cool simple framework of just how to think about go-to-market. There's all this like, oh, you need a go-to-market strategy. Talk about how you talk to founders about thinking about what it takes to put together a go-to-market plan and how to make it a repeatable motion versus just I'm just going to go to people and try to sell them.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:03:37):\nOur founders, even the most capable of them find this topic pretty overwhelming because it branches into so many areas. So we do try and distill it to something that is in bite-sized chunks. We think of it in four pieces. The first piece is ideal customer profile. Who do we really want to sell to? What are their qualifications? What are the discovery questions we would use to get to those qualifications? What are the kill criteria to know that this is [inaudible 01:04:10] fool's goal, this really isn't the human?\n\n(01:04:13):\nSecond bucket, loosely called marketing. But within that marketing is also positioning. So what is our uncommon denominator from the enemies? So who are we competing against? Is it actual companies or is it status quo in some sort? What are they great at? What are we great at? What are we great at that they're not? Then how do we represent that in the world? That's branding and artifacts and identity work, et cetera.\n\n(01:04:44):\nNext is demand gen, which we'll simplify to say, how do we go find the humans we want? I've long loved the book Traction that Gabriel Weinberg... I'm going to forget unfortunately the co-author's name right now, Jason Mares? Sorry. Where they talk about the 19 channels that all companies have availability to, they're the same ones. Now the book has got a couple of years on it, so there are a couple of new channels that have popped out since, but what we then try and expand the aperture for our founders is rather than just think about meeting your next customer through however you did at your last company, availability bias, instead, which of these might make most sense next? A simple two by two matrix can work here like some experimentation, some brain writing. Love brain writing, not brainstorming. I know you've talked about that on prior pods. And then high impact, low effort. Can we think of the three or four experiments we want to run by channel? Let's go play.\n\n(01:05:48):\nAnd then fourth, sales. And this is the codification of a playbook. How are we having the conversation? How are we doing discovery? How are we handling objections? How are we doing demo? How are we moving to close? If we can get through those four, then we can start to talk about deployment and customer success and upselling and account management, et cetera, et cetera. Those are good problems to have. Oh my god, my install base is so large, I need to manage it. Great, great fricking problem. But we try and break this complexity of going from individually selling to building a machine into just these four buckets. Who am I selling to? What do we want to say about ourselves? How do we reach them? How do we close them?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:28):\nAmazing. I was going to summarize that. You did an excellent job there. Before we follow up on this, you mentioned this term brain writing. What does that mean?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:06:35):\nOh, first time I heard of this was Adam Grant. I don't know if he's the originator of the idea. Brainstorming, you talked about this a bit in your Annie Duke podcast as well of how horribly coercive meetings can be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:55):\nFor brainstorming, especially.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:06:56):\nFor brainstorming especially. And so, what many of our founders don't recognize because they just see like, Hey, I'm just sitting around a table with a group of folks I respect, so we can just debate things as peers. No, you can't. You're a founder. Your voice has a megaphone attached to it even if you can't hear it. So you have to turn down the megaphone if you actually want to learn what your people have to say. So brain writing is I'm going to expose an idea and I want everyone to now write and weigh in on there... it could be in a survey, it could be in a shared doc, what have you, my preferences in through some sort of methodology, you are now sharing your opinions, comments, edits, dreams, in an async way that no one else can see until it's all combined, maybe even ideally without authorship identified.\n\n(01:07:50):\nThen when the founders weigh in, you don't know, they're just a part of the mass. Let everyone read the thing. I even like the Amazon, take the first 10 minutes of a meeting, let's just go read so we're all fully present and then have a debate. What it allows for is the dampening of the founder effect in meetings.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):\nYou're just so full of golden nuggets. That's just like a random tangent that I think could be really transformative for a lot of teams. So the advice here is just when you're trying to ideate and brainstorm, don't go in a big room and put post- its on a wall and talk throughout ideas and have a discussion. Instead, just everyone individually sits and thinks and shares their thoughts and the founder presents, here's a problem, here's a question we're trying to tackle.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:08:39):\nWhat it also allows for is an evening of the playing field between fast processors and slow processors, introverts and extroverts, because they're all equally potentially talented in your room, but if you do live brainstorming, you have diminished all the folks that prefer to sit and chew on something first.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:02):\nThat's very much me. That's exactly how I operate. I need to think and process. I'm not on the spot quick thinker person. So 100% fan of this approach. Let me come back to your go-to-market framework. I have the notes pulled up here. So basically if you're a founder or even a product builder and you're trying to think about how do I... people keep telling me I need a go to market plan, I need to grow this thing. How do I think about this? You're basically saying there's these four buckets to think about; who are you selling to? How are you going to motivate them and get them excited to buy your thing? How do you reach them? And then how do you close them?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:09:37):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:39):\nLuckily I have podcasts and newsletter posts on every single one of these buckets, if folks want to pursue each one of these. I have templates for ICPs, marketing advice, all these things. So that's good news. There's a lot of content for people to read if they want to explore this stuff. Let me ask you, where do you often find the biggest bang for your buck when you come to a founder or if founder comes to you and they're like, I need to figure out, go-to-market motions? Just start from the top and work your way down. Or is there, here's where maybe you want to spend a lot of time.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:10:10):\nEarly stage founders, and this is certainly more true for the first timers Lenny than the veterans 'cause they learn this problem. The first timers are like twenty-something year olds in a bar and they're being social for the first time in their lives, and anyone that makes eye contact with them is enough for them to say, I want to go on a date with you. That's it. There's no discrimination of any kind, like, oh my god, they like me, I'm in. That's the mistake that hounds first timers. The veterans and those we get our hands on. Instead, we say, let's imagine you could build your perfect customer in a lab, like a Petri dish and you grew them, what do they look like? And if you have any kind of install base, I'll ask the question. I just did this with the founder the other day. They are enterprise whale hunting business. They have four large customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:13):\nWait, actually whale... okay, whale hunting in terms of large wealth person or actual whales?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:11:21):\nThe extreme of enterprise selling.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):\nOkay, okay, got it. I want to see a whale hunting startup. Okay, go on.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:11:29):\nI said, so which of your four customers is your favorite? Which one, if I got them on the phone, they would rave about you. They would be salivating openly with a chance to evangelize what you're doing for them. And they was like, oh, that's clear. It's this one of the four. Great. Tell me about them. And what you start to see and pull apart from that is the founder does have an ideal profile. They do have a dream. Now, there are all sorts of risks about is the world too small? Is it not a big enough market if they get too tight, and founders get so caught up in that and it's a mistake because all we're-\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:12:00):\n... so caught up in that, and it's a mistake. Because all we're looking for in the beginning is a white-hot center of opportunity, a small population that is an enormous fan that's getting enormous impact. We can worry about adjacencies and expansion later. I like to remind them that Amazon just sold books. We can start with one thing and be great at it. So where the founders often get hung up on for us is that they've moved towards selling without contemplating ideal customer profile, without contemplating qualifications, without contemplating discovery questions that get to that. And most importantly, kill criteria, if this is true do not sign them, even if they want to go out on a date with you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):\nI'm glad you said that because that's exactly what I believe and I hear often on this podcast is how underappreciated picking your customers in early leads are. And if you think about this funnel you described, figure out who you're selling to, how do you motivate them, find them and then sell them, all this trickles down from who are you going after. You will know how to motivate them if you know who you're talking to versus the opposite. If you're talking to everyone-\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:13:11):\nIt's the most expensive mistake of those four.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:15):\nOkay. Is there anything else on go-to-market or growth you think might be helpful just to touch on before we close up our conversation?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:13:25):\nThe one thing I'll share, this goes back to the ready, fire, aim that we talked about earlier, is that there's implicitly a funnel, mathematical funnel, to what we just described. And founders often make the mistake when planning for the year ahead of I need to be at this revenue to justify this multiple. And then all of the funnel math is a plug, and that's death, as opposed to here's what's been true for the last three months, six months, nine months, 12 months. And then what assumptions can I reasonably make with ways I'm going to influence that funnel going forward, to go build up to where I think I'll be a year from now? And it just lowers the bias that your planning process operates with.\n\n(01:14:15):\nBut when a founder starts from a place of, \"I have to get to 3 million or we're dead,\" you're already dead. As opposed to what do I really believe I can do to get there, changing top of the funnel, changing conversion rates along the way, changing a deal size or deal length, et cetera based on my recent history, and then have a conversation about the gap between where I think the business reasonably can get with some ambition, and where I think I need to be financially, because that's the more mature conversation and that's the one the ready, fire, aim CEO doesn't have. That's the one most founders have only started to learn to have over the last few years when capital dried up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):\nI love that. I love just how practical and real talk your advice always ends up being. Speaking of that, I emailed a founder that you work with and asked him, \"What should I ask? What should I ask Jonathan when he comes on the podcast?\"\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:14:57):\nUh-oh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:09):\nAnd he said something that was really... That's great. It was really unexpected what he said. He said that the biggest lesson he learned from you is to, as a founder, to trust his intuition more throughout the journey of his startup. Can you just talk about that as something you've learned, something you've seen, that maybe founders under appreciate?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:15:31):\nIt's impossible not to be a startup CEO and not face many existential moments. Is my company going to survive? Did I make a mistake? Will I ever be hired again? Should I sell the company now? Should I break up with a co-founder? Should I fire this critical employee? They happen to all of us. And fear is not a good decision maker. Our lizard brain is a really bad decision maker in those moments.\n\n(01:16:07):\nAnd so what we'll often share with the founder who's facing one of these scenarios, and I know the CEO you're describing and he's facing one of these scenarios, we'll say to them, \"Do you know that little voice when you get really still, the quiet one that says you should marry this person, you should take this job, you should start this company? Watch out for that human, they're a bad one.\" And most of the time, Lenny, when I frame it that way the person across me says, \"Yeah, I know that voice.\" And I'll ask, \"How do you hear it?\" And they're usually some version of, \"I have to get really alone, really still, really quiet, walk on the beach, listen to music, work out, play with my pet.\"\n\n(01:17:06):\nI said that voice is who you are. It's not your brain. Your brain is a tool. It's our hands, it's our feet, just a tool. It's a pattern recognition machine. But who you are, if you can watch your brain, you know what you're thinking, like, oh, look what my brain's doing. That means you're not your brain. It's something else. And that's the little voice, and that little voice is going to be right. And where we get screwed up in life is when we stop listening to that voice, when the mania of our chaos of our lives get in the way of that voice.\n\n(01:17:42):\nAnd so whenever our founders face one of those moments, it's not a framework, it's not a playbook, or even a directed piece of advice from us to say, \"You should just go left. I've seen this before. Go left.\" Nope. I trust founder intuition. If the founder says this business is still going to work, or this co-founder is the wrong person, or yes, it's time to sell, I'm in. We're just here to support them. And we try and be the only person in their life that is fully on their team because we're not on the preferred side of the CAFS table. We're not fiduciary, we're not board members, not a co-founder, none of those things. And so in those moments we'll just say, \"Can you get really quiet?\"\n\n(01:18:21):\nAnd the founder you're talking about, I have the story in my head, he was facing a breakup moment with his co-founder, and I asked him, because he's good at getting quiet, \"What did the voice say to you way back when?\" And the voice said to him, \"This is the wrong fit. This isn't going to work. He believes in different things than I do, and that's going to go badly.\" But the lizard brain didn't want to believe that, and so it took another year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:58):\nWow. I had tingles throughout that entire piece of advice. I love how it's also very applicable to just life, not even just being a founder. It's a good reminder to trust that voice more. It's interesting that this also connects to founder-mode a little bit, and I'm curious how you think about that where a lot of the founder-mode advice is like trust your judgment, don't hire people to delegate things away. Do you see a difference in the core idea of founder-mode and just like, but you should actually trust your intuition more?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:19:35):\nIntuition comes from, in my point of view, a deep understanding of self, and the capacity to get quiet and be well resourced, meaning you've slept well and you've eaten well and you have enough love in your world. And I think what founder-mode can confuse is my intuition says I should just do this job for them and fire these three people. That's not intuition, that's reaction, that's a fear response. And when the founder says, \"I sat with this, I felt it out, I can see it. I need to terminate my whole go-to-market team and start over. This isn't working, and I have data that supports it, but I know this isn't working.\" I'm like, \"Let's go with that. I'm in. Let's do it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):\nAnd I think you described a lot of times people feel this, and it takes a year, two years, three years, many years to actually realize that. And your advice here is try to listen to that more and trust it more. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Well, Jonathan to pivot our energy, is there anything else want to leave listeners with, last piece of advice, anything that you think might be helpful before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:21:04):\nTo be a founder is a state of being. It's an attitude, it's courage, it's instinct, it's a capacity to push through, despite all sorts of evidence suggesting you're wasting your time. To be a CEO is a craft. The more founders who can accept that those are two separate things and they're both equally important to build an ascendant startup, the better all of us will be. And so what I would encourage every founder out there that wants to go build something substantial, go work on your craft in addition to working on the business. Be honest with yourself about here's the shit I'm bad at. I don't know how to read a financial statement. My board meetings suck. Half my meetings that I have with my leadership team we all walk out of there saying what did we just accomplish right now? Or I get to the end of my workday and I'm like, I didn't get anything done. Those are all examples of just not taking the craft seriously enough. I'll leave with that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:18):\nI love that. And I think I've made the mistake during our conversation of confusing founder and CEO and assuming they're the same thing, and I really appreciate you just again pointing out to folks that that's the big distinction you got to start making is there's the founder and there's the CEO. Often they're same person, but different parts of your brain and different skill sets.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:22:36):\nAnd I'm now fully off the very awkward soapbox I've been sitting on for a long time, so we can go to lightning round whenever you're ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:44):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lighting round. Jonathan, are you ready?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:22:48):\nI'm ready. I'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:49):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:22:54):\nMy number one business book that I've recommended would be Five Dysfunctions of a Team, by Patrick Lencioni. I do think it always comes back to team. The right team can solve all the things. And that book is a beautiful distillation of the most common problematic archetypes that show up in a leadership group. So that's the number one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:16):\nAmazing. Anything else you'd recommend?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:23:19):\nThe second one, it goes more personal. It's a book called Untethered Soul, by Michael Singer. It was, at least for me, the first introduction to this idea that I am not my brain and that my brain can be a tool that serves me well, and at times doesn't. So that would be number two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:38):\nI've started to read that book and then I never finished it, so this is a good reminder to give it another shot. Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:23:50):\nI just watched and really enjoyed, because by the way, I have a three-year-old at home, so the amount of content I now consume is reduced tremendously. Well, my wife and I just watched Will & Harper. This is the documentary between Will Ferrell and his very dear friend who just recently transitioned. They road trip across the country together, and it was freaking delightful. It was sweet and endearing and one of the better things I've watched in a while.\n\n(01:24:19):\nTV show, Slow Horses, I'm utterly addicted. I'm only midway through season two, but I've been voraciously sleeping less and watching more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:31):\nI love both those. I just watched Will & Harper, and completely agree with your sentiment about it. I wasn't planning to watch it. My mother-in-Law started watching. I'm like, wow, this is really fun. It's also funny, meaningful funny.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:24:43):\nThere's so many moments in it that are really sweet. As an aside, this was '20, I don't know, April 2020, and a group of our very close friends said, \"Hey, how are we going to keep in touch?\" And so we started what we called Movie Club, and we routinely either pick a TV show or a movie. We all watch separately and every two weeks we get together on Zoom at night, we talk about what we just watched.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:06):\nI love that.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:25:07):\nAnd some have been great, some have been terrible. But Will & Harper was our most recent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:10):\nOh, such a cool tradition. Okay, we'll keep going. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be something physical?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:25:21):\nTwo, and one is I'm going to talk my own book, but I still love it. The first one is Aura Frames. These are digital picture frames. They're amazing. The UX for them is incredible, the quality of it, they're pieces of artwork. So grandparents, in-laws, parents, we have multiple in our house, just love it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):\nJust to clarify, it's a frame that has picked digital photos and you can give it to your mom and show photos of your kid wherever they live. Is that right?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:25:55):\nAnd the combination of the ease of the software and the quality of the imagery is better than anything I've tried, and I've tried a bunch of them. A-U-R-A Frames, and this is not an Enjoy The Work company. This is just one I'm a giant fan of.\n\n(01:26:08):\nThe second one is an Enjoy The Work company called Augie Studio. A-U-G-I-E Studio. This is Canva for video. It can turn anyone with no engineering skills whatsoever, no code video creation, with full editing tools. So suddenly you can create branded high fidelity, high quality commercial video in minutes, with no effort. It's amazing. It was built by two media tech co-founders that were building this thing pre-ChatGPT, and it's just growing like this, and it's super fun, and the guys are great. So A-U-G-I-E Studio.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:51):\nSounds amazing. Augie Studio, I could use that. That sounds awesome. Two more questions. I feel like this one's going to be a good one. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work on in life?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:27:04):\nThe first one, and the one that I probably most commonly refer to, is that there is only one life. The quick backstory, and I know it's a lightning round, but I'm guilty of these stories. I went for a walk with a girlfriend of mine a bunch of years ago. And we did this once a month and we would always have a pretty typical ritual of giving each other life updates to begin the walk. And so I started the conversation with, \"So there's the family update and then there's my work life and then there's my social life.\" She's like, \"No, no, no, no, no, stop. That's all bullshit. It's one life. Stop assuming that there are these pretend walls between them or among them.\" I've lived that ever since.\n\n(01:27:42):\nSo I try and show up. That phrase lets me show up the same way, no matter my setting. If you and I were having a beer or a meal, or if I'm sitting with one of my co-founders or clients, it doesn't matter, I show up the same way everywhere. Part of the way I enjoy the work is by having a real friendship, a real intimacy with everyone at Enjoy The Work, and including our clients as well, I want that level of conversation. I don't want the sterile stuff over here with my work environment versus my personal versus my family. It's just one version of me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:15):\nAnd the phrase is, it's just one life.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:28:17):\nJust one life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:18):\nIt's just one life. Final question. So you ran a casino at one point, I believe, and it was like a Harrah's Casino, is that right?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:28:28):\nMy first career was in the casino business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:30):\nOkay.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:28:31):\nBut before I go on, what's the question?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:32):\nThe question is just is there a fun story, or experience, or lesson from that time in your life that might be fun to share? Maybe a mob involvement, or cheating, or something? I imagine that's a unique life experience.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:28:48):\nI'll tell one of my favorite family stories then briefly. But yes, my family goes back in casino gambling in one form or another, several generations. My great-grandmother ran a illicit poker game. My grandfather ran numbers out of a gas station. My father's been in the casino industry since Atlantic City in the 70s. My sister is a prominent gaming attorney, and I worked in the industry for a dozen years, so this is my family. And Lenny, I didn't know any of this was weird until I was in my mid 20s.\n\n(01:29:18):\nI turned 21, and I'm old, yes, I'm going to just hide the year. I'm kidding. Anyway, I turned 21 and we take a family trip to Las Vegas because that was normal for us. My father was doing a lot of work out there, so he got us hotel rooms, etc. I'd never been there before, and I was newly 21 and so my parents said, \"You have $300 to gamble with. We're going to be here for five days.\" This is a vacation. My grandparents are coming in. My uncle and aunt were coming in, and they're encouraging me, \"This is all up to you, but try not to lose it all on night number one,\" which was good advice to give me. I was 21 and I was pretty much a schmuck at the time. But also, part of my experience being there was to interview for a summer internship. I was a college going to be junior.\n\n(01:30:06):\nSo we go and I immediately go sit at some table and start playing some games. And I turn $300 into a few thousand dollars in the very first evening. And that was exciting and it was crazy and it was wild, et cetera. On the third night, which happens to everyone who goes to Vegas for too long, we're all delirious because all of us are staying up all night and being silly and being stupid. And my parents ask me, by the way, this is pre-cell phones, they ask me, \"Hey, can you stay awake? Your uncle and aunt are going to arrive late tonight. They'll call the room. You can come down and just greet them and say hello?\" Sure. So I get the phone call like 11: 30 at night. Go on downstairs, they're here. I go downstairs in the casino floor. We're staying at the Las Vegas Hilton. It's since been renamed, but I go downstairs and I can't find them anywhere. I think, okay, well I have cash in my pocket and I'm now awake so I might as well gamble.\n\n(01:30:53):\nShortly thereafter, Lenny, I have an experience that happens one in 369,000 occurrences, and I win $35,421.92. For the trip I ended up winning $40,000 that I turned $300 to, and I was just 21 years old, which has left me with one of my mantras that I've had for the rest of my life, which some people roll their eyes at, but that is gambling does pay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:20):\nI love that you remember the exact amount. What games did you end up playing that helped you win so much money?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:31:27):\nThe primary game that I played was Caribbean Stud Poker, where there's no skill of any kind. You get five cards, the dealer gets five cards, whoever wins wins, and if you have particularly unusual hands you get odds on the hand. And I got dealt 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of spades in five cards.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:44):\nI thought you'd say slots or something. I love that you're just sitting there playing poker and went from $300 to $40,000.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:31:51):\nIt's not even real poker.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:53):\nThat was a great story. I'm glad I went there. Jonathan, this was incredible. I think we've helped a lot of founders through this conversation. Two final questions. Where can folks find you guys? Who would be a good fit? What should people know about Enjoy the Work? And finally, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:32:10):\nLove that. So let me unpack those three. The first one is enjoythework.com, or just find me on LinkedIn. I'm not hard to find. Send us a note.\n\n(01:32:22):\nWho should ping us is very simple. If you're a founder out there, or a CEO out there, and you know in your heart that there's some gap between how you're running the business and how the company's going, and how it could be going, and how you could be running the business, if there's some gap there, we're here to help. Now our expertise, as we talked about in this call, is company building. So if you just have an idea on a napkin or you have a science experiment that you're not sure, we're useless, that's not us. But if you have some breadcrumbs worth following, like the business is starting to work, you're a series A into B and beyond, and you know that there's better, you can see it, that's where we help. Send us a note. Love to chat.\n\n(01:33:06):\nHow can listeners be useful to us? So we are ferocious readers. All we try and do is study how do the best startups do X? From tiny things, like how do they run all hands meetings or off sites to the big meta topics of what is going to repeatable go-to-market even mean? Or what is financial planning in a way that's useful? Or how do you set goals that won't make you roll your eyes? We consistently learn from the ecosystem of podcasters and authors and journalists, like, go look at this material. So if your listeners have a favorite X on whatever topic in running a startup, send them my way. All we love to do is read and chew on that stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:54):\nAwesome. And the best way to send that is either through Enjoy the Work or LinkedIn.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:33:58):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:59):\nAwesome. Jonathan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:34:02):\nLenny, this was so damn fun. Thanks for listening to my crazy casino stories.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:07):\nI want to hear more, but we got to go. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:34:11):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Managing nerves, anxiety, and burnout | Jonny Miller (Nervous Systems Mastery)\n\n## Transcript\n\nJonny Miller (00:00:00):\nI have this idea that I call the feather brick dump truck phenomenon, and basically what that means is when we are showing early signs of burnout, our body will give us feedback usually in subtle ways in the beginning. So the feather might be waking up in the morning and feeling a little bit tired, maybe a little bit exhausted. The brick, maybe you ignore that or you don't notice it, and then three or four weeks later, you have a fight with someone or an argument, or you just feel frustrated and terrible and you lose your cool. And then maybe the dump truck is a month later, or even a year later, there's a full-blown health crisis, or you develop type two diabetes or there's a whole range of things, or maybe you get fired. Ideally, you want to notice when it's the feather and then make adjustments or shift then and not have to wait until you experience the full-blown pain of the dump truck, which unfortunately is what happens to a lot of people, especially when they experience burnout for the first time.\n\nLenny (00:01:02):\nToday, my guest is Jonny Miller. Jonny teaches courses and does one-on-one coaching with tech professionals helping them with something he calls Nervous System Mastery, which is essentially a set of tools and techniques for cultivating calm, upgrading your resilience, and increasing your aliveness. If you can get better at dealing with stressful situations, avoiding burnout and being more confident in meetings and big presentations, it becomes a superpower and a huge advantage in both business and in life. I actually read a post by Jonny about a year ago, and it totally changed the way that I think about nervousness and stress, and I still apply many of his lessons today.\n\n(00:01:41):\nIn our conversation, we dive deep into Jonny's key insights. We talk about why the best way to stay calm in stressful situations is to focus on the state of your body and not your mind. How to create calm and confidence by changing the state of your body through breath. Jonny shares a bunch of very specific breathing exercises for creating calm and also for creating energy that we actually try out on the podcast. We also get into a bunch of advice for how to tell if you're seeing early signs of burnout, how to release emotional debt that you may be feeling. Also, why feeling the feels gives you a competitive advantage in business. Also, a practice called APE, which reminds you to focus on your awareness, your posture, and your emotions that have started practicing ever since our chat and so much more.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nJonny Miller (00:04:37):\nIt's great to be here, Lenny.\n\nLenny (00:04:38):\nSo I read this post that you wrote, I think it was over a year ago at this point. It was called The Operating Manual for Your Nervous System, and first of all, blew my mind when I read it. Second of all, I always think about it when I get nervous or anxious in a situation, it's really stuck with me. And I know that people in the workplace often get nervous and anxious doing all hand presentations, meetings, performance reviews, all the things. So I thought it'd be awesome just to dive into the stuff that you've uncovered about how we can become less nervous and less anxious. Before we get into the meat of it, I'd love to just spend a couple minutes just getting a sense of why you got into this stuff. What actually got you to spend so much of your energy and life force trying to understand how the nervous system works, how to get people to be less nervous and anxious.\n\nJonny Miller (00:05:27):\nMy story starts in I kind of have a background in tech. I had a startup, we went through Techstars back in 2012. About five and a half years into that experience, I went through burnout, which is pretty common in the startup world, but that actually wasn't the trigger for me. I find that usually people that get into this type of work, there's some kind of catalyst or some kind of challenging life event. And for me, that was October 23rd, 2017, and my fiance at the time had an anxiety attack and she took her own life. And that completely just destroyed me at the time. And I realized that I'd been so disconnected from my body and my emotions, and it sent me on this five plus year journey to discover all of this inner landscape that I'd been numb from the neck down, and I went into breathwork meditation retreats, did hundreds of breathwork journeys, researched with a breath lab over in Bali, and basically just kind of directed all of my focus and attention onto understanding this inner landscape that I'd been pretty much oblivious to. And since then, I've been working with founders, executives, running courses and teaching what I'm learning and hopefully still researching at the same time as well.\n\nLenny (00:06:52):\nWow. And I imagine the thinking was that if your wife had these skills, she would've had another path.\n\nJonny Miller (00:07:00):\nYeah, that was definitely part of it, yeah. And also just since realizing how many people are struggling with anxiety, depression, all of this kind of constellation of mental health challenges both in the workplace and at home as well. And yeah, it's been a very rewarding journey.\n\nLenny (00:07:19):\nAll right, this episode's already gotten very heavy and I'm sucked in. I'm excited to learn all these things that you've uncovered. So let's just get into the meat of it. Just talk about this kind of general method that you've found for how to help people become less nervous and anxious.\n\nJonny Miller (00:07:38):\nSo I find this top down, bottom up distinction to be incredibly helpful. Most people when they try to calm down, they use tactical reframes or maybe mindfulness or maybe reframing the situation in a positive light. There's lots of different practices that people use which do have some effect. But in my experience, working with the physiology, using what's known as a bottom up approach, primarily using the breath, although there's also other approaches that you can use, it's just such a rapidly more effective way of shifting your state.\n\n(00:08:11):\n And to give a little bit of context and maybe some science as well, we have what's known as afferent and efferent neurons going up and down our body, and there's four times more afferent neurons going from the body to the brain as from the brain to the body. So you can almost imagine there's a super highway of traffic of information going up to the brain and four times less going from the brain to the body. And so by learning how to pull on the levers of our physiology, we can rapidly change our state. And then from there, by changing our state, that impacts the thoughts and feelings that we have. So instead of trying to change the story or trying to fix something or trying to solve something, which is what most people do by default, myself included in the past, if you change your state first, then there's a cascading effect which changes your thoughts and your feelings.\n\nLenny (00:09:06):\nOkay, amazing. Yeah, and just to share how I felt when I was reading this and try to understand this approach is whenever I get nervous, there's always this like, oh, my body's starting to feel anxious. And then I think of a reason. Oftentimes, I don't know why it gets nervous, why my body's starting to create this feeling of anxiety. And then I often realize I'm just now trying to just explain why it happened, \"Oh, I have this big meeting coming up, or I have this podcast episode I'm nervous about, or I'm not going to make a deadline for my newsletter.\" I often experience this where it's just like, \"Oh, something feels nervous.\" And then, \"Okay, here's the explanation.\" So maybe just along those lines, what else is there that might be helpful for people to think about in this context?\n\nJonny Miller (00:09:47):\nI mean, I think it's helpful to understand the process by which, by changing the way that we breathe, for example, it shifts our physiological state and changes our nervous system. So if you're listening to this, maybe you, Lenny, you can try this as well. If you start breathing into your upper chest and shallow fairly, fairly rapid, maybe even through the mouth, that will then there's a part of your brain called the insular cortex, which is basically constantly spying on the way that we're breathing and it will register that change, it will then send information to activate the endocrine system, which then creates shift in our blood chemistry. The sympathetic nervous system gets activated and that increase in adrenaline and cortisol starts to flood your body. Everyone's probably very familiar with that feeling. And then that will then have a cascading impact on the thoughts that you're having and the way that you feel. And so you just shared, we have a tendency to kind of confabulate or make up stories that match the state that we are in. And so that's kind of what happens when we're breathing in that way. And then you can also consciously change your breath to breathe in a different way, which has the reverse effects, which I can go into, but I'll pause there.\n\nLenny (00:11:05):\nYeah. So I think one of the big actionable takeaways here is that instead of trying to convince yourself, \"No, this talk is going to go great, I don't need to worry about how I'm going to look in this meeting.\" Basically instead of going top down, trying to calm your body through thought, your advice is calm your body first because then your mind will notice, \"Hey, I'm actually not as nervous as I thought. Maybe things are going to be okay.\" Is that right?\n\nJonny Miller (00:11:29):\nYeah, precisely. And I mean I've used this myself many times before presentations. I gave a TEDx talk a few years ago and I was like my entire body, I was just terrified. And I did in 15 minutes of this breathing practice before and walked on stage almost cool as a cucumber. It's very effective.\n\nLenny (00:11:47):\nSounds too good to be true. But we're going to do some of these exercises for people. Before we get into, why is it that breath specifically so powerful? It feels like such a strange thing to work so well, just this idea of breathing in a different way. You talked a bit about this, I forget what you called it, that kind of watches how you're breathing. But I guess what else can you share about just why is breath so effective in changing our state?\n\nJonny Miller (00:12:10):\nSure. Well, it's one of the few things which happens automatically, but we can also control it consciously. And so what scientists have discovered that when the exhale is twice as long as the inhale, it has a calming effect. And when the inhale is either more intense or twice as long as the exhale, it has an activating effect. So you can kind of think of this as an up or down lever on the nervous system.\n\nLenny (00:12:36):\nYou also have this really clever way of describing this system. You call it state over story, essentially focusing on the state of your body versus the story you're telling yourself. Is that the way to think about it? And can you just talk about that concept?\n\nJonny Miller (00:12:48):\nYeah, so it's basically a shorthand for what we've just been talking about, which is most people tend to approach the problem or try to solve things on the level of story. So there's multiple ways you can do that through the breath as we just talked about. You can also defocus your gaze and kind of relax your eyes, and that has a similar effect. It can expand your awareness and kind of bring your awareness to behind you and the sides of you and below you, or you can breathe in these ways which emphasize the exhale. And so when we breathe in a way with say the exhale twice as long as the inhale, that part of the brain, the insular cortex then sends signals to the parasympathetic nervous system, which then has the cascading effect on our endocrine system and calms us down. And what I usually find as well is that the kind of reactive thoughts and feelings that we have when we are in that kind of anxious loop, they can be self-reinforcing. And so if someone has a thought of like, \"Oh no, I'm nervous before this important presentation.\" Then that exacerbates the breathing pattern and then the whole thing just goes into this spiral, which can end up in full-blown panic attacks if there's not an intervention of some sorts.\n\nLenny (00:13:57):\nYeah, that's what I find with my nerves. I hate talking on stage. I get nervous before every podcast. This is not my natural state.\n\nJonny Miller (00:14:04):\nInteresting.\n\nLenny (00:14:05):\nYeah, and I hide it well.\n\nJonny Miller (00:14:07):\nIs that still the case with podcast today?\n\nLenny (00:14:09):\nAbsolutely. And it's like different levels of nervousness, but it's always just like, \"Oh, there we go.\" I'm not a performer person. Even I kind of push myself to do this podcast as a way to get better at this, to be honest. So it's still a thing that I think about. And what I find is the nervousness comes from exactly what you described is the nervousness of being nervous. I don't know, there's no reason specifically to be anxious, but I don't know how I'll be once I do the thing. So it's nervous of what it might look like or end up being like. So that's exactly what I ran into.\n\nJonny Miller (00:14:41):\nYeah. And there's obviously people say mindfulness, meditation, things like that, that can increase the psychological space between stimulus and response. And that is something that obviously does help over the long term, but it's in my opinion, nowhere near as rapid and effective and efficient as just changing the way that you're breathing.\n\nLenny (00:15:00):\nAwesome. So let's get into it. I know you have a couple exercises specifically for this, and then we'll go from there.\n\nJonny Miller (00:15:06):\nWe can stack a few of the exercises and I'll try and keep it to a minute or so. So yeah, if you want to get comfy in your chair and sit up straight, feel your butt on the seat, and I find it helpful to kind of be aware of the space behind you and above you as well, kind of expanding your awareness so that you are aware of the space behind to the sides and above.\n\nLenny (00:15:29):\nAnd should we close your eyes?\n\nJonny Miller (00:15:31):\nYeah, and close your eyes down. If you're listening and driving, obviously don't do that. But yeah, closing the eyes down for sure helps. And now we're just going to do simple breath. We're going to inhale in through the nose for four. We're going to hold the breath at the top for four, and we're going to exhale for eight, and then we're going to repeat. So let the breath go and inhaling through the nose. Inhale, 2, 3, 4, hold the breath, 2, 3, 4. And exhale, 8, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Inhale, 2, 3, 4, hold the breath, 2, 3, 4, and exhale, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And now you can let go of the breath completely and we'll end with one round of humming, which is surprisingly effect of it calming as well. So take a full breath in and humming through the nose all the way to the end of exhale. Let out a sigh if that feels good and open up your eyes.\n\nLenny (00:17:01):\nI feel extremely calm. I should do this every podcast episode before we start.\n\nJonny Miller (00:17:08):\nA note on the humming. It also releases nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator, and that helps to create that kind of calming effect and it also reduces eye tension as well. So I'll do it if I've been looking to screen for too long. It's really good for kind of reducing eye fatigue as well.\n\nLenny (00:17:24):\nAnd there's also a vagus nerve component to it because your body's vibrating, is that true?\n\nJonny Miller (00:17:28):\nYeah, precisely. So it kind of tones or stimulates the vagus nerve, which stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system.\n\nLenny (00:17:35):\nWhat's your advice for doing this? Is this before you go into a big meeting or a presentation? How do you apply this?\n\nJonny Miller (00:17:42):\nI kind of like to share building a toolkit of different practices that are appropriate for different contexts. So something like the 4, 4, 8 breathing, you could do pretty much anywhere without anyone necessarily noticing. Humming is slightly more obvious, but if you're about to jump on a zoom or something, you can totally do it with your eyes closed. Things like expanding your awareness or bringing your awareness down to your feet and your hands, which creates a kind of grounding calming effect that also you can do if you're in a busy room. Maybe you have social anxiety, even orienting and labeling things that you are hearing and feeling, kind of bringing the awareness and attention back into the body that also has an effect. And then there's longer practices for say, non-sleep deep rests, belly breathing, things that you can do if you have 10, 20 minutes and you're at home and you want a downshift.\n\n(00:18:30):\nSo I like to kind of give people a big toolkit to see what works for them and then cherry-pick which ones are suitable to different situations. And another way that I think about this is, I call it, if this, then breathe. So it's like if I feel overwhelmed, then I do the humming. If I feel anxious, then I do 4, 4, 8 breathing or alternate nostril breathing and kind of having my own little recipe set that I have for different context is really helpful and I work with people to kind of build those toolkits themselves.\n\nLenny (00:19:03):\nThis sounds like it needs to be a website where people can go with these lists of if this, then that is there a place that we could send people in the show notes and if not, you should make one before we go live.\n\nJonny Miller (00:19:13):\nThere is not currently. It's part of the curriculum in the course that I have, but-\n\nLenny (00:19:17):\nOkay, great.\n\nJonny Miller (00:19:18):\n... I can maybe see if I can spin one up as well, but yeah.\n\nLenny (00:19:21):\nOkay, cool. We'll link to the course if nothing else. Amazing.\n\nJonny Miller (00:19:23):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:19:24):\nAlong this line of calming breath exercise, Huberman also has a different version, which I've tried and I'm going to do both now. You breathe in fully and then you breathe in a little bit more. I imagine you've seen that piece of advice?\n\nJonny Miller (00:19:37):\nThat's also fantastic. He calls it the physiological sigh, and it's both very effective, especially if you just have five seconds and you just take a full sigh, it's great. I'd also add that the sigh happens naturally as a result of doing these downshifting practices. So if you notice after you do let's say the 4, 4, 8 breathing, at the end, you might naturally just want to let out a sigh, and that's a signal that your body is naturally downshifting. Or if you are with a friend and you feel just comfortable and relaxed, then your body might sigh. And it's something that we do a lot and as you say, you can consciously do it and that will help as well. That's another one of the practices.\n\nLenny (00:20:18):\nAwesome. So link to that. And I think throughout this episode, as you said, we're going to give people a bunch of tools that they can use, and it feels like some are in the moment, \"I need to feel calmer right now. Here's a thing you could do.\" And then there's things you can do ongoing that build... I guess another way to think about it's just make your body more calm as a baseline of practice to work on there.\n\nJonny Miller (00:20:38):\nYeah, precisely.\n\nLenny (00:20:39):\nAwesome, okay. I think the other breathing exercise we're going to do is the opposite. Gets you all excited, is that right?\n\nJonny Miller (00:20:45):\nYeah, sure. We can do that as well. I call this espresso breath. So this is the opposite. This is very activating. I would only recommend this if you're feeling lethargic or maybe instead of drinking a coffee in the afternoon, you could do this for a minute or so. In the scientific literature, it's bellows breath or breath of fire, and it basically looks like a series of rapid exhales through the nose. I like to keep it through the nose only if you do it through the mouth, it can be very too activating and it can kind of overwhelm people. Obviously, there's the Wim Hof practice that I'm sure many people are familiar with. So this is a more gentle version of... If Wim Hof is like Red Bull, this is kind of like a small coffee.\n\nLenny (00:21:30):\nI like that. And you call it the espresso breath, espresso breath.\n\nJonny Miller (00:21:33):\nEspresso breath, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:21:33):\nSo yeah, that's a good metaphor there.\n\nJonny Miller (00:21:35):\nYeah, yeah. So yeah, let's do it. So again, kind of sit up straight, and this time you want to be pumping the breath from your lower belly and you pump the breath on the exhale. So I'll demonstrate it briefly. It's like breathe in.\n\n(00:21:56):\nOkay. So yeah, take a full breath in and begin.\n\n(00:21:58):\nAnd let go. And full breath in. And sigh on the exhale. I already feel a little bit tingly.\n\nLenny (00:22:25):\nI'm energized. Let's do this. Go, go, go, go. That was great. Okay, look at that. We're back to where we started with the full circle of energy. That was great.\n\nJonny Miller (00:22:34):\nUp and down.\n\nLenny (00:22:35):\nAnd then how long do you recommend doing that one for?\n\nJonny Miller (00:22:38):\nSo it kind of depends on how activating you find it, but I usually find 30 breaths per round and then take a breath, have a long pause on the exhale, and then if you want to do another round or two.\n\nLenny (00:22:50):\nAmazing. And the cases where this might be helpful is maybe you're about to give a big talk, I guess in a talk you both want energy and want calm, so that's kind of complicated.\n\nJonny Miller (00:22:59):\nEspecially if you are meetings early in the morning and you haven't quite got going yet, you can do the espresso breath to begin with and that activates you. And then do some of the downshifting practices to kind of ground and stabilize that aliveness.\n\nLenny (00:23:12):\nAre there any other tactical breathing exercises that are worth doing real quick? I know we'll get into some longer practices and deeper stuff, but is there anything else that would be helpful here?\n\nJonny Miller (00:23:21):\nNo, I think we've covered the bases. I don't want to overwhelm people too much.\n\nLenny (00:23:25):\nJust as a takeaway, there's these two techniques. One to help you get more calm when you need to be calm in the moment. The other is to get energy. And then I guess are these things that you recommend doing ongoing to build this muscle in your body or are these mostly for you need this now in the moment and it's not worth just doing a few times a day even when you're fine?\n\nJonny Miller (00:23:47):\nYeah, great question. So I like to recommend both a morning practice, particularly to build the muscle of just doing it and getting used to it. So maybe five minutes in the morning before you start work, before breakfast, something like that. And then you are more likely to remember that you have access to that in the moment because usually the challenge is that when someone is in that flustered state, remembering to do the practice is often the last thing that comes to mind. So by having a deliberate practice for at least 7 to 10 days and so that you get the hang of it, then it feels much more natural to do it when you're feeling. That's kind of like playing the game on hard mode when you are really stressed and anxious, that's when you need it the most, but it's also when you're least likely to remember to do it.\n\nLenny (00:24:36):\nAwesome. Okay, so the first exercise to calm you down is essentially breathe in four seconds, hold it for four seconds, breathe out slowly for eight seconds and do that for about 30 seconds, is that right? Or for a minute?\n\nJonny Miller (00:24:48):\nYeah, I'd say for at least a minute or two. We kind of did a shorter version. I'll also add that the important thing is that the exhale is twice as long as the inhale. So if exhaling for eight is too long, you could do 3, 3, 6 or even 2, 2, 4 or even 5, 5, 10 depending on your lung capacity essentially and your CO2 tolerance.\n\nLenny (00:25:08):\nOkay, good to know. And then the espresso breath, when you need energy or you just kind of pump air out of your belly through your nose and you do that for how long would you recommend?\n\nJonny Miller (00:25:18):\nTwo to three rounds of 30 pumps, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:25:22):\nAnd again, the reason this is effective and powerful is coming back to your original big insight that our state is driven by what our body is doing and our mind often explains what we're feeling based on what our body's doing. So that if you can change the state of your body and become less nervous in your body, your mind will be like, \"All right, everything's fine.\"\n\nJonny Miller (00:25:45):\nYeah. And maybe something that we haven't touched on yet, but I think is important to add in is this idea of interoception or somatic awareness. And the reason I bring it in is because if you do this practice but you're not really aware of your body and how you feel, then it'll be less compelling to you. But if you're kind of tuned into like sensations in your body, what's going on, you're more likely to notice the difference in the shifts.\n\nLenny (00:26:09):\nGreat. So let's get into that. That was something I definitely wanted to touch on here. This awesome acronym to help you with this process of interoception. So talk about what that is and then how to actually go about becoming better at being aware of what your body's doing.\n\nJonny Miller (00:26:22):\nYeah. So it's this idea of interoception, which is known as our sixth sense, and basically it's our ability to sense, track and feel our internal landscape. And I like to use the metaphor of a chef in the same way that you train your flavor palette for kind of sweet, spicy, umami, things like that. You can also train your interoceptive palette and become more aware of the internal sensations, whether that's your breath, whether it's tension, whether it's moods and emotions, whether it's the quality of your awareness, the quality of your thoughts. And the more kind of in tune with that you are, the more likely you are to notice the kind of early warning signs of something like anxiety. Because usually, certainly a panic attack doesn't come out of nowhere. There will be a kind of cascade of subtle things that happen in your body that eventually result in anxiety. And so if you can catch those things early and kind of nip them in the bud and do one of these practices, then you can avoid the kind of 10 out of 10 worst case scenarios.\n\nLenny (00:27:25):\nOkay, awesome. So I know that there's also specific things you recommend people pay attention to, to understand what their body is doing in this process of inter...\n\nJonny Miller (00:27:33):\nInteroception, yeah,\n\nLenny (00:27:34):\nInterra... Okay. What is it?\n\nJonny Miller (00:27:36):\nInteroception.\n\nLenny (00:27:39):\nInteroception.\n\nJonny Miller (00:27:39):\nAs opposed to exteroception, which is awareness of all the external stimuli.\n\nLenny (00:27:44):\nGot it. I guess before we even get to that, so you mentioned that it's another sense we have, and I think that's a really important point that I think maybe people didn't catch. So we have these five senses, obviously taste and smell and vision and touch. But you're finding and research showed basically this is another sense people don't really know we have.\n\nJonny Miller (00:28:02):\nYeah, exactly. And it has been studies quite a lot, especially in the last decade or so. And there's a number of interesting findings from the research that I found. One being that ADHD tends to correlate with low levels of interoception, as does if people have PTSD or trauma. Again, interoception is lowered. And I'd certainly say for myself, for the first 25 years of my life, I was fairly numb from the neck down. I was not very aware to what was happening in my body in real time. I was also reading a book recently called The Hour Between Dog and Wolf, which looked at Wall Street traders and they correlated higher degrees of interception with basically making more money and making better decisions. And I think the thesis was that by tuning into what their body was doing in certain moments, they could pick up on things more intuitive decision making essentially.\n\nLenny (00:28:55):\nSo I think there's a specific list of things that you recommend people pay attention to, their posture, their breath, things like that. What is that list and then how do we actually do this better?\n\nJonny Miller (00:29:06):\nYeah. So I simplify this to APE, which basically is an acronym which stands for awareness, posture, and emotion. So to kind of go through each one by one. Awareness is, to give an example, I could narrow my awareness and become really focused and just you kind of tense up and it also is quite activating sometimes or you can relax and expand your awareness and be aware of the space above me, the space behind me, the space below me. And that is generally a calming thing. Posture is fairly self-explanatory. But again, our posture affects how we feel. You're shifting there now. And then emotion, which I include somatic or body-based sensations which arise. So both kind of what is the overall mood and the flavor or the texture that I'm feeling. Like right now, maybe it's excitement, maybe there's some joy. I'm noticing there's some heat in my belly probably from the breathing. Yeah, there's a little bit of tightness in my lower back from working out yesterday. So just sense kind of mapping that landscape of sensation. And for most people it's almost like it's like a [inaudible 00:30:22]. You have those maps of [inaudible 00:30:25] and for a lot of people there's just these big kind blind spots in their body.\n\nLenny (00:30:30):\nAnd the advice here is, so there's this acronym APE and the advice is think about these three things when you're feeling something that you may not, basically something's going on slash just often come back to this. I imagine just whenever you can think of, \"Oh, APE: awareness, posture, emotion.\" Is that how to use this?\n\nJonny Miller (00:30:51):\nYeah, exactly. So again, it can be something that you do before you start your day, maybe with a cup of tea. I like to drink tea and just do a body scan essentially and just check each of those three areas. And it's really valuable, particularly if you are having racing thoughts or something doesn't feel quite right. Instead of just tackling the problem on the level of the mind dropping down into the body and bringing that into the picture as well, I find to be really helpful.\n\nLenny (00:31:26):\nBasically, as often as you can. And generally when things are feeling all off, just remember APE, where's my awareness? How's my posture? And then what am I feeling? Am I feeling sad? Am I feeling happy, excited, angry? Things like that. I think you also talk about breath, like you have a list you wrote about this of other things that you might want to pay attention to. Actually finding paying attention to what my breath is doing is really powerful too. So I'm going to try a BAPE version of this or I'm going to try to think about where's my breath coming from, what am I feeling there?\n\nJonny Miller (00:32:02):\nYeah. So the breath and sensations are two other ones that are really helpful. The breath in particular, often people will... There's an idea of email apnea when people are checking their emails, they will, without noticing it, start to hold their breath, which is generally a very activating thing to do. Or as I mentioned earlier, if your breath is through the mouth and shallow and into the upper chest, that will also be very activating versus is your breath through the nose? Is it kind of into the belly and into the sides of the rib cage and does it feel easeful? Basically, breathing without tension is ideal.\n\nLenny (00:32:39):\nWhat I think about using this practice is if I were sitting in a meeting and just not feeling amazingly confident, I just come back to this acronym, BAPE or APE, whichever one you want to choose, just like how am I feeling right now? Oh wow, my whole stomach is clenched. I'm maybe nervous about what might happen or I'm not breathing at all, or my posture is really bad. So I think in a meeting would be really helpful Here, maybe you're about to get on a zoom or an important call or something like that. Maybe a one-on-one. Is there anything else, any other moments that kind of triggers for people of like, \"Oh, I should really be aware of what's happening right now. Let me do an APE exercise.\"\n\nJonny Miller (00:33:16):\nYeah, well, just to kind of piggyback on what you just said, if you are about to jump on a meeting and you're noticing that your stomach is clenched, that's actually really useful data to be like, \"Why is this happening?\" Is it your intuition kind of saying that maybe you shouldn't do this deal with someone or maybe something is off and so it's a sign to explore that more. Or it could be that you've been triggered by something or something that someone said and you've only just realized it and then that's again, more information or something that you can reflect on or go into.\n\nLenny (00:33:51):\nIs there anything in your life recently that is an example of this where you're feeling unsure and maybe you realize, \"Oh, here's what my body's doing, maybe I should pay more attention to this.\"\n\nJonny Miller (00:34:03):\nActually, last week I did a podcast conversation, so I have a podcast myself, and I got off the call and I remember I felt or got off the podcast and I felt pretty exhausted and I felt like there was this kind of tension in my chest. And again, my breath was kind of all over the place and I realized that I had very much over committed myself for that week. I'd scheduled back to back podcast interviews. The podcast wasn't even the priority for what I'm focusing on in this quarter, so I then made the decision to just push back all my episodes until the summer basically.\n\nLenny (00:34:42):\nI love that example. I know that feeling very well.\n\nJonny Miller (00:34:46):\nI'm sure.\n\nLenny (00:34:48):\nWhen you wrote about this idea of interoception, you connected it to burnout, and I think you talked about how this is one of the best tools to avoid burnout. Is that right? Am I remembering that right? And if so, how do you think about this burnout and avoiding burnout in general, something a lot of people experience?\n\nJonny Miller (00:35:08):\nYeah, so I have this idea that I call the feather brick dump truck phenomenon. And basically what that means is when we are showing early signs of burnout, our body will give us feedback usually in subtle ways in the beginning. So the feather might be waking up in the morning and feeling a little bit tired, maybe a little bit exhausted. The brick, maybe you ignore that or you don't notice it, and then three or four weeks later you have a fight with someone or an argument or you just feel frustrated and terrible and you lose your cool. And then maybe the dump truck is a month later or even a year later, there's a full-blown health crisis, or you develop type two diabetes or there's a whole range of things, or maybe you get fired. There's a bunch of different things that can happen, but normally depending on how attuned or depending on someone's interoceptive capacity, ideally, you want to notice when it's the feather and then make adjustments or shift then and not have to wait until you experience the full-blown pain of the dump truck, which unfortunately is what happens to a lot of people, especially when they experience burnout for the first time.\n\nLenny (00:36:18):\nThis is such an important point and such a good way of thinking about it. It reminds me of Andy Johns and the episode we had there of just how long and willing to the episode there of just how all these little things came up along the way and then eventually just became incredibly unsustainable to live the life that he was living.\n\n(00:36:34):\nThis episode is brought to you by Miro.

What are some examples of these kind of feathery signs of like maybe I need to change something?\n\nJonny Miller (00:37:55):\nYeah, so I'll tie this in with a concept that I call emotional debt, which is basically when our nervous system experiences stress, there's known as a mobilization cycle, and if that cycle isn't completed or we don't get to downshift or relax on the other side, that gets stored in the body as allostatic load, which I call emotional debt. And over time, that creates fragility in the nervous system. And so what that fragility can look like is anything from being impacted by small things in a kind of disproportionate way. So noticing that you are more reactive than normal, maybe you're a little bit more snappy, maybe you get frustrated by little things, maybe your sleep isn't as good, maybe you wake up not feeling fully rested. Maybe relationships are often, especially intimate relationships are usually a place that this shows up or relationships at work. So those are the classic early warning signs. And then as that emotional debt threshold increases in the same way that say with technical debt, if you're building a product in the beginning, it's fine, and in fact it's even necessary in the beginning. It's great that our body can buffer the stress response because it allows us to function. But if we don't pay off that technical debt or emotional debt, then over time it accumulates and it can also come out through health crises, health challenges. It just gets basically progressively worse until that debt is paid off.\n\nLenny (00:39:25):\nI feel like a lot of people listening are like, \"Yes, I know exactly what you mean.\" How does one notice that you're building emotional debt and then how do you start to release this debt and pay off this debt?\n\nJonny Miller (00:39:38):\nWhat I've seen with some of my founder clients and in the research that we did where we interviewed 260 leaders, what can often happen is that emotional debt will increase and increase and increase until it gets to a point where we are well outside what's known as a window of tolerance. And at that point there's like a crash. It's almost like the fuse switch blows and there's exhaustion. Maybe there's complete inability to get up off the couch. And for some people, people with large nervous system capacity, they can keep going for five years, maybe 10 years, and they can keep building this up, and it becomes normalized to live in a way where you are always on and never really relaxing or coming down. Or one really key sign actually is if you are not able to naturally downshift or down regulate your nervous system at the end of the day without something like wine or CBD or some kind of external substance, that's a sign that you kind of reached a certain threshold of emotional debt.\n\nLenny (00:40:47):\nAnd then how does one start to pay off this debt if you've spent years just working way too hard, you've had a relationship that just isn't working great, I don't know. I imagine most people go to therapy and just talk through all these things and try to work through the challenges. What do you recommend if you're just like, \"Man, I feel like I have this, what should I do?\"\n\nJonny Miller (00:41:08):\nYeah, well, I mean that's a big question. I'll probably get some pushback for this, but I'm not a big fan of talk therapy alone or at least therapy that doesn't have a somatic or body-based component. And from my understanding of the nervous system and how we store this stress, just talking about things and keeping things on the level of the intellect doesn't actually address the root of the challenge. What we need to do is create a certain sense of safety to kind of go into those buffered emotional responses and feel them all the way through and allow that mobilization reflex to complete.\n\n(00:41:48):\nAnd so to kind of give a personal example, when I was living in Bali, I did several hundred breathwork journeys where you breathe in a certain way to get into an altered state, and then in that place, these memories would arise of these things that happened 5, 10 years ago. And my body, it would either move a certain way or the anger would come through. Sometimes there would be sadness or grief. Often there's a lot of stored emotion that's held in our body that just needs permission to kind of be felt through and be released. And so for me, it was a journey of coming into right relationship with my anger and my grief, and honestly my shame as well, giving myself permission to feel this gunk that had been stored in my pelvis.\n\n(00:42:35):\nSo I'm not saying you have to go to Bali and do 200 breathwork journeys. That's definitely not... I mean, that's a path. But first it begins with, as I said, cultivating interoception and even being aware that there is this tension, there are these things in your body. Secondly, having the practices of self-regulation so that if these things come up, you don't get overwhelmed. You're able to downshift and ground. And then thirdly, it's the practice of what I call emotional fluidity, which is basically creating the conditions of welcoming the full spectrum of emotions as they arise. And often it's very helpful to have a guide or a somatic practitioner, I like somatic experiencing, hakomi, the two modalities I'm a big fan of. And yeah, that's the journey and a process and it depends how many years you've been operating in a slightly numbed way, and it's different for everyone. But it begins by tuning into and listening to the body and then having honestly curiosity about what is there and just following that curiosity and the body starts to show you what is ready to be seen.\n\nLenny (00:43:49):\nI love that it always comes back to the original place we started which is that the way we feel is a very bottom up body-based system, it's not we feel something and our body gets nervous. It's our body gets nervous, and they're like, \"Oh, here's why I'm nervous.\" And your advice is just focus a lot on helping your body release the stuff that you've built up this debt. And then also just when you're nervous in the moment, focus on getting your body to a state versus trying to convince your mind now everything's going to be okay.\n\nJonny Miller (00:44:17):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:44:17):\nAnd specifically on the therapy route, just to touch on that, so your advice there is if you were to work with a therapist and you feel a lot of this stuff that we're talking about is focused on a somatic oriented therapy where it's body oriented, not just thinking about it and talking through stuff, it's actually convincing your body, \"Here's a way to helping your body release this debt, essentially.\"\n\nJonny Miller (00:44:40):\nYeah. I mean, you can understand in precise detail about whatever the challenge was from 5, 10 and 15 years ago, but if you're unable to connect it to the correlating sensations in the body... Usually if say, I don't know, if I was to imagine someone shouted at me yesterday and I think about that, there's usually a correlating kind of sematic sensation. The neuroscientist Damasio calls it a somatic marker. So by tracking the somatic markers and then either on your own just kind of following that sensation and allowing whatever emotion was present at the time to complete that is the way that we kind of slowly pay off that emotional debt by one process at a time.\n\nLenny (00:45:26):\nSo maybe coming back to this question of say someone is listening and wondering, am I building emotional debt? Am I ignoring things that are these feathers? What are signs and just, I don't know, examples of emotional debt being built up of this trauma, whatever you want to call it, being built up in the body? I don't know, is it just like anytime you feel really nervous, that's emotional debt? Is it anytime you push something down that you are pretty sure you should deal with in the moment, that's emotional debt? What are just some examples of what that feels like and looks like?\n\nJonny Miller (00:45:58):\nYeah, so it's typically different forms of nervous system dysregulation and that shows up as it could be someone's breathing pattern if they're constantly in this sympathetic or hypervigilant state, if they're always tracking for things, looking for the worst case scenario. Another common one, and this is particularly true in the tech sector, is being very much in the head and living in the thoughts and the mind the entire time. And there's a form of disassociation that happens as a kind of protection mechanism essentially because it's uncomfortable to be with the sensations in the body. And because our society tends to reward people for solving problems and being in their mind, that is a pattern that continues for many, many years or even decades.\n\n(00:46:43):\nOther ones are, I think the most obvious one for people is emotional reactivity, where your response to a certain situation is disproportionate to what's happened. So for example, if you said something to me of that doesn't make any sense, and I was like, I freeze maybe... And this is another important point that most people have two versions of reactivity. Some people will freeze, withdraw, shut down and disconnect, and other people will become more aggressive, become bigger and attack and fight back. And knowing which way you tend to orient, for me, it's usually shrink and freeze and shut down, knowing what your pattern is and also knowing what the sensations are when this happens, it's really helpful for you to be like, \"Oh, that thing's happening.\" My priority now is to downshift and kind of find a sense of safety basically in the body and then interact, then make the decision, then have the conversation. Because if you can keep going from that place of reactivity, nothing good happens from that place. No great decisions were made from that place. So again, that's a place where having the interoceptive awareness to know, \"Oh, this is what's going on.\" Being able to then downshift your system, kind of access a sense of, \"Oh, I'm okay, actually this isn't so bad.\" And then moving on from there is a profoundly practical and just useful skill.\n\nLenny (00:48:14):\nKind of along these same lines, you wrote somewhere this idea that you have a big competitive advantage if you feel the feels is the way you described it. Does that ring a bell? And if so, what can you share around that, just why this is so powerful, especially in the workplace?\n\nJonny Miller (00:48:28):\nYeah, so I think I wrote about this in one of the Every essays. I think the title was The Best Decision-Making Is Emotional. And I basically wanted to kind of poke at the phrase, I think I saw someone on Twitter say, \"Fact over feelings, like don't let emotions ruin good decision making.\" And yeah, there's so much that I can say about this. But basically there was a landmark study by this guy, Damasio, this kind of famous neuroscientist, and he studied a patient called Elliot. And Elliot had a tumor in his brain that was removed and it basically meant that he was unable to feel emotions. So his entire emotional capacity was removed. And Elliot went from being a successful married businessman to divorced, broke and unable to choose what he could have for lunch. He was unable to make the most basic life decisions, and it's because he didn't have access to that emotional sense in his brain.\n\n(00:49:22):\nAnd so our brain is like a prediction making machine, and as I mentioned earlier, there's this highway of sensory data that's coming up through the body. And if we don't listen to that when we are making decisions, then we're losing out on a lot of information. And what tends to happen, I see this in clients that I work with, is if they are avoiding feeling a certain way, let's say, that they don't enjoy feeling conflict or anger, then they will make decisions subconsciously to avoid feeling that way. And it becomes a huge bias and a huge problem because people make decisions because they're afraid of feeling a certain way. And if you are on the other hand able to just welcome and be with whatever emotions would arise on the other side of a decision, you're able to decide clearly instead of being skewed one way or the other.\n\nLenny (00:50:16):\nEasier said than done.\n\nJonny Miller (00:50:18):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:50:21):\nDo you find there's ever a downside to being too in touch with what you're feeling? I actually not a feeler of what I'm feeling kind of person. I'm pretty stable, partly because I'm not super in tune with what I'm feeling a lot of times, and maybe this is a huge problem that I need to deal with. But I don't know, it's worked out okay so far. I guess, do you ever find that sometimes it's okay, sometimes you don't need to know exactly every moment anything that's hurting you or causing you pain?\n\nJonny Miller (00:50:49):\nYeah, it's a good question. And some people do have a very high interoceptive capacity, and that can be overwhelming. In which case I would recommend focusing on the breathing practices to build that capacity to downshift, so you're able to just function. And there's definitely people who are overwhelmed by the stimuli of day-to-day life being out in traffic, like they're very easily overwhelmed. And for those people working on increasing nervous system capacity to kind of hold that amount of stress, maybe it's through sauna and cold plunge, maybe it's through gentle titration of stresses and then downshifting, that's actually really valuable.\n\n(00:51:28):\nI'd also say that the ability to function well, this applies to a lot of high functioning people, which is probably honestly a lot of your audience. It's very helpful in the moment to, let's say something comes up, you want to be able to buffer intense emotions and say, get through the meeting, get through whatever it is. It's a very helpful skill. But if you don't, then give yourself spaciousness afterwards to downshift and allow yourself to feel whatever was brought up by that experience, you are going to be adding to this emotional debt over time. And as I mentioned, some people, it might be a year before there's some kind of breakdown, burnout. Other people, it might be longer. And usually it's more unfortunate in the longer case because it creates a long-term health crisis and then lower amount of money or time is able to repair the damage that's been done, which can be really tragic.\n\nLenny (00:52:24):\nMy chat with Andy Johns is a great example of that happening.\n\nJonny Miller (00:52:26):\nYeah. And Andy's a superb example, and I love his vulnerability and honesty in what he's been through.\n\nLenny (00:52:33):\nYeah, I think if you're interested in this topic, definitely watch that episode. Another exercise that you talk a lot about is this idea, it's called NSDR, I think. Talk about that and when that might be useful, how to go about using this tool.\n\nJonny Miller (00:52:49):\nYeah, so NSDR was a practice coined by Andrew Huberman, who you mentioned earlier. And it basically, it's a more scientific lens on the practice of yoga nidra, which is an ancient yoga practice. But I am a huge fan of it, and I do it myself most days for 15 to 20 minutes. Basically what it looks like is you lie down, put on an eye mask or a blindfold, and you listen to a guided audio. I've recorded some myself, so I can share these in the show note links.\n\nLenny (00:53:16):\nYour voice would be so good for these, by the way. You found your calling.\n\nJonny Miller (00:53:22):\nNice, yeah. It's really fun for me to do. But basically what it involves is a guided body scan. So this is also a great way to practice interoception. It's something that I didn't mention earlier was that when there's cortisol present in our body, the cortisol basically acts as a numbing agent, so it's much harder to kind of tune into those sensations. But using this, I think it's a 14-minute guided NSDR practice, you're basically lying down, there's a guided body scan, there's relaxing music in the background. And by the end of it, you feel like you've had a two-hour nap. It feels incredible.\n\n(00:54:00):\nAnd particularly for people who myself tend to get tired in the afternoons, if you space this out, usually between 1 and 3:00 PM for me, that will give you a second wind in the afternoon and it'll mean you won't end the day collapse on the sofa. So I think it's great for improving interoception, it's good for allowing your body to downshift and relax instead of being in that kind of high tone sympathetic state all throughout the day. So it gives your body a break, and it just feels really good. Honestly, it's probably my most played practice of everything that I teach, just people listen to it every day. So I'll share that in the show notes as well.\n\nLenny (00:54:41):\nAnd I imagine if you feel like you've built this emotional debt, this would be a really good exercise to start to do, is that right?\n\nJonny Miller (00:54:49):\nYeah, it is fantastic. I mean, there's some people who struggle with having enough energy to kind of get out of bed and function. But again, I imagine listeners to your show, people that live in Silicon Valley, their challenge is the downshifting without external substances. And so NSDR is a really great way of strengthening that ventral vagal tone, which is our body's capacity to go from on kind of go, go, go to then relaxing. There's a quote from Kevin Kelly that I interviewed recently, and he said, \"If you have a great work ethic that needs to be matched with a great rest ethic.\" And I think that kind of piece of actually training our capacity to downshift after stress is just completely missing from most people's playbooks.\n\nLenny (00:55:38):\nI think with a lot of the sort of advice, if you listen, Tim Ferriss and Huberman and everyone's got this stuff you should be doing every day list and it ends up being so long and there's so many things to do, cold plunge, sauna. What is it that you practice or come back to slash what would you recommend people try to do daily that is most impactful of all this stuff we've talked about?\n\nJonny Miller (00:56:05):\nFirst experiment with a bunch of different practices and see which you enjoy and notice how you feel before and then how you feel afterwards. That's kind of the key because once you know that it feels good, you're not going to have to force yourself or motivate yourself to do it. You'll just do it naturally because you know you'll feel great afterwards. I would recommend starting really simple, so starting with the 4, 4, 8 breathing or humming, doing that in the morning for just two minutes, two minutes in the beginning is enough. And I would also recommend listening to the NSDR practice at least once or twice. If you work from home, it's pretty easy after a lunch break, something like that could also be in the evening when you get home as well. Some people use it to help fall asleep.\n\n(00:56:52):\nAnd then the final thing that I would recommend is if you have the resources and you have access, finding a somatic practitioner or somatic therapist is so [inaudible 00:57:03]. I mean, I emerged a completely different human on the other side of the 200 breathwork journeys. I have a different experience of life basically released so much time. Even my voice sounds different. If you listen to the podcast episodes I recorded four or five years ago, my voice is higher pitched. It just sounds different. It has a different resonant quality to it.\n\nLenny (00:57:27):\nWow. Okay, awesome. So you've kind of summarized, I was going to try to summarize all the advice you've given, but if you were to do the bare minimum next steps based on this advice, try this 4, 4, 8/3, 3, 6/2, 2, 4. Does 2, 2, 4 work too if you just go real fast I guess?\n\nJonny Miller (00:57:28):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:57:45):\nYeah.\n\nJonny Miller (00:57:46):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:57:46):\nOkay, perfect. Okay, so do that for a couple mornings. See how that does try this NSDR practice. We'll link to a recording of how to do that and then was there something else you recommended? Oh, somatic worker, basically maybe a therapist, maybe not someone that helps you with your body.\n\nJonny Miller (00:58:06):\nYeah, and I'd add in the eight practice for even 15 seconds before the breathing in the morning and after, just so that you notice the difference. And if you do the NSDR, that is basically a 15-minute interoception practice as well. So you're kind of getting two birds with one stone with that practice.\n\nLenny (00:58:24):\nWhat's your perspective on meditation? Does that fit into this? Do you find the NSDR replaces the need for meditation?\n\nJonny Miller (00:58:29):\nThat is a big topic. I am an avid meditator as what I've done many 10 day silent retreats. I was in a dark room for 10 days.\n\nLenny (00:58:40):\nWow.\n\nJonny Miller (00:58:41):\nWith meditation, I think it really depends on what you are training. It's like saying what's your opinion on exercise? Well, are you training mobility or stamina or strength? It's the same with meditation. You could be training loving kindness. You could be training your focus and attention. You could be training spacious awareness. So I'm a big fan of embodied meditation practices. So this is often the classic vipassana body scan is a good example. Again, I mean that's basically interoceptive practice where you are just moving your attention through different parts of your body over and over and over again for days on end.\n\n(00:59:17):\nIn the case of vipassana retreat, meditation is helpful for the specific skill of increasing the psychological space between a stimulus and your response. So if you have some degree of meditation practice instead of getting wrapped up in a certain emotion or we're even believing a certain thought pattern, there's usually an ability to kind of step back a little bit and see if what it's, so there definitely is a place for meditation. But my viewpoint is that we've kind of over-indexed for mindfulness and meditation in over the last 20 years. There's so many apps, there's so there's much talk about it and we've completely forgotten the body-based approaches. So I'm not saying don't meditate. I think meditation for sure has its place, especially if your goal is more of the traditional waking up and seeing through the nature of the self, that's a different kind of path in my opinion. But if you're looking to function more effectively and be more in tune with your body, then there's a whole different category of practices in this bottom up variety that we've touched on today.\n\nLenny (01:00:27):\nOn the topic of bottom up, I imagine you're a big fan of this book that everyone always talks about, The Body Keeps Score, I think it's called. Would you recommend that book? Is it connected in a large part to the stuff you talk about? What do you think of that book specifically? Because I hear about it all with him.\n\nJonny Miller (01:00:41):\nYeah, it's a good book. It's by Bessal van der Kolk and there's another writer I think Peter Levine says, \"The issues are in the tissues.\" Is basically the concept. And this is the idea that we have these incomplete mobilization reflexes that are stored in our body and often held as tension. It's not strictly true to say that the trauma is in the body. It is actually a cortical map in the brain which kind of tracks these things. But for kind of practical purposes, it looks and feels as if there is stored grief in my right hip or anger in my solar plexus, that's the experience that we have. And the more that you become aware of these sensations and start to develop emotional fluidity essentially, the more that tension is released and the less reactive you become and the more emotional debt you pay off. So I think The Body Keeps The Score, I think a more accurate way would be the body is the scorecard in a way. I think that's kind a slight reframe. And if you're interested in this, the work of Peter Levine, Waking the Tiger is the seminal book on this mobilization reflex stuff that I'm describing.\n\nLenny (01:01:51):\nI never need that part of it. And basically it's actually kept in the brain, but it comes across as somewhere in the body.\n\nJonny Miller (01:01:57):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (01:01:58):\nFascinating. I want to spend a little time on a new segment that we have in this podcast that I call Contrarian Corner. So let's visit Contrarian Corner, I feel like you'll have something interesting here. So the question is there something that you have a very contrarian opinion about, something that you believe that a lot of other people really don't believe?\n\nJonny Miller (01:02:17):\nWe've already touched on I'm not a big fan of talk based meditation, which will probably get me some comments I would imagine. I'd say the other one that's worth mentioning is I think that we vastly underestimate the impact of burnout, particularly from a bottom line perspective. There was a research report that I did a couple of years ago where we interviewed these leaders and they'd all experienced burnout of some degree. And we said, if you were to estimate how much this costs your startup or business, what would you say? And the median response was a hundred thousand dollars, which I imagine is more than most people would think.\n\n(01:02:57):\nAnd most people aren't actively investing in burnout insurance. Like it's not something that's on many people's radar besides meditation practices and things like that. And I think part of the reason that the cost is higher is because there are these second and third order consequences of talent attrition, of opportunity costs, lost productivity, you lose great leaders, make shitty decisions in the run up to the burnout itself. There's also this idea of emotional contagion, which there's some research from Wharton I believe, and they show that the leader or the CEO has a disproportionate impact or their emotional state has a disproportionate impact on the people in their team. So something I'd like to say is the nervous system of an organization is a reflection of the nervous system of the CEO. And so I think that's just something which I would like to see talked about more.\n\nLenny (01:03:53):\nJust on this idea of burnout, I don't think you're saying don't work really hard If you want to work really hard, it's that you need to maintain your body and mind and nervous system if you're working insanely hard. If you're working long hours, feel free, but just know there's debt you're building up and you need to be doing things to pay off that debt as you're doing that.\n\nJonny Miller (01:04:11):\nPrecisely. It is very much like building technical debt in the early days of a startup. It's worth doing, but just do it intentionally. Know that you're doing that and that. So let's say you work really hard for eight months, you give yourself a month or two off to really downshift. And it's also really worth building that nervous system capacity. It's great to be able to push it really hard and focus and then combine it with that rest ethic as well. So do NSDRs, kind of find a way to downshift so that way of working can be sustainable.\n\nLenny (01:04:44):\nJonny, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nJonny Miller (01:04:48):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny (01:04:49):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJonny Miller (01:04:53):\nI actually had a sense this question was coming and I have the books with me here. The first book is Constellations by David White. This is the book that I've gifted most to friends, I think more than any other book. And he basically has 52 definitions of words like ambition is I think the first word. And his writing, it just blows me away. I open this to a random page, read the definition, and it's probably affected me more than any other book. So that's one that I love. 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, which is I imagine has come up before in your podcast. This is by Jim Dethmer and Diana Chapman. They have the Conscious Leadership Group. And this is basically, in my opinion, it's the best leadership book that I've come across and it combines practicality with a lot of great theory. So this is awesome. And then finally, this is a bit out there, but Recapture the Rapture by Jamie Wheal, big fan of Jamie's work, Jamie's writing. This is kind of three books in one. The beginning is addressing the meta-crisis and a lot of the craziness that we're seeing in the world. The second chapter is very related to what we've been talking about, he calls it Hedonic Engineering and it's basically practices for shifting your state of consciousness. And the third is Ethical Cult Building, which I'll leave that there. [inaudible 01:06:22].\n\nLenny (01:06:22):\nDo you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nJonny Miller (01:06:28):\nMy wife and I love animations and we saw Kubo and the Two Strings recently, which was fantastic. Just so, so great. That and also Wolf Walkers, which was an Apple TV series. Yeah, those have been my two favorite movies I've seen recently.\n\nLenny (01:06:46):\nIf you like animated content, check out the Scavengers Reign on HBO. I've mentioned it on this podcast before, but it's incredible. It's a TV show on HBO. So I usually ask, do you have a favorite question you like to ask candidates you're interviewing? But I know you coach people, so to kind of turn this question a little bit around, do you have a favorite question you like to ask executive coaching clients that you work with?\n\nJonny Miller (01:07:08):\nI stole this question from a guy Jerry Colonna who's here in Boulder, and the question is amazing. It is so good. It's basically, how are you complicit in creating the conditions that you say you don't want? And so the word complicit there is key because it's not saying in what ways is it your fault, but it's like in what ways were you complicit in creating the conditions for anxiety, for building up emotional debt? And just the question kind of opens up the door to ways in which you are an active participant in creating these challenges in your life. And it's a really rich journal question or a question to explore with a friend, co-founder colleague.\n\nLenny (01:07:53):\nI remember him sharing that on the Tim Ferriss podcast many years ago and it stuck with me and I often think of it, but I never am complicit of anything that goes wrong. It's never my fault. He has nothing on me. Just kidding.\n\nJonny Miller (01:08:06):\nExcellent.\n\nLenny (01:08:08):\nDo you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nJonny Miller (01:08:11):\nOne is these blue blocking glasses. These are raw optics, blue blocker glasses. They block out a hundred percent of blue light and they are a lifesaver if I'm ever going out of the house basically after dark, I'll wear these to drive. I'll wear these to even dinners with friends sometimes. And it basically means that I'm able to then sleep well that evening. So that's one.\n\n(01:08:38):\nAnd then the other thing I'll briefly share, this came through the other day, you mentioned the vagus nerve earlier and that device, I have three devices here that are all vagus nerve stimulation devices. This one is called Neuro Sim. This one I believe is Pulsetto, and I think this is a Apollo Strap. I haven't used them that much yet, but they basically work by sending low level electrical stimulation directly to your vagus nerve. So this clips on your ear because the vagus nerve goes through the right side of the neck. Same with Pulsetto. And I'm really curious to compare the effect of these versus say breathwork, humming, the other body-based practices. Obviously, you can do both at the same time, but I am just interested in playing. So I wouldn't recommend them yet, but I think it's interesting that they exist.\n\nLenny (01:09:29):\nHow cool would that be? We just put these things on, we don't have to do anything else. We just get up, slap on our device and life is amazing. Don't have to meditate, don't have to breathe in a different way. I'm going to need to do this while I'm on the podcast just wear all these devices, see how that goes. Awesome. Well, I guess somehow report back to us how these go because that feels really great. Next question, do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends, either in work or in life?\n\nJonny Miller (01:10:00):\nState over story would be one which we've touched on.\n\nLenny (01:10:02):\nState over story.\n\nJonny Miller (01:10:04):\nAnd then I think the other one, which I think about often is I like to say, \"Make generous assumptions.\" And by that I mean in any situation, what is the most generous story that I can tell of this person, of this situation? Not kind of naively fabricating something, but usually there's a spectrum of I can assume that they're a bad person and they did this thing out of spite, or maybe they had a bad day, maybe they have a lot of emotional debt. There's there's many stories that can be told. And I usually try to have a practice of telling the most generous story that I can.\n\nLenny (01:10:47):\nI like that a lot. Another way of describing that is just assume good intentions, which I often think about.\n\nJonny Miller (01:10:53):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (01:10:54):\nFinal question. You seem extremely calm always, and very centered and stable. What still gets you rilled up and unsettled, and what do you do when that happens?\n\nJonny Miller (01:11:07):\nWell, I was nervous before this podcast, so I did some breathing practices and some stretching and some humming before jumping on here. I still at times notice ways in which I'm conflict avoidant. I've been working on it actively for a while, but there's a part of me that can sometimes avoid conflict. And so I've actually noticed how there's a relationship between that and having a healthy relationship to anger. So basically giving myself permission to express frustration, not at someone, but just allow it to be there. And then from that place set better boundaries with my time with what I'm doing, saying no to certain things. I think that's the practice that's most alive for me right now.\n\nLenny (01:11:53):\nJonny, you are awesome. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online and explore the things that you offer? I think you teach a course, whatever else you offer, talk about that and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJonny Miller (01:12:06):\nYeah, well, this has been so much fun. I am very active on Twitter or X. My handle is Jonny Miller. It's J-O-N-N-Y-M-1-L-L-E-R. And yeah, if this was interesting or listeners would like to dive deeper, I teach a course. Our next cohort is running in the spring, the end of March. Applications are now open, and the website is nsmastery.com/lenny. I've created a custom page and there's a $250 juicy discount for listeners if they want to sign up.\n\nLenny (01:12:39):\nI got to sign up for this myself. I didn't know you're going to do that. That's awesome. And NS Mastery stands for Nervous System Mastery.\n\nJonny Miller (01:12:47):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (01:12:48):\nAmazing. Anything else? And then the second question of how listeners can be useful to you.\n\nJonny Miller (01:12:52):\nWell, firstly, if any of this resonates, I'd love to hear from you on Twitter or email me as well. I can pass over my email and I would just love it if you experiment with this stuff. I love this idea of just being a scientist of life. So if anything that we've talked about resonates or any of the practices you want to try, just go out and try it and see how it feels and then tell me about it. That would be the greatest gift I think.\n\nLenny (01:13:23):\nAnd the best way to tell you about it is tweet at you or is there something else?\n\nJonny Miller (01:13:26):\nTweet at me or my email is jonny@curioushumans.com. So feel free to email me as well.\n\nLenny (01:13:32):\nAll right, I'm going to use all these things. Jonny, thank you so much for being here. You're awesome. I am excited for the show notes we're going to have to give people actual tools to use to become less anxious and nervous in their work and life. Thank you again for being here.\n\nJonny Miller (01:13:46):\nAmazing. Thanks so much, Lenny. This was super fun.\n\nLenny (01:13:48):\nSame for me. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:13:51):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Competing with giants: An inside look at how The Browser Company builds product | Josh Miller (CEO)\n\n## Transcript\n\nJosh Miller (00:00:00):\nWe want people that show up to our company with some fire in their belly, something that they are out to do. And for each person it's a little bit different. For some people it may be UI Craft details. For other people, it may be achieving double the performance with a quarter of the engineering headcount. Everyone has something, but they show up with this heartfelt intensity. And I think even relative to everything else, I'm going to say, that's it. If you have a team that has heartfelt intensity and is there for a purpose and something to prove, you get it. You give them a very exciting, ambitious product and get out of their way and they will do remarkable work.\n\nLenny (00:00:36):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Josh Miller. Josh is the CEO and co-founder of a company called The Browser Company, which makes a product called Arc, which has quickly become my default web browser. I fell in love with this product as soon as I started using it and wanted to get a glimpse into how Josh and his team approached the craft of product. There's this cohort of companies like the Browser Company, [inaudible 00:01:09], a few others that are just laser focused on building the best possible user experience, almost above all else. And I wanted to spend some time exploring this trend with Josh. We cover how he thinks about prioritization, team building, storytelling, company values, metrics, shipping, building in public so much more.\n\n(00:01:28):\nJosh is such an earnest, genuine and humble human, and it was such a pleasure getting to learn from him. And, just to be clear, I'm not an investor in the Browser Company and I barely knew anything about the company before I chatted with Josh. So, I'm just a fan. And as a special surprise, Arc is normally invite only. But if you're listening to this now, check the show notes for a special link that'll get you right in to use the browser, if you want to play with it yourself. With that, I bring you Josh Miller after a short word from our select sponsors.\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:02:01):\nThis episode is brought to you by Rytr.

You are the CEO and co-founder of The Browser Company, which builds a product called Arc. Can you just talk about what is The Browser Company? What is Arc? And then whatever you can share about just like the scale of Arc at this point. That'd be really interesting to hear.\n\nJosh Miller (00:04:15):\nSure. I hope you don't mind me doing this. I'm curious, I hear that you may, may or may not use Arc? How would you describe Arc to somebody?\n\nLenny (00:04:25):\nThe simple explanation is it's just the best web browser that I've used. So, to me it's a browser. I know that you have a bigger vision than that, but that's the way I see it as a layperson who hasn't seen the full vision.\n\nJosh Miller (00:04:38):\nAwesome. I think we can go home now. That's great. That's awesome.\n\nLenny (00:04:39):\nThere we go.\n\nJosh Miller (00:04:39):\nNo. To be totally honest with you and your listeners, we have a really hard time describing Arc, which is something I'm not proud of. But it is, objectively, a replacement for your default web browser. And people who try it seem to really love it, and most people seem to have a hard time using the internet in the old way. So, that may sound like I'm being coy, but we have work shopped many a one-liners and the words have escaped us so far. So, to be honest, it is on our to-do list to get sharper about that.\n\n(00:05:15):\nAnd then in terms of our scale, since we have a lot of product managers listening, I'll give you the PM answer to that question, which is, we really focus on one key metric as it relates to tracking our growth or how we are doing. We call it D5, D7. A lot of other companies call it L5, L7. But the human explanation for that is how many people turn to Arc at least five days a week? That is all we obsess over from a metrics perspective, because for us it captures retention, engagement, and growth in a single metric. You can't game it. Right? So from retention perspective, it's not just opening it accidentally once a week. You need to open a tab on a day in order to count as an active for a day.\n\n(00:06:01):\nBut so it tracks retention. It tracks engagement because five days a week is no joke. There are very few apps or pieces of software you actively use five days a week. And then, obviously, it tracks growth, because of we track the count. So that is what we track. And then we also don't obsess over absolute numbers, because if we're successful, if you zoom out and out and out, any point in time will be inconsequential and small. So, what we really look is growth rate week over week. So, relative to last week, what is our growth rate? And for the past eight months or so, we've been growing over 10% every single week. So very, very thrilled with that. Do not think that will continue If anyone is listening. I would be shocked if we continue like that for another eight months. But, yeah. We obsess over how many humans use Arc five out of seven days a week. And we really want that number to grow as fast as possible every single week.\n\nLenny (00:06:54):\nI love that we're already talking about metrics and retention. This is off to a good start.\n\nJosh Miller (00:06:57):\nYou got to know your audience. Lenny.\n\nLenny (00:06:59):\nWe're going to talk about just how public you're about everything. But would you be for sharing your retention actual numbers? The D5 and D7 you just mentioned?\n\nJosh Miller (00:07:07):\nYes. With the asterisk that I didn't prepare for that. So, Rebecca correct me on Twitter after this, if this is wrong. So once again, we don't look at DAU retention. We don't look at weekly active-user retention. We really just look at D5 D7 retention. Depending on the cohort, that's somewhere between low to mid-30s and low 40s. So really, really fantastic. Again, not going to continue. If there is anyone on this call that is going to check this in a year, it will be lower I'm sure. But so far, we're really thrilled with it.\n\n(00:07:37):\nAnd most importantly, in the same way, we don't look at absolute gross growth number, we don't look at retention in this moment. We look at, is it improving cohort by cohort? And so, what I think I am most proud of is that, if you go back a year, by all means our retention curve, we were really proud of it. And I think one of the best in our category of software. But, what I'm really proud of is, 12 months later we've been inching it up and up and up, despite getting further away from the earliest most passionate adopters. So, our retention curve's going up and up a little bit, which is-\n\nLenny (00:08:11):\nAll right. All right. If you haven't shared that, that'd be cool to share on Twitter someday. I'm a retained user.\n\nJosh Miller (00:08:15):\nI'm going to wait and you can share this clip. We'll share this clip.\n\nLenny (00:08:18):\nOkay. Okay. I love it. We're just ready. We got the marketing strategy coming together. So, I told you this ahead of the chat, but the reason I wanted to have you on this podcast, even though, as folks may know, and as I've told you, I try to actually avoid founders and CEOs on this podcast to give other folks a platform who aren't often invited on podcasts. But the reason I wanted to have you on is, I just feel like Arc is a remarkable product. It blew me away the first time I used it. I don't know if you saw it, I tweeted as soon as I signed up? I had to share how awesome it was. I was like-\n\nJosh Miller (00:08:47):\nOf course I saw it. It made my day.\n\nLenny (00:08:48):\nOkay. Okay, great. And, also as an outside observer, it just feels like you're building remarkable culture and team that's really unique. And, so I just want to selfishly learn from how you think about product and team building and all the things that go into it. So yeah.\n\nJosh Miller (00:09:03):\nThanks for saying that, Lenny. What a cool way to kick off an interview.\n\nLenny (00:09:06):\nAbsolutely. First question I have along those lines is, you mentioned at some point that your product building philosophy is a reaction to the traditional Silicon Valley way of building product. I'm curious to hear what led you down that road? Why did you feel like you had to react to it? And then how would you just describe your product building philosophy at The Browser Company?\n\nJosh Miller (00:09:27):\nI'll share this caveat once and never again in this interview. But I want anyone listening to know, I'm someone who doesn't believe there is a single right way to do things. So, what I'm sharing today is truly just what we have found works for us in this moment for what we are doing. But, I remember when I was earlier in my career, I'd listen to podcasts like this and take it as dogma, because there are these people that had done it and I respected what they'd built. So, if any of this sounds like \"better than thou,\" it's not intended to. This is just what we found works for us and what we care about. [inaudible 00:09:59].\n\n(00:09:58):\nOkay. So early in my career started a company also with Hursh, my current co-founder and CTO. We were fortunate enough to have that company acquired or acqui-hired by Facebook and spent a number of years working at Facebook. And remarkable organization, probably the best executing I've ever seen at that period of time. And, by the way, I'd never been a PM before, so I'm not complimenting myself, I was just learning for the first time. But what struck me at Facebook in call it 2014, and I've seen through to this day, is Silicon Valley, at least the most modern version of Silicon Valley, has this obsession with graphs, and has this obsession with numbers and metrics.\n\n(00:10:36):\nI mean, you saw me in the previous answer, I'm talking about D5, D7. What's a D5, D7? And, it is an incredibly effective way to achieve certain outcomes, to focus on numbers, because it's very quantitative, it's objective. You can see the graph go up or go down, or stay flat depending on what you want. But what we've found is that optimizing for metrics leaves a lot on the table and it misses a lot. And so, what we do at The Browser Company is we talk about optimizing feelings. How do we want to make someone feel on the other end of our software? Do we want to make them feel joy? Do we want to make them feel fast? Do we want to make them feel organized? Do we want to make them feel focused? What is it the feeling we are trying to evoke in whatever we're doing on a specific project, or a specific feature, or a specific piece of storytelling content?\n\n(00:11:31):\nAnd I can imagine what's going through the heads of your listeners right now, which is probably a number of things. But among others, that sounds really damn romantic. If they're like, \"Okay. You optimizing for feelings.\" But if you allow me, I would posit that actually this modern way of optimizing for numbers and graphs, especially for what we all do every day, which is make things and put in the world, is what's fairly odd. Because, if you just to yourself daydream about, what are your favorite products or product companies and brands, while it may sound cliche for me, Nike. Nike was one of the first companies that at a very deep level resonate with me as a child. Disney? Disney, same thing. Apple? Before I was a professional in an industry, these were the brands and the products that they made that really made me love something that was ostensibly a commercial product I could buy.\n\n(00:12:29):\nWhat do you think Walt Disney was optimizing for when he was crafting Disneyland? What do you think Phil Knight was thinking about when he made that first version of the Nike running shoe? What do you think Steve Jobs was imagining and daydreaming about when thinking about the iPhone or the Macintosh? By all means, numbers are a fantastic way to be honest with yourself about whether or not you are achieving what you aim to do. But at the moment of creation, at the stage as product people, wondering what should we do, and why, and how? We think it's much more important for us to think about the human, the person at the other end, and how we really want to make them feel.\n\n(00:13:10):\nI think one tangible example of that is when I was at Facebook, I joined in the midst of Snapchat's ascendancy. And, there was a lot of feelings about how are we doing, should we be worried? And the way that we would have that conversation would be, how many times per week do people share on Facebook? Do they post something? We even had an acronym OBPS. It's like seared into my memory. What is OBPS? And how is it trending over time? Well, I think we should have been asking, and what we at least would ask at The Browser Company and our way of product development is, \"Do we think people feel closer to their friends and family?\" Or something of that nature?\n\n(00:13:52):\nI think that's what Snapchat got so right. They weren't obsessing about something like, \"How many people put an image into the composer and hit the plus button. And the number of times per week means success.\" They were thinking about something much more human and essential. And so, that is what we've [inaudible 00:14:07] The Browser Company. Don't optimize for metrics, don't optimize for graphs. Use that as a way to keep you honest, and use it as a tool in your toolkit. But fundamentally, none of us are here for that. We're there to make people feel something.\n\nLenny (00:14:19):\nAs you pointed out, I think a lot of the people are listening are like, \"I love that. I wish I could do that. I want to optimize for feelings, but then I got to drive the business forward. I got goals to hit. I want to keep people accountable.\" I'm curious how you operationalize this approach? How do you actually implement this idea? I imagine you still have goals and metrics and you guys, you talked about retention and things like that.\n\nJosh Miller (00:14:42):\nYeah. Obviously it's difficult to do that in the abstract for another company, and it may not work for every company and every product. But, for example, one of the reasons we found this to be so effective so far is, if you pick the right feeling, it typically tracks pretty closely with the metric you care about. So, for example, we don't have a growth team and we have no semblance of growth projects. However, in many of the new features that we put out into the world, we want people to feel surprise or joy or an emotion like that. Guess what? When people feel that way, they go, \"Oh, my God, what was that?\" And they start telling their friends and family about it, and they start dropping a screenshot in Slack, et cetera. So, there's one example on the consumer side. I've never built traditional enterprise software selling to CIOs, et cetera. But I can imagine maybe someone in the IT department of a large enterprise wants to feel smart, or wants to feel ahead of the curve or wants to feel secure and ease at what they're doing.\n\n(00:15:54):\nI think sometimes we just forget that whoever your buyer is, or whatever your business objective, at the end of the day we're a bunch of people in a bunch of rooms at the other side of these screens. And just thinking about that person, it could be a buyer, it could be a customer. But I think the truth is the answer to the question Lenny is, when I was earlier in my career, I was searching for the answers or the way to do things, the right, the wrong, the binary. I think anyone that's been doing this or anything for a while learns that it's all nuanced. It's a spectrum. It depends. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\n(00:16:26):\nBut I think the true answer, Lenny, is just optimizing for metrics so purely is deeply flawed in my opinion. Optimizing for feelings so purely is flawed as well. And it depends on what you are doing, what the project is and a lot of other things. But I think the reason we come out so strongly is, I do think Silicon Valley has tended so far towards optimizing for graphs and metrics, that if we can reel it back in a little bit, at least as just one company, I think that will be good. But the truth is, it's both. We need to use all the tools we can get, but I think hopefully that's one way that people can operationalize.\n\nLenny (00:17:05):\nI'm curious, just to poke out a little bit, how you actually implement that? So maybe as an example, you recently launched this Peek feature, where you mouse over, I think, a link and it opens up in a little browser that doesn't last. Do you put together a little spec of some sort of, \"We're trying to create surprise, and maybe here's a metric we think about it.\" What's actual day-to-day operational approach to a new feature, in terms of feelings versus metrics?\n\nJosh Miller (00:17:32):\nYeah. The truth is I don't think we've operationalized it as formally as we should one day. And we'll probably need to one day. The lucky thing is we are a very tight group of individuals that have now worked together for a long time. So not so formal as there's a PRD at the top of it, we list out the emotions. It's much more, with that project, get Ben in a room and whoever else is working on it and say, \"All right. So here's what we're trying to do for people. Here's the problem we're trying to solve or the way we fit in their day. And in that moment people want to feel very light and airy.\"\n\n(00:18:05):\nSo, for the Peek feature [inaudible 00:18:07] he's referencing the use cases. You're on Hacker News and you want to probably in pretty quick succession check out five to seven URLs. And you're not really sure which one you're going to spend time on, but you're going to open a bunch of stuff really quickly. And Peek allows you to effortlessly just peek into it, without leaving Hacker News and context switching to this whole new tab and going back and forth. So in that scenario, the conversation was how do we make it feel really airy and effortless to just whoop, pop it up, pop it back down, lightness, airiness, speed, agility. So again, it's not that we have a, \"What is the number one feeling and the number two feeling?\" It is much more conversational at this stage, but I am actually really excited. Hopefully we got the privilege one day to have such a large team that we have to figure out a way to do it. So, that's an example of how we think about it.\n\nLenny (00:18:57):\nIt's a good segue to a question I wanted to touch on. So, I asked Scott Belsky what I should ask you. He's a big fan of yours. I don't know if he's an investor? But he's just like, \"I love Josh.\" And asked him, \"What should I ask Josh?\" And one of his questions was about, you guys ship very quickly. You're shipping meaningful features every Friday. And you also close the loop really well with customers when they come ask for something. You're like, \"Hey, here. We did it.\" What is it that you do, and what can people learn from the way you all operate that allows you to ship quickly?\n\nJosh Miller (00:19:26):\nWell, first of all, thank you Scott, if you're listening. It's somewhat of an awkward question admittedly, because it's like someone complimenting you about your product. It's always impossible to really take and accept the compliment, because you see all the blemishes. Of course we see all these ways in which we don't ship fast enough and could be doing a better job listening and building with members. But, at risk of sounding a bit cliche, I really think we ship our values. So, we thought a lot about our values as a company. You can read about them online. And I think if you examine those values and then you look at your compliment or Scott's compliment, you can see [inaudible 00:20:05] one-to-one. So the first, and I really think the most important is, we hire people that show up with heartfelt intensity.\n\n(00:20:11):\nAnd, a lot of companies I think obsess over craft details. They'll be a value like, \"We obsess over the details.\" What we say is, we want people that show up to our company with some fire in their belly, something that they are out to do. And for each person it's a little bit different. For some people it may be UI Craft details, for other people it may be achieving double the performance with a quarter of the engineering head count. Everyone has something, but they show up with this heartfelt intensity. And I think even relative to everything else, I'm going to say, that's it. If you have a team that has heartfelt intensity and is there for a purpose and something to prove, you give them a very exciting, ambitious prompt and get out of their way and they will do remarkable work. So, showing up with heartfelt intensity.\n\n(00:20:54):\nOur second value is assume you don't know. Assume you don't know. And the value \"assume you don't know\" is, even if you're a subject matter expert. We have someone in our company that literally built the first version of Chrome and ran it for 16 years. But he more than anyone embodies this beginner's mind of, \"I have no idea how this should work or what will happen.\" And the follow up to that value is, \"So we got to get going.\" It's like dropping in a new city. You just got to walk out the door of your Airbnb turn left and ... Maybe you'll turn right and then you'll hop on the subway, but you just got to get going and see what you find. And so, we have this attitude of, you're showing up with this heartfelt intensity. But you start by saying, \"I've no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea what's going to happen.\" So we've just got to get going. And that biases in a default to action.\n\n(00:21:44):\nWe have another value of, start by asking, \"What could be?\", which is pushing ourselves to be as aspirational, ambitious as possible. So the Peek feature that you mentioned, we just didn't want to solve the problem of context switching. We wanted to almost blur the line between native and web software, and make it feel like a sheet of paper. And really pushing ourselves to be as ambitious as we can be, which is the consequence of blowing back around and more deeply motivating the people working on it.\n\n(00:22:13):\nSo, I mean, I could keep going. We have a value, \"You're doing it for the crew when you got to swarm. When you got to swarm,\" and we have value of, \"make them feel something.\" But I think what it all adds up to is, a team that has a lot of heart, has a lot of intrinsic motivation and a, \"It's the first day of my career. I wonder what's going to happen?\" attitude. And I think all of those things add up to a culture which is, \"Let's get something out there. Let's see what happens.\"\n\nLenny (00:22:46):\nHow did you come up with these? What was the process to come up with company values? Because I know a lot of companies are like, \"We should come up with these.\" How do you do that?\n\nJosh Miller (00:22:54):\nThe secret is I hate corporate values. I've never resonated with them. And I'm fortunate, we're fortunate enough, to have a lot of really spectacular, experienced leaders in our corner. And I got hammered to the first year, two years on, \"Josh, where are your values? How can your team operate without values?\" And I always experienced them on the other end as almost corporate propaganda, these cliche fortune cookie, Panda Express-like, \"You should care about the detail.\" It didn't resonate with me. And the thing that clicked was maybe a year and a half, two years into working, I just kept hearing the same things from the team. And I would do things like a year into someone joining, \"How's it going? What's going well? What's not?\" And I realized that there are some traits that define our team, extremely organically and naturally. No one told people what our values were.\n\n(00:23:51):\nAgain, because I was this naive, ignorant 31-year-old being like, \"Values are a corporate, late-stage capitalism creation,\" and just very, very hardheaded. And it was really special two years in, hearing from the team why they love The Browser Company, why they think we're doing ... Just the passion there. And then we challenged ourselves to what became a value. Well, if something about the five one-liners on the corporate webpage feels off, start by asking what could be in dream a little bit. And what I realized was, all of the statements people would say about what they loved about The Browser Company, what they thought defined the way we work, they reminded me of how I like to take road trips. I'm a big traveler. I'm a big fan of dropping in somewhere new and just exploring. And so we just had this \"Aha!\" Moment. Let's, instead of having a corporate landing page with five value titles and subtitles, let's write a manual for how to take a road trip.\n\n(00:24:54):\nSo we wrote an essay called \"Notes on Road Trips\" that use this semi-biographical, but mostly fictional, story about a person and their father taking a road trip when they're a teenager, to tell the story of how we do things at The Browser Company. And share these values, but in a way that hopefully won't feel so propagandary and feel a little more, you're reading an essay. So I say that, again, not to say there's anything wrong with traditional values. I'm actually sure I'm going to get an earful for a lot of people that coach me and give me advice that I sounded too indignant on this podcast. But I'm pretty proud of that story because it was a great example of assuming you don't know. We were sure that corporate values were not for us. And then very organically without trying it turned out, \"Wait! They run through this company in a pretty profound way. We should put some words around it, because it's happening whether or not we like it, or say it is or not.\"\n\nLenny (00:25:49):\nThat's awesome. I have the page here and it's quite beautiful. And, pulling to it in the show notes just very briefly and tactically, did you just sit down and start writing this thing and then people gave you feedback? How long did this process take? Just for folks that maybe you want to go down this road?\n\nJosh Miller (00:26:03):\nYeah. Warning downside of this process that it takes a lot longer than we thought it would, because we put so much heart into it. So, what it started with was again, in my natural one-year, check-in type conversation, starting to notice these patterns. And then we actually very comprehensively were like, \"Okay. Let's sit down and interview everyone at The Browser Company. But no survey. One by one, talking to people, asking questions. And then we pulled out those words. So, actually what's really cool about these values, if my memory serves me, I believe every single one, with the exception of maybe a word or two, was something that someone on our team said. So we interviewed the entire team and then these are meant to be a mirror. The putting it in road trip essay form? That took a long time. That that was a lot of ... Yeah. I don't recommend the way that we did that, but-\n\nLenny (00:27:02):\nHow long is long?\n\nJosh Miller (00:27:03):\nProbably three months.\n\nLenny (00:27:06):\nOh. That does not sound that long. Okay.\n\nJosh Miller (00:27:07):\nYeah. Maybe this goes back to Scott's comment that maybe our bar to how quickly we should ship stuff including values is, it's like I don't know. But, yeah. It felt like a long time. And this was not just me. Just for anyone listening, this was not CEO in a corner writing a missive. This was a team effort. There's a woman Abby on our team that did so much work on this project. The words themselves came from our team. So, it has my name I think somewhere on that webpage, but by no means was this me writing this essay in a corner with the fireplace on, or anything like that.\n\nLenny (00:27:40):\nOkay. Awesome. That was really helpful. As you also saw, I asked on Twitter what to ask you, and I got a ton of questions. People have a lot of questions for how y'all do stuff. The most common question turned out was from Ched Khan who had the most likes of all the questions that people asked you. And it was around hiring, that basically you've been able to convince some of the most amazing people in the world to join The Browser Company. Like you just mentioned, you hired the guy that built Chrome, basically, to work on Arc now. What is it that you do that convinces amazing people to join? Because everyone wants to learn from you and copy you, and do that themselves.\n\nJosh Miller (00:28:15):\nThank you for that question and for all the legs. I will admit, this is also a fairly awkward one to ask. I actually just came from an interview with a candidate and they asked me a fairly similar question. And I said, \"You know what? You should go ask the people that work here. It's not me. I don't know why they ultimately join.\" But what I will tell you is, the intentionality, which is another secret, sharing a lot of secrets. This one will probably get me in trouble. I don't care about web browsers. I've never cared about web browsers. I never wanted to build a web browser. If you had told me a decade ago that I'd be working on a desktop first web browser at 32, \"I'd say what in my career went horribly wrong?\" The origin story of this company was Hursch, who I met when I was 20. We started a company together. Lots of mistakes, a lot of successes, a lot of growing pains and figured out who we are. And a decade later we were still friends, we went to each other's weddings.\n\n(00:29:10):\nWe'd worked in all these different industries and different-stage companies and we just realized, \"You know what? There are a lot of ideas that get us really excited. There are a lot of shapes and sizes.\" But as we were nostalgic for looking back on the decade prior, it was groups of people and moments in time with those people that were our best memories. And so, what Hursch and I decided, long before the company started was, we want to build a company, but we want to build a company where we feel like we can hire whoever we want. And I don't mean whoever we want in terms of who would dare say no. But we want to work on something where the greatest minds in our industry and adjacent would want to work on that prompt in a hypothetical sense. And then build an organization, build a team where we can work in the way that, after a decade of trying on a bunch of hats and ways of doing things and metrics this and [inaudible 00:30:04], we could do what was right for us.\n\n(00:30:06):\nAnd so, where we went to with a new web browser, let alone a web browser as a new form of computing, which is our true aspiration, to build an internet here. You can look up the internet computer YouTube video on our Browser Company YouTube page. But our ambition's even higher than a web browser. The intention of that is, we just want to go hire our favorite people that we know and don't know and build a team that, we'll never get bored working with this crew, because of how incredible they are and how humble they are. And so, when you think about it like that, I as the CEO as notionally the head of product, I view our product as our team. And I know a lot of companies say that. I actually think they probably all mean it. I don't think anyone's being disingenuous, but we really meet it. It is the genesis of this company.\n\n(00:30:55):\nIt is not a new web browser. It is, let's build the dream team, our dream team. And let's build a way of working that is really fun for us and really speaks to our values. And let's go find people that resonate with that. And that trickles down to everything we do, whether it's our policy about this or the way we do that. I'll give you one example. Our goal of interviews is to convince people not to join The Browser Company. If I have an interview with someone, I don't pitch them and say, \"What do you want to ask me? Anything you want? I'll be super honest, most people shouldn't want to work here.\" So I think it all starts with us viewing our product as the company, as the team, not Arc itself. And then, I think being self-aware, that that's how I think that's how we think.\n\n(00:31:43):\nBut again, flying back things that I've heard, we have been fortunate. We've hired a lot of really remarkable people, especially on paper and especially off. I mean, all around. I'll just give a couple examples to share one thing that I've heard. A few recent hires, we hired someone named Darren who, as I mentioned, he co-created the first prototype of Chrome and then ran it for 16 years. I think hundreds if not thousands of people reported to him. He joined the Browser Company as an IC. We just hired a woman named Tara. She was on the original Paper by 53 team, one of my most inspiring products at the beginning of my career. Most recently she was actually, I believe, Senior SVP of product at Vimeo and a senior director of engineering. She joined our engineering team as an IC. We just hired someone named Peter Vidani. When I was 20 building consumer social software, he was the coolest, most impressive person. He was the first designer at Tumblr. Ran the design team at Tumblr for seven years and the most recently was SVP of design at Slack. Joined the team as an IC designer.\n\n(00:32:48):\nAnd though that sounds like I'm bragging, the thing that was really interesting and perplexing to us was, these are people that have made a lot of money, that have had really fancy titles, that have worked on transformative projects. Why are they joining this team? And I think something that people show up to The Browser Company with is, in addition to heartfelt intensity, this aspiration that their work at The Browser Company will come to define their careers. And that's coming from people that have done really remarkable things, by all accounts. And I think more than anything, we've realized that, in order for people like that to join and to show up with that, there are a number of things you have to promise and provide them, that make folks like that gravitate with the intention of doing their work of their career, ranging from an incredible and ambitious aspiration, really empowerment to act on the prompts that they're given on behalf of the team in the way that they see fit, and truly trusting and empowering them.\n\n(00:33:54):\nA very kind culture. I think if you've been doing this for a decade plus, your intolerance for bullshit is very, very low. And so, by no means do I think we're perfect. I don't think everyone shows up The Browser Company saying, \"If I'm not on the equivalent of the early iPhone team, I'm going to be bummed.\" But I think generally speaking, Hursh and I, and everyone that was on the early team showed up with this aspiration of making The Browser Company the product. And I think that's carried forward to this tumbleweed of people saying, \"[inaudible 00:34:23]. That's where I'm going to finally do the equivalent of building the iPhone.\" And we all know we probably won't, but there is that, \"I want to give it one more shot. I want to go for it.\" And that just tumbleweeds, I think, at some point.\n\nLenny (00:34:37):\nThat tumbleweed is, I think a big part of it is, once you get amazing people, more amazing people want to join. So I think that's very much helpful. Something else this resonates a lot with is, just the mission of a company is such a powerful tool for pulling people in, the best people. I've seen that a lot with founders. If they have a meaningful mission, it's so much easier to hire, versus not. And clearly you're really good at sharing that vision and mission. And then you also have a really interesting mission and vision. I think there's also, you're just a charismatic founder and that helps a lot too. And you're a great storyteller.\n\nJosh Miller (00:35:08):\nWell, the other thing I want to add Lenny is, again putting myself in the listener, I imagine a lot of what I just said probably sounded a little bit ... Could come off, if you don't know me and you don't, as a little bombastic or a little again romantic. Very tactically, I'll give you something that was just who we are, but I think has helped contribute to this tumbleweed. From the very first person we hired, we celebrated them publicly. The fact that they joined. And in a very heartfelt way, telling you about them as a person and what they did. Long before we had anyone that anyone would've heard of before working at The Browser Company, just because it was earnest, we were really proud. Again, if you think of our original mandate as building the companies, the product, when our first designer joins, we want to tell everyone about it. That's a product launch. That is the product launch.\n\n(00:35:57):\nAnd then, whenever we ship something, we go out of our way to celebrate the people that worked on it publicly. I think there's a CEO-hero worship sometimes in Silicon Valley. I do very little at the company. Or sorry. I do very little as it relates to the thing people fall in love with Arc. I do a lot for The Browser Company, but I don't make Arc. I didn't make Peek. And again, that's just who we are, which is, \"Alexandre. She killed me! Look at how cool this is!\" because it's earnest and it's honest to who we are. And then I think it creates this reinforcing cycle of you're someone that's done something incredible, which is, \"I'm going to be celebrated. They truly want me here. I'm going to be recognized for the work that I do.\n\n(00:36:39):\nIt's not going to just accrue to this like CEO figurehead who everyone thinks is some genius visionary. And so again, by no means are we perfect. By no means do I think we get it right all the time. But, because it's such an authentic expression of who we are and what we were trying to do, I think we do little micro implementations like that, that ladder up to that principle I got so excited about but are as simple as someone tweets about some animation. They're like, \"Woo! This was fun.\" Tag Sherry. Sherry made that, Sherry's incredible. And you don't see that that much in Silicon Valley. You see corporate blog posts and the CEOs more than anyone else. That's probably why you don't have CEOs on the podcast, because you don't want ... You know this Lenny. That is why that's your policy. You don't want to hear from the CEOs. They're not the ones building the product. You want to hear from the people actually doing it. That's why I love this podcast.\n\nLenny (00:37:26):\nThat's right. That's right. Thank you. I'd say just hearing everything you're saying, The Browser Company sounds like an incredible place to work. I could see why people want to go work. It's pretty simple. You touched on being public and sharing everything that's going on. And that's another area I wanted to spend a little time on. You guys are very transparent about what's going on and inside the company. You bring cameras into the board meetings. I watched a half-hour meeting you had with your head of design talking about a project that's behind scheduling. You're trying to figure out how do we get this out the door. You just share actual things you all are doing within the company, publicly. And I'm curious just, why did you start doing that? What have you seen as a good or bad that has come from that? Is there anything you've shared that maybe you regret like \"Oh, maybe we shouldn't have put that out there.\" What's been your experience with that?\n\nJosh Miller (00:38:17):\nWhy don't I start with the regret. It's not yet a regret, but the thing that I wonder ... Because this is very much ... I may have hopefully spoken with a lot of earnest passion to some of the questions before. This is one that I would really characterize as a prototype. We really have a prototype-driven culture. And this is one that I'd put high on the list of, \"Maybe we'll regret this later.\" And specifically what I hope is that, I'm uncomfortable putting myself too central in our story. But, naturally, when you're doing storytelling publicly, there's a gravitational pull for the CEO and the founders to be at the center of that. And so, sometimes even this morning, we had our best-performing YouTube video ever. The first one that really broke out of people that already follow us. And it's a reaction video in classic YouTube form to MKBHD talking about our product for the first time.\n\n(00:39:13):\nAnd I honestly watched it right before this again, and I was like, \"What the fuck am I doing? What are we doing? Why am I trying to become a YouTuber?\" So, to be totally honest, I don't regret anything yet. But I wonder if we could take this too far? So if anyone's listening, if you see us starting to take this too far, especially as it relates to me, we want to hear about it, because that's keeping me up. But I do think the intentions are pure and earnest, which are ... And another thing that defines people that have joined The Browser Company, in addition to wanting to do the work that defines their careers, is I would characterize it as a little bit of hopelessness, maybe feeling jaded, questioning this industry that they've worked on or products that they've worked on and wanting to rediscover. But, at the end of the day, we are a group of idealists, of optimists, wanting to rediscover what we fell in love with when we were kids, whether it's the part of our craft or the potential of technology, the internet and software.\n\n(00:40:19):\nAnd, as part of that, I would view Arc and the Browser Company as an experiment in we can do it. Better is possible. And as we were thinking about better as possible, rediscovering what we love and believe in deep down and trying to express it in the world, one of it related to trust. I remember when I was a teenager using the internet for the first time and early on to college, just the hopefulness of what was possible, and the belief that these people building these tools, they were like heroes to me. Not just the leaders, but the teams, the companies, the brands. And somewhere along the way, I'm not blaming a single company, I'm not even saying that anyone did anything wrong, but culturally ... I was a sociology major. Culturally, we have lost trust in tech companies and in tech brands.\n\n(00:41:10):\nAnd so, building in public showing you our meetings, uncomfortably so, is an act in, \"If we were them, why should they trust us? Why should anyone trust us?\" We have your most sensitive personal data. We have your most sensitive professional data. Why should you trust us if we've had our trust broken again and again? And I think our hypothesis in this prototype, in this experiment is, we can have the best privacy policy in the world, but at the end of the day, again, it's just people behind the screen. And so, even if I think about ... I haven't done interviews like this, because I worry that if you don't know me, I come off the wrong way.\n\n(00:41:51):\nA lot of people tend to. I've noticed a lot of friends in my life that I know them behind the scenes, but the way that people perceive them publicly here don't know them. They interpret it the other way, because there's not that trust. And so our bet is that if you get to know us, Nash, Dina, me Hursch, and you really feel like you get to know us as person and all of our imperfections, we're average looking, we're average to all that stuff. Then when you see that we're asking for a permission, you might trust it is because we want to make you feel a certain way that's better. And if not ... I'll say someone tweeted something yesterday, who apparently we didn't earn the trust yet and they haven't gone to know us. And their interpretation of what we were doing was the worst possible interpretation you could [inaudible 00:42:40]. And, at first honestly, I felt a bit of anger, like, \"Who was this person on a Thursday just saying we're doing X and Y?\" And then I realized, \"You know what? I'd have the same feeling because of the experiences I've had with technology in the past five to 10 years.\"\n\n(00:42:53):\nAnd so, the intention with these the building and public experiments are radical trust building. Not radical transparency, we can't share everything, but radical trust building. You get to know us as humans and I worry that we'll regret that, and that it could potentially turn into, \"Oh, they're trying to be internet celebrities that they're so important, they should share everything because ... Thank you, them, for gracing us with their opinions.\" It's not the intention and it feels worth taking that risk. But that's the intentionality behind it.\n\nLenny (00:43:24):\nThat is a really interesting insight. It makes a lot of sense for a browser to find that so important, to build that trust.\n\nJosh Miller (00:43:31):\nI haven't done podcast interviews, I haven't done this. I really like you. I really like the feeling of your conversations, the intentions behind them, the warmth, even your intro music is a friendly jig. So, I mean, it's a great example, where I think it's one of the most wonderful things about the podcasting medium is I've had you in my ear for a year and the people on your show and you feel a sense of trust in you and your intentions here. And your intentions both in this interview, in terms of what you're trying to do for listeners. To some extent your show, and the warmth that you bring to it and the perception I have as a human being ... We've never met. We've maybe DM'd briefly, maybe five messages exchanged. But I feel like I know you and that makes me trust you. And so, in many ways this podcast, at a meta level's an inspiration for it.\n\nLenny (00:44:23):\nI feel the same way in reverse. You made this point about being worried about being two front and center for your company. I have the same exact feeling. Even though my newsletter's called \"Lenny's Newsletter,\" I only named it that because that was the default recommendation when I was signing up for Substack. I didn't want to be this, \"I know it all. Come to me. Welcome to my know-it-all place.\" I really dislike that. And that's why I created this community that lives along the side, where people can help each other, because I'm not going to have all answers. And so, I've had to lead into that. \"All right, people.\" They want a person to help them understand what's going on, learn about ... And in your videos you do a great job highlighting other people. I was watching your board meeting video and it's like, \"Here's all team members coming along. Here they come. How are you doing?\" So, anyway. All that to say, you're doing a great job finding the balance.\n\nJosh Miller (00:45:14):\nOh, thank you. You as well.\n\nLenny (00:45:15):\nI appreciate it. You talked about storytelling, and you mentioned that you have a whole bunch of odd teams at The Browser Company. One of them is a storytelling team. And that actually explains, I think, how you're so good at making these really amazing videos, because making great videos is hard. Can you just talk about some of these odd teams that you have, that probably other companies don't?\n\nJosh Miller (00:45:34):\nOne of the other things that, hopefully, you're picking up in this interview, so far, is we are a very prototype-driven culture. It goes back to the \"assume you don't know\" ethos. We try a lot of experiments, and we try them related to product features related to how we work together, related to the stories we tell. So, this isn't a category of, \"I'm not sure it's going to work, but we're trying it,\" and it seems to be working so far, at least for us. What Lenny's referencing is, we have a handful of teams. I'll pick two just as an examples. We have a membership team and we have a storytelling team. And though you probably recognize or are obviously familiar with those terms, those aren't historically startup orgs, or startup disciplines and teams. And let me tell you about the intention behind both.\n\n(00:46:16):\nMembership. Membership was, when I was at Facebook, the most impressive thing to me about how Facebook built product was their user research team. Shout out to Lowie and Jane. I don't know why you'd be listening to this podcast, but you deeply inspired me when we were at Facebook together. They had the most incredible team of user researchers. And it always felt odd to me. And this isn't Lowie and Jane's fault. Actually, in fact, they suffered from this. That user research almost felt like a service organization, relative to product engineering design. There'd be a PM. The PM would get assigned a researcher and the PM got to decide how to use the researcher, and ask them what to do and ask them questions. But seeing the potential for when you really get to know the people that you are building for, that you're serving, at a really deep way, it is extraordinary. How do you build product any other way?\n\n(00:47:09):\nAnd so, we took that to the extreme at The Browser Company, which we said, \"Let's not think of it as customer support, customer service, customer success, user research. Those are just business terms. Those are just industry terms.\" At the end of the day, what we're saying is if there is a human being, from the moment they touch our software or our products for the first time, to, if they have it last, we need to have a deep, genuine, ongoing relationship with them.\n\n(00:47:36):\nAnd on day one, that may be air quote, \"customer success.\" \"How do I use this thing?\" On day 37, that might be, \"I have a bug. Do you mind helping me fix it?\" And on day 58, that may be, \"Hey, we're shipping the mobile app soon. What do you want from mobile? What do you want on your phone?\" Other companies view that as different orgs and disciplines. We view that as, there are a bunch of people at the other end of this that we are serving from the moment they touch our product the first time. Let's own that relationship full stack and think about it holistically. And so that's the membership team.\n\n(00:48:07):\nOn the storytelling side, very similar, different type of person. Again, we're a humanistic the company. So, the theme here is the people on the company, the people at the other end. So if the membership team takes people from the moment they touch our product for the first time to the last, the storytelling team is about people we don't have the privilege of serving yet. They don't use Arc, they don't know what Arc is. That could be an investor, air quote, \"investor relations.\" That could be members of the press, air quote, \"PR.\" That could be just people out in the world, air quote, \"marketing\" and one-day sales. But at the end of the day, it's telling our story to people. It's telling our story to people and thinking about that holistically in full stack.\n\n(00:48:47):\nSo that's how we think about teams is, we start with first principles asking, what are we really trying to do here? And what is the most direct way to manifest that, even if it's not how other people do it? In practice, one of the benefits of that is I do think it leads to certain pieces of content. For example, that people go, \"Oh, wow! I've never seen that before.\" But again, I think anyone's capable of this. I think we have an extraordinarily talented storytelling team and membership team, but I really think it's as simple as the intentionality of what is the team? What are their incentives? What are the disciplines on the team? Even hiring a video editor, for example, as a small company. But the video editor, not having make a TikTok account go viral. But think about it more holistically in terms of the people.\n\n(00:49:33):\nSo, again, there's a lot that breaks down. There's a lot that's not going well about it. I have no idea how the scales, the 500 people ... Yeah. So this is not me saying this experiment is ultimately going to be a huge success, or right for everyone or even us at different times. But that was the intentionality of the membership team, the storytelling team and others. And even product management. We don't have PMs at the company. My title at Facebook was Product Manager. I love product management. But, we view it not as a team. We view it as a leader, a role on a project, on an effort.\n\n(00:50:07):\nAnd depending on the projects, different types of people should be a PM. So, we have a performance-related project going on where, of course, an infrastructure engineer should be that air quote, \"PM.\" We have a product project, where actually I think someone from membership should be the PM, because ultimately, yes, we're building software product, but it is really about serving our members in a specific way, so we should have someone for membership be a PM. Again, as you can imagine, as is going through the heads of everyone listening, \"That must break down in 18 ways?\" Oh, it definitely does. And so I'm not promising one day it won't change. But again, continuous through the company is, assume you don't know. Start by asking what could be, and let's just try some things and see what happens.\n\nLenny (00:50:48):\nStart with what could be. I love that value. This episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, this sheet tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful. Why is it that always seems to be working against you, instead of working for you? Why does it feel like such a chore to use? Well, Linear is different. It's incredibly fast, beautifully designed, and it comes with powerful workflows that streamline your entire product development process, from issue tracking all the way to managing product roadmaps. Linear's designed for the way modern software teams work. What users love about Linear are the powerful keyboard shortcuts, efficient GitHub integrations, cycles that actually create progress and built-in project updates that keep everyone in sync. In short, it just works. Linear is the default tool of choice among startups and it powers a wide range of large, established companies such as Versel Retool and Cash App. See for yourself why product teams describe using Linear as magical visit linear.app/lenny to try Linear for free with your team and get 25% off when you upgrade. That's linear.app/lenny.\n\n(00:52:00):\nSo, I was going to ask you actually, you talked about why you don't have PMs. Do you think you'll hire PMs in the future, having a PM background? Do you think you'll get there or do you think you'll try to stick to this? People do the PM role, depending on the project?\n\nJosh Miller (00:52:12):\nYeah. We've increasingly hiring people that at other companies may have a PM title. I'd say we have two to three right now, that could have a PM title at another company. I don't think we will have a pm organization, or a PM role, because again, we believe depending on ... If you unpack the verbs that a PM does, I think those are verbs that anyone that we hire could do. And it really depends on what is the project? And what are we trying to do? I think the thing that will be unwavering is we like to hire mutts. And I haven't yet figured out a term that comes off as more endearing, because it's meant to be very endearing, but ... For example, there's a woman in a company named Rebecca.\n\n(00:52:58):\nRebecca was a data scientist we use at Cora. She got her PhD in MIT in I think behavioral psychology or something. I'm probably going to misquote that. But, got some crazy degree at MIT, and then was a software engineer at Stripe. And I'm talking about Rebecca through her resume. There's so much about Rebecca. She plays effectively a PM role right now. She is effectively PMing our effectively our multi-player team. But what was so awesome about meeting Rebecca is her and other people at this company have the mindset of, \"I make things, and I will do what I need to do to make what I want to make. Whenever that verb is, whenever that discipline is.\" And that requires people that are multidisciplinary in practice and multidisciplinary in approach to their work. It's not that we don't hire PMs, but we want to hire people who have a multidisciplinary approach and view things as, \"I like to make things. Tell me how I contribute to making it.\" And sometimes they may play the verbs of a PM and sometimes it may be something else.\n\nLenny (00:54:07):\nThis can be a really interesting story to follow. I've seen this journey a few times at different companies. What I find is a lot of times people that are good at other things like engineering or design, for a while, they're like, \"Yep. We don't need PMs. I'll do the PM job.\" And then eventually they're like, \"This sucks. I hate doing this stuff. I want to design. Leave me alone. I don't want to sit on a [inaudible 00:54:29] all day. I don't want to be in meetings.\" So eventually, it turns out, they're like, \"Okay. Let's find someone to do this thing that loves it.\" And so that's one thing that happens.\n\n(00:54:36):\nThe other thing I find is, I'm sure you've seen this, a lot of people are wary of PMs. They come in and they're like, \"Here's what we're doing,\" and they're just adults process complexity. What I find is those are just bad PMs. If you have an awesome PM, everything just gets better. Everyone's happier, things move faster. So I think companies often get to that stage. And then also there's just career development stuff, eventually as you scale. It's like \"What happened to my career path,\" and they're like, \"All right. Well, we got to go on one road or another.\" It's hard to stay in this hybrid role. But I super respect the first principal's approach of let's just-\n\nJosh Miller (00:55:08):\nAnd, for what's worth, Lenny. I think you're almost, definitely right. And I think it will almost definitely happen with us. And again, this goes back to the \"assume you don't know.\" The \"assume you don't know,\" is try a prototype and then assume it's not going to work. So, even in my own experience, I remember getting to know Evan from Snapchat just enough to know how he talked about PMs at Snap. And it was, \"We're never going to hire PMs at Snap. Everyone's a designer.\" And, I have no relationship with him anymore, but you can look, there are a lot of PMs at Snapchat.\n\n(00:55:37):\nSo I know from my own experience with people that I respect from a product perspective that were indignant, they would never hire PMs, their organizations now have PMs. And that's probably for a really good reason. I would tell say also on our team, if any of our designers are listening, they'll tell you these, whatever you want to call it, \"These verbs are taking up a lot of my time, and I do not have as much time to think and dream and design and do user research.\" And so, we're already feeling it breaking into our company.\n\n(00:56:04):\nI think the intentionality, whatever comes next, whatever it is, is leaders of the project should be picked for the projects, not because they're in a certain org at our company. And, if we ever hire people to do the PM role, we want them to think of themselves as people who make things and have lots of different disciplines and tools in their toolkit, not just the PM discipline. And, of course, even that could be wrong, and maybe in a year we cave. I got it totally wrong. We got it totally wrong. So, we'll see. But I would also, that that of all the things I shared on this podcast so far, this is probably the one I'll come crawling back to your podcast in a couple years, being, \"Lenny, you were right. It all blew up!\"\n\nLenny (00:56:47):\nBut it's a fun experiment and Snap is a good example. Stripes another, where they waited a long time to hire their first PMs. And I think it's because their designers or engineers were just incredibly good at that element. And it was also very design-forward or very edge-forward, so they didn't need as much PM skill initially.\n\nJosh Miller (00:57:03):\nIf I had to predict, I would predict that if we found that we were missing this discipline as a team, I think we would evolve Rebecca's team, which is technically the data team, and do something closer to a technical PM or data plus [inaudible 00:57:19] Again, it's all live, but the thought has even crossed our minds recently, that we may be wrong, and what org might we create if we need folks that have more of a background of [inaudible 00:57:29] like this.\n\nLenny (00:57:30):\nI'm excited for the video of this discussion that might happen. It's also interesting, your PM that you mentioned, Rebecca is very data oriented. And then, the initial discussion we had around focus on feelings and that sort of thing. So, that's cool that you have this really interesting balance of people that are very data focused and then this, \"Okay. But let's not obsess with that. What are the feelings we're trying to create?\"\n\nJosh Miller (00:57:50):\nYeah. Because again, the point of optimizing for feelings is not hire people who make feelings. It's like Rebecca's title is Data Lead. She runs our data team. But, Rebecca's one of the most humanistic people I know. You meet her and you feel the warmth that you feel when you talk to you, and you ask her what she does outside of work. And so, it's not that data doesn't have a role. Actually I'd say, for better or worse, data is part of our practice. It's more about what's that top-level intentionality? What are we trying to do here? But, yeah. We have a lot of people that, data is either a noun they've had in their resume or it's been a part of their practice a lot in the past.\n\nLenny (00:58:29):\nAwesome. One very tactical question with the storytelling team makes me think about Airbnb's video team. A lot of people are joking internally for years and years that the videos Airbnb put out in the early days accounts for half their market cap, because they're so good. And you're just like, \"Oh, my God, I want to go on an Airbnb.\" They just make you feel so much and they're soul made. So, what is the makeup of your storytelling team? Because I imagine some companies maybe listening, like maybe we should do something like this on our team.\n\nJosh Miller (00:58:57):\nWe have a three-person storytelling team. It's run by a woman named Nash. There is a gentleman named Ellis, who is a ... Background, started as a reporter at The Verge. Maybe there was a publication before that. But I met him when he was a reporter at The Verge covering social media. And then he ran marketing strategy for Snapchat for seven years. And then we have a person named Josh Lee, who I actually met as an intern. He was an intern at Facebook as a designer, that an intern for me at the White House when I worked at the White House, and then decided that he was over product design and over design, and totally just jumped and be like, \"I'm going to be a filmmaker,\" and has been making really fascinating indie films for a few years now. And he's our video editor on the team.\n\n(00:59:44):\nAnd it's so interesting. Nash's background, she had a brief stint at NBC. But again, you get to know her and she writes poems after hours and her dream is to write a fictional book. I mean, anyone that knows Nash, especially [inaudible 01:00:00] is just a force. A force. And the three of them, what's so interesting about them, which also relates to our design team ... One of the things I also found at Facebook is there was a tendency toward homogeneity. As you know, there's a stereotype of a Facebook PM for example, or a Google PM, the contrast between them and the way they work. And one of the things we also have purposely done on the storytelling team and otherwise, let's hire radically different archetypes. Ellis cannot be more different than Nash. Nash cannot be more different than Josh. There's some shared values, there's some shared beliefs, but they're very different.\n\n(01:00:35):\nDitto on the design team. Our design team? They are all over the place in terms of who they are, what they've done, their sensibilities, their aspirations. And whether it's the storytelling team or the design team, that can be hard sometimes, just to be honest. It's a lot easier to say, \"Hey, we're the Acme Co storytelling team, we're Acme Co design team. We hire designers like this and storytellers that.\" We hire people all over the place. We have an extremely diverse team, but in all senses of the word. But again, the no PM thing, it's not without flaws. I can see why a lot of large companies over time tend are like, \"It's the Facebook way or no way,\" or \"You're not good for here.\"\n\nLenny (01:01:14):\nYeah. It's actually I think, exact makeup of Airbnb video team. I forget what they were called. They didn't have a cool name, the storytelling team I think. But it was a videographer, an editor and then their producer, basically.\n\nJosh Miller (01:01:26):\nYeah. I mean, I remember going to Airbnb's offices early in my career and seeing the storyboards lining the walls and just being like, \"I want to work here.\" So, I'm actually not familiar with the ... I mean, I'm familiar with Airbnb's videos and brand marketing, fucking fantastic, excuse my language. But, yeah. I remember just walking around that office being like, \"Oh, my goodness! Are they making a movie or something? I want to [inaudible 01:01:53] here.\"\n\nLenny (01:01:54):\nFunny you say that. And for folks that want to find that, we'll link to it in show notes. But if you Google \"Snow White Airbnb,\" you'll actually see these storyboards. They basically hired a Pixar storyboard artist to draw out key frames of the journey of a host and a guest. And that became a central element of the strategy of, let's make each of these moments as amazing as possible. And it was based on the movie Snow White. You can read about it.\n\nJosh Miller (01:02:15):\nFor what it's worth, this is a great moment to share. All of the beliefs that I've shared here on behalf of our team, these aren't things that we just originally came up with. They're moments like when I went to Airbnb's office early in my career and saw these Snow White storyboards lining the walls. That had an impact on me. Even the idea that you would think in terms of that moment, you could actually see the lineage to, well, how do you want that person to feel when they open that door for the first time? So, I think it's just a great moment to shout out that we've accumulated a lot of doses of inspiration, like that day at Airbnb, that trickle down to us talking about optimizing for feelings. But that didn't come in a vacuum. That's our expression of what we've seen in the industry. This is building on the backs of so many people and companies that we've been fortunate to see.\n\nLenny (01:03:03):\nAnd now the trickling is happening from your lessons and experience and your unique approach.\n\nJosh Miller (01:03:07):\nI hope. There's a documentary that I highly recommend called General Magic. And it's one of the best pieces of media I've seen related to technology industry. And it's really interesting. I think there are two types of people to just be very ... There are people that watch that and view it as, \"Wow! What a missed opportunity,\" or almost like a sad story. And I view it as, \"If only we could be so lucky to assemble a group of people like that.\" And the thing about that documentary, for anyone that hasn't listened to it is, essentially was the iPhone before the iPhone, with the most legendary group of technologists working there. And it totally failed, completely failed by all traditional business definitions.\n\n(01:03:50):\nBut, what stuck with me from the documentary, how proud and nostalgic and passionate those individuals were in reminiscing about their time there. And then, what they all went on to create. And the fact that even today on this podcast, I'm sitting here talking about General Magic. So, I mean, to your point of hopefully Browser Company will have ripple effects. That to me is the ultimate goal, for me personally, at a very emotional level. If we could only be so lucky. That, to me, seems like success in many ways.\n\nLenny (01:04:24):\nYeah. What's cool is you're getting a lot of footage that will be very useful for a future documentary on the history of The Browser Company.\n\nJosh Miller (01:04:30):\n[inaudible 01:04:30] I didn't think about it like that, for better or worse.\n\nLenny (01:04:32):\nOne last thought, I was going to mention it in terms of the storytelling movie-making elements of Airbnb. Fun fact, there was a period where product managers were actually called producers, because one of the founders was like, \"We don't want to manage product, we want to produce beautiful experiences,\" like a movie producer. And so that was a year and a half maybe of Airbnb's history, where product managers were producers. The problem is, we got a lot of job applicants from Emmy-winning producers and they're like, \"oh, I want to work at Airbnb.\"\n\nJosh Miller (01:05:01):\nI know this podcast is about very tactical advice. So, one tactical piece of advice I'll give is, whether or not you like the idea of the storytelling team or something else, a byproduct of some of these experiments that we've found works really well is when you give something a new name, it sheds a lot of preconceived notions of what the thing should be. We found that even with product. So if you say you're building a browser history feature, then the benefit is everyone knows what you're talking about. And the downside is, everyone knows what you're talking about. And you show up with these preconceived notions of what it has to be. And so, if you go back again to revalue ask what could be ... In many ways the point of calling the team, the storytelling team or the membership team, or not having PMs as an organization ... All of this stuff isn't meant to be novelty for novelty's sake. It's meant to almost be a rhetorical tactic, to make people think truly first principles about what are we trying to do here?\n\n(01:06:00):\nAnd again, if at the end, producers are called PMs, that's fine. But I assume when it was called a producer, a much more intentionality was given to you communicating and talking and discussing, what does a producer do? What's their relationship with design? Because no one knew what the heck a producer was. And so, ultimately, that may have been failure in other ways. But that's one of the things we found tactically to be really helpful is, whether it's a product feature or a team, or whatever, give it a made up name just to really get to the root of what you're trying to do there. Or not borrow too much from wherever you worked before, whatever you've seen, popular media or whatever.\n\nLenny (01:06:36):\nI love that. And it's very undo ... Like, you've got to undo it. It was-\n\nJosh Miller (01:06:41):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (01:06:42):\nIt's a two-way door. And I like just the vision, the value you have of just prototyping things and whatever. It didn't work. Let's go back to what everyone else is doing. You mentioned great product and there was something I definitely wanted to chat a bit about, which is just, there's this group of companies who are just focused on, \"Let's just build the most amazing product experience.\" And I feel like The Browser Company is at the forefront in a lot of this. But it's like you guys, Linear, Raycast is this product, Cron. There's probably a few more and I'd love to actually hear if there's others that I'm not thinking about. That are just obsessed with the user experience and less focused on drive metrics, drive revenue.\n\n(01:07:24):\nAnd I'm curious, just where do you think this goes? What's your take on this trend? Why isn't every company thinking this way? Or is this just like, \"We don't know if this is a good idea in the end?\" So what's your take on this cohort of just like, \"We're just going to build the best possible product and hope it all works out,\"?\n\nJosh Miller (01:07:41):\nYeah. Well, I'll say first, I love those products, or many of those products you mentioned. There's some I haven't really used. But, for example, our company runs on Linear, and has run on Linear since day one. So, I'm a big fan of that. So, the way that we think about it is ... So, I actually spent two years at a venture capital firm as an investor, called Thrive Capital. They've invested in Slack and GitHub and a lot of really transformative companies. But I was an investor there. I was a venture capitalist. It even feels weird to say that. And I learned a lot. A lot. A lot. A lot from that experience. It has made me, I think, a better CEO and a better product leader. And one of the things I learned is different ideas, product ideas, business ideas, company ideas come with different attributes and things that will matter to their success.\n\n(01:08:34):\nAnd so, when thinking about starting The Browser Company and picking this category of software, Hursch and I were incredibly intentional about what that would mean for what would need to matter for our company. And so, if you think about the web browser category, traditionally ... I'm not saying forward facing, I'm not saying it is what we are doing. But, if you were to look backwards and take The Browser Company out of it, and look at the web browser category, you'd notice a few things. The first is, it's actually one of the most consumer pieces of software out there. People forget that. That's the opportunity to us. If you ask someone in the street, \"What's your web browser? What do you think?\" They either won't know or they won't care, \"[inaudible 01:09:15]. I don't know.\"\n\n(01:09:16):\nBut what pieces of software do your parents, do your little nieces and nephews and you use? What's at the center of that Venn diagram? Your parents hopefully don't use TikTok and Instagram, or probably don't. Your nieces and nephews, I hope don't have a reason for email at the tender age of 16, or a calendar. And a web browser's one of the few things in the middle. So it's an incredibly universal piece of software consumer, unlike very few other things outside of a smartphone and messaging, and maybe video calling in 2023 and a web browser. So, it's very consumer, very universal.\n\n(01:09:52):\nThe second attribute is, it's a commodity. I'm not saying that Arc is a commodity or we want it to be, but objectively web browsers are interchangeable. They all do the same thing. Increasingly, they're literally just carbon copies of the exact same code chromium, with little tweaks, little tweaks around the edges. So, they're all the same. It's a commodity market. And they're unbelievably lucrative. Browsers print cash. There is a reason why they're owned primarily by Google, Apple and Microsoft. They're incredibly high margin, they're incredibly lucrative. Low marginal costs. The cost of revenue is incredibly low, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n(01:10:30):\nSo we have a product that everyone in the world uses, where they're all identical, essentially, interchangeable commodities. And if you can get people to use it, you're going to print money. So, the attributes of that business and that product category mean, you have to win on how much do people love your product and feel an emotional connection to it, and choose your brand, your product over the other, almost not rationally, but emotionally. And so, if you tie that back to everything I've said before, bingo! That is what we want to work on. That's what we want. We want to create emotional connection with people. We're creating that emotional connection with as many people as possible and delighting them with surprises and animations, is the way you win. It's not romantic, it is practical. In many ways it's capitalistic. This is how we win this market if you want to think about it that way.\n\n(01:11:30):\nSo, the reason I hesitate to answer your question directly is, I don't think that applies to every category of software. And to be totally honest, I don't know enough about the ticketing space or the calendaring space or the whatever other space to know, honestly, off the cuff, if that approach is good for those industries. As a human being, at the other end, I'm really grateful that they picked some reason to do it, whether or not it is part of their business strategy or not. It's a really wonderful trend as a human at the other end that cares about feelings. But I would say, we actually think about it not as a, \"We're focusing on the user experience over revenue or growth.\" We, in fact, picked a category of software we're focusing on brand and user experience is how you get growth and revenue.\n\n(01:12:14):\nAnd, because we knew that this is who we are, and if we were building cybersecurity software that you sell to government agencies, they are not going to give a shit about rounded edges, or what color the button is, or how surprised you feel with every member update. So, we didn't build cybersecurity software to sell to the government. So, I hope that more people build things at the craft bar of something like Linear, but that's how we think about it, is less of a \"this versus that,\" and more \"could we pick something we're going to work on, where that's how you win.\"\n\nLenny (01:12:48):\nI think that's a really powerful insight, that for consumer software especially, and for commoditized consumer software especially, experience is a differentiator. You need to give people a reason to even try it, and then end up sticking with it when there's awesome alternatives. And so, just an obsession with the experience is a really smart strategy. If you get that right, people use it and continue to use it and you win.\n\nJosh Miller (01:13:13):\nI've seen this with a lot of ... And COVID is, I'm sure everyone listening, has a lot of the remote-work collaboration tools. A lot of them obsess, to their credit, over really interesting design details and product feature concepts that were imaginative and brought people together in new ways. And then the latency of the video of the audio audio was horrible, because they relied on some third-party API that was significantly worse than Zoom. And so, that's a great example where in that market, that category software, you better nail latency. I think a great example of this ... One of my favorite products these days, but past years is Tuple. It's ostensibly a paired programming tool that just lives in your menu bar. I'm not paired program with anyone. It is the fastest way to talk to someone at your company. And they have an unbelievably simple user experience.\n\n(01:14:00):\nThe designer, based in Lyon, France, is incredible. It's a beautifully designed product. And it is the best audio quality I have ever experienced in a communication tool. Better than Zoom. So, that exact same product with all their craft details, sand latency, not going to do it. But also Tuple wouldn't have beat a lot of the other competitors for me if it wasn't unbelievably beautiful and easy and simple to use as well. So again, I think it's like, what are the attributes you need to win and picking a market that the ones that you want to excel at and work on, are key to that.\n\nLenny (01:14:34):\nAnd also how much better you need to be. Like, if there's a 20% better than Chrome product, people are just going, \"That's fine. I don't need to learn something new and everyone's using something else. I'm just going to have all these problems.\" So, you got to be significantly better. And that's a high bar for consumer products. Final question I wanted to touch on. You talked about the big vision for Arc and The Browser Company. And you mentioned this idea of the internet computer. And this is another question Scott Belsky suggested. By the way, Scott is the CPO of Adobe and just an awesome product-thinker person. And he just wanted to make sure that we touch on this, because I think there's a big idea here that maybe people don't realize. So, if you could just give us a brief overview of, what is just the actual vision and plan for The Browser Company and Arc, long term as a final question?\n\nJosh Miller (01:15:19):\nYeah. So, we call it The Browser Company of New York almost as a misdirection, because as you know from the intro, we view Arc as a replacement for your default web browser, but we're hoping it will be much more. And so, to start at the highest level and bring it down to reality, one of the things that I've done many times in my career already is underestimate pretty foundational changes in how we use technology. I've appreciated them but underestimated them. Great example is mobile. I think me and Hursh's first company would've been much more successful if we really appreciated the tidal wave that was mobile. And I think one of those macro trends we're underestimating right now is the shift to cloud computing. The shift to the internet, which may sound weird because every big public company mentions Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. You hear about cloud, cloud, cloud and cloud. But again, that's this business term.\n\n(01:16:13):\nWhat I mean by the shift to cloud computing is, everything in our technology, in our computing lives is moving to the internet. It has been moving, but it's going to move even more. And what I mean by that is, your applications are almost all today web-based, internet-based applications. And they will all be soon. There's very, very few pieces of truly local-only software or even local-first software left. All of our files are moving to the internet, if they're not all already there. So if you really think about your files today, and again you ignore the word \"files,\" the stuff you need for work in your personal life. They're not sitting on your desktop, they're all URLs. It may be an air quote \"PDF,\" but that PDF is probably out on Dropbox somewhere and you're accessing it as a URL.\n\n(01:17:03):\nYour photos may seem like they're on your iPhone. They're not on your iPhone, they're on some iCloud server somewhere. When you get a new iPhone, they'll be right there. The manifestation of that actually is, if you smash your device that you're listening to this on right now, whether it's a phone or computer, other than being sad that you lost the resale value and there's a chore of replacing it and a cost of replacing it, you would not lose any of your stuff. So, imagine in five years our entire computing lives are not on our devices, on our computers, on our phones. They're out there somewhere. They're out in the internet, they're out in the cloud, which begs the question ... I remember when I was 10 and I got my first computer. It was a see-through iMac. And I wonder ... My son is two. When he's 10, what will his computer be?\n\n(01:17:52):\nAnd I mean computer not in the technical ... Again, going back to words and the words that we use. I don't mean computer in the literal sense of my MacBook Air, but computer in the human sense of, what you need from your computer, your stuff, your applications and tools that people ... Where is that going to be? Where is his computer going to be? I think it's obvious at this point that we're going to have airflow computers everywhere. We already do. My car has CarPlay, my TV is a computer, my laptop is a computer. I think that's going to be even more true in five years, where hardware is commoditizing. And it will commoditize even more. They're becoming empty shells that don't have anything on it. They're just vessels. They're just interfaces to viewing our real computer, which is out there on the internet somewhere. And so, our view is that what we are building at The Browser Company is an internet computer, is a air quote \"computer,\" where the move to the internet and move to the cloud accelerates and continues the tsunami as much as we think it will.\n\n(01:18:57):\nAnd the way we represent that is, we say we want to be to the web browser, what the iPhone was to the cell phone. Yes. The iPhone replaced your cell phone, but it really was something much more. And so, we want Arc to be the iPhone for the internet, and that yes, it replaces your default browser. But whether or not we call it the internet computer or something else, it really is that interface, this new type of computer. If you play that one step forward, then what we're building today is, we're building our equivalent of multi-touch gestures and the first party-notes app. But, on any new computer, any computer or computing device, the developer platform itself is much more interesting and lucrative and world changing than the first-party computer itself. And so, we have no doubt that in the next decade, if we're successful, if we still exist, Arc as a development platform is going to be much more central to what we're doing, building on top of these internet computers, ours and others than anything else.\n\n(01:20:00):\nSo to bring that down from reality. If you think about it, the internet, the web, is really the best development platform out there in many ways. It is accessible on every single device. It doesn't matter who makes it or the shape and size. It is free to access for individuals. You don't need money to access it. It's free for developers. You don't have to pay a license to use it. There's no 30% tax on what you make. And it's democratic. The best frameworks can win. And so, in many ways, if you were to say, \"Hey, in this future we want to see, what is the platform that we should be developing on top of, what has the best attributes?\" The web has that. And that's why you're seeing today. Why do you think Figma is in the web browser?\n\n(01:20:41):\nWhy do you think Figma's blog post was \"Meet us in the Web Browser\"? Because as the development platform, developers cross platform in one click. There's no tax. Everyone should want to and wants to make for the web. The challenge, though, is there's an experience gap. Native software feels better for whatever reason. And the problem is the people that control our interfaces to this development platform that is the web, that is the internet, have incentives to keep it from being as good as local software, from truly native, immersive software. Apple? They don't want you making web apps or applications for the web. They want you making them for the Mac and the iPhone so they can taxi you when you do it through the app store. And also surprisingly, Google doesn't want you making stuff, more native and immersive for the air quote \"Web,\" because they want it to be indexed by their search engine.\n\n(01:21:37):\nSo, there's a reason that the Chrome extension platform is one of the most underutilized opportunities. They view it as a loss leader. They built chrome extensions just so they could have parity with Firefox. They don't want you making extensions, because you have some immersive extension experience that's not something that you could index in Google. And that's taking away from doing searches. And so, I think we look at this and say, everything is heading to the internet, which means we need interfaces to the internet that are truly more robust than a browser, that are more of a computer. And if we do that, then the most interesting opportunity on top of that is actually the things other people were built on top of this development platform. And if you look at this development platform, which exists today, the worldwide web, the open internet, what is missing is an interface and a set of capabilities and APIs to make web-based experiences as immersive and rich and powerful as native experiences, which require that interface to the internet to provide those.\n\n(01:22:34):\nAnd our interfacers to the internet today are the web browser companies. They have perverse business model incentives as big public companies that have lost the soul of the founders, that they don't want to do that. They don't want to do that. So it doesn't mean we're going to do it. And in fact one of them may win. And I actually think that this is something [inaudible 01:22:51]. We're trying to sell anyone in our vision. We feel fully confident there are going to be many types of internet computers and Arc may or may not be one of them. But we feel very confident that that is the future and the development platform on top of the web and the internet, and these new interfaces will be the most exciting opportunity.\n\nLenny (01:23:09):\nMy next question was going to be how do you make money with a browser, which people get for free, really well? And now it makes a lot more sense where y'all are going. And so, with that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nJosh Miller (01:23:26):\nReady.\n\nLenny (01:23:27):\nOkay. So, ready? What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nJosh Miller (01:23:34):\nHarold and the Purple Crayon, Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees, which is a book about Robert Irwin. That's my number one PM book. So, if you're asking from the perspective of the disciplines of people listening, that book is absolutely fantastic. And then God Saved Texas by Lawrence Wright, who's one of my favorite authors, who if you're interested in road trips, politics, food, culture. So, three very different types of books.\n\nLenny (01:23:58):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nJosh Miller (01:24:01):\nThe first TV show episode I've cried from in recent memories, episode three of The Last of Us. I thought I was watching a zombie violence thing and I just was sitting there bawling. So that one. And then I've been re-watching all of the Adam Curtis documentaries on YouTube. I'm a huge Adam Curtis fan.\n\nLenny (01:24:20):\nI have not heard of Adam Curtis. I will have to go check that out.\n\nJosh Miller (01:24:23):\nHyper-normalization is my favorite. And I would view his work as less non-fictional documentaries and more video art.\n\nLenny (01:24:32):\nThere's been a meme of everyone saying White Lotus is the show to watch. And I feel like it's about to transition to Last of Us. And so we will see how that goes.\n\nJosh Miller (01:24:40):\nCan I get it first? Was I the first guest to say it?\n\nLenny (01:24:43):\nI think you might be actually. I forget, but I think you might be.\n\nJosh Miller (01:24:45):\nAll right. Well, I'll say episode three, specifically.\n\nLenny (01:24:47):\nYeah. Yeah. Absolutely. People love that one. But every episode's awesome. Next question. Favorite interview question you like to ask people when you're interviewing them?\n\nJosh Miller (01:24:56):\nWhat would you like to ask me? That seems like a non-answer, but my interviews at Browser Company are all, \"Ask me anything,\" and I find what people ask, and how they follow up, is as revealing about who they are and what they care about than anything I could ask them.\n\nLenny (01:25:12):\nWhat is it that you look for in an answer that tells you, okay, this is a good candidate?\n\nJosh Miller (01:25:17):\nAuthenticity, probably more than anything else. Do they really believe what they're saying?\n\nLenny (01:25:21):\nAwesome. What are some SASS products that your company uses and loves, other than ... ? I don't know if you consider our SASS, but probably not. So, yeah.\n\nJosh Miller (01:25:29):\nI want to plug Tuple. I think I'm going to put everything on Tuple, relative to ... We run on Notion, we love Notion, we love Linear. But I'd say the closet hit that I just cannot believe is not a hundred times larger company is Tuple. It is ostensibly a pair programming tool, but don't go in with that mindset. Go in with, \"I need to talk to a colleague right now,\" or \"a couple of colleagues right now, to do some work together,\" and it is absolutely fantastic.\n\nLenny (01:25:58):\nI love it. I love these products I've never heard of that are super cool. We will link to that. Next question. What's something relatively minor you've changed in how you build product, that has had a significant impact in your team's ability to ship and execute?\n\nJosh Miller (01:26:11):\nThis past January, a couple months ago, we have started removing me from a lot of the product development process, which seems to be really healthy. So, that has been the big shift this year.\n\nLenny (01:26:22):\nThat's a big transition. I went through that at Airbnb and it's great. It's great for everyone. Final question. Best pro-tip for using Arc, that people may not be aware of?\n\nJosh Miller (01:26:32):\nTry your best to not think of it as a browser. And have a beginner's mind about how it works and how you might use the internet.\n\nLenny (01:26:40):\nWhoa! Big idea.\n\nJosh Miller (01:26:42):\nYeah. Big takeaway from this conversation, we got to get much better at describing what the heck we built. And why it's good for you. So, I'm not proud of my first or last answer, but it is what it is.\n\nLenny (01:26:54):\nAnd, actually, I mentioned this in the intro and if you listen to this already, you probably heard it already, but we're going to link ... In the show notes, we'll have a link to actually get into Arc, because right now it's wait-listed and we have this link that will get you straight into Arc. And so go check it out. Josh, you've shown up with heartfelt intensity. I feel like I want to go apply for a job at The Browser Company now. But you're not hiring product managers, so I'm not going to do that. Just kidding. Thank you so much for being here, for being so genuine and insightful and warm. And thank you.\n\nJosh Miller (01:27:29):\nThank you so much, Lenny. I really enjoyed this.\n\nLenny (01:27:33):\nThank you so much for listening.
