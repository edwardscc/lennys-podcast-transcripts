Prasanna\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nThere's a lot of talk about productivity gains through AI. There's this camp of people that are so overhyped, nothing's working, nobody's actually adopting this at scale.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:00:07):\nWe see a significant amount of games. We find engineering teams that are very, very AI forward are reporting about eight to 10 hours save per week. Whenever I hear a stat like this, I think an important element is this is the worst it will ever be. This is now the baseline. The truth is the value is changing every day, so you need to ride that wave along with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):\nThere's a story I heard you share on a different podcast where there's an engineer who has Goose watching.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:00:31):\nYou'll be talking to a colleague on Slack or an email, and they'll be discussing some feature that they think is useful to implement. Now a few hours later, he'll find that Goose has already tried to build that feature and opened a PR for it on Git.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):\nWhat level of engineer is most benefiting from these tools?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:00:47):\nWhat's been surprising and really amazing, the non-technical people using AI agents and programming tools to build things, the people that are able to embrace it to optimize for their particular workday and their particular set of tasks are really showing the most impact from these tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):\nHow do you think things will look in a couple of years in terms of how engineers work that's different from today?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:01:12):\nAll these LLMs are sitting idle overnight and on weekends, while humans aren't there. There's no need for that. They should be working all the time. They should be trying to build in anticipation of what we want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:24):\nWhat's maybe the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building products or building teams?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:01:29):\nA lot of engineers think that code quality is important to building a successful product. The two have nothing to do with each other.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:37):\nToday my guest is Dhanji Prasanna. Dhanji is Chief Technology Officer at Block, where he oversees a team of over 3,500 people. With Dhanji's leadership, Block has become one of the most AI-native large companies in the world and has basically achieved what many eng and product leaders are trying to achieve within their companies.\n\n(00:01:55):\nIn our conversation, we chat about their internal open source agent called Goose, that by their measure is saving employees on average eight to 10 hours a week of work time, and that number is going up, how AI specifically making their teams more productive and the teams that are benefiting most. Interestingly, it's not the engineering team, what it took to shift the culture to be very AI-oriented, the very boring change they made internally that boosted productivity even more than any AI tool.\n\n(00:02:24):\nAlso, lessons from building Google Wave and Google Plus and Cash app and so much more. This episode is for anyone curious to see what a highly AI-forward technology-driven large company looks like and can act like.

Here's the thing about digital customer communications. Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes, or account alerts, you need them to reach users reliably, that's where Sinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses, including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally use Sinch's API to build messaging, email and calling into their products.\n\n(00:03:38):\nAnd there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about. Rich Communication Services or RCS. Think of RCS as SMS 2.0. Instead of getting texts from a random number, your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new. It's a more secure and branded experience, plus you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies, and here's why this matters. US carriers are starting to adopt RCS.\n\n(00:04:06):\nSinch is already helping major bands send RCS messages around the world and they're helping Lenny's podcast listeners get registered first before the rush hits the US market.

When I was a PM at Airbnb, I still remember when Figma came out and how much it improved how we operated as a team.\n\n(00:04:35):\nSuddenly, I could involve my whole team in the design process, give feedback on design concepts really quickly, and it just made the whole product development process so much more fun. But Figma never felt like it was for me. It was great for giving feedback and designs, but as a builder, I wanted to make stuff. That's why Figma built Figma Make. With just a few prompts, you can make any idea or design into a fully functional prototype or app that anyone can iterate on and validate with customers.\n\n(00:05:02):\nFigma Make is a different kind of vibe coding tool, because it's all in Figma. You can use your team's existing design building blocks, making it easy to create outputs that look good and feel real and are connected to how your team builds. Stop spending so much time telling people about your product vision and instead show it to them. Make code back prototypes and apps fast with Figma Make. Check it out at figma.com/lenny. Dhanji, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:05:34):\nThank you Lenny. It's a great pleasure to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:37):\nI want to start with a letter that I hear you wrote to Jack Dorsey to convince him that he and that Block needed to take AI a lot more seriously. I think you called it your AI manifesto and it seems like it really worked. We're going to talk a lot about the changes that came as a result of that. So let me just ask, what did you say in this letter and what happened right after you sent that letter to him?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:06:00):\nSo about two and a half years ago or so, Jack really felt like things needed to change. I think he had a sense that the industry was going in a different direction. So he got about 40 of the company's top executives into a room on a weekly basis, and they all used to sort of talk everything through that was going on and he added me to that group.\n\n(00:06:26):\nSo at some point, I observed that we were talking about lots of deep things, lots of relevant things, but no one was really paying attention to AI, and so that's when I wrote that letter. And to be honest, it's I think taken on a life of its own, but there wasn't much to the letter other than I think we should do this. I think we should do it centrally and it's important for us to be ahead of the game and be an AI native company because that's where the industry is heading.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:55):\nLet me just say it's important to note you were not CTO at this point. You were just a senior engineer kind of person?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:07:00):\nNo, yeah, in fact, I was part-time at the time because I had just had a kid and I was coming back in and I was helping out one of the engineering teams and then Jack came over to Sydney and spent two days with me and both of us like long walks. So we walked all around Sydney and talked it through up and down, and then yeah, he offered me the job and I thought it was a great opportunity once in a lifetime, so I took it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:30):\nIt's like be careful what you're good at sort of situation. Okay. So what were some of the bigger changes that you made after Jack is on board and Block execs are on board of are, \"Cool, this is completely right. We need to go much bigger and think much more deeply about how AI is changing, how we build and how we should build.\" Or some of the bigger changes that you made from a perspective of other companies listening to this, trying to think about what they should be doing?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:07:53):\nAt the start, my main focus was to get block to think like a technology company. And for a long time we had had a little bit of, I'm going to call it identity drift, maybe. We were talking about ourselves as a financial services company. Some people called us FinTech, all of this stuff. But when I started working at what was then known as Square, we were always thought of as a technology company just like Google or Facebook or any of the others.\n\n(00:08:25):\nAnd so I wanted to get us back to that. And so the first thing I did was to try and institute a number of programs that focused on that. So everything from getting the top ICs in the company together to talk to each other, to starting a whole bunch of special projects. So we got about two to five engineers per project. There were about eight or nine different projects and we had reinstituted, the company-wide hack week.\n\n(00:08:55):\nAnd so all of this just kind of created a little bit of a spark of, \"Hey, we're building technology again, we're trying to push the frontier again.\" And that's how it started, and then there were a whole number of steps after that where we went from a GM structure to a functional org structure, which was I think the key to making our transformation into being more of an AI-native company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:19):\nOkay, talk more about that. What does that mean? What does that look like? Why is that so important?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:09:23):\nAbsolutely. So when we were in our mature phase, so when Square was working quite well, it was a very large business, and then we had started Cash App and that also followed suit. We had spun them out almost as what we call a GM structure. So they were effectively run as a portfolio of independent companies and they had their own CEOs who all reported to Jack and it was still one single executive team, but they had separate engineering practices, they had separate design teams.\n\n(00:10:00):\nThey were kind of separate in almost every way except for some shared resources like our foundational resources like legal and some platforms and things like that. So I think that that was very useful for us for the stage of company that we were in, but when you really want to go deep in technology, when you really want to connect with these things that are industry changing events that are happening, you need a singular focus, and we changed the organization.\n\n(00:10:32):\nSo all engineers report into one single team now, all designers report into one single team and there's single head of engineering, single head of design, et cetera. And so that was the big transformation that we made, and that meant we could really drive forward AI, we could drive forward platform and just technical depth generally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:51):\nFor companies that are struggling with this potentially or trying to figure out how to do this, two things I'm hearing here is start to see yourself as a technology company. It doesn't necessarily apply to every company, but seems like an important element is like we're building technology, we're not a financial company, we're not a real estate company, we're not a technology company. And then two is organize the team such that say engineers report up to an engineering leader versus a GM who maybe doesn't understand engineering as well or doesn't take it as seriously as they should.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:11:19):\nYeah, I think that's pretty much what we did. And not to lean too heavily on this, but this is what jobs did when he came back to Apple as well. He reorganized Apple to be functional, and it wasn't like we were following a playbook. We discovered this as we were investigating what it's going to take to make these teams more tech-focused and to bring our DNA back to our roots, which really was putting engineering and design first, which is what technology first means to me. So yeah, I would say to companies, find your DNA and really try to optimize for what that is in a very simple and clear way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):\nOkay, so you made a bunch of changes, you had this manifesto, everyone's on board, you made a bunch of changes. Functional technology first, comparing the way that your say engineering team works today versus two or three years ago, what is most different?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:12:13):\nNot everyone was on board, I'll tell you that. It was quite a painful transformation. I think that one of the things that I learned the most throughout this process is that Conway's Law can be really, really powerful. So it's the law that basically says you ship your org structure. So what you're organized as in terms of teams, in terms of collaborating groups and your operating model matters a lot to what you build.\n\n(00:12:45):\nAnd so I think that that was essentially the biggest change is we had a lot of momentum in each of these silos, be it Cash App, be it Afterpay, be it Square or even TIDAL or music streaming service. And no one was really talking to each other, no one was really aligned on technical strategy on what we even wanted to be five years from now as a collective team. And so all those things are different now. I'm not saying it's perfect, there's still a long road ahead of us, but we at least speak the same language.\n\n(00:13:24):\nWe're all have access to the same tools, we share the same policies. So a certain level of senior engineer means the same thing across the whole company. People can move from one team to another's into an area of need. All of these things are very different. But to sum it up, I would say we're technically focused and we're focused on advancing technical excellence as a goal. And that just really wasn't that true two to three years ago. There were other things we were optimizing for then.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:58):\nMaybe going one level deeper in terms of how people actually work at a day. So if you're looking at an engineering team, say the average engineering team and maybe also the top most optimal engineering team, how is the way they work today different from a couple of years ago?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:14:12):\nIn the small, certain teams that are very, very AI natives or teams that are building AI first everywhere are working much differently than before because they're using vibe code tools and they're essentially building without writing lines of code by hand, and that just wasn't true through the three years ago. I don't think it was true anywhere in the world. So that's dramatically different in teams that are still working with very heavy legacy code bases.\n\n(00:14:47):\nIt's less true, but they're also encountering these background AI processes. So we have these tools that run 24/7 or run in the CI pipeline and they're analyzing vulnerabilities. They're looking at even bugs filed on tickets and trying to build patches while engineers are asleep. So they come in the next day and look at it. So I would say there are a number of ways in which they're different, but different teams have adapted in different ways depending on how close they are to the tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:25):\nOkay, so let me lean into that AI piece, which is I think where you guys are most ahead of a lot of other companies. You guys built your own agent I think is how you describe Goose. So there's a lot of talk about productivity gains through AI. There's this camp of people are like, you don't understand how much productivity there is to gain from AI. It's the future, this is the way it's all going to work.\n\n(00:15:46):\nWe're all accelerating 10X. There's also this camp where people are like, I'm so overhyped, nothing's working. People talk about it. All these pilots are failing. Nobody's actually adopting this at scale. I feel like you're probably in that first camp. What sort of gains have you seen practically from AI tools on your teams?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:16:03):\nOur number one priority is through automate Block, which means getting AI and getting AI forms of automation through our entire company. And we feel that that's just at the beginning of where the utility is with all these large language models, and I think we're going to continue to see that improve. But even now, we find engineering teams that are very, very AI forward that are using Goose every day are reporting about eight to 10 hours saved per week, and this is self-reported. And then we also have a number of check metrics to try and validate that.\n\n(00:16:45):\nSo we look at PRs, we look at throughput of features, we look at a whole bunch of things and we have our data scientists come up with a complicated formula that tries to distill it all into something meaningful. And we feel across the whole company, we're probably trending towards 20 to 25% of manual hours saved. And I think that's just the start of all of this. I do feel that the more AI-native companies are doing a better job of realizing this.\n\n(00:17:17):\nSo companies that started just with AI startups mostly, but there is some truth to this notion that AI isn't a panacea and it's growing as well in capability. So you need to ride that wave along with it. And I think a lot of the companies aren't realizing this. They're like, \"Well, where's the value?\" And the truth is the value is changing every day. And so you need to be adaptable and look at what the value is today and plan for what the value will be tomorrow and then slowly expand to the areas where it's most efficacious.\n\n(00:17:54):\nI'll give you an example. One area in which we find that it's really good is for non-technical teams to be able to build little software tools for themselves. So this has been one of the most surprising and energizing uses of Goose within Block is we'll have our enterprise risk management team build a whole system for self-servicing enterprise risk, and this is compressing weeks of work into hours, or ordinarily, they would be waiting for an internal apps team or something to go and build that and they would put that on their Q2 roadmap and everyone would be twiddling their thumbs until it all clicked into place, but now you can just go and do it.\n\n(00:18:42):\nAnd so a lot of these kinds of use cases we're seeing an enormous amount of productivity gain in the other area, which I'm really excited about is we have this other tool called Gosling, which is a goose for mobile effectively. So it operates your Android OS at a native level using the accessibility API. And we use that for automating UI tests.\n\n(00:19:09):\nSo before, you would have to hire an army of contractors or QAs who would go and click through every screen, but now we can just bake those into automated tests and then give you a report at the end. So we're seeing a lot of advantages in those types of areas, but where you have a lot of depth and a lot of really strong people come together is where AI, I think still underperforms humans. And that's something that's probably going to get better over time, but it's also something where we should lean into as humans.\n\n(00:19:45):\nSo when you have some very senior engineers and they're thinking about things like architecture and design and race conditions, orchestration, things like this, that's still an area where AI isn't quite there. And so I think the companies that aren't feeling the success in AI are trying to just throw these tools at their giant code bases and hoping good things will happen, and that's not how it's playing out. Eventually, I do think it'll get there, but right now we're still in the early utility phase.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:18):\nHoly moly, there's so much there in what you just shared. There's like five things I want to follow up on. Okay, so one is this metric you kind of alluded to, which is how you measure the impact of AI in your team. So it was human manual hours saved, is that how you describe it?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:20:35):\nThat's correct. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:36):\nSo it's roughly a fourth of an engineer's time currently is being saved by AI tooling.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:20:43):\nThat metric is across all teams. So that would be our support teams, our legal teams, our risk teams, all of them together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:51):\nWow.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:20:52):\nAnd then on the engineering side, it's very variable because like I said before, it matters how big and how complex the code base is. And so if you're building a totally new Greenfields code base or you're building an app for a new platform, then we're seeing those pretty aggressive gains, but in very complex code bases that already exist, those gains are not quite there yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:18):\nThat's amazing. And whenever I hear a stat like this, I think an important element that people need to think about is this is the worst it will ever be. This is the lowest, this is now the baseline. And so it may not sound that crazy yet, but it's going to get crazy. Okay, the other thing that you talked about is Goose, you haven't explained what Goose is. This is a huge deal. Explain what Goose is and how important this has become to you guys.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:21:49):\nSo Goose is a general purpose AI agent. So you can think of it as a desktop tool or a program that you can download and install on your computer and then it has a UI. You can talk to it just like a chatbot and you can say anything from, \"Hey Goose, organize my photos by category, and it has the ability to look within your photos and if there are a lot of trees, it'll organize them as nature photos. And there are a lot of people, it'll organize them as portraiture.\" All of this sort of stuff to writing software for you.\n\n(00:22:30):\nSo it can do all of these tasks, and the way we've been able to do this is through something called a model context protocol or the MCP, which a lot of your listeners might've heard. And this is something that Anthropic came up with that we were a very early contributor to. And the model context protocol is very simply just a set of formalized wrappers around existing tools or existing capabilities. So if you have tools that you use in the enterprise, be it Salesforce or be it Snowflake or SQL, any of these things, you can wrap them in the MCP and then it exposes them to your LLM to be able to manipulate.\n\n(00:23:16):\nSo until that point, the LLMs were not really able to do much other than chat, but Goose gives these brains arms and legs to go out and act in our digital world, and that's where we find it's had most impact and it's built on this fairly open protocol that anyone can implement. There have been an explosion of MCPs. Goose is entirely open source, by the way, so any of you can download it and extend it, write your own MCPs, and that's been our core successes through Goose.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:54):\nOkay. So essentially like Claude code with a UI, desktop app sort of thing built on top of Claude and OpenAI ChatGPT and a bunch of open source models. Is that right?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:24:06):\nYeah, it can use any model. So we have a pluggable provider system and you can either bring your own API keys and use the Claude family models or OpenAI's family models, or you can use open source models and you can download them and use them directly or via Ollama and other, there are several tools that help you do that, but essentially it's taking the capability of these models to generate text and to interpret text and applying them to real world situations.\n\n(00:24:42):\nSo one example that I really like is you can ask Goose to go and build your marketing report and it has MCPs to connect to Snowflake and Tableau and Looker. So it'll write SQL to pull out data from there, it'll do some analysis and a CSV so it can write Python code on your desktop to do all that. It will generate some graphs using some JavaScript charting library that it knows about.\n\n(00:25:11):\nAnd then finally, it'll put this all into a PDF or Google Doc or whatever and it can even email it for you or upload it somewhere. And it's doing all of this on its own, by the way. No one's sitting here telling it that, you're just saying, \"Hey, I want this report, I want this emailed here, I want these pretty charts.\" And it's orchestrating across all these systems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:31):\nSo essentially at Block, instead of using Claude or ChatGPT directly or even Cursor and all these apps, they use Goose?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:25:40):\nYeah, we allow our engineers and our general employee population to use any tools that they want. Goose is the one that's most well-integrated into all of our systems because it's built on the MCP and it's so easy to create an MCP for an existing system. So for example, if you're using a issue tracking tool and you want some AI automation added to it, before Goose, our teams would have to wait for the vendor to build that AI capability in there, or maybe there's some way in which OpenAI or Anthropic or Google would provide a general purpose capability where we could plug those in. But with Goose, that's no longer necessary with a few lines of code that an MCP represents. All these systems are orchestratable with AI basically overnight, and Goose can write its own MCPs. So it's pretty bootstrappable as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):\nAnd this is open source and basically you've spent all this time building this thing, any other company can now implement it and build on all the work you've done?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:26:51):\nYeah, and we have a lot of companies using Goose pretty actively. I don't want to name too many names, but from our competitors to our close partners, a lot of them are using Goose pretty regularly on their teams. I know Databricks talks about it a lot, but everyone you can think of in this mid-tech tier is using Goose in some form.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:15):\nThat's insane. This feels like it could've been a massive business of its own, some of the fastest growing companies in the world, basically this is their product and you've built it and given away.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:27:23):\nYeah, we believe in the power of open source and one of our core missions is to increase openness, and that means contributing to open protocols and contributing to open source. And as a tech company, we're built on a lot of open source software. I think pretty much every tech company is whether you're talking about Linux or Java or MySQL or any of these essential components, and so we feel like we have a strong imperative to give back.\n\n(00:27:57):\nWe want to build things that not only are good for us and our customers, but that outlast Block and outgrow Block, that's certainly a core value for us and has been from the beginning even long before this whole AI phase. So yeah, Goose follows in that proud tradition and yeah, we're very excited that its had the success it's had.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:18):\nWhat's the story with the name Goose, by the way? Can't help but ask.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:28:21):\nGoose is a Top Gun reference. So our engineer that came up with it. He also looks exactly like Goose, so it's kind of crazy if you put them side to side, he's going to be really embarrassed with my sharing this, but that's the reason why they call it Goose, and then we lent into the whole bird theme after that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:41):\nThat's incredible. There's a story I heard you share on a different podcast where there's an engineer who takes this to the extreme and has Goose watch him. Talk about that, share that story.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:28:50):\nYeah, absolutely. So he is very, very AI-focused and he's trying to extract all these crazy ideas from Goose and Goose can do all of the things that I described through specific interactions with tools, but it can also just watch your screen so it understands how to process images and process the things that it's looking at through screenshots. And so he built this system where it's essentially just watching everything he does all the time and he'll be talking to a colleague on Slack or an email and they'll be discussing some feature that they think is useful to implement.\n\n(00:29:30):\nAnd then a few hours later he'll find that Goose has already tried to build that feature and opened a PR for it on Git and all sorts of other wacky things like that. So it'll try to nudge him out of a workflow. If he's running over on a meeting and he's late for something else, it comes up with these creative things that he didn't program or he didn't write prompts for, but that it thinks will help him improve his productivity or improve his work day. So yeah, it's pretty crazy. You have to have the stomach for it to be that level of tied into your working tools, but it kind of shows you what's possible with tools like this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:14):\nClearly this is where things are going. Once this gets good enough, I love this guy is just trying it. So it's basically watching him work and anticipating what he should be doing and does the work for him as a first draft so that he's like, \"Oh, the PR is already done on this thing. We were just talking about it at this meeting.\" That's incredible.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:30:31):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:32):\nHow good is it? Where's it at? If you had to go zero to a hundred of like, \"Okay, going to, all you have to do is now think and talk and that'll just do your job.\"\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:30:41):\nYeah, so voice is the other big part of it. It has voice processing capability, so it's always listening to what he's saying as well and trying to interpret that. I would say that this is mostly an experiment, given that he's on our core Goose team and he contributes to Goose, so he has a day job. This is a kind of thing on the side that he was developing.\n\n(00:31:04):\nSo once this evolves into more of a native feature of Goose itself or other tools that we use in the enterprise, I think it can have a lot of legs, but it's already pretty good. It's probably cutting down enormous amounts of busy work that he has to do. So for example, one thing he'll do is he'll say, \"Oh, I have a meeting conflict. I can't make it that time, or I have to go pick up my kid.\"\n\n(00:31:32):\nAnd Goose will automatically reschedule that meeting without him ever sitting in front of his calendar and clicking through 10 times. Yeah, so these are things that I think we were waiting for the calendar vendor to build as features into calendar, but we don't need to do that anymore because AI is able to orchestrate this for us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):\nThis isn't that guy that had four jobs at four different startups that he was able to paralyze all his work and hire people.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:31:58):\nNo, it's not. He's someone that I've worked with for a long time and he's been at Block for a long time. He just loves experimenting and he embodies that culture of experimentation just like our creator of Goose who did the same thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:16):\nSo let me pull on that thread a little bit. You're kind of seeing a glimpse of where things are going. You're very ahead of the curve in a lot of ways at Block. How do you think things will look in a couple of years in terms of how engineers work, how product teams work that's different from today?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:32:32):\nI think a lot of it is dependent on the improvement of LLM performance, but I can tell you the way I'm trying to change how I work and how I'm trying to change our immediate team's way of working. So I think vibe coding has been an interesting, exciting thing, which is you talk to a chatbot essentially and it goes and builds software for you, but I think this is highly limiting.\n\n(00:32:59):\nIt's very ping pong. You do something, you wait for three or four minutes and it comes back with something sort of half-baked and you have to nudge it and guide it and massage it to get where it needs to be. I think that we're going to see much more autonomy. So where we're working on a couple of experiments with Goose, with the next version of Goose where we're really trying to push it to work not just for two or three or five minutes at a time, our median session length is five minutes and on average, seven, but we're trying to push it to hours.\n\n(00:33:36):\nWe're trying to say, \"Hey, all these LLMs are sitting idle overnight and on weekends while humans aren't there, there's no need for that.\" They should be working all the time. They should be trying to build in anticipation of what we want if we go back to the earlier part of the conversation. But also I think that they should be able to build in ways that were never possible before.\n\n(00:34:04):\nBefore as humans, we had limited resources, limited bandwidth, and a lot of coordination overhead. So we would have to choose the best path to try in an experiment, and I don't think we need that anymore. We need instead to be able to describe multiple different experiments in a great amount of detail. And then maybe we go to sleep and then in the morning, all those experiments are built and we can sort of throw away five or six of them.\n\n(00:34:34):\nSo one of the things that I do regularly, so I write code every day, but one of the things that I do regularly is just throw away huge, huge amounts of code, and it's kind of hard for me because I've never done that before. I mean obviously engineers love deleting code, but this is different. You build a whole new system or a whole new feature and you're like, \"Ah, it doesn't feel exactly right. I'm just going to delete and start over.\"\n\n(00:35:00):\nSo I think you're going to see a lot more of that way of working. And I think that you're going to see instead of us, for example, refactoring an app to have a different UI or to evolve into its new version, we're just going to rewrite that app from scratch. And one of the things I'm really pushing our teams to think about is what would our world look like if every single release, RM minus RF deleted the entire app and rebuilt it from scratch? And so we can't really do that today, but I think this shows you some of the direction of what's possible and where these tools are taking us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:42):\nWhat's interesting about that is that there's this common rule in software engineering and just product, don't ever just rewrite. Don't try to rewrite your thing. You're going to forget all of the small improvements and tweaks and bug fixes people have made over the years, and you think it's going to be the simple straightforward thing. It ends up being now it's like a year or more of just getting it back to where it was. And so interesting that AI now can make that possible, and what you're saying is that's actually maybe the way you should be working.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:36:09):\nI think so. And I think that the trick is getting the AI to respect all of those incremental improvements, yeah, and sort of bake those in as a part of the specification, if you will. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:25):\nAlso, the point you made about this agent, just you give it a bunch of ideas that builds them overnight and then you could see, I imagine it goes even further up the stack and comes up with the ideas and then starts building them and then you're like, \"Okay, oh, that was a great idea. Now I can see it immediately in the same workflow.\"\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:36:39):\nYeah, that's true. I was actually literally trying what you're saying just last week. And so I have this new version of Goose that we're working on and I was asking it to come up with ideas to improve itself and implement it overnight. And sometimes-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:57):\nSlip problem.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:36:59):\n... Sometimes it kind of goes off the script entirely and you have to sort of pull it back a bit. So I think we're not quite at that era where it's completely self-improving and completely autonomous, but I do think we're in a transition phase where we can give it that nudge and say, \"Hey, here's my wishlist of 10 things that I wish you could do. Go and figure out the best way to do them.\" And it's successful I would say on 60% of those things, if the features are well enough described and it struggles on the remaining 40 where you have to kind of intervene and massage it. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:43):\nOh man, I'm just imagining this feature where you give it the goal of drive revenue and growth and then it's just like, \"Okay, everyone's fired. Here's your paychecks. I'll take it from here.\"\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:37:56):\nI don't think we're going to be there. I do think we're going to need a lot of human taste to anchor these AIs so they don't go off script to be honest. And that's really where our design lead and our design teams are pushing us to think, and that's a differentiator that I think will push us beyond this era of AI slop that everyone's talking about. So yeah, it's very much anchoring it into a thing that matters to people and the thing that's tasteful and useful and has value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:30):\nTo make that even more concrete, is there an example of something maybe AI was trying to, or a team was trying to pitch where you had to just know this is where humans are going to step in and keep things on track?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:38:43):\nI'd say it was more around things like process automation or a lot of times I'll get this sort of request where a team will say, \"We need to buy this new tool from this vendor because our current tool is entering X, Y and Z.\" Another team will say, \"No, no, no, we can just use Goose to build an app that will do the same thing for us in half the time or less.\" And then as a human, you're sitting there thinking, \"Is any of this necessary? If we just change the process, do we even need to think about building tools?\" And this is the thing that AI isn't good at, it's not able to have this portfolio judgment or judgment across a global sense of what's important and what matters.\n\n(00:39:40):\nSo a lot of times, I tell teams just question the base assumption, particularly our InfoSec teams because they'll twist themselves into knot sometimes trying to secure something and you'll be like, \"We'll just ask the team that's building it to do it differently or to not build that at all if it doesn't matter, and then you won't have to increase your surface area of securing it.\" So I think those are the areas where it's better for a human to use judgment and AI has not done a great job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:11):\nYou make this point about building your own software, your own tools instead of buying stuff. This is a big question with AI, is it's going to replace all these SaaS apps to Salesforce over. Is there a sense of just either how much money you guys have maybe saved building your own stuff, or have you built a new-found respect for the existing SaaS software that everyone's using and pays lots of money for?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:40:31):\nI think there's a trap in getting away from your core purpose as a company. And our core purpose is economic empowerment. So getting customers or merchants or artists the ability to make a sale or pay their rent or upload their latest creation to TIDAL. And I think that anything that serves that purpose, we should encourage and we should invest in, but if we're just purely looking at dollars versus dollars, then that's pulling us off that purpose.\n\n(00:41:12):\nThe savings and costs that there might be in replacing a vendor tool by something you build in-house is probably not worth it in the mental bandwidth that you've lost and the amount of the team's technical focus that's being taken away. So yeah, I would say it just keep coming to the thing that matters to you as a company and then the rest will follow from that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:38):\nYeah, I think people forget just how much maintenance it takes to keep something you've built. Like, \"Okay, cool, we built it in a weekend and now it's years of endless maintenance and requests and support.\" And also to your point, it feels like it comes back to the always motto of just focus on your core competencies and then buy everything else.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:41:57):\nYeah, it's the classic 80/20 problem, and we have that enough with the apps that we build for our customers. We'll build some great experiments that really resonate, and then we have to spend a lot of time ironing out the long tail of problems. So in Cash Card, for example, we built the entire functionality of Cash Card, I would say pretty much in a weekend or maybe a week of integration and work.\n\n(00:42:26):\nAnd then it took a really long time to iron out all these edge cases where someone would tip twice the value of the bill and then it would completely break something in the back end, or people would use it as a gas station and they have a different way of billing your card. So yeah, it's very much that. And to your point, I would always come back to what is the reason we're doing this? Why does it matter to us and to our customers? And if it doesn't clearly satisfy that, I would just push it off as a not interesting thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):\nThis episode is brought to you by Persona, the verified identity platform, helping organizations onboard users fight fraud and build trust. We talk a lot on this podcast about the amazing advances in ai, but this can be a double-edged sword.

One of the biggest parts of the conversation around AI is hiring jobs, things like that. So I have two kind of this two-part question. One is just how has the rise of all these AI tools, this increased productivity impacted the way you plan head counts and hire? And then what do you look for that's different in people you're hiring now that AI is such a big part of the way you guys work?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:44:34):\nI don't think that things have progressed far enough that it's really impacted in a fundamental way how many people you would need to build an app of the scale of Cash App, for example. I think what's changed for us is much different and it has nothing to do with AI, it's what we talked about earlier is moving from our GM structure to a functional structure. And in our GM structure, our incentives were always to think of engineering headcount as a commodity.\n\n(00:45:09):\nAnd so we would just add more engineers if we wanted to build more features and the classic mythical man person month trap or whatever it's called. And I think that moving to a functional structure completely changes that and you're like, \"Well, we can leverage common platforms, common modules, we can bring in experts from across the company to advise us on how better to do this.\"\n\n(00:45:38):\nAnd so those kinds of things I think have made it much different and how we hire and we no longer see engineers as a commodity to just add 100 people to go and build the next product in Cash App. But on the AI side, we're very much looking for people that are embracing these tools and that are eager to try and learn from it. We're not looking for people who are amazing AI practitioners on the get-go.\n\n(00:46:14):\nI think we have those people and we're interested in those people if they ever want to work with us. But I'm much more keen on looking for that college grad who just really is eager to learn about these tools and open to it, or even the veteran who has embraced these tools and figured it out. And that's kind of where we're optimizing for who we look for rather than a specific set of skills.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:44):\nSo essentially the biggest change is just looking for people that are embracing AI, not being like, \"No, I don't need this stuff. I'm an amazing engineer. I don't need to use Cursor or Goose or all these things.\"\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:46:55):\nYeah, a learning mindset is how I would put it. This is something that Jack our CEO talks about a lot is he wants us to be a learning first company. So everything we do, every experiment that we ship, what can we learn from it and did we feel that we gave it our best shot? And I think that that's more important to him than even sort of coming up with the right business answer every time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:25):\nWhat about when you're interviewing? Are you encouraging engineers to use AI tools as they're doing exercises? How did that change over the past year or two?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:47:33):\nYeah, we're starting to do that now. So traditionally we would just use CoderPad or something like that to wipe boards or a problem or even program it in Pseudocode or near Pseudocode. But now we're looking at can you use Vibe code to build something? How comfortable are you with these tools or how are you thinking about evolving with them as well?\n\n(00:48:04):\nBut it's early days yet I would say that it's not clear to me that necessarily how someone knows how to use, be it Goose or Cursor or any of these other tools matters that much to whether they're a good engineer. I still think that things that we interviewed for in the past, a critical mindset, the ability to really understand deeply the technical nature of a problem is still much more important than whether you're a fully AI native programmer or not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:37):\nAnother question that I've always been thinking about a lot of people wonder is what level of engineer is most benefiting from these tools? You could argue it's the junior engineers now, they could just get all this work done. You could argue it's senior engineers because they know so much more about how things work and now they could just orchestrate thousands of agents doing their bidding. What have you seen in terms of which level is benefiting most?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:48:56):\nYeah, so two answers to that. One is you're definitely right that the more senior and the more junior they are, the more comfortable or the more eager they are to adopt these AI tools. And I think that's for a variety of reasons, including some of them that you named. I think the senior people really understand in great depth how everything works.\n\n(00:49:18):\nAnd so they're almost relieved that this tool exists that can go and do all these things that they've done a million times before and couldn't be bothered. And then the junior people are like my niece and nephew on a BlackBerry or something, they're just blitzing through things, not BlackBerry in the early days and iPhones now, they're blitzing through a text message when I'm still seek and destroying through my keyboard, shows you how old I am.\n\n(00:49:50):\nSo I think there's that, but I think the non-technical people using AI agents and programming tools to build things is really what's been surprising and really amazing. And I think that speaks to how these roles are going to evolve in the future. The lines are going to be blurred between whether you're in legal or in risk or in engineering and design even. And so I think that the people that are able to embrace it to optimize for their particular work day and their particular set of tasks are really who are showing the most impact from these tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:36):\nIt's interesting. No one talks about that element of engineering productivity, which is the reduction of asks from all the other parts of the company to build random one-off things. That feels like a huge productivity gain for engineers.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:50:47):\nIt is massive, although I think that it's a little bit like the analogy of if you build a bigger highway, you'll just get more cars on the road. So I think the fact that everyone's building software means that there's more software to be built, more coordination to happen, and everyone's more eager to ship things faster and with greater results. And so we're just seeing an overall uptake in velocity and the ask for more features, if that makes sense. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:22):\nAbsolutely. And it connects to your point about you're not slowing hiring. What I'm hearing is just headcount, hiring desires for more engineers, more product people is not slowing at all. You're basically, it's as if AI wasn't really there.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:51:37):\nWe're being more thoughtful about it. So like I said, we were looking at as a commodity in the GM era, and now that we're functional, it's much less about how many engineers we need as a function of the number of features we have in Square or Cash App and in the functional org structure, we think of it much more as what are the areas of optimization? Where can we build depth and what really accelerates our priorities through things like modularization reuse and going deep into platforms.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:12):\nI love this hot take of if you're trying to be more productive, forget AI, just re-org into a functional structure.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:52:21):\nIt's not wrong in some ways. So here's another really interesting example where we are trying to improve our build times and you were using Goose and a lot of other tools to help us with this too, and they've done remarkable things. So we have this really cool tool that analyzes our test suites and selects the right test to run for changes that were made.\n\n(00:52:50):\nSo we cut down basically 50% of test runs this way, which is pretty great, and we're not warming the planet as much with all these unnecessary CPU cycles being wasted on tests. But then things like offloading tests to the cloud or simply just deleting tests that don't make sense anymore, probably save you two to three times that.\n\n(00:53:14):\nSo there is still a portfolio approach that you need to take for lack of a better term. It's like that example I told you earlier about should we buy a vendor tool? Should we build this in-house? It's like, \"Well, do we even need to do this process at all?\" So in some ways, structure matters more than the efficacy of the tools you have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:34):\nWise words makes me think about Elon has this whole process for optimize stuff and one of the steps is like, \"Do we even need this thing before we start out optimizing and automating it?\" Before I zoom out and ask about just general lessons that you've learned over the course of your career, is there anything else that you think might be really valuable or useful to folks that are trying to lean in further into AI or just help their teams think a little bit more forward thinking?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:54:04):\nI would say really try and use these tools yourself. So the way in which I think we've been able to drive most of the adoption is Jack uses Goose, I use Goose, our executive team all have used Goose and use it regularly and use other AI programming tools and assistance as well, and we do it every single day.\n\n(00:54:31):\nAnd so we learn a lot about how our own workflow can change, and that's going to tell you so much more about how are you going to change your organization's workflow than if you're reading a bunch of think pieces on LinkedIn or Harvard Business Review or whatever it is, and then trying to get your teams to follow suit. So I think we do this with everything. It's feel it, use the product yourself, feel it, understand its strengths and weaknesses and its ergonomics, and then figure out how to apply it to your teams.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:06):\nSomething I've found helpful in doing that, which I completely agree with, which is stop reading about it, stop listening to us talking about it, just build some stuff. The thing that I found really helpful there is have a specific task or problem you want to solve for yourself because that really motivates you and makes it very real.\n\n(00:55:21):\nFor example, just the other day, I was trying to pull images out of a Google Doc. Google Doc, it's like I think of it as Hotel California. You put images in there, but there's no way to get them back out unless you do some crazy stuff. So I just went to Lovable and like Bill an app, or I can give you a Google Doc URL and let me download the images real easily and bam. Perfect.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:55:41):\nYeah, great example. I did something like this a couple months ago as well, where my son has a whole bunch of therapies, he has additional needs, and so I was trying to gather the receipts for all these therapies and share them with my wife and she will claim it from our insurer, and I was really struggling to do this because they're in various forms.\n\n(00:56:05):\nThere are screenshots in some cases or PDFs or whatever. So I asked Goose to do this and it was all sitting on my laptop and Goose figured out that it could put all of these receipts into my Apple Notes app into a single note. It converted it to HTML so it would sync seamlessly to my phone and then I could email it or share it with her from there.\n\n(00:56:30):\nAnd that's just something I just never would've thought of. And it did this using Apple Script, so it just controlled my computer for me in the background. Yeah, so these are surprising ways in which these tools help us, and the more you use them to solve real problems to your point, the more you understand what their strengths are and where you can deploy them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):\nI love this example. So did you just go to Goose and be like, \"Here's the problem I have, how would you solve it?\"\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:56:56):\nYeah, pretty much. I said, \"I have all these receipts there in Google Drive, so we have similar origin problem there and I need to get them into a single form and I need to collate the totals and do all this.\" So it tried a few approaches first. It tried to download them and it tried to read them using a PDF reader and this and that. And then the thing about Goose that I think a lot of the other AI agents learn from us as well is if it tries a few things and fails, it'll back up and it'll try a different route and it'll just keep going until it makes some progress.\n\n(00:57:33):\nAnd that's what it did. Then it picked Apple Script as a way to do it because it had the MCP extension to control my computer, and this is the same thing that our engineer, we were talking about the other day uses to watch his screen and things like that, but this was a very focused problem and it managed to do that. So yeah, it's surprising what these tools can do and allowing them the flexibility to do that is a big part of learning how to use them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):\nThat's cool. I love the, by the way, can you run Goose as a regular person? Can you just download Goose and use that instead of Claude?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:58:08):\nYeah, absolutely. Yeah. You can just download it from our URL. We can share it in the show notes for you and yeah, you can install it. It comes for Mac and Windows and Linux I believe. It's an electron app, so it'll work on all of them. It also has a command line, so for people who are more comfortable using that, we have that UI as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:32):\nWow, you really are competing with these massive foundational model companies building. What's the simplest way to compare Goose to something else? Is it like this Claude code, this simplest comparison or something else?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:58:43):\nI think it's a bit different than Claude Code because at its core, Goose is a platform that implements MCPs. So MCPs give it this dynamically extensible nature so it can do all of these things for you, whether it's automating things like we were talking about with Google Docs and notes and things like that, or it can do straight up programming tasks for you using other MCPs.\n\n(00:59:11):\nIt can index code and do it that way. So it's really more of an extensible platform. So I would say it sits somewhere between your classic AI assistant where you just ask it, \"What's the weather today? Can you calculate how many months it's been since this date?\" Or whatever it is, to the more focused cursors and Claude codes of the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:39):\nBasically, it's everything combined wholly and free. You pay for the LM tokens, but yeah.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (00:59:46):\nYeah, there's not like an open source models which-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:50):\nOh my God, this is crazy. What a cool team to be on building Goose at Block. Must having must be having so much fun. Oh man. Okay. Let me zoom out a little bit. So you've been CTO in LinkedIn right now for just about two years. What's something that you wish you knew before you stepped in this role? If you could go back a couple years and just whisper a few tips and tricks or lessons into your ear, what would they be?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:00:13):\nI think maybe two different things. One is just the power of Conway's Law, like we talked about before. It's like how difficult it is to change outcomes without changing the structure of relationships between people in an organization. And I think I always kind of knew that at some level, but really appreciating it in a visceral way is big. The other thing that I really learned the hard way maybe is you only hear about it when things are going wrong.\n\n(01:00:49):\nSo when things are going well, you kind of have this eerie silence and you're like, \"Well, am I doing the right things here? Am I focusing on the right problems?\" So having a bit of judgment, having a bit of time to step back and look at things holistically, those are things that you really need to make time for and do on a regular basis, which I wish I had known when I took up the role.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:15):\nLooking back at your time at Block, I keep trying to, I almost say Square because I'm so used to that over the air, but I know Block is the name of the broader company and Square is just one. Just so people understand, Square is one business unit, one product within Block.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:01:28):\nCorrect, yeah, we have Square, Afterpay, Cash App and TIDAL are four major brands, and then we also have Bitkey and Proto that are focused on Bitcoin for us and we chip hardware in those two brands.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:44):\nOkay, great. I think that some people are like, what are you guys talking about? Okay, cool. So reflecting back on your time at Block, what's maybe the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building products or building teams that goes against what most people believe, say common startup wisdom?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:02:02):\nI think code quality is one. Being an engineer. I learned this very early on and it keeps coming true over and over and over again. A lot of engineers think that code quality is important to building a successful product. The two have nothing to do with each other, but my favorite example is YouTube. I was working at Google around the time YouTube was acquired and I just remember there was this whole wash of angst about how horrible the YouTube code base is and how terrible their architecture is, and they're storing videos as blobs in MySQL and whatnot.\n\n(01:02:41):\nAnd you could argue that YouTube is the most successful product at Google by a long way, maybe more successful than many of their others combined. And so it really has very little to do with how well it was architected because the flip side of that Google video, which is product that I don't know if people remember, it existed before YouTube. It supported more formats, it supported higher resolution.\n\n(01:03:11):\nYou could upload hour long videos, YouTube had none of this. It just had the one or two minute quick video thing and it's far and away, blown away its competition. And so I think just keeping that front and center is why are we building these tools or these apps or these products? They're for people to solve a specific problem. So in our case, it's for a square merchant to make a sale, to sell coffee to you or to sell something they've made. And that's really what's important.\n\n(01:03:49):\nIt's not really important how well our Android platform performs unless it's serving that need. And so I think that's been a really hard one for me over my career. And I continually encounter engineers who think we need to refactor, we need to do this in a better way. And then I'm like, \"No, all this code could be thrown away tomorrow. So just focus on what we're trying to build and whom we're trying to build for.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:19):\nThat is an incredible insight and lesson. This YouTube story is so fun and such a good example. You're saying they were storing the video content in a MySQL set like row and column as a blob data.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:04:34):\nYeah, this is what, I didn't actually look the code so I couldn't verify it, but this was the common wisdom. And then they had an entirely Python stack that was incredibly slow compared to the state-of-the-art C++ and Java servers that we had hyper-optimized at Google back in those days.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):\nThat is hilarious. It makes me think about also companies when you look inside a company, if you work at a company, you're just like, \"This is just pure chaos. No one knows what's going on. This is just about to all fall apart.\" And that's basically what it's like at every successful hyper-growth company.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:05:14):\nYeah, there's some truth to that for sure. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):\nAnd so I think again, it's just there's so much more that is more important to the success of a business. And it's what you said is are you solving a real problem for people? Can you get in their hands? Can you continue solving real problems for them? It's not about the quality of the code, it's not how well you operate internally.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:05:32):\nAbsolutely. I think on Cash App we had that as well. So in the early days of Cash App, I was head of engineering from when we were about 10 engineers to 200 plus and took us to about 10 plus or 20 million users thereabouts. And there was a very similar thing there. From the outside it looked like everything was really chaotic. It's like people would build random experiments and ship them and it just didn't look like we were following strict policies on things like software life cycle and stuff like that, and it was kind of true.\n\n(01:06:13):\nAnd my philosophy was always, we have all these brilliant engineers and I'm going to do more harm than good by trying to harness them into very strict blinkered areas. If they want to spin their wheels building something that is a complete waste of time for a little bit. But at the same time, if they're delivering these amazing things on the flip side, then I'll almost allow that. I'll be okay with that.\n\n(01:06:44):\nAnd it's a fine balance because engineers can really go off and into rabbit holes if you let them. But yeah, there's a certain amount of creativity that chaos breeds and you have to know how to build controlled chaos in some ways. So you have to create a foundation that isn't liable to rupture. You have major liability problems or something like that, or you're going to lose money in our case. And so as long as those things are bedded down and you allow your engineers to have the freedom to experiment and iterate and do the things that energizes them, that's the ideal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:26):\nSpeaking of controlled chaos, one of your titles during your time at Block, I guess this was while you were actually at Square, was Mad Scientist for four and a half years.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:07:38):\nYeah, that was a time when I was working part-time, mostly because I had very young kids with lots of additional needs and I was a consultant on various different projects and I was trying to help some wacky things get off the ground. And yeah, I'm really grateful to Block that they afforded me the freedom to have that role in my career as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:08):\nMaybe one more question before I take us to Fail Corner, which I'll explain. So you've shared a few lessons of things you've learned over the course of your career. Are there any other, just let's say core leadership lessons that you've learned that you think have been important to you being successful at the work that you've done?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:08:26):\nI think start small with everything. If you try to boil the ocean to make a cup of tea, I don't know who said that, but it's a really a useful phrase that I keep coming back to. You'll never get there. So if you're making a cup of tea, just make the cup of tea. You don't need to boil all the water that there is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:47):\nThat sounds like really not delicious tea. Ocean water.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:08:52):\nYeah, I think there's another one of, I think Carl Sagan said, \"If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you have to first invent the universe.\" So it's like narrow your scope to the thing that's in front of you and that's achievable. And so that I think is really important and that's one of our core tenets and always has been even when we were just Square in the early days, start small.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):\nIs there an example that maybe worked really well or maybe didn't work?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:09:23):\nYeah, Goose started small. It was just an engineer working on their own time trying to build something that was useful and that satisfied a thesis that they had. So Brad, our creator of Goose, believed very early on, I think long before we heard the buzzword going around that agents would be how we unlock value from LLMs. And he built a proof concept and he shared it with a bunch of people. He shared it with Databricks and Anthropic, got them excited and learned a lot from them.\n\n(01:09:59):\nAnd so it just sort of built momentum from there. And even internally, it was quite a similar thing. Cash App itself was like that and Cash App started more or less as a hack week sort of idea and grew into a bigger and bigger and bigger thing. So a lot of our projects start with these small experiments that we try to then build on top of. We became the very first company that was a public company to launch a Bitcoin product. And that was again a hack week idea that actually Jack and me and another engineer worked on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):\nThat was the hackathon team? You and Jack Dorsey and an engineer?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:10:44):\nYeah, it was the three of us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:46):\nUnreal.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:10:48):\nYeah, and it was great. We went and bought a cup of coffee, a blue bottle, and it was bought using Bitcoin over cash card. And I'll tell you those in hindsight, probably the most expensive cup of coffee.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:02):\nWhat was Bitcoin at? 20,000?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:11:02):\nI think it was 6,000 or 7,000 back then. I don't know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:07):\nIt's like 120,000 now. Great.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:11:12):\nBut yeah, it's an example of how you get to a working useful product to people if you focus on a small thing first in a build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:22):\nAnd just to double down on this counter too. \"Okay, we have a big idea, we're just going to put a bunch of resources on it and go big immediately.\"\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:11:29):\nYeah, absolutely. And I've been part of teams like that too. So in my career, I worked at Google on this product called Google Wave, which was trying to be everything to everyone and we were 70, 80 engineers building this thing before it even really had any users outside Google. And so I think that's an example of something that started big, tried to go big on day one and probably lacked some of that meeting the earth where reality lies and adapting accordingly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:08):\nI remember Google Wave. Absolutely. It was beautiful. A lot of hype. I don't remember what it was for specifically, but it looked really nice.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:12:15):\nYeah, a lot of learnings from that one for me. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:19):\nWhat else? Any other big lessons?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:12:21):\nThose two are the big ones, but I would also say question base assumptions on everything. Sometimes we get into traps where we are as professionals, hyper focused on what we're building that day, that week, that month. And we don't stop to think should we even build this at all? Or what's the purpose of building this?\n\n(01:12:46):\nCould we build something completely different that would matter more to our core reason for being? So I would say, yeah, question the sort of base assumptions. It's somewhat of a cliche, but you really need to remind yourself to apply it over and over and over again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:03):\nI had a colleague of yours on the podcast back in the day, IO, who worked with you on Cash App.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:13:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:09):\nHe's a friend of mine, he's amazing. He had a quote along those lines of just like, I forget exactly what it was, but it was just get to the bare metal of the thing that you're working on, just touch the thing that you're building and go to the base of it to really understand what's going on. And I imagine that was really important with Building Cash App and Cash Card.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:13:26):\nYeah, IO is one of the best product people I've ever worked with and one of my closest friends actually. So absolutely with him, and you on that one, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:38):\nOkay. I'm going to take us to a recurring segment on the podcast I call Fail Corner. You already shared one example of a product that failed that you worked on. I'm curious if there's another, and the question is just what's the product you worked on that did not work out? Because people listening to this hear all these amazing successful people come on the podcast, share all these stories of success, endless success, but they don't hear the stories when things don't work out. And so this question is just, \"What's a product you worked on that didn't work out and what did that teach you?\"\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:14:08):\nIt's a very valuable point. My career has basically been a string of failed product on top of failed product. And I think that, \"Yeah, the Google wave example's there.\" I worked for Hot Minute on Google+, which was another epic failure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:23):\nGood one.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:14:23):\nI worked at this social networking startup called Secret, which burned hot for a bright minute and then blew up. And then there was an email startup that we did, and that was, again, very promising, and then that fizzled. So the co-founder of Canva and I worked on that one. So there's been a whole string of failures, but at each point, I think I learned something and I learned that I need to never make that class of failures or errors again.\n\n(01:15:01):\nAnd so Cash App was probably the big success for me that a product that I worked on that was very early on and grew to be this giant business and product that people love. So yeah, been my career is essentially taking the learnings from all these failures, getting some humility out of it in the process too, coming into things, willing to listen to other people's points of view, critical points of view, and not just thinking that I have all the answers, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:36):\nAnd I bet all these products that failed had really beautiful code. A lot of really good architecture decisions were made. Some of them, some of them were awful in every way. So many reasons for it to fail. Incredible. Dhanji, is there anything else that you wanted to share or I don't know, double down on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:15:59):\nI would say I think that we're in this era of a lot of change and people are scared or reticent or uncertain about where things are going. And I think that look at the things that matter to you. For us, it's open source, open protocols, improving access for everyone. I've been very lucky in my career to only work on products that are either free or almost free to anyone or they have a free tier and then you pay for some premium services and that are usable by everyone. So anyone can become a Square seller.\n\n(01:16:42):\nI remember even in the early days, people used it to pay each other as a peer-to-peer money transfer system and that's why we built Cash App and that was really successful on the back of that. So I think it's really look at the things that are important to you and optimize for them. It's not really that important that the technology trends are growing in a certain way because technology is here to serve us, and if we have an important reason for being and an important purpose, then we can make that technology serve us. And that's much more important than being deep with the technology or being at the forefront of every trend.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:27):\nSuch great advice when there's so much to pay attention to and so much happening. So stressful to feel like I'm just not aware of all the things. I'm not as good as all these people I'm seeing on social media, but what's happening with AI, I'm just so behind. What I'm hearing from you is just like what is actually important to you? And just do that. Don't feel like you need to be the best at everything that's happening on top of all the latest AI news.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:17:51):\nYeah, exactly. And if it's not meaningful and fun, then you shouldn't be doing it probably.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:58):\nWith that Dhanji, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:18:03):\nOkay. Shoot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:04):\nI see so many books behind you. So I love this first question. I'm excited to see what you pick. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:18:12):\nYeah, so I very much of the opinion that you shouldn't read books that are about your daily work or your professional life. I read fiction, I read the classics, I read poetry, philosophy, history. These are the books I really enjoy. And I think it expands your mind and gives you creative ideas and helps you question things about the human condition.\n\n(01:18:39):\nAnd that's much more valuable than some self-help book or some get good at being an engineering manager book. So yeah, having said that, the Master in Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov is one that I really love. It's a masterpiece of Russian literature. And then I've always been drawn to Tennyson's poetry and I find that in the times when I'm most uncertain or grieving, Tennyson's poetry has always resonated with me and helped me find a center.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:16):\nWow. Never heard these recommendations before. I'm really excited to check these out. Very cool for a CTO of a big tech company. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:19:30):\nAlien Earth I think is pretty awesome. It's by Noah Hawley who did the Fargo TV series. And so it's someone with all of these incredible skills in high art filmmaking who's doing a pulp sci-fi show, and it just looks stunning and it feels stunning and it captures all of that essential alien pulpiness that makes it so interesting and fun. So I really like that, and I'm also watching Slow Horses, which I think is one of the better shows on TV.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:04):\nLove Slow Horses. The new season's Out, think the fifth episode just dropped the day we're recording this. So I love that show. Alien Earth also just watched it, so creepy and just like all these slimy, gooey little creatures just crawling around.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:20:16):\nYeah, I just love the aesthetic and they captured something essential about the original Alien and yeah, they do it, but every scene in Alien Earth feels like you're watching a painting or something or someone's reading a novel to you. It's really unfolds very thoughtfully.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):\nI've never watched any alien content in my life and I really enjoyed Alien Earth. I will say the ending, I was just like, it felt like it kind of slowed down a bit. I'm just like, \"All right, I guess I see where it's going now.\" But it was really fun to watch. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite product you really enjoyed? Sorry, a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really enjoy? It could be an app, could be an gadget, could be some kitchen thing.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:20:58):\nWell, I'm a gamer. I love playing games. So for me it's the Steam Deck, the Steam Deck OLED, which is their latest version. It's like this gorgeous piece of hardware that lets you play the best games out there, but it's totally extensible and customizable. And in this era where we're constantly told by big tech companies that we need to lock everything down, we need to lock down the user experience and customizability in order to have things work for people.\n\n(01:21:28):\nI think Valve showed that's totally unnecessary and totally wrong, and you can build the Steam Deck. You can install competing app stores, you can install Windows on it. You can treat it like a computer, write programs, which I have done to run on it. So yeah, I think it's an incredible thing and it looks beautiful and it works great. So yeah, big fan.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:50):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to often in work or in life?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:21:55):\nIf you're not waking up in the morning feeling energized about what you're going to do that day in your professional life, then change something, quit if that's what it comes down to, or find a new way of doing what you're doing. Just don't accept what's meted out to you. So that's how I've tried to do things, and sometimes it works, sometimes not, but yeah, it's a good thing to ask yourself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:25):\nI really love this advice. It's really hard to do that for a lot of people. Is there anything that has helped you get over that fear of just like, \"Oh man, I'm going to quit this thing. I don't know where I'm going to go next.\"\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:22:36):\nThe main thing is telling yourself that a year from now, you're going to look back on what looks like a monumental problem, a life-changing thing, and you're going to be like, \"Oh, that was so trivial.\" A lot of times we get into these traps where we're overthinking something or really nervous about making a change, but in hindsight, those don't seem that big.\n\n(01:23:05):\nAnd all the time that's passed since and all the events that have happened teach you that there's more to the world and it's never too late to do something useful or never too late to do something that's for yourself and improving yourself. So yeah, I think just kind of remembering that things are not as big or bleak or decisive as they seem in the moment is always important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:30):\nFinal question. So you were a mad scientist at Square for many years. Do you have another favorite mad scientist from pop culture or real life?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:23:41):\nThat's an interesting one. I think the image that always comes to my mind is Doc Brown from Back to the Future. I feel like he's the canonical mad scientist of my generation anyway, but there've been a lot in video games and stuff too, but he was the one that was like, \"I'm just going to do this crazy thing because I almost have this burning desire, need to do it, and whether I want to or not, I must build this time machine.\" And he spends the entire movie trying to fix the problems that it creates. But yeah, he has always been a really fun character for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:20):\nYou know what? I think about Pinky from Pinky in the Brain.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:24:24):\nOh yeah, that's a good one too. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):\nOh man. Dhanji, this was awesome. You were wonderful. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions before we actually wrap up. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more about say Goose or anything else going on at Block? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:24:43):\nCheck out our GitHub pages for Goose and all of the other open source projects we have at Block. So there's a lot that's useful there. We do a lot on Android open source as well, so check that stuff out. You can always find me on LinkedIn, so feel free to connect. I'm very happy to be contacted.\n\n(01:25:06):\nAnd I would say the way people can be useful is, again, going back to this era we're in of a lot of change and uncertainty, I think people that demand more of their companies, of their employers, of their teams, demand something better. At Block, we always ask, \"Can we default to making this open source? Can we build this for people that are not just us or our customers? Can everyone benefit?\"\n\n(01:25:37):\nAnd I think that's particularly important in this era of AI where everyone's locking themselves in walled gardens and trying to capture parts of the platform that are emerging. So yeah, just demand more of people. The internet was created as a promise for open sharing of information to the benefit of all, and I think that AI should realize that for us. And so yeah, just demand that of people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:07):\nA really beautiful way to end it. Dhanji, thank you so much for being here.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:26:11):\nThank you, Lenny. I really appreciated it. Thank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:14):\nI appreciate you.\n\nDhanji R. Prasanna (01:26:15):\nCheers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:15):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Zigging vs. zagging: How HubSpot built a $30B company | Dharmesh Shah (co-founder/CTO)\n\n## Transcript\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:00:00):\nSome of the best startup advice I've heard is startups should focus on one thing and be really, really exceptionally world-class at that one thing. And one of our early zigs is we are going to do exactly the opposite of that.\n\nLenny (00:00:11):\nYou have no direct reports and I don't believe you've ever had direct reports at HubSpot?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:00:16):\nI could become passively okay at management with some training, with some coaching. I don't want to spend any years of my life becoming passively okay at something.\n\nLenny (00:00:23):\nWhat was that process like to define the culture?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:00:26):\nMy co-founder and I were having one of our founders meetings and he said, \"Oh, Dharmesh, I hear this culture thing is really important. By the way, can you go do that?\" I'm like, \"Okay. Brian, of all the people in all the company, is like, I am the worst possible person.\" It's not that I don't like people, I just don't like being around them a whole lot.\n\nLenny (00:00:40):\nSomething that's really unique and interesting about you is you're obsessed with comedy and keynote prep.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:00:44):\nIt comes down to this metric that stand-up comedians use called LPM laughs per minute. I have custom software that I've written that will say, \"Okay, here are the points at which the audience laugh.\"\n\nLenny (00:00:57):\nToday my guest is Dharmesh Shah. Dharmesh is the co-founder and CTO of HubSpot and also one of the most fascinating and first principled thinkers I've ever met. In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground. Dharmesh's hilarious and ingenious approach to putting together a talk, including measuring laughs per minute, his biggest lessons from being a public company exec for over 10 years now, especially while being a startup guy at heart, how he approached creating and scaling the culture of HubSpot, which you'll find both hilarious and inspiring.\n\n(00:01:28):\nWhy founders and product teams are all fighting the second law of thermodynamics, how to zig, while everyone else is zagging, how and why Dharmesh leans into his strengths, including never having a single direct report during his 18 years of running HubSpot and so much more. This episode is so fun and will expand your mind in many ways. With that, I bring you Dharmesh Shah after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:53):\nAnd if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

It's an honor.\n\nLenny (00:04:16):\nIt's my honor, and thank you for joining me. You are a wildly fascinating human and so I thought it'd be fun to start with just a bunch of fun facts that I found about you online. And what I'm thinking is I'll just walk through them. Tell me if they're true as I walk through them, and then this is going to lead to a bunch of different topics that I want to talk about. How does that sound?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:04:34):\nSounds great.\n\nLenny (00:04:35):\nOkay, here we go. So one, you have no direct reports and I don't believe you've ever had direct reports at HubSpot.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:04:42):\nThat is correct. 7,000 plus employees? Exactly zero direct reports from time, T equals zero.\n\nLenny (00:04:47):\nOkay, we're going to talk about that. You also don't do one-on-one meetings as a result. You don't have reports to have one-on-one meetings with?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:04:54):\nThat's correct.\n\nLenny (00:04:55):\nYou built many side projects while at HubSpot, including a product called Wordplay, which at one point made $90,000 per month and had 16 million users.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:05:06):\nThat is correct.\n\nLenny (00:05:06):\nYou also bought chat.com for $10 million and then you sold it two months later for more money than you bought it for?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:05:13):\nIt was actually 15 plus million dollars, but I had kind of stated eight figures, but... well, yes.\n\nLenny (00:05:22):\nOoh. Is this breaking news?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:05:23):\nIt's breaking news, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:05:24):\nWow. So that's not what you bought it for?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:05:27):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:05:27):\nOkay, and you sold it still for an undisclosed amount, is that right?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:05:30):\nUndisclosed amount, yeah. And more than that, I'll just say that.\n\nLenny (00:05:33):\nYeah, there was a profit, and I know you gave some money to charity and there's some promises you made where people commented on your LinkedIn post and you gave more money away, so it was awesome. Okay. Also, you're a billionaire?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:05:42):\nThat is once again true. It's still true.\n\nLenny (00:05:45):\nGreat. Also, you were born in a village in India that had no paved streets, no traffic lights, no hospitals.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:05:52):\nThat is correct.\n\nLenny (00:05:53):\nOkay. Before HubSpot, you founded two companies, but I think the more important fact there is you promised your wife you would not start another company before you started HubSpot and then you ended up and went on and started HubSpot.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:06:05):\nYes. I had promised her that I would not do start... I had to hang up the proverbial entrepreneurial hat. Best laid plans and all that. I met my co-founder in grad school, which is that I was going to... The plan was, \"Oh, I'll go back to grad school and go find myself.\" And then the plan was to go eventually teach, not do another startup. But then I met my co-founder there and one thing led to another as these things go.\n\nLenny (00:06:27):\nI hope she's forgiven you.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:06:29):\nI do too.\n\nLenny (00:06:31):\nOkay. Final fact. So Kipp, is that how you pronounce his name? Kipp, your CMO?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:06:36):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:06:37):\nOkay, great. So I asked him what to ask you, and he tells me something that's really unique and interesting about you is you're obsessed with copywriting and comedy and keynote prep. That you have a very unique approach to preparing for a talk and how you think about humor and slide design and story arc.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:06:52):\nThat's very true. Public speaking is not something that comes naturally to me. So we're going to start there. We can talk a little bit about the copywriting, other things that are sort of related. And one of the... and I try to not do things that I'm not good at and don't enjoy. One of the rare exceptions that has snuck through is the need for me to get on stages as founder when we have our annual HubSpot event, our conference, which at the time when we did our first one, it was, like, 150 people at the Marriott. And then it's steadily grown since then, and so now it'll be like, 10,000 people in the live audience and hundreds of thousands online.\n\n(00:07:33):\nBut as I came to this realization that I was not going to be able to talk my way out of it, and I saw where this was headed, I'm like, \"Okay, this is something I'm going to have to actually learn, because I can't delegate it, can't talk my way out of it.\" And so I'm a big believer in this talent versus skill. So we all understand talent. It's like if someone has a talent for music, someone has a talent for athletics, whatever it happens to be. And that's true. That exists, but the way I think about it is talent basically controls the slope of the curve, but most things are actually acquirable skills. So for instance, if you have a talent for music, let's say, you might learn music faster than someone else and your ceiling may be higher, but does not mean that other people can't learn music, right?\n\n(00:08:18):\nIt's like an acquirable skill. That's lesson number one. And lesson number two is that there is a process, and this is the engineer in me of just kind of functional decomposition of a problem to say, \" Okay, in order for me to be a pretty good public speaker, what are the underlying sub-skills required in order to accomplish that? Okay, skill number one, you have to be able to stand up on stage and not pass out.\" That's kind the bare minimum. And so what I did over the years is to say, \"Okay, I'm going to functionally decompose this skill of public speaking in front of,\" what I call high-stakes speaking. I've got to actually hold the audience's attention. That's part of success. So it doesn't matter what the message is, nothing else will matter if I lose their attention, which is increasingly easy to do now in kind of short attention span society.\n\n(00:09:06):\nAnd every year I will pick a different part of the public speaking skill set and say, \"Oh, I want to learn about slide design and visual expression,\" Not the actual design. I'm not a designer. But then the one thing that I came up that has had the most impact is humor. Then you break that skill down just like the engineer would do. It's like, okay, well there's humor writing, there's humor, execution on stage, whatever. There's standup comedy. There's like, okay, so how do you put all these pieces together? And along that journey, I came up with this... and I've always had this, I'm a very data-driven, quant based person. It's like, \"Okay, well, how will I know whether something is actually funny enough or not, whether I'm losing the attention or not?\" And so in preparation for one of these high stakes keynotes that I do every year, I will have my talk, I will do practice runs.\n\n(00:09:57):\nI will have increasingly larger actual live audiences that I will practice it in front of. I will record those talks, everything so far. Nothing unusual yet. I will have the talks transcribed. I have custom software that I've written that will say, \"Okay, here are the points at which the audience laughed.\" Actually audibly laughed. That's the only way it counts. And this actually... and it comes down to this metric that standup comedians use called LPM laughs per minute. And there's actually a benchmark that you can say, \"Oh, well...\" And standup comedians have a very, very high LPM. Business talks have a very, very low LPM. The most popular Ted talks there's a high strong correlation between the most popular Ted talks and high. So I have a goal, look, I'm going to have a minimum I want to improve. And so I have software that will calculate the laughs per minute.\n\n(00:10:48):\nAnd so then you learn these little kind of tools of the tricks of the trades. It's like, okay, if you're solving literally for that ratio of laughs per minute, there are two ways to improve it. One is to add more laughs. Two is to decrease the number of words between laughs, right? So one of the things a software measures, it gives me a visual map. It's like, here's the entire talk broken down with little square per minute of talk, or 30 seconds, and it's like, here's what they like. It's like, \"Oh, here I went one minute and 17 seconds and nobody laughed.\" So I have to do one of two things. Shorten that segment if there's nothing funny that can be said without being overt about it, or I have to say, \"Okay, I'm going to find something funny to try to inject into this and kind of break it up.\"\n\n(00:11:29):\nAnyway. And that's a long way of saying if I can get up on a public stage and learn that particular skill, anyone can learn just about anything. It just comes down to practice and measurement and just getting incrementally better over time.\n\nLenny (00:11:45):\nWow. I feel like I've just learned so much about you and how you think just from that question and how you approach this problem. On this humor piece, I'm curious, any lessons to share on how to be funny?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:11:56):\nOne of the kind of tricks of the trade in humor, and you learned this particularly in stand-up comedy, but just any comedy. And I just hadn't thought of it this way, is that... and this is very tactical, but it works and it's a very easy thing to apply. So let's say you're looking at... and most of us, we're not stand-up comedians. We're not going to tell jokes in a classic sense.\n\n(00:12:14):\nAnd even stand-up comedians don't tell jokes. They actually have stories and they happen to have a punchline or two. So, two tactical pieces of advice. One is when you're telling the story, whatever the funny bit is, those have to literally be the last words of that particular segment. So once you deliver it, then you have to stop talking. And the reason you have to stop talking is the audience needs about a half a second to react, and then they want the permission to laugh. And if you're continuing to say words, it's going to make them feel awkward and it's going to be less funny. So even if moving a phrase in the sentence that you're about to say, it's like, \"Well, that sounds kind weird to put those set of words at the end of the thing.\" Do it anyway even though it's awkward because it will actually work better.\n\n(00:13:00):\nThat's kind of tip number one. Tip number two on LPM generally is that having stories such that you can spend the time setting up the story, but then have multiple funny bits, multiple punchlines, because you've already made the investment. I've said 75 words in order to set up this context, say something funny that's amusing, that's whatever. Say some more things. You already have the... and you'll see the stand-up comedians do this all the time. And then say something else that's funny because a laugh is a laugh. Doesn't really matter that it was still the same story. So leverage the investment you've already made in establishing context and scene, and then just squeeze more humor into the end of it in punctuated fashion.\n\nLenny (00:13:37):\nI feel like the entire podcast could just be this one thread, but I need to move on to other topics.\n\n(00:13:42):\nOne quick question. So you said ideal laughs for a minute is two to three-ish? Is that what you said?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:13:46):\nYeah, two plus is hard for a business talk because stand-up comedians, the reason they can do it is that's all they're really solving for is LPM. In business talks, you actually have another agenda other than just being entertaining. You actually have a message. You're trying to promote something. Promote an idea, promote a product. So anyway, in my mind, for most normal circumstance, even if you can get above a one, 1.2, 25, you're in the top decile in terms of top, generally given by non-professionals.\n\nLenny (00:14:19):\nWow, this is incredible. So after every talk, you run this transcript and audio through your program to see how you did.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:14:25):\nYes, yes.\n\nLenny (00:14:26):\nAnd are you ever going to publish and release this program? Because that sounds really cool.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:14:30):\nI have this notion of what I call SoloWare. And SoloWare is exactly what it sounds like. It's software built for exactly one person, and in my case, that one person is me. And so I've been doing this thing for 30 years right now. I just build things that I would myself find useful. And the nice thing about Solo, one of the many nice things about it is that the UI is only for one person. You don't have to do a whole lot of testing because it only needs to work for one person. And the most important thing is that because it's only for one person, if it stops bringing utility, you can just turn it off. You can just stop using it. Versus if you have users, even 10 users, and you put it out there and then people would be disappointed if you took it down for whatever reason, that's kind of hard.\n\n(00:15:10):\nSo anyway, that's the calculus I go through, \"Is this useful enough to enough people where it's worth the calories of making it non-solo ware, making it even micro-ware?\" I just made that up, but yeah.\n\nLenny (00:15:22):\nWow. Okay. Let's see how the YouTube comments react and how many people would want this and slash pay for it.\n\n(00:15:28):\nLet me go in a slightly different direction. We talked about how you have no direct reports, you've never had any direct reports? I know that's somewhat related to a piece of advice you often share, which is to lean into your strengths and to not do things that you're not amazing yet. So can you just talk about why this is the case? Why don't you have any reports? And then I think this idea of just strengths and the importance focusing on strengths.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:15:52):\nYeah. I'll tell you the quick story as to how this came about. My co-founder and I had the founding meeting for HubSpot. This is the week where we've decided we're going to do this, and then we have this list of questions or topics for the founders discussion. One of them, and I think I've published a list, these are the questions all co-founders should ask each other in that kind of early period. One of the ones it's like, okay, well who's going to be CEO? This was an easy one because I had been CEO twice before and had figured out I'm not that good at it. I actually suck at that. And one of the reasons I suck at that is that part of the CEO role is being good at managing people. It's not just about leading and having a vision or whatever. Actually have to do the management as a craft. And so, that part I already had in my head.\n\n(00:16:40):\nI think Brian, my co-founder, already had in his head that with... That's how this... that was a very quick conversation. And in the moment, as soon as I had that win behind me, it's like, \"Okay, well I don't want to be CEO.\" Brian wanted to be CEO because he'd never done it before. I'm like, \"okay, that was easy.\" And then I said, \"Oh, and by the way, I don't want to have any direct reports.\" It just popped into my head as an idea. I had not pre-planned it or anything, and I sprung it on him.\n\n(00:17:04):\nHe's like, \"Okay, well...\" And the reason is because I have learned that I suck at management. I'm a reasonably smart person. I think I could become passively okay at management with some training, with some coaching or whatever. I don't want to spend any years of my life becoming passively okay at something. I would rather take those same calories and take the things that I'm good at that I actually enjoy. And those things are highly correlated. You tend to be good at the things you enjoy. You tend to enjoy the things you're good at. And Brian was like, \"Yeah, sure.\" And then I'm like, \"No, no, Brian, you don't understand.\" Because then I was like, \"There's going to be a time in the company.\" He was like, \"Oh, our VP of engineering just quit. Just be interim with something or whatever and have this team report to you until we find..\" It's like, \"We're going to have those things and you're going to have to promise to me we're not going to do that. We're going to...\" It's like I am not going to have direct reports.\n\n(00:17:53):\nAnd we had that kind of heart to heart conversation, and it was one of the best decisions I've made both for myself and for HubSpot. Had I not made that decision, I'm a startup guy, I don't know that I would've survived at a company at HubSpot scale. And right now I can honestly say I'm having a better time at HubSpot now at 7,000 people than I was having at 70 people. And the reason is, I get all the upside of scale, which is I can make big bets. So we can have long-term things and plans, whatever, and plan for global domination without the downsides of scale, which is, \"Oh, you're having to manage all these people and all the kind of mechanics.\" And that's hard. It's a hard skill to have.\n\n(00:18:33):\nI appreciate other people that have it. I don't. And so I get all the upside with very little of the downside of scale, and that's what kind of keeps me engaged and energized and happy at HubSpot. So I think it's been both productive for HubSpot and good for me.\n\nLenny (00:18:46):\nI love that this is an example of how you can build a company the way that you want to build it. You don't have to do it the way everybody else has done. I imagine there's a lot of challenges to this too, but I think it's inspiring to just like, \"Hey, I'm going to design a company the way I want to build it.\"\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:18:59):\nYeah, it's amazing what you can get away with in terms of shaping the universe to your liking. I think people automatically assume that things have to go a certain way, especially founders and first time founders.\n\n(00:19:11):\nIt's like, you should at least try it. It's like, \"Okay, well I want to do it...\" First of, I'll give you another tactical example. Both my co-founder and I are night people, not morning people. Just happens... I didn't pick him because of that. We learned that later. And so we made it just from the early days of HubSpot in the early years at least, we're like, \"No meetings before 11 A.M. Period.\" That was it. And then we adjusted it, I think maybe three or four years and we're like, \"All right, we could have meetings before 11:00 AM. You just can't invite one of the co-founders to it. So you're welcome to meet amongst yourselves if you choose to do so.\" But anyway, yeah, it's little things.\n\nLenny (00:19:50):\nThat's an amazing rule. I have a personal rule where I have no meetings before 3:00 P.M. because I don't work anywhere. I can more so create my schedule, but the idea is I create this deep work time in the beginnings of the day.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:20:01):\nI love that. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:20:02):\nOkay. So you talked about you're a startup guy. At the same time HubSpot is approaching its 10 years of being a public company and I think 18 years since founding.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:20:13):\nYup.\n\nLenny (00:20:13):\nI'm curious what lessons you've taken from that experience being someone that's clearly startuppy person, being an exec at a very fast growing and large company. And I'm thinking from the perspective of a founder who's maybe thinking about starting a company or starting company, what advice you might have to share for them? And also for people in the exact role today?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:20:34):\nA couple of things. One, since we are publicly traded down, this doesn't get talked about enough. I'm going to go and get this out there and use this as a platform to get this message out, which is I think too many founders, once they get to a... They are very apprehensive of going public and going through the IPO process and being a publicly traded company because they think... I mean, that's like the beginning of the end. \"It's going to change everything and my life is going to suck.\"\n\n(00:20:58):\nAnd I think they're over indexing on what they think it's like to be a publicly traded company. In my own personal experience, and Brian, my co-founder would attest to this. And yes, there's certainly a tax or things we have to do now as a publicly traded company that we didn't have to do as a privately traded company. But there are actually benefits. For instance, if you kind of venture back in private, let's say, you're sort of at a little bit the whim of the market and how VCs perceive your category and all these things or whatever. And you get, every now and then, when you're out raising a round of capital, you sort of get marked to market. Now here's sort of what the valuation is based on what someone's willing to kind of fund the company at. One of the nicest things, and this is underappreciated, is that we know right now what the market values HubSpot at. I can tell you that any business day of the week. And there's a niceness to that. And that's the other thing I tell folks within the company is that the valuation, which is we're in a relatively efficient market. The public stock market is a relatively efficient by the economic definition of the term, in efficient market. So, the valuation will oscillate around the value.\n\n(00:22:04):\nSo, if you focus on creating values, here's what we're actually building, valuation will sometimes be higher than you deserve, sometimes will be lower than you deserve, but over the fullness of time, those two things will move in lockstep, right? That's been demonstrated. That's what happens. That's almost a definition of an efficient market is that information moves essentially, and then the valuation catches up with the actual value.\n\n(00:22:25):\nBut here's the other social reason why I think founders should go public, which is... So in HubSpot, and I hadn't thought about this so I'm not going to take credit for being this generous, magnanimous person, is that in our first pre-public years, I think we were eight years old when we went public, we had created roughly a billion dollars in market cap, give or take. We hadn't been a unicorn. So it was slightly below when we went public. So HubSpot was never a unicorn because that's private privately held company, over a billion.\n\n(00:22:55):\nIn the subsequent years, we went from a billion dollars in market cap to 30 billion, which is roughly what it is now. That first billion of market cap creation, a very small number of people got to participate in. The rest of the $29 billion in market cap, everyone, every public investor got a chance to participate in. And so I like the idea of, okay, well you believe in your company. There's lots of people that believed in HubSpot. It's nice to let them kind of participate. Our customers, our partners, our well-wishers, and they can sort of now have the upside. And you don't get that in the private markets because it's a very closed... you can't just buy shares in every private company you like. I wish that existed, but it doesn't. So, it's a way to let the market at large participate in your growth earlier.\n\nLenny (00:23:42):\nWhat about from the perspective of just staying excited and motivated and finding things to take on, is there any lessons there for founders that are, I don't know, at a larger company and just, \"Okay, this is going to help me stay excited about what I'm doing\"?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:23:57):\nYeah, I think this is... and Bezos exemplifies this, I think the best, which is, just because you're a public company does not mandate that you do certain things. All that's necessary is the kind of transparency that says, \"Here's what the company is doing, here's what we're about, here's what we're solving.\" And he had this with his very first annual shareholders letter, which he obviously writes every year, which is, \"This is what Amazon is about, we're solving for the long term or whatever.\" And he didn't say this in a snarky way. If you reread the letter, but if you read between the lines, it's like, if you don't agree with this approach, you should not buy Amazon shares. It's like, it's a completely optional thing. \"You don't have to buy it, but this is the way we're going to run the business.\"\n\n(00:24:39):\nAnd he stayed true to that. And you can continue to do that. I'll tell you one quick story. This is once again, the anti-dissuade founders that might be reluctant to go public. So one of the core values at HubSpot that's been part of the culture from the early early days, literally days, is transparency. And so, one of our mechanisms by which we implement transparency is we've had this thing that says all information within HubSpot is equally shared with everyone in the company, period.\n\n(00:25:11):\nEverything. So our balance sheet, what we raised capital at, whether we're going to be able to meet payroll in six weeks, all those things, everything was transparent all the time. And with two exceptions. One is if it was illegal for us to share, let's say if we were looking at some acquisition or whatever and we had non-disclosure or the information was ours, not completely ours to share. And one example of that was salaries. So, we feel that salaries are co-owned both by the company and by that individual. And it's not up to us to share someone's salary if they don't want to do that. Okay. All right.\n\n(00:25:45):\nSo, we had that transparency and then as we go public, we have this meeting with our investment bankers and our lawyers. This is in the IPO prep process, and they sit down and as part of this all day meeting, one of the questions is like, \"Okay, so who are your designated insiders?\"\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:26:00):\nSo who are your designated insiders? Brian nor I had ever taken the company public before, we're like, \"We don't know what that is.\" It's like, \"Oh, it's this group of people that will have access to all the financials and will know.\" And we're like, \"Oh, okay, so how long is that list?\" And they're like, \"Five or six.\" And so then Brian says, \"Seven? Seven?\" And they're like, \"Yeah, you can do seven.\" And I say, \"Eight? Could you do eight?\" And so we discovered through that mathematical induction process, is like, \"If it's true for N, is it true for N plus one?\" Is that there's no actual legal limit to how many insiders a company can have.\n\n(00:26:38):\nAnd so we ended up doing, literally the day we went public, is we designated every single employee to be a designated insider. So that allowed us to maintain the transparency thing because there was no rule that said you could only have 5, 6, 10, and there was hundreds of people. And we did not make it optional. We didn't say, \"Oh,\" because there are downsides to being an insider. There's windows within which you can't trade, there's stuff. But we're like, \"Okay, well, we believe in transparency. Everyone's going to have access to it, and it's not an opt in kind of thing. You're like, \"This is it. We're all in it together.\"\" And we still do this to this day, even at 7,000 people, everybody's an insider, so we can still share all the financials with everyone all the time.\n\nLenny (00:27:18):\nYou have many contrarian opinions is what I'm getting from this conversation already. And the way you're pushing the envelope on, \"Can we have 10, can we have 1,000?\" I'm curious if there's anything else there of just contrarian ways of running a company. I know there's probably many, but what comes to mind?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:27:36):\nSo one of the phrases we like to use in our industry overall is this notion of first principles. I don't know who popularized it, but it's used a lot. I'm not going to say something snarky, but I think most of the time first principles is used, it's actually used incorrectly. Because the way first principles is supposed to work, as Elon would probably describe it, is that it's not first principles like first principles of what we believe, these are our core first principles in the company, it's the first principles of the universe. It's not what you believe is true, it's what do we all collectively know to be true to the best of our knowledge? It's science. That's physics. Like the first and second law of thermodynamics, those are first principles. All the layers on top of that are things that you think are true, are your assumptions or the decisions you made, and that's fine. You may have made some decisions.\n\n(00:28:23):\nFor instance, transparency is not a first principle, it's a founding principle. It's not everyone should do this, it's a completely core thing. And so yes, I can be a contrarian, but you have to limit the dimensions. So the number of things that you're a contrarian on has to be greater than zero, but not too high. So what I think of is high conviction, low consensus bets. So high conviction is, \"We really, really believe this,\" and low consensus is that most other people don't. And there are other people have phrased this differently. I think Peter Thiel actually says it more simply and elegantly, which is, \"You need to be right about something that other people think you're wrong about for a very long time.\" And you just have to be right.\n\n(00:29:09):\nSo one of the early high-conviction decisions we made at HubSpot was that we were going to focus on SMB as our target market. And I'll make a case both for SMB and for having a high conviction bet. It doesn't have to be your target market, but something. Once you make that bet, because it's low consensus, it's going to be hard and necessary for you to have the conviction because everyone disagrees, including your board, including your investors, including potential investors. So we have that for literally all 18 years of HubSpot's history. We have always had the... All during the IPO roadshow, it's like, \"Yes, we get that you've on SMB, but so what's the path to the enterprise?\" No, you don't understand. This is not a go-to market strategy. This is not like, \"Oh, we're going to conquer SMB first,\" this is not Bowling Pin, this is not Geoffrey Moore, this is a, \"We are here for SMB.\" That's what we're doing.\n\n(00:29:58):\nAnd so we maintain that conviction for a very long time, and that helps you make other bets that are secondary. But you don't want to reinvent everything. So I'll give you an example of something that we had in the early years of HubSpot that we kind of forwent. So in the early years of HubSpot, we're like, \"Okay, we believe in a flat organization.\" One of the manifestations of that flat organization is we had no titles in the company. Nobody had a title. So even though you had business cards, whatever, we had no titles. If you introduce yourself in a meeting, and we had this up to hundreds of people, when you introduce yourself like, \"Oh, I work in product, I work in engineering,\" whatever, it's not like, \"I'm director of X or VP of Y,\" because that, as a thing, didn't exist.\n\n(00:30:41):\nThen as we scaled, we came to the realization that there's actual value that people ascribe to titles. And the reason they ascribe value to titles is because there are rumors that there's life beyond HubSpot. I couldn't believe it. \"What? There's a life out there outside of HubSpot?\" It's like, \" Yeah, looks like.\" And then when we go to the Thanksgiving dinner or whatever, and I talk to my aunt, I need some shorthand. It's like, \"Oh yeah, I got promoted to director. I got...\" Just to show some progression because it's a signaling device.\n\n(00:31:11):\nAnd in this life beyond HubSpot and outside of HubSpot, it's like, other people are also going to want to know where I was in... It's like, \"Okay,\" and this was the winning argument. I love this argument. Because we had a daylong meeting on talking about this one topic. And the winning argument was, \"Dharmesh and Brian, I recognize why we don't have titles. I recognize this.\" And so they made the case of, \"Yeah, there's value. And by virtue of you not giving us titles, that means you're having to compensate us in an economic sense in other ways. So you're losing out because it's like, is that value high enough to not do that?\" That's a strong case.\n\n(00:31:50):\nAnd then we had it down to three choices. We're like, \"Okay, well,\" we could have chosen to just stay firm with still no titles. We could have said, \"Okay, we're going to have classic titles.\" Then I had the option on the table of, \"Make up your own title.\" You can be grand poobah of X, and that can be your... And then we ended up making the decision to go with classic titles because that actually served the need of, there's a benchmark, there's a standard, otherwise it doesn't mean anything. So having made-up titles is pretty much the equivalent of having no titles because they lack any meaning anyway. But that's one of those things that, okay, you iterate, you change things as they go.\n\nLenny (00:32:25):\nYeah. I think there's so much to this, \"Let's just try things differently. Okay, that didn't work. Okay. It's fine. We're just going to do what everyone else is doing here.\" And then often you discover a thing that, \"Okay, this is actually better.\"\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:32:36):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:32:36):\nJust to understand, when people have no titles, so someone say as a product manager, do you call them a product manager, or just like, \"I'm an employee at HubSpot, I have literally no title\"?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:32:45):\nAt the time, it was no title. And now we have classic titles, so we have levels of things and-\n\nLenny (00:32:50):\nYeah. But back then it's like, \"You're just here-\"\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:32:50):\nNo title. Literally no title.\n\nLenny (00:32:50):\n\"... we don't know exactly.\"\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:32:51):\nNo title.\n\nLenny (00:32:55):\nI saw somewhere that you paid everyone $5,000 monthly as their salary at the beginning of HubSpot, including yourselves for a long time.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:33:00):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:33:01):\nIs that right? Okay.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:33:02):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:33:02):\nAnother fun fact. How long did that last, by the way?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:33:04):\nI'm trying to think back. It's a long time ago. I want to say probably the first year, year and a half.\n\nLenny (00:33:11):\nAmazing.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:33:13):\nOne of the things that, and this is one of the core... And not everything that we... Obviously not everything was right, but not everything is applicable to other companies. But there are some things that I think are, and one of the things that I think are applicable is just this need to solve for simplicity. It's like the simpler you can make things in the early years, the better off you generally are. And this is going to sound weird, so how we wound up with transparency is not because of some moral, it's like, \"Oh, everyone deserved to have this,\" and this is the truth, so it's not some moral position. It was a, when we hired the first employee, and both Brian and I [inaudible 00:33:54], when we hired the first employee, we had to make the decision, it's like, \"Oh, so what files do we give them access to and what...\" And so Brian is just like, \"All of it. Nothing to hide. Why would we do that?\"\n\n(00:34:09):\nAnd so then we thought out... And then the output of that was like, \"Okay, well, A, binary decisions are much easier than non-binary decisions.\" It's like, \"Okay, everything or nothing is much, much simpler.\" And then it's like, \"Okay, well, if it works for Employee Number Three in the company, why wouldn't it work at Four? Why wouldn't it work at Five? Why wouldn't it work at 50?\" And we just kept doing it because it's like, \"Okay, well, until it breaks, we'll just keep doing that.\" And this applies to so many different aspects of HubSpot, but as we try to start with the simplest possible thing that might work, and then, if necessary, add the complexity, add the things or whatever. Even our original, this is actually the tactical thing that everyone should take away, especially early-stage startups, very first HubSpot office has exactly four tables because aspirations for growth, because we were in a co-working space, so, we lived in WeWork back in the day, here in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n(00:35:04):\nAnd so we had four chairs, and the only distinguishing characteristic of the four chairs, there were two chairs that were by the window, two chairs, not by the window. Okay, great. Hire that first employee. Other decision we have to make is like, \"Okay, well where do people sit?\" And so this one is like, \"Well, it feels unfair to us that we would just get the window seats or whatever.\" It's like, \"Okay, we believe in a flat organization, why?\" And so what we did is we said, \"Oh, we'll just do a lottery.\" And it's not like, \"Oh, whoever pulls the thing gets the window seat.\" Whoever pulls gets to choose from the remaining seats, because different people ascribe different utility to different seats. It's like maybe you don't want a window seat. Maybe you like the darker corner, whatever it is.\n\n(00:35:42):\nAnd so we did that with employee number one. Then we did that with employee number two, and we did it every time we hired a new employee, we would do a seat shuffle. We're going to do the lottery, we're going to go down the sequence, and of all the seats, that was the algorithm. And our investors were like, \"Oh, that's cute and that's funny. It's not going to work at 15, 20 people. It's not going to work at 50.\" It worked at 25 worked at 50, worked at 100, worked at 200. We updated the algorithm, we did some local optimizations, which we said, \"Oh, there are some groups that should not be next to other groups because engineers like quiet time and salespeople don't, and so we're going to try to optimize a little bit.\" So it's not completely random anymore. Now it's like within this part of... Well, we still would do it. Then we said, \"Okay, we're not going to do it for every hire, we're going to do it every quarter.\" And that stood, by the way, for hundreds of people, that mechanism still worked. It's like it's... Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:36:37):\nOh my God.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:36:38):\nSo the moral of the story is, that one decision of simplifying, can you imagine the amount of politics we avoided? In corporate America, the amount of calories spent is like, \"Well, your office is bigger than my office. Your desk is one inch higher or one...\" Like, \"No.\" It's like all of that just went away by virtue of that one decision. And we don't even know, it's incalculable, honestly, how much grief that saved us. And then there's all other side benefits to it in terms of people getting to know each other better, better chemistry, there's lots of good upside, but just the simplicity is almost always a better answer.\n\nLenny (00:37:13):\nI love that everything often comes back to some algorithm you've developed or this N-plus-one approach of, \"Let's just keep going until something goes wrong.\" This is amazing. I'm excited for many more of these hilarious, amazing examples of how you did things differently. You've been talking about simplicity. The opposite extreme is, you could say, entropy, and someone told me that you have this concept that every leader in every business is fighting the second law of thermodynamics, which I believe is entropy.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:37:42):\nYeah. Well, the actual law is within a closed system, entropy increases over time.\n\nLenny (00:37:47):\nOkay.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:37:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:37:48):\nOkay.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:37:49):\nWe don't have to get into the [inaudible 00:37:50] of this.\n\nLenny (00:37:50):\nNo, I love this.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:37:50):\nI'm not a physics guy.\n\nLenny (00:37:51):\nNo, we're getting to the first principles of everything. Talk about that. What does that mean when you... And what does that look like when you're running a business?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:37:59):\nOkay, so in lay person's terms, the second law of thermodynamics, I'm paraphrasing here, is that, \"Over time, unless you intervene, everything goes to crap.\" I'm paraphrasing. Which is, essentially, the amount of disorder and randomness in a system is going to increase over time. You see this like when you break an egg, the molecules don't come together and form an egg. That doesn't happen. It's always the other way around becomes disorderly and more random. That's the second law of thermodynamics. And this happens in companies as well, and it happens in code, almost every level of abstraction, you will see some variation of this. And so the way I think about this is that in the early stages of a company, you're essentially fighting to survive. Just trying not to die. That's the thing. Okay, priority one, don't die. In the second phase of a company, you're trying not to stagnate. But it's like you still want to be able to drive growth and be able to do things like, \"Okay, we managed not to die, because stagnation is essentially death, so we're still trying not to die.\"\n\n(00:38:58):\nBut then the third stage is you're fighting complexity. And that's the thing that you will crumble under your own weight over time, absent some external intervention. And you see this happen all the time, and it shows up and manifests in different ways, which is, everything gets more complicated. You need more layers of management, more headcount, more this, more that, more everything. Everything becomes harder. Margins go... It's like just bad things start to happen, you become slower. And that's the eventual... It's a slower death, because you're at more scale now, but it's still eventual death. Complexity does kill companies. Maybe not as quickly as other things, but much more reliably than other things.\n\n(00:39:38):\nAnd so this is why it's never too early to plant the seeds of simplicity, put them in there, make that part of the culture of the organization. And we have a thing that are part of our culture and guiding principles around what I call \"fight for simplicity.\" It's literally those three words. And the message we're trying to convey is, \"Simplicity is worth fighting for.\" That's thing number one, it's important, but the other one is that it requires fighting for. It does not happen, and it will be a fight, because the universe is working against you. And it will take calories to fight for that simplicity, because everything, even well-intentioned people, will introduce complexity because that's the natural way of the world. We want more tiers in our pricing, we want these knobs and dials in the product, we want these more... It's like all of it tends towards the second law and entropy increases. So anyway.\n\nLenny (00:40:28):\nI love this. The algorithm for seating is a good example of this. Is there any other examples, either in the product or strategy, where you pushed for simplicity and that ended up being right?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:40:39):\nYeah. So on the product side, in the early years, and Brian gets credit for the actual implementation of this. So we had a relatively broad product, and we can talk about that, pros and cons of that even in the early years, but we were solving for simplicity, and we got this from Apple, we can talk a little bit more about genesis of this, but we had a rule in the HubSpot product as the product grew in those early years that every time you added what we thought of as a knob or dial, called a feature, you had to take one out somewhere else. That's a net amount of... And this is a very coarse measurement. It's like, \"Okay, well, not every radio button, checkbox, drop-down, whatever menu item that you put in your nav is necessarily equivalent, but it's better than nothing. It's better than having no constraints.\n\n(00:41:27):\nAnd so once again, this goes to the binary thing, it's like it just at least forces you to think about it, versus the... The other mistake I think people make in product all the time is that we measure the cost of a feature based on the, usually, or even a new product, based on the cost of implementation. That's the first-order thinking, it's like, \"Oh, it's going to take six months to develop, it's going to be Y engineers and Z designers or whatever.\" Second-order thinking is thinking through the maintenance of that feature. It's like, \"Oh, it's not just the first version that goes out, it's like now we have this code base and we have to support and improve or whatever.\" I get that. The third-order thinking, which I think is the most nuanced, and it turns out to be the most important, is the other costs that complexity adds.\n\n(00:42:12):\nOkay, we'll come back to this. So when you go from product number one to product number two, it's like, \"Okay, product number two is going to cost us this much to develop, it's going to have this risk associated with whether it's successful or not, all these things. So there's going to be this carrying cost for product number two.\" What companies don't think through is that that is... And the maintenance of that, it's like, \"Oh, we're going to need a team to maintain that new product.\" No, what actually happens is that now when you go from product one to two, you have added dimensional complexity to your business.\n\n(00:42:43):\nWhat I mean by that, it's not an incremental increase like, \"Oh, we went from one to two,\" it's like, now every decision you make has to be made through the lens of, \"Now we have two products. We just hired an engineer, do they work on product number one or product number two? We're going to launch a marketing campaign. Do we spend five minutes talking about product number one and two minutes talking about product number two? How do we do anything?\" Every chart you look at in terms of the growth, revenue per whatever, it's all of it. Now, every chart that you ever had now has to be sliced by product one and product two in order to really capture that precision.\n\n(00:43:14):\nAnd so now you have this new dimensional complexity that you just hadn't planned on. And this applies, once again, every level of abstraction. So everything you do in your business should factor in the long-term cost of that complexity. And it should be worth it. Of course, you need, and I can make the case that you need to build product number two and product number N, N plus one over time, but you should be mindful about the cost of that complexity. [inaudible 00:43:39].\n\nLenny (00:43:39):\nIs there something you've done to help operationalize that? Because I imagine everyone's like, \"Yes, this is great. Don't do too many things. Simplify.\" Hard to do when you're like, \"Oh, we got to drive growth. We have this awesome idea, we have this opportunity, we have a competitor.\" I know that this is part of the culture, so maybe that's the answer, but how do you keep people to actually this principle?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:44:01):\nSo it's really hard, I'll say that. And things that have made it easier, it's a little bit idiosyncratic to HubSpot, so part of what has made it easier for us to keep things simple is the early constraints we impose. And we didn't know this at the time. So because we're building for SMB, we have a freemium product. All right, well, when you're doing that, there is literally a limit to how much complexity you can add, because we don't have an army of people that are going to spend in 18 months implementing something. We have to be able to support a product that's free. That's hard to do. It has to be simple enough that someone can get value from this thing. And so there's these self-imposed things.\n\n(00:44:41):\nSo the lesson I would carry away is come up with systematic ways and mechanisms, as Amazon would call them, of putting guardrails and constraints in to the degree that you can. Because you can put words on a page and try to infuse it in the culture, it's like, \"Oh, we believe in simplicity, we fight for this,\" and you can have meetings and you can get up in all-hands meetings and reinforce that, which I encourage you to do, but a really, even a reasonably well done system will outbeat any other mechanism that you can try to put it [inaudible 00:45:14]. Those things deteriorate over time. It's hard to scale them. So I'm a big believer in systems and imposed constraints versus-\n\nLenny (00:45:22):\nI can't help but talk about this SMB piece, because I do a lot of angel investing, and classically, companies that focus on small businesses are very challenging, because getting to small businesses at scale is very hard. They're often more old school, not early adopters. You sell one and that's just one small customer, and they're not going to upgrade and roll it out to this large group, and they're not going to increase spend very quickly. For founders that are exploring SMB or trying to win something SMB, any advice other than just, maybe the advice is, \"Probably don't do it, it's very hard\"?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:45:58):\nNo, my advice is absolutely do it.\n\nLenny (00:46:00):\nAmazing. Great.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:46:02):\nA, because it's hard, and we'll talk about that, but B, okay, so I'll tell you this quick story in terms of how we chose SMB. And so my co-founder and I met in grad school, and he had done software, he was on the sales and marketing side, I was on the product engineering side, didn't know each other before grad school, and we met there. But one of the things, as we were canoodling on possible ideas of working together on the startup, we said, \"Oh,\" we had done both an enterprise software before, the opposite of opposite of SMB. And there are definitely challenges with enterprise software. One of the biggest one is that life as an enterprise software company sucks as a startup. Sales cycles are super long, feedback loops are super long, you have to have sale, there's all this kind of... You have revenue concentration, which means you don't completely own your product roadmap anymore because whoever's writing the biggest check will ask for these three things and it's really hard to say no, especially as a startup, all these things that go along with that.\n\n(00:47:03):\nIt's like, \"Okay, we sort of know that game.\" At the other end of the spectrum, you have consumer startups. It's like, \"Okay.\" The problem with consumer startups is they have very bi-modal outcomes. It's like either you can be super successful, the next Meta, the next Google, the next whatever, or it's going to be to zero. It is very rare that you have, \"Oh, you made a few million bucks or whatever.\" Because either worked, because this is a massive market. The case for SMB is you have almost the best of both worlds. You have the nicety of enterprise, which is, \"Oh, I can solve a product and people pay me money for it. I don't have to be advertising subsidized, I don't have this bi-modal outcome. I can build an incrementally more valuable business that's measurable.\"\n\n(00:47:43):\nSo we're \"Oh,\" we went from a 100K in ARR to a million ARR, to 2 million ARR because we're a business software company. But it has the benefit of consumer because there's millions of them out there to sell to, and there is no revenue concentration. You do control your roadmap. You have very short feedback loops. You can try pretty much anything that you want because there's... Like, \"Oh, we have 50 customers. If we do this and screw it up, it's like there's 5 million more.\" Don't intentionally screw it up, but you can experiment, you can take on risks. And by the way, when HubSpot started SMB, it was literally a hundred times harder to succeed in SMB. And we could not raise capital. It was so hard because the common argument was there literally is exactly one company in the history of software that's made a global brand, billions of dollars of market that was into it. No one else had ever created SMB-focused software company before.\n\n(00:48:37):\nAnd we're like, \"Yeah.\" It's like, \"We know.\" But the nice thing about it is once you figure the physics of it out, because it's so hard to do, you end up, and this has played out, now there's lots more proof points. There's Shopify, there's a bunch of companies that have succeeded in SMB. But one of the things about SMB is that in the software market... By the way, all I know is software. That's the scope of my experience, is that in software, there's what I call reverse gravity. That over time, the market will always pull you up. Because what ends up happening is that smart founders and smart management teams will look at the numbers and say, \"Oh, well, as it turns out, our bigger customers stay with us longer, pay us more, often have higher NP, all these things.\"\n\n(00:49:27):\nAnd so if you allow yourself to be led by that, which seems like a reasonable, smart thing to do, you will get pulled up in the market. And because of this reverse gravity, almost every company winds up being, every successful software company, ends up being an enterprise software company over the full list of time. That's what you see. The byproduct of that reverse gravity is that every software company ends up being an enterprise software company, so you end up competing with literally everyone. In the SMB world, you're only competing with the people stupid enough to stay focused on SMB, or try to do that. It's a harder thing to accomplish, but once you figure out the physics of it and make it work, it's a much more sustainable, much more fun model. So I encourage, particularly startups, and maybe you fight reverse gravity for some period of time, and maybe... But at least start there, try to make it work, until it gets really, really, really painful, and then try some more. It's like there's just so much value in SMB. It's that idea.\n\nLenny (00:50:29):\nOkay, so this theme has come up a bunch already in our conversation. I asked Chris Miller, previous podcast guest, what you're amazing at and what I should talk to you about. And he said that you're very good at zigging when other people are zagging, and zagging when other people are zigging. And I think that's already come across in our conversation. I guess, is there anything else along those lines that you think might be helpful to people, in terms of how you think about that, or examples of that in action?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:50:52):\nSo this comes down to high-conviction, low-consensus bets. And so we had like three things that we were zigging... And by the way, it's not just me. My co-founder and I both have that zig versus zag. And we ask ourselves this to this day, it's like, \"Okay, well we understand this is the way the world moves, this is the way it's normally done, but have we considered this completely? And I'm not saying we should do it, but have we considered this alternate path?\" So I would encourage you, at any stage of the company, you don't necessarily have to do the zig versus zag, but you should at least know what the zig would've been and have talked it through. So that's thing number one.\n\n(00:51:29):\nSome of the best startup advice I've heard and I've ever given is, \"Startups should focus on one thing and be really, really exceptionally world-class better than anyone else at that one thing.\" And one of our early zigs is, \"We are going to do exactly the opposite of that.\" So from year one, HubSpot decided to build an SEO tool, web analytics, blogging tool, content management, all of it. And every one of those categories that we were building a product in, literally this is year one, had great products with great companies behind them. And so it's like, \"Okay, well, why would you do that?\" And-\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:52:00):\nAnd so it's like, okay, well why would you do that? And the reason is that the one thing we wanted to be good at was solving for the actual customer problem that existed, and the customer problem that existed was not a dearth of tools, lots of great SEO blogging, everything, all the tools existed, but SMB specifically did not have the wherewithal to put all those pieces together. So you and I, it's like, \"Oh, I can throw a website up. I can put Google Analytics on it. I can put a Wufoo Typeform format. I can do all these things. I can wire doc. No big deal. Why is this so hard?\" But for most people, most SMBs, that's a science project, and so we said, okay, in order for us to solve the actual customer problem, we have to solve the actual customer problem, even if it's uncomfortable, even though it's contrarian and every instinct and every advice we've heard or given says we should not do this. We should not go that broad.\n\n(00:52:53):\nBut once we make that decision so that the other lesson learned, it's like, and we said this in the early years and it's gotten better since, let's say you do this, and this is the all-in-one approach, we're going to have this broad-based product. It's like, \"Okay, we're going to be many miles wide and only so inches deep.\" One of these, and this goes back to our very systematic thinking, is like, \"Okay, we're going to measure each of those individual product categories that we're now playing in. Are we in the top three in the market in that category? If the answer is yes, that means we invested too much in that category.\" We should not be in the top three because our value proposition is not that we are the top three blogging tools or one of the top three web analytics tools. We have the top three, whatever, our value proposition is that everything works so well together that that being in the top three and having those right features or whatever doesn't matter.\n\n(00:53:41):\nDoesn't matter as much as the all-in-one. And that means we over-index on one individual category by virtue. That was one of our heuristics for being able to tell that we were over-indexed on one particular aspect of it.\n\nLenny (00:53:51):\nThat is hilarious. Rarely do I hear we're in the top three and we're doing the wrong thing. We are too good at this.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:54:00):\nAnd by the way, and we changed that over time in the startup world, and now I would argue that most of the categories we play in, we are, as the surveys would tell you that we're in the top three in each of those categories now, but at the time when we are very, very resource constrained, we were trying to be disciplined and focused.\n\nLenny (00:54:17):\nWe're just racking up all these very contrarian approaches to company building. I imagine people listening to this might feel like, \"Okay, cool, I'm just going to build a bunch of stuff. This is great. I worked for HubSpot.\" Do you have any heuristics for when it makes sense to go wide and not deep that you share with founders? When do you think it makes sense versus now you should actually follow the common advice here?\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:54:37):\nYeah, so it comes down to what problem you're solving. So I think one of the mistakes I think founders make is that, especially product oriented founders, is that we fall in love with the solution instead of falling in love with the actual problem, and you need to fall in love with the problem and putting that constraint on yourself forces you to understand and at least label and define what problem you're solving because oftentimes we can describe our product or whatever, but we struggle sometimes as founders to describe the actual problem. So if you can make the case, which HubSpot did, it's like, okay, it's not like we immediately jump to that like, \"Oh, we have this epiphany. We're going to build the all-in-one, do all the things kind of thing.\" We're like, \"Oh, in actually talking to customers\", we considered doing it like, \"Oh, we'll just do this marketing piece.\"\n\n(00:55:27):\nWe'll just do this or whatever. It's like, no, that's not their issue, their issues it's not that these things don't exist, so if you, as a result of talking to customers and understanding the problem deeply, you come to the conclusion that you need to do more than just one thing, but then you should force yourself to have a discipline that we did, which is, here's why we're going to go a little bit broad, and here's how we're going to make sure that that broadness doesn't kill us. You have to have the self-imposed constraint. You can't have the best of both worlds. You can't say, \" We're going to be all in one, and oh, by the way, we're going to be the best.\" No, you can't be the best. You can say, we solve this particular problem the best, but we're not going to have the best product along any of those dimensions.\n\nLenny (00:56:11):\nAmazing. I love this advice.\n\nLenny (00:56:14):\nImagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B-to-B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10 x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team for Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn ads you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers, including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs, and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B-to-B.\n\n(00:57:04):\nIn tech, LinkedIn generated two to five x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B-to-B world you operate in. Make B-to-B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/pod Lenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/ pod Lenny. Terms and conditions apply.\n\nLenny (00:57:33):\nOkay, I'm going to go in a totally different direction for now and see where this takes us. I want to talk about flash tags.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:57:38):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:57:38):\nSo this is something that you came up with that came from a problem of you're founder, people come to you for feedback, you give them some random thought, and they treat that as gospel and they go do it and spending months fixing something that you're like, oh, it's just a thought. Talk about flash tags.\n\nDharmesh Shah (00:57:55):\nAnd this is exactly the problem. It's not just, once again, most things exist at every level of abstraction. So anyone that manages people, anyone that leaves has this exact same issue. It's the megaphone issue. Someone will pass you in the hall when we had offices in halls, they'll ask you a question, and as it turns out, this is particularly true of founders. I have an opinion on everything, literally everything. So if you ask me a question I will have, it won't be thought out, it won't be right, but I will have one, right? And so the challenge is people will take that and over-index on what was an opinion, and because it's inefficient to qualify every time someone asks you something, every time you put an email out there and say, \"Oh, by the way\", this is just my opinion, you can put IMHO or something like that every now and then, but then people say, \"Oh, that's just politeness\", or something like that, right?\n\n(00:58:43):\nOkay, so here's what flash tags are literally, and I live most of my life through email, but I do this in other media as well. It's like the hashtag that we all know, but it's a discrete set of them, an escalating set of what I call the dying on the hill spectrum. So here's how it goes. The bottom hashtag is hashtag FYI, and the definition of the FYI is, \"I came across this interesting blog post\", or \"I found this news, or whatever, just letting you know, no response expected\", fine, go on with your life. Next level up is hashtag suggestion. \"I have this thought that came into my head because I listened to the episode on Lenny's podcast with Sam from Microsoft or whatever, and this feels like it'd be a good thing to explore, but hashtag suggestion means I still don't expect a response.\"\n\n(00:59:36):\n\"You don't have to do the thing I'm asking, but it is something that I would do if I were you, or at least I would consider if I were you.\" Okay, next level up is hashtag recommendation. Hashtag recommendation is, \"I've thought about this a lot. I've done some research, I've done some digging, I've done some soul-searching. I would do this.\" It's still not a, \"You have to do this, but if you decide not to do this, I would appreciate a response in terms of why you don't want to do this, what you learned in the process of exploring this particular thing, other alternatives or something.\" So it's like a response expected, but still not a mandate. And then the last one is hashtag plea. \"I beg of you, we don't have mandates at HubSpot. I have thought about this so much to my core, in my soul, I believe this is the thing we should be doing. I'm going to plea with you to please just do this.\"\n\n(01:00:34):\nStill not a mandate, by the way, and so now it's commonly accepted. It's on the Wiki, and I use this multiple times every day. Other people at HubSpot use it. It is remarkably effective because self-descriptive hashtags are searchable, but you can go back, and it's like, \"Oh, I want to know the last five hashtag recommendations that I made, how those turn out?\" There's just so much goodness that comes out of it. It's not hard to understand or describe.\n\nLenny (01:01:04):\nIt's really interesting that none of them are just do it. You say that there's no concept of there's no mandates, essentially. Why is that? And do you feel like people just treat plea as, \"Okay, I actually just really have to do this?\"\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:01:16):\nSo we've always had, as part of early manifestation of HubSpot culture, we believe in autonomy. Lots of companies believe in autonomy, and we try to carry that idea as far as we can, and for the most part we do that and that, and we hashtag plea as part of that. This is like we trust our people. We try to hire the best. We expect them to learn, and we still want them to have the discretion to be able to make hard decisions, and we call them DRIs. We didn't invent that term directly responsible individual. And we'll talk more about, we should talk about more about decisions and how decisions get made but the reason I do hashtag plea is that it's a soft way of a mandate without being a mandate. It's like, okay, and by the way, the number of times that happens is I can count on the fingers of one hand and still have fingers left over.\n\n(01:02:09):\nThat almost never gets to that because either I talk myself out of it. It's like, okay, and this goes to the, is this a hill I'm willing to die on? Right? It's like, okay, I get it. I may disagree. Is it the end of the world? Is it really going to do that much harm? And is the cost of imposing that founder card go do this? It does happen just not that often.\n\nLenny (01:02:34):\nAwesome. And we'll link to that. There's a post you wrote about how to use these.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:02:37):\nIt's flashtag.org If you want a quick way just to get to that blog post. I believe in domain names and shortcuts because I believe in simplicity.\n\nLenny (01:02:44):\nYou mentioned decision making. There's something interesting there. Talk about how you make decisions at HubSpot.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:02:49):\nLike most organizations, HubSpot historically has made decisions poorly. It is just all a spectrum. I think decisions that were the hardest things because it's hard to strike the balance, and we've evolved it over. I think we're much better than we were in our earlier years. The things we get wrong, most people get wrong, and so I'll tell you the things we get right now is that, so we're very data oriented. We like to make data informed decisions, but data doesn't make decisions, people do. So that's like thing number one. It's like you have lots of geeky founding companies or whatever. It's like, \"Oh, we have a chart that says this, so we should go do that\". That doesn't work, doesn't work outside, data's awesome, and we also have one position that we designate to make the decision, and that is not necessarily the executive over that team.\n\n(01:03:41):\nIt's like, okay, well, and they literally own that. And we didn't invent this idea either. This existed long before HubSpot, but it actually works. It's like you have to decide who's going to make a decision, and that is almost the number one decision to make, and it's like, okay, don't pick people you don't trust to make the decision, and so that's kind of thing number two. And the biggest mistake, and we used to make this much more than we make now, is, and Amazon has stated this really well, theirs is called disagree and commit. We have a slight twist on, I'll tell you why we twist it a little bit. Ours is debate, decide, unite. That's our kind of phrase that we use in HubSpot culture, but the idea here, the core premise of it is that once you make a decision, getting alignment around that decision, because there will always be at any amount of scale, people that disagree with that decision because they were debating the other side, they would of picked option A and we ended up picking option B.\n\n(01:04:42):\nBut it's extremely important that even when a decision gets made and we decided to do something that's contrary to the thing that you believe and would've debated for and did debate for, you lost on that particular one, fine. Hard to do, but so important, so valuable, and I'll tell you why we tweaked the Amazon one. So the disagree and commit sounds a little bit harsher than we like, which is out. It's fine for you, disagree, but then F and commit, right? It's like, okay, I get that. I'm biased. So the debate is, okay, so let's have open debate. Let's get all the options on the table. Let's actually make the decision, and then it's unite around that decision, not just, it's like, okay, let's come together around that, and that sounds more Hubspotty so anyway.\n\nLenny (01:05:33):\nIt is a lot more friendly. I was thinking that as you were talking, debate, decide, unite versus disagree and commit, and then there's have backbone in that one.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:05:42):\nThe other thing I'll tell you, this is partly HubSpot thing with partly a me thing, and this will not surprise you at all, is I like to think systematically around decisions, and so I'll give you an example. The question I ask myself when faced with a decision or a thing that I'm trying to do is, \"Okay, if I could write Python code of Python function to come up with an answer to this, what would be variables or the coefficients\", okay, let's say you're not, if you were making Excel spreadsheet to make this decision, what would the columns be? All right, you don't have to decide the weights, but at least decide the factors. Then the next step is like, okay, here are the factors that I think matter in the making of this decision. I'm going to decide between these seven options. Here are the things I'm going to look at.\n\n(01:06:33):\nYou would do this for picking a school to go to, or it works and you don't have to take it to the nth degree, but the exercise of going through it's like, \"Okay, well step one, if I can just identify the factors that I think should impact this decision, that's an 80% win right there.\" Not because it's just in head. If the team works collectively to say, \"Okay, here are all the factors that I think should contribute to the making of this decision.\" Then number two is, okay, we can't assign exact weights, so we can't write the Excel formula just yet or the Python code, but can we at least stack-rate the factors? This factor is more important than that factor. Now you get a closer sense of approximation. You're still not going to use the spreadsheet to make the decision, but the human making a decision has much better information they had than pre-going through that exercise.\n\n(01:07:21):\nOne of the mistakes people make around decisions, and Amazon has written about this, I'll give you my take on it, is that the calories you spend on a decision should be proportional to the consequences of that decision, pure and simple. He calls them one-way doors versus two-way doors, which is a binary heuristic, which is, I love the elegance and simplicity of that. I'm taking it one level further, which is, it literally should be proportional. It's like, okay, if you have a really, really big decision that's going to be expensive to change, really, really, but a lot of calories making that decision, you may still get it wrong, but it's worth it. And it's not just around decisions, around activities and bests and things that you're going to do is that the calories you spend should be proportional to the outcomes and what you're seeking and the value of it.\n\n(01:08:06):\nAnd that's one of the things I try to apply to my life. It's like, okay, my geeky nature wants me to go nine miles deep and start writing code and do this thing or whatever, but I found that that one simple thing is like, okay, is this a first-order approximation where I can just identify the factors or it can, and the other thing that helps by the way is, and we'll talk about this. So one is my default position on most things, and I don't mean this in a negative way, is, no. It's like, \"Oh, shiny object. Should I go do this?\" \"No.\" And then I have to force myself like, \"Okay, I need reasons to say yes.\" I have to force myself because it's easy to say I love new things, I love new people, I love all of that. So I have a, sorry, but no post on my blog that life-changing for me.\n\n(01:08:57):\nAnd so the idea there is that this goes back to other first principles is time is with a few constants. So every time you say yes to something, by definition you're saying no to something else, and so this goes back to the product heuristic we were using in the earlier years of our class. Like, oh, when you put something in, you have to take something out because we want to keep the complexity roughly constant if we can. Same thing, so it's okay to say yes to things, but then you have to force yourself, based on the calories that you're committing to say, \"Okay, well, what am I going to take out of my schedule, out of my life, in order for me to be able to make room for this thing?\" Because as it turns out time, I have not been able to, despite my best attempts, bend the laws of space and time. So how do I make room for this new thing that I want to say yes to?\n\nLenny (01:09:44):\nI love the way your mind works. I'm excited to talk about culture and how this connects and the way you think about culture and through all these frameworks and lenses. Before we do that, you hinted at this idea of how you pick what to work on. And I know you have kind of an interesting framework for how to decide what ideas are good and what ideas are worth investing in. I think both as a founder and a product leader, how do you think about deciding what is worth investing in?\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:10:08):\nSo imagine the Excel spreadsheet again. So let's say you're a value and idea for a startup, for a new product, a new feature, whatever happens to be, I think this applies. So the first thing you should look at is, and I measure things on a scale of zero to 10 because I like quantifiable things. I like to be able to multiply X by Y. I don't like letter grades, pet peeve of mine, but anyway, so put a number on it. It's like, okay, if this thing were successful, so let's say we're just picking a new startup idea. I'm considering starting this new business. If it were successful, what could it be? What's the magnet to the outcome? However you decide, it could be impact, it could be revenue, it could be market cap, it could be portfolio, whatever it is, it doesn't matter. I mean, it matters, but not relevant for this discussion.\n\n(01:10:48):\nSo that's the potential. Thing number two is probability of success. And now I'm going to pause here and tell you the most common mistake people make is they think through the probability first without actually forcing themselves to think through the potential, and here's what happens is if they apply a filter that says, \"Oh, I only have a one in 10 chance to pull this off, there's only a 10% success rate or whatever\", not going to do that. Well, if it's a one in 10%, one in 10 chance at 10 billion, it might be worth it. It might be maybe not. Sometimes it's based on stage of life and things like that in terms of risks you can afford, but for instance, so by the way, and when I say probability, that's the biggie side. I mean, you can do it multiple ways. You can say, \"Oh, here's the X percent chance you can do in statistics as an event entry.\"\n\n(01:11:37):\nIt's like, oh, here's path A, there's a Y percent chance that happens, and here's what the outcome would be, Z percent chance or X. Anyway, here are the popular things, and you come up with what's called the expected value. Anyway, so let's say we just look at two branches like, \"Oh, there's a fifty-fifty chance that I'm going to make 10 million.\" It won't tickle one branch just to keep this shorter. So the expected value of that is $5 million. That's literally the expected value. It's like, oh, you got a fifty-fifty chance at a 10 million outcome, and let's say you have a 10% chance at a hundred million dollar outcome or 500, whatever it is. So mathematically, it's like, okay, well, you should at least consider that other one, even though the chances are lower because the expected value is higher. Okay? So that's thing number one. Anyway, we'll get through the rest.\n\n(01:12:22):\nSo start with the potential outcome, then look at probability not the other way around because then you're going to apply that mental filter and throw out ideas that may not have been worth throwing out. The third thing is what I think of is either passion or proximity. Do you care about this actual thing that you can actually bring to bear? And then the fourth is, since I need a P word, it's like prowess. Do you have some assets? Something that makes you uniquely positioned? Either if you're building a new product, you have existing lines of code that you can reuse, you have a market that you already have access to, there's something about this particular idea that you have an unfair advantage pursuing, and that impacts your probability of success, and this is the other reason. You need to look at all those things, and once again, no one thing is the deciding factor.\n\n(01:13:15):\nYou're not going to just pick the thing that has the high expected value to take the potential times, whatever. It's like you have to sort of look at all of them and look at your own situation, but it helps to think through that, to have the discipline to say, \"Oh, how big could it be? What are the chances? How much do I care about solving this problem? Is this something I can work on for two years, 10 years, 20 years?\" And finally, \"Why me? Why me? Why my company? Why would we succeed at this? Why it's our chance of success, even low, higher than the rest of the world?\" Like why?\n\nLenny (01:13:48):\nOkay, so I'm already picturing the spreadsheet here. For every idea you have, you basically have a column, potential probability of success.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:13:55):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:13:56):\nProximity, you said? Just like how...\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:13:57):\nParticular passion.\n\nLenny (01:13:58):\nOkay, passion.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:14:00):\nYeah. I started with passion, and I have an issue with passion as a word because it's ambiguous, because we talk within startup circles. It's like, \"Oh, pursue your passion.\" Sure, but it's like, you know what? Most of the companies that exist today that are even successful ones with awesome founders, they didn't necessarily pursue their passion. It's like they maybe are baffled in their scenario, particular problem, or a market segment or something like that, but it's like it's okay to become passionate about something as you dig into it or whatever. That's fine too.\n\nLenny (01:14:38):\nYeah, one of my favorite startups that I've invested in, it's called Zip. It's a procurement platform. The founders were not passionate about procurement when they got into the space, they just saw a huge opportunity. They thought they could build a much better product, and they got passionate about it once they started working on it and finding products.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:14:54):\nThis is the thing. So yes, if you can find your true calling and this is what you were meant to do in the world, and you have the opportunity to do it, great. That's a tiny, small fraction of people. It doesn't happen. You may not even know what your passion be, especially if you're a first time founder. It's like, okay, well, I haven't seen the world. I don't know.\n\nLenny (01:15:15):\nOkay. So just for people, if they're creating a spreadsheet for all their ideas, for startups, it's potential, probability of success, passion, prowess.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:15:24):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:15:25):\nOkay. Amazing. Okay, let's talk about culture. I know you spent a lot of your time on helping build HubSpot's culture, create the original culture. You created this epic culture code deck. I think it's 128 pages. So maybe just to dive into it, what was that process like to define the culture of a company and maintain the culture over time?\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:15:48):\nI'll say awful. No, the beginning of it. Okay, so I'll give you the very quick story because my co-founder and I, having one of our founders meetings or founders dinners as we do, and he had been meeting with this CEO group, and he said, \"Oh, Dharmesh, I hear this culture thing is really important.\" By the way, the word culture had never been mentioned prior to this conversation, the halls of HubSpot ever. And this was how many years in? This is, I want to say three or four years in. I can check the records because by the way, even Brian and I, even back when people work on offices, most of our communication was over email and Async. We've always been big believers in that written form, but anyway, so I can tell you whether you know where cultural was used or not, and it was not.\n\n(01:16:36):\nAnd he's like, \"Oh, I've heard\", because talking to us, \"Culture is super important. Dharmesh, can you go do that?\" I'm like, \"Okay, Brian, all the people in all the companies, I am literally the bottom decile, if not the worst possible person. It's not that I don't like people, I just don't like being around them a whole lot, and from what little I know of culture, it sort of involves people. I don't know, but it seems like I'd be the wrong person.\" But anyway, I'm a team player. I'm like, okay, it does feel like it would be important, and so I took on the task and I didn't really know because when he said, \"Dharmesh, can you go do that?\" What does that mean? And so when I took it to mean, it's like, okay, well culture actually already exists. We have a culture. It's like whatever it is, and it's working pretty well, companies doing well, people seem happy.\n\n(01:17:32):\nAnd so I said, \"Okay, well, what I'm really trying to do is kind of describe the culture that's there.\" So it's not creating culture, it's articulating the culture, so we know what it is, and so then this is the side of me showing up again. So the question I asked myself is I literally asked myself this question, which is, \"If I could write a Python function that would measure the probability of success of a new person coming into HubSpot, what would the factors be?\" What are the things that if I could measure, if I knew I had a true function that says, \"Oh, on a scale of zero to 10...\"\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:18:00):\nIf I knew, if I had a truth function that says, \"Oh, on a scale of 0 to 10, here's how they rank on this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this,\" I could approximate how successful and how good they're going to be for HubSpot. That's my exercise.\n\n(01:18:13):\nOkay. So I did an internal survey, and I'll tell you why this was such an awful experience in the beginning, because this is also a good story. So once I took on this task, I sent an email to the company. It's like, \"Hey, everyone. I'm just going to be digging into culture, so I'm going to send this survey out. I just want to get an understanding so I can...\" Great. And the negativity and the visceral response to that one email was literally up until that point, it still ranks in top three, worst things I've ever...\n\n(01:18:47):\nPeople felt so negatively and so strongly, and I was not expecting it, right? And I'll tell you, the one line that really just was gut-wrenching was like, \"Dharmesh, here we're talking about culture. Next, we're going to have like posters up on the wall about excellence. HubSpot is not the company that I thought I joined.\" Like oh. It is just like the deep part of me is like I just did not know how overloaded that idea of culture was, right? And so then when you dig into it, it's like, oh, because so many companies had done it so poorly and just didn't walk the walk or whatever, this is why. There was a reason why there was this kind of negative response.\n\n(01:19:30):\nSo anyway. So I went back to my thing. It's like, \"I get it. So I'm going to try to describe what we have, and I'm going to write this truth function.\" So I wrote the slide deck, which had exactly 16 slides, and that answered this one question, which is, if I could write a Python code, what are the factors, so what are the attributes that we would look for in humans. And the reason I came up with that particular question is that when I did the survey, I did the NPS survey, which everyone knows that you would send to customers. It's like, \"Oh, on a field of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend HubSpot as a place to work?\" and the other NPS question is like, \"Why did you give that answer?\"\n\n(01:20:12):\nAs it turns out, here's the thing that I've learned which was troubling, everyone was happy, and the reason they were happy is because of the other people at HubSpot. That was the number one reason, which is both good and bad. It's like okay, well, that's awesome, but that doesn't tell me anything, right? It's like, okay, well, that's a self-reinforcing kind of recursive loop. And so that's when I was like, \"Okay, well, what makes the people at HubSpot the people that are at HubSpot? Let's come up with the attributes that define what it means to be one of these people that makes other people happy.\"\n\n(01:20:44):\nAnd so we came up with the original set of things that were embodied in that slide deck, and I called that slide deck the Culture Code deck, and the reason I called it the Culture Code deck is not because it was a code of conduct, or a moral code, or, \"This is how companies should be run.\" It was because if I could write code to kind of define the culture of HubSpot, this is what the code would look like. And since that point, it's like the question I keep asking myself is, if we could have an operating system that ran the company, just the geeky part of me, not that you could do that, but what would that look like, right?\n\n(01:21:17):\nThere are very few original ideas I've had that are any good. One of them is this thing that culture is a product, period, and that every company builds two products, one is the product they build for their customers, and the other is a product they build for their team. That's what culture is, it's the product you build for your team. And let's say we stipulate that that just happens to be true. Just humor me for a minute. If you assume that's true, then a bunch of things kind of follow from that postulate, that hypothesis, which is, \"Oh, well, just like we would never build a product without talking to customers, we would never build a culture without talking to the customers of the product,\" which are the people. So we do a repeat of that original NPS survey we've been doing every quarter now forever to figure out what the NPS of that product is, our culture product.\n\n(01:22:15):\nThe other thing is like, okay, well there's no product person in the history of humankind that would've said, \"Oh, I built this product. It's awesome. I'm done.\" No one would ever say that, and this is the number one mistake, I think, I'm biased, I think founders make, is that they say, \"Oh, we have an awesome culture, and my job is to preserve the culture.\" That is not the job because the needs of your customers change, the needs of the employees change, right? The culture exists to help the great people do great things for the company. That's why the culture is there, and the things they need later as the company scales are different. And so just like you would never freeze the lines of code of a product, you would never freeze the lines of code of a culture. Culture should be iterated on just like you iterate on product.\n\n(01:23:07):\nAnd there's so many other things that kind of fall. So just like in a product, you will get feedback from the customers like, \"Oh, here are the bugs,\" and we actually call them bugs. It's like, \"Oh, here are the bugs in the culture.\" At the all-hands meeting, so we have this survey that comes back. Once again, transparency notion. Every single survey response, it's anonymous in terms of who submitted it, we publish it, right? The quant score of the subjective thing, everything, then we will categorize it, and then at the next all-hands meeting, we call them all-minds... Anyway, a little-\n\nLenny (01:23:37):\nI love that, all-minds.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:23:39):\nAll-minds.\n\n(01:23:41):\nAnd it's like, \"Okay, so here are the things that we heard.\" Just like we would do for a product meeting, it's like, \"Oh, the customers, here's what we're hearing back.\" It's like, \"Here's the bug that you've identified. Here's the ones we're going to fix.\" And when we're going to fix some, we're going to commit like, \"Oh, you said this was broken. Okay, we're going to do something about that.\" Here are the things that like, \"Yeah, I know you don't like it that way, but it works as design,\" which we do in product all the time, right? And you should have the right to do that. It's like, yep, some people are going to disagree, and there may be any number of reasons why we think that needs to stay the way, we're not saying necessarily forever, but as it stands, we are not prioritizing this, we are not fixing that thing that you think needs fixing for whatever reason.\n\n(01:24:21):\nSo the one lesson here is, very few things I've learned that I think are universally applicable, that one, I think, is right, and just so much greatness and goodness falls out of that, is if you think of the people as customers and if you think of the culture as product, it takes away this kind of abstract nature of working on culture and then takes away this thing that I heard this back in the early commentary from the HubSpot team, is like, oh, well, culture is not something you really build because that seems fake, that seems inauthentic that you just go, it's like, \"Oh, we're going to craft this culture.\" No, we craft in the same way. I'm not saying we're going to impose it, like we're going to do this often in isolation, but we're going to work on it, and it's something you actually do manifest, and it's not just up to the founders.\n\nLenny (01:25:07):\nWow, what an amazing story. You're definitely getting laughs per minute for me, and I think there's at least one laugh per minute so far in this podcast. That's amazing. And I think this point you just made about your job is not to preserve the culture as a leader, I think that's really profound, because I think most people don't think that. They think their job is, \"We need to maintain our culture as we grow.\" It's all fading away, our culture's changing, but your point is that that's good and that's great.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:25:31):\nBringing it back to product, I think this is an important thing. This is the second order lesson learned after you start with the culture is product, is that one of the challenges almost everyone will deal with is that you have these things... And so by the way, just because culture is product does not mean there's not a sense of having what some might label as core values, right? Because we have this in product as well. There are core values that the product believes in, like we believe in our product, that we're going to hold constant through it, right? Like, \"Oh, we're building for SMB. Want it to be easy to use.\" There's constraints that we put on ourselves that are intentional that even though we iterate, we're not going to iterate away from these things, kind of that high conviction bet thing again.\n\n(01:26:10):\nBut not everything that's part of your product is a core value, right? So not everything that was part of your culture in the early years. So transparency is one that has endured over a long time, right? It's part of our core value, and we preserved it even though it was troublesome through the IPO. I shared that story. And then there are things that we changed that were part of like, oh, we believe this meritocracy thing in a flat organization, but the manifestation of that was a bud with lack of titles, right? And so we changed that. It's like, \"Okay, well, there are things...\"\n\n(01:26:38):\nAnd here's the other thing. It's a mixed metaphor problem because I haven't been able to come up with a good metaphor yet, but there'll be things that you have that are kind of core... And the way I describe it right now, I'm just going to put it out there, I'm kicking myself for not coming up with a better metaphor, is like federal versus state law. So there are federal laws we have here in the United States that says, \"Okay, here are the things, and these are the inalienable rights of all citizens of the United States. These are the things that are core.\" But then we have state things, right? It's like, \"Oh, for this particular state on these particular aspects, they can optimize for their particular state.\" It's like, \"Yes, we understand this is the corollary, but for our state, we're going to do this.\"\n\n(01:27:21):\nSo we have something similar at HubSpot. We have a core set of things that are part of the culture, part of the thing that's like, \"Okay, here's what we believe,\" and then there are things that the individual groups, so our head of engineering could come back, it's like, \"Yeah, I know our overall, like the founder's leaning is X, but for my particular group, that doesn't really make sense. We're going to do this.\"\n\n(01:27:40):\nSo I'll give you an example. So one of the core things from the early years of HubSpot is like we don't care about what hours you work, like from what time to what time. It's like it doesn't matter, like literally does not matter. We didn't track it, we don't care. But then over time, it's like, \"Well, we have a support organization,\" and that organization, as it turns out, does matter to our customers, right? Like we need to have coverage and things like that. It's like, \"Okay, well, that sort of makes sense,\" right?\n\n(01:28:04):\nBut then you sort of have to, A, pick your battles, but then fight back. For instance, transparency, there have been times where individual org leader's like, \"Okay, Dharmesh, I know you believe in this transparency thing and Brian believes in this transparency thing, but it's inefficient for someone that is a SDR in the sales organization to have access to the high-order financials. It's a waste of time. It's a distraction.\" That was the argument. It's like, \"You may be right, but the binary decision, the fact that we value transparency so much, we're going to...\" Yes, maybe it is a distraction, fine. And the other one is like, \"Oh, I don't want my team to have it because I just don't...\" You know, we were hiring so fast and it's like, once again, that's a lot of trust to put into people or whatever. It's like yeah, but then one of the other lessons is cultures over time become self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\n(01:28:57):\nSo in the early setup, big lesson learned. So when I put the first version, the public-facing version of the Culture Code out there, and I got feedback from the team and like, \"Dharmesh, you say this in the Culture Code deck, and it's just not true.\" It was not true enough for us to kind of state that as a thing. And so the thing that I did is in the deck, I have what I call these little liner notes. It's like stuff going on. It's like, \"Oh, this is not really true yet, so it's more of an aspiration. This is how we want it to be, but we're not walking the walk yet on this thing.\"\n\n(01:29:32):\nSo I didn't take it out because I wanted it to be an aspiration, and here's the thing that I had not thought it through. I cannot take credit for it. What happened over the fullness of time is that those things that were aspirations became increasingly true by virtue of being in the deck because as people join, it's like, \"Oh, that's something we aspire to, so I'm going to pretend that's actually the culture of HubSpot,\" which is exactly what we want. So it's okay to say things that are aspirational. Just call them out. Don't present things that are not true, but they'll back off of the things that you would like to be true.\n\nLenny (01:30:04):\nWow. There's so many lessons there. It reminds me of Airbnb, actually. I was there when they created the original, there's these six core values of Airbnb. One of them was simplify, it turns out. And then, I don't know, some number of years later, the founders realized, \"We're not actually good at this,\" and values should reflect who you are not aspire to be, and I like this middle ground you found of like, \"I'm going to put in here, but I'll note this isn't necessarily who we are.\" We didn't do that. That would've been a smart move. So they removed that core value. They're like, \"We're not actually this,\" and going from six to four. There's another one they removed. So I was really impressed because we're like, \"Okay, wait.\" Because it comes up in meetings. They're like, \"Simplify. No, this is actually really complicated.\"\n\n(01:30:46):\nOkay, so what I'm going to do, I have one more question about AI, and to make this work timing-wise, I'm going to cut the lightning round, so hope that's okay.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:30:55):\nTotally fine.\n\nLenny (01:30:56):\nOkay. I know AI is very top of mind for you.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:30:58):\nBy the way, this is my diabolical plan to have to skip the lightning round because that's the thing I'm not good at, like I'm not [inaudible 01:31:05]. Anyway, you know I was dreading the most.\n\nLenny (01:31:07):\nPlaying 4D chess here. You knew exactly the timing and you're like, \"I will take this long for all these answers so it'll perfectly play out.\"\n\n(01:31:16):\nSo I know you're spending a lot of time on AI. It's on many people's minds these days. You built this product called ChatSpot. Is it still called ChatSpot? Is that the product you changed the name for or that's still ChatSpot?\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:31:26):\nIt's still ChatSpot.\n\nLenny (01:31:28):\nStill ChatSpot. And I know that you've handed that off now to a team actually that's working on this.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:31:28):\nYep.\n\nLenny (01:31:31):\nIt's not like just the entire mesh project anymore.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:31:33):\nYep.\n\nLenny (01:31:34):\nSo I don't know exactly where to go with this, but just why is AI so top of mind? And where do you think people should be spending time? Where do you think things are heading? What comes to mind around AI?\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:31:46):\nYeah. Obviously, I'm not alone in my excitement, but I will say this. So I'm about to hit the 30-year anniversary of my working in commercial software, right? So I've been at this for a long, long time, and that's all I've ever known, that's all I've ever done. And the last time I was this excited was when the web first came along in the mid to late-'90s, and I'm like, \"Oh, this literally changed everything,\" right? It's like relevant to everything. It's like literally everything is going to be impacted by this thing called the internet. And I was in my early twenties, right?\n\n(01:32:27):\nI've been here for mobile, I've been here for social, I've seen lots of things that people got really excited about, but nothing to me has hit the Richter scale to the degree that AI does, and the reason is, okay, so if you think about early computers, PCs, that kind of gave us compute at scale, which was awesome. The internet effectively gave us distribution at scale. It allowed us to take information, products, whatever, and get them out at scale because everything was now connected, where before it was not. What AI gives us now is cognition at scale, the ability to literally amplify the human brain, right? That's never been done before. Look, not that we haven't been trying, but now we have demonstrable evidence and products that actually work. We've used ChatGPT and products like it. And so it's life-changing, right? And so for the product people out there, which is a lot of you, AI...\n\n(01:33:28):\nBy the way, the internet unlocked a massive opportunity because, especially for startups, it's like, \"Oh, we can just reimagine the world with this new thing called the internet that was not possible a year ago and now is. What can we now unlock?\" and lots of great companies were created. I think something similar will happen here.\n\n(01:33:45):\nAnd there's a couple of things just tactically that I think are possible vectors that can satisfy my spreadsheet of if I were going to choose ideas, and these apply across industries, is that, so as software companies and product builders, most of us have always called our products like, \"Oh, we build intuitive products.\" We say that, right? As it turns out, it's just not true because as a user of X product, whatever it happens to be, it's like, okay, I've got this mental model, the thing I'm trying to accomplish, and then I have to translate that into a series of clicks, drags, touches, and swipes in order to accomplish the thing that I want in the software product that I'm using, and what varies is the degree to which that translation needs to occur.\n\n(01:34:31):\nBut there is this impedance mismatch, right? There's a translation that has to happen from what's in my head, like, \"I want to remove this background in Photoshop,\" \"I want to create this report in HubSpot.\" And so the opportunity now is that we're going from what was an imperative model, this is what engineers would call like a step-by-step, you give instructions to the computer like, \"Do this, do this, do this, do this,\" and then hopefully you get the output you're looking for, to what engineers would call a declarative model. A declarative model is you describe the outcome you want, not the steps to get there, and the closest analogy that most people are familiar with is SQL, the querying language, right?\n\n(01:35:08):\nSo before SQL, if you wanted to get data out of a system, you wrote code that says, \"Okay, loop over all my customer records, then filter out the ones that have less than a million dollars in revenue, and then give me the result,\" and SQL said, \"No, just put a where clause on it. Describe the data you want, and what columns you want, and how you want to order it, and what filters you want to apply,\" and it figures out if the database figures out how to get you the thing that you're looking for.\n\n(01:35:31):\nNow we have the ability to do that for interfaces for software, right? So instead of saying, \"Click here, drag here,\" it's like, \"I want you to generate a report that's all my customers in Europe that we signed up last quarter that were more than 100K in ARR.\" And you just literally take the thing that's in your head and express it in whatever medium you choose, text, voice, doesn't matter, and the software now can actually... So now the technology exists to pull that off. Did not exist before, and now it exists.\n\n(01:35:59):\nI know it didn't exist before because six and a half years ago, I built this product called GrowthBot. That was a chatbot for HubSpot software and business software generally for marketing and salespeople. It's essentially what ChatSpot is now. Amazing product, GrowthBot, and it had just one teeny tiny small problem, which is it didn't work. Really well-conceived, really brilliant idea. It just didn't work and the technology wasn't there. You just couldn't do it with any degree of fidelity because AI hadn't... And now you can. And that's what caused me to go prove out my theory, is like I had a chip on my shoulder, particularly with that idea, right? But I think, and I'm not suggesting that web and mobile interfaces are going to go away, but there are a class of use cases across pretty much all software where we can make things easier for the human by not forcing that translation layer and just make it truly intuitive. Yeah.\n\n(01:36:58):\nSo thank you for coming to my TED Talk or my [inaudible 01:37:01] podcast.\n\nLenny (01:37:03):\nSo what's great about watching you, because you kind of build in public with this AI stuff, that you're doing it, like your approach to learning about this is building and doing. When you launch ChatSpot, you tweeted that it took you many, many late nights of work.\n\n(01:37:17):\nFor people that want to understand what's going on, get ahead of where things are going, build the skills to be relevant in the future, do you have any advice? Is it just build stuff and do it, or is there anything else you'd recommend for people that want to understand what the hell is going on?\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:37:34):\nYeah, and this is very simple practical advice, and this is the same thing for engineers in software as well, is don't try to go learn something because you think it's worth learning. Find an actual problem that you care about and go try to solve it with that new thing, right? If you have something tangible that you're trying to do, so for instance, going back to the talk around public speaking, it's like, okay, if I had said, \"Oh, I want to learn about humor and stand-up comedy,\" I don't think I would've accomplished a thing. But I had a goal in mind, which is like, \"Hey, I need to be able to get up on a stage and a hold of a thing and I have this measurable thing.\"\n\n(01:38:13):\nSo whatever it is, whatever line of business you're in, whatever you do as a professional, I guarantee you there are ways AI can help you, even with the tools that we have out there right now. So either use the tools, build tools on top of the APIs that exist, very easily accessible right now, very cheap to start. Yeah, just do it and iterate. And I'm a big believer also in learning in public as well. That's why the Culture Code is out there. It's like, okay, well, if you accept the fact that culture is a product, we're going to learn about things much better, like instead of just getting feedback from the employees at HubSpot, why don't we put it out to the world? Because the internet is exceptionally good at telling you why you're an idiot, right? It's like it's one of its core strengths. So I would recommend, have a goal in mind, write about it. I'm a big believer in writing generally, but yeah, do it in public.\n\nLenny (01:39:07):\nI love that advice.\n\n(01:39:09):\nIs there anything else that you wanted to share, or touch on, or leave listeners with before we wrap up?\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:39:17):\nWe covered a lot of territory.\n\nLenny (01:39:19):\nYeah, we did. Yeah, we did.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:39:20):\nI might do the quit while I'm ahead thing. I'll leave it with this. So I have my definition of success I came up with years ago that I kind of still stand by and that HubSpot actually stands by, is success is making the people who believed in you look brilliant. That's it. What I like about that is it's not like an inward-facing thing. This is the kind of, like customer folks, like all the employees that join your company when you're a founder that were kind of silly enough to, \"Could I join you on this thing?\" whatever, like customers that believed in the early product that completely sucked, investors that believed, like all of that, do what you can to like when they reflect back on it, it's like, \"Oh, boy was I smart to having believed in Lenny and what he's doing.\" So yeah, I think...\n\nLenny (01:40:07):\nThat is really beautiful. Dharmesh, you are wonderful. Thank you so much for doing this.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:40:14):\nThis has been a lot of fun. I'm glad we were able to put it together.\n\nLenny (01:40:16):\nSame. We covered so much ground. We got through everything that I was hoping to get through and more. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow what you're up to and maybe reach out if they have questions? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:40:27):\nSure. So I'm Dharmesh, D-H-A- R-M-E-S-H, everywhere. I'm not only findable, I'm unavoidable on the internet as it turns out. And follow me on social media. Tell me where I'm being an idiot and what I can learn. Here's the thing, leave a YouTube comment and tell me which Lenny episodes were your favorite so I can go back, because I've been binge-watching anyway. I'd love to know.\n\nLenny (01:40:54):\nAnd then speaking of that view, I know you have websites of your content, you have your YouTube channel. Where can folks find those things?\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:41:02):\nYeah, if you just go to dharmesh.com, that'll have links to the other places. I'm probably most often on LinkedIn as it turns out, which is a whole topic for a whole other day, but...\n\nLenny (01:41:13):\nYeah. Awesome. All right. I'll let you go. Dharmesh, thank you so much for being here.\n\nDharmesh Shah (01:41:17):\nThank you. Bye, everyone.\n\nLenny (01:41:21):\nThank you so much for listening.

Revolut values way more raw intellect and this unquenched hunger to build things rather than experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nI hear one of the ways you approach early products differently is you guys invest a lot in actually making it good.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:00:18):\nIt's not getting traction. Is it because the underlying idea is wrong? Or maybe your product just sucks? By forcing everyone to build a product that people will love, we kind of cut out this part of uncertainty. We can cut down the product in terms of functionality to just most critical features, but we will never compromise on the quality and UX and the aesthetics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):\nIs there anything that you've figured out about just how to set up new products for success?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:00:48):\nIf something is 99% done, it's closer to 0% rather than 100%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):\nToday, my guest is Dmitry Zlokazov. Dmitry is global head of product at Revolut, which is a finance super app offering customer savings and checking accounts, crypto, investing, joint accounts, even mortgages. Not only was it last valued at over $60 billion, but in the research that I've been doing into which companies hire and incubate the best product managers, Revolut was right at the top alongside Palantir and Intercom. And so in our conversation, we dig into what Revolut has learned about producing and hiring great product leaders, including a focus on ownership, having people solve really painful and complex problems while making the experience wow and lovable by users. Also indexing towards hiring really smart and driven people early in their career versus people with a ton of experience in the space and so much more. If you're looking for a job that will accelerate your product career or want to help your product team level up, this episode is for you.\n\n(00:01:48):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

With that, I bring you Dmitry Zlokazov.\n\n(00:02:08):\nThis entire episode is brought to you by Stripe. There's a reason that I've had more guests on this podcast from Stripe than any other company. It's because they hire the best people and they build incredible products. You probably know them for their payments platform, which powers my newsletter, and also companies like NVIDIA and Salesforce and Zoom and DoorDash. What you may not know is that they have several other products that can help accelerate your revenue, such as Stripe Billing, which powers billing for companies that you may have heard of. OpenAI, Anthropic, Figma, Atlassian, and over 300,000 other companies. Stripe Billing lets you bill and manage customers however you want from simple recurring billing to usage-based billing to sales-negotiated contracts.\n\n(00:02:53):\nThere's also Stripe's Optimized Checkout suite, which is a plug-and-play super optimized payment flow that natively supports over 100 global dynamic payment methods. There's also a product called Link, which is an accelerated checkout experience built specifically to increase your checkout conversion. Every single one of the Forbes top 50 AI companies that have a product in the market today use Stripe to monetize it. Half of Fortune 100 companies use Stripe. $1.4 trillion flows through Stripe annually, which is equivalent to over 1% of global GDP. Use Stripe to handle all of your payment-related needs, billing, manage revenue operations, and launch or invent new business models. Learn more at stripe.com. Dmitry, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:03:46):\nHi, Lenny. I'm happy to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:48):\nAs you know, I've been doing a bunch of research into which companies hire and create the best product managers, and I've been triangulating this across a bunch of different data points. I've been looking at which companies alumni product managers get promoted most when they leave the company, become chief product officers at the highest rate when they leave the company, become the first PM at a startup, also start their own companies. And when I triangulate it across all these different data points, there's three companies that are kind of sat at the top, you guys, Revolut, Palantir, and Intercom.\n\n(00:04:21):\nClearly you guys are doing something really special. I don't think a lot of people, especially in the US know a ton about Revolut, and so I'm really excited to have you here. I'm really excited to basically extract as much wisdom as I can from you about what you guys have figured out in helping in hiring and training product managers. So I want to actually start with giving people a slight understanding of what is Revolut. I think a lot of people in the US especially don't know much about it. So what's the simplest way to understand what you guys do?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:04:49):\nRevolut challenges banks in 50 different countries and it all started 10 years ago in London. So maybe let me give you a bit of a context, especially for someone based in the US, it's important to understand that European banking landscape is very diverse. In the US if you travel from state to state, things are different, but for example, you always pay in US dollars, right? In the UK you pay in British Pound. If you travel to mainland Europe, you will pay in Euro, but if you go to Switzerland, you'll pay in Swiss francs. If you go to Sweden, you'll pay in Swedish Krona and so on and so-and-so. Overall, there are 25 different currencies and every time you were traveling and paying in a different currency, banks were charging you exorbitant fees on top of terrible foreign exchange rates, and that's when Revolut launched as a multi-currency card and people loved it.\n\n(00:05:51):\nThey loved that Revolut was saving them 50 or 100 euros, but even more so they loved the transparency and simplicity of the product and that's why when we started rolling out more and more products based on those principles, they were quickly getting trust of people. They were quickly getting traction. So that's how P2P transfers appeared, and then frictionless crypto buying and withdrawal to a bank account appeared. And then more and more products created products, savings products and so on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:27):\nAwesome. And then just to give people a few kind of scale of the company, how many employees are there roughly? I think the last valuation something around 60 billion. I don't know if you can even comment on that, but just what are some numbers real quick for people to understand the scale of the company at this point?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:06:40):\nThe headcount is not something we're trying to increase, to be honest. Actually Revolut tries to stay as lean as possible, but I think it's just that our appetite for growth is so big that I think we're currently at maybe 6 or 7,000 employees.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:58):\nWow. Okay, cool. So let's get into what you've learned about building an amazing product team and also hiring an amazing product team. So first of all, you call your product managers product owners, and when we were chatting through initially it was like, \"Oh, I see. It's just like a big scrum business,\" and they just have all these product owners who many times on this podcast people have talked about that's not actually a product manager, but that's not at all how you work. So in this context, product owner's an actual owner. Talk about just the story behind why you call your product managers, product owners.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:07:28):\nYeah, it's not a scrum term for us, it's just our take on emphasizing how ownership is important, really. So product owners are central to the company and its growth. They are end-to-end responsible for the product, for this part of the business, and for their customers to be happy. And for that, they do really everything. They run the teams, they define which roadmap we need to build to improve certain business metrics, and they also contribute to high-level company strategy, but then most importantly, they execute on it relentlessly and they are ultimate responsible for the product to be shipped and achieve results.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:24):\nThere's always this term of mini-CEO, PM as a mini-CEO, and it feels like in your context, that's actually what you try to do with your product team is they're essentially mini-CEOs. They have a lot of power. I think engineers, designers report to them. Is that right?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:08:35):\nYeah, correct. Well, I prefer to say local CEO.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:38):\nLocal CEO. Okay, let's talk about that. Yeah, yeah.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:08:42):\nYeah, but that's true. So the way we operate, we have these fully cross-functional teams, meaning they're staffed with all necessary functions, engineers data, analysts, designers, operational managers and so on. And we also operate in metrics. So everyone has a line manager and a functional manager. So product owner is always the line manager for everyone on the team, meaning product owner defines what they need to do, but then functional managers, they define how these things are need to be built and essentially with the right level of quality and so on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:28):\nI love this because it's so fun just to learn about such different ways of operating. Another fact that I saw is that there's two types of product owners. There's kind of like a UX product owner, and then there's a different like technical product owner.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:09:41):\nWe actually have three.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:42):\nThree.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:09:43):\nAnd the third type becomes increasingly more important. So the first type is UX product owners. Then there are technical product owners, and then there are data science product owners. So UX product owners are the ones who work on consumer facing part of the product. Usually they have a great taste for things and they understand what constitutes UX that will work and which things will not work. So they also have this expertise in the industry. Then tech product owners, they are the ones who delve deepest into details. Usually those are former engineers who grew into making decisions and driving business. And the data science product owners are usually former data scientists who decided to grow into management positions, but they're still very hands-on.\n\n(00:10:55):\nAnd you know what? There are way more things that are common to each of these three specializations. So what we see sometimes is people just shifting them because I would say that what defines the specialization is probably 5, 10, 15% while 85 to 90% is common to each one of them. And those things are, so first of all, being a great problem solver and have a great linear thinking, but also have a creative approach towards nonlinear problems. Then building this context for customer and building empathy towards customer and translating it into the team.\n\n(00:11:48):\nThen going down to details very, very deep because in our domain there are no obvious things and you need to get to the root cause of the problem really, really deep to understand what will work and what will not work. And that means that you also need to be quite technical, even if you are an expert, you still need to often go as deep as sitting with engineers and reading code. And then I would also emphasize the importance of business acumen because we tend to measure and quantify product performance a lot. And you need to understand, okay, what things will we build that will drive eventually that business metric and that target?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:41):\nSo I love this idea of the product owners having to go really deep. I think a lot of people hearing this, they think they can go deep, go deep, really understand the details of what they're working on. I'm curious if there's an example that's illustrative of just what you actually mean here.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:12:55):\nFor example, to provide the best possible product in every country of presence, we need to have necessary licenses. In Europe, it means that we need to launch local branches of our European bank, for example, a branch for France, a branch for Germany, or a branch for Italy. To launch a branch, you need to fully comply with all necessary regulation. You need to report necessary data on customers to various regulators and authorities. You need to register with local payment systems. And each of these things, they have a lot of projects nested within. We have a very lean team of just a few people who need to scope everything and do it at the scale of 50 countries. So the way we do it is we go very deep on example of each of these projects. For example, we launched a branch in Ireland, we launched a branch in Netherlands.\n\n(00:14:01):\nThen we reverse engineered what was the best process to do it, and then we went back up on top level and we said, okay, but what's the ideal framework of doing it at scale? And then we formalized it into a process really like an algorithmic process with steps and quality gates and assay needs, what people do we need to hire and how soon do we need to start doing that before we want to launch a new country. Then, so it's not only going deep, but also being flexible and doing this switch between zooming in very deep and then raising on the level of helicopter view and then understanding, okay, so this seems very, very complex in details, but then when you zoom out, how can we simplify it and build a robust process around it, which is scalable? And that's something that we have to do a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:05):\nAs you're talking and we go through this chat, I'm keeping kind of track of what I think is most contributing to your alumni product owners, product managers becoming so successful. So a couple of things so far that I think are probably contributing to this is one is just having a lot of ownership over what they're building, which leads to building skills to start companies and become leaders at other companies. So these product owners that you have are just own a lot and are essentially GMs of whatever product they're working on. And then there's this depth and complexity where you have to really get good at understanding a problem really deeply. I imagine many of these people go on to work on something like that later, somewhere else because they've spent all this time, or they just get really good at dealing with complex many layered problems. So is there anything else just kind of along those lines as I say that you think is important?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:15:54):\nI would probably add an obsession with building wow product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:03):\nWow. W-O-W?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:16:04):\nW-O-W.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:06):\nCool.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:16:08):\nI think in FinTech overall, this is probably the most neglected part usually, but it's also a part that we at Revolut, we pay enormous attention to. So it's not only when you do a trade in the app or when you send money, it's very important for it to be very fast and cheap process for you so that you don't pay a lot of fees. But we also pay a lot of attention to look and feel of the app and how smooth it is and how frictionless the process. Not only we invest in reducing clicks and optimizing finals, but we also want people to feel that we really cared about them. We also want people to feel that we love our customers and we applied extra effort for the product to look great and feel great. And I hear this a lot from our customers, like the app is something they really love and it helps them solve their problems. It's at least one of the ingredients of the company's success.\n\n(00:17:22):\nAnd I think people that work at Revolut, they built habit of paying attention to these small nuances, small details that make the product lovable. And then second is handling this context because it's a lot of details where you need to dive, but there are also a lot of dimensions where you need to dive into different details. And I think this ability to keep this large context in your mind and consider second order effects and view subjects from multiple angles, I think that this is also a very important skill that people usually train at Revolut.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:05):\nOkay, cool. So we have three bullet points on the ingredients of great product managers slash owners that you guys incubate. On this wow piece, which I love. How do you operationalize this sort of thing? I imagine a big part of it is hiring people that are really good at this and value building lovable products. Is there any way you kind of have a process around making sure the things you ship are wow and lovable?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:18:27):\nTwo things that you need to understand about how Revolut operates is that we operate in small lean teams that are tasked to build products and as I mentioned, and having end-to-end responsibility for products. And usually they're the ones who build it from zero and then they're growing and developing this product. And then another thing is that company is very flat and hierarchy is very flat. We still have our founders, Nick and Vlad, very hands-on going down to details for every product and every part of the business. And every week they have product reviews with every team giving an opportunity to every product owner present directly to CEO and CTO and show what increment has team achieved in the last week, but also get steering from founders, which is super valuable.\n\n(00:19:31):\nEssentially founders of the company, they still review a hundred percent of screens that are being shipped and everything that you will see in the app pass this review. And there are a lot of eyeballs that were scrutinizing this and thinking of all possible edge cases and nuances that we need to consider to make sure that every single customer will be happy in this product, in this flow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:02):\nThat seems to be a consistent theme in products that are incredible is the founders are deeply involved in the experience and review everything. How many product owners are there at Revolut? Just to give people a sense by the way?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:20:15):\nOh, I'm afraid to say it's already more than 150 people, maybe 170.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):\nCool. That's what I would expect. And then you said that there's kind of these three types, there's kind of like the eng type, the PM, traditional type, and there's the data product owner. When you hire the UX type of product owner today, is their previous role usually a product manager at another company?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:20:36):\nYes, but I would say that not necessarily it's a very experienced product manager. Well maybe even it's way more important to have this hunger for building things and having the raw intellect. And we always try to find people with these intrinsic traits rather than hiring people who are very experienced but maybe are not super excited about building things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:13):\nWhat percentage of your product owners come from internal transfers from other functions?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:21:18):\nIt's a quite substantial part of product owners who eventually become very successful by the way. So it's like a positive self-select, so it means that someone already succeeded in another role. So it's a guaranteed culture match, it's a guaranteed domain knowledge, and then they simply grow. Usually it could be operations managers or engineers. They grow into someone who now manages the team and that's why it's a very successful path.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:53):\nSo the other company on the list of top three companies that produce and hire the best PMs, according to the research I've done, Palantir. I just had someone that was at Palantir for a long time and we talked about exactly all the same questions. And interestingly so far we have kind of these three bullet points in terms of what product owners within Revolut get to do. There's a lot of ownership, there's a lot of depth and complexity, and there's a lot of focus on wow lovable products. So interestingly at Palantir also tons of ownership, also tons of depth and complexity. The other ingredient that I want to ask you about is they also have this concept of a forward deployed engineer where they put an engineer in the office of the company they're building the product from, they sit there building it for them with them.\n\n(00:22:36):\nAnd so there's a lot of skills built in terms of understanding customer problems, talking to customers, getting empathy building, things like that. Is there anything you guys do or focus on around just like talking to customers, the way you approach having your product owners work with customers, understand problems, things like that that might be helpful for people to hear?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:22:56):\nFor us, it's a bit easy to reach out to customers simply because the customer base is so big, it's more than 50 million people and usually we ourselves are power users of the product. We receive our salary into Revolut and then we spend with Revolut, our friends the same. So it's like a no-brainer to talk to people continuously and even if you are not proactive in it, they will reach out. If you have a problem in the product, I guarantee that we know about it very, very soon. We've also built tools for product owners and designers to have an easy access to a panel of users via different tools so that they can just start an interviewing process or a survey or a test of different designs in a few clicks.\n\n(00:23:52):\nFor me, it was very important to build this direct connection to customers because when you delegate such an important thing as customer research and collecting their feedback to someone, you will get a refined filtered version. You won't get these nuances of how people describe things, which emotions they feel like and so on, and where they think stuck. It's very easy to lose all those important bytes of information in this process. So I'm a strong believer that it's very important to have direct communication channel to customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:32):\nAs you describe this, it's funny how you guys are at the extreme opposite end of the spectrum from Palantir in terms of how easy it is for you to get feedback. They build stuff for the government and for Airbus where employees would never use a product like that or need a product like that. You guys are getting paid in Revolut using Revolut to pay for things and constantly in the product. And so I could see why there's less of a need for something like a forward deploy engineer. Okay, amazing. Let's talk about hiring then. Is there anything unique about how you approach hiring, sourcing, looking for people, what you look for in people that you think might be contributing to your alumni being so successful down the road?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:25:12):\nI think everyone is striving for talented, skillful smart people and experienced people. Revolut values way more raw intellect and this unquenched hunger to build things rather than experience. So let me maybe bring an example. Imagine we saw this, you hire a great experienced professional with amazing regalia of achieving a lot of things, but then what I see in product, the adoption curve is usually longer than in other functions because product owners by definition are the ones who are the experts in that domain and in all those intricacies of how product is built and how it's used. So what we see from these professionals is they still take a lot of time to ramp up and sometimes they also take time to adapt to new culture or worse, they just rest on their laurels. But you already have super inflated expectations and usually their compensation is by the way, quite high and which adds up to these expectations. And I myself, after conducting maybe 400 or 500 interviews with product owners at Revolut, I also see this.\n\n(00:26:46):\nUnfortunately, professionals with a lot of years of experience from established companies, they don't have this strong urge to change status quo, which by the way will require toil, tears, and sweat. And that's why even if a candidate doesn't have a lot of years of experience, but they love building things, they've done it, they worked with engineers maybe by the way, maybe in their own startup or one of the best profiles that I've seen is a tech co-founder. So I think that's probably the best way to boost career is to go and found something work in a startup, build things yourself or with a very small team, work in all different areas because in startup you have to work in all different areas. And then these kind of people, they really thrive at Revolut and even if they don't have a lot of years of experience, they actually attack a specific problem.\n\n(00:28:09):\nThey have a sense of what can cause customer pain, and they are very fast moving to solve it quickly and then that's how they get appreciation from everyone around. The team starts respecting these people because they solve some specific problem and then they take another problem, they solve it and then they take another and that's how they grow in the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:33):\nEssentially what I'm hearing is you hire kind of more junior or super high raw, intellect driven, passionate, how do you describe, hungry people? And this explains why so many people get promoted so much more that leave Revolut because they start their earlier in their career and you help them learn all these skills, ownership, depth, understanding, working in complex environments, building amazing products. So this all makes a lot of sense. Is there anything you figured out about where to find these people? Because this is the dream, hire amazingly smart people that are super driven that nobody knows about yet and then make them awesome. Have you found anything about where to source and find these folks?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:29:14):\nSo the way we work, we have a weekly catch-ups with the recruitment team. So essentially they are also a team that runs in sprints. So every sprint we define what do we want to focus on, which areas, which companies. One of the great sources is actually looking into products and apps that we love ourselves. So if someone built a great product, then it's likely a high performer. So usually we provide some great products in specific areas that are more important for us to the sourcing team and they just try to source targeting those companies. It could be also different areas. It could be even schools, like good schools. And so it varies from sprint to sprint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:06):\nThat makes sense. Gokul had this really good piece of advice, I think it was on the podcast, if not he tweeted about it, where you look at there's successful companies, but then there's also what function in that company is the key to their success. And so you want to go like a company A for sales, company B for customer support, company C for design. And so it sounds like that's kind of the way you guys think about it a little bit. Yeah, very cool. Okay. I love how we're uncovering and we're uncovering this mystery.\n\n(00:30:33):\nThis entire episode is brought to you by Stripe. Every single one of the Forbes top 50 AI companies that has a product in the market today uses Stripe to monetize it. $1.4 trillion flows through Stripe annually, which is equivalent to over 1% of the entire global GDP. And Stripe isn't just a payments platform. They also have a product called Stripe Billing, which powers billing for companies that you may have heard of, OpenAI, Anthropic, Figma, Atlassian, and over 300,000 other companies. Stripe Billing lets you bill and manage customers no matter your pricing model from simple recurring billing to usage-based billing to sales negotiated contracts. Collect and retain more revenue, automate revenue management workflows, and accept payments globally. Use Stripe to handle all of your payment related needs, including billing, revenue operations, checkout flows, or simply launching or inventing new business models. Learn all the ways that Stripe can grow revenue for your business at stripe.com.\n\n(00:31:33):\nLet me go in a different direction and see if there's more to learn here. When it comes to running your teams, is there something that is kind of fairly contrarian in how you approach running the product team that is maybe not how other companies operate that you think is key to your success?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:31:51):\nI've changed in how I operate after I joined Revolut probably because Revolut is a founder-led company and probably it's because it's self-led, and also because my role is quite spread across many things. So my role at Revolut is leading product function across company, but also leading retail, which is a core part of Revolut business. And it's very easy to be spread thinly across all those domains and catching up with 50 or 70 projects that are being executed simultaneously, which would mean that you will just spend your entire week just catching up on statuses, not really adding value to anyone, but it's also scary to not do it because what if there are some things going wrong and you won't be able to stop it or steer in a better direction.\n\n(00:32:57):\nSo I think that's why also a lot of managers, especially in senior positions, they kind of stay high level and they don't go very deep into details. But how we did differently at Revolut is to go very deep into details. We take maybe 7 or 10 projects which are most impactful for customers right now. And we go super deep into them, really, really deep sitting with engineers like reading code level and understanding, okay, how it's built exactly and what's the underlying issue. And you could think that, okay, but what about others? Let's say 50 or 60 items that are being executed. But the thing is that it actually, it's counterintuitive, but it works really well because first of all, teams, they talk to each other, there are formal and informal ways of communicating through meetups or just meeting in the office and they know which areas are being scrutinized right now and which team is being scrutinized.\n\n(00:34:19):\nAnd it also gives information on what are the current priorities in the company. But in addition, it's signaled to other teams that if they are not proactively executing things on the expected level, paying attention to all the details and being meticulous in all those details, especially in quality, they will be the ones that will be reviewed to a such deep level, next phase, next cycle. So as a result, it also builds a great discipline. And since Revolut is such a high concentration of very ambitious people who thrive for being best versions of themselves and grow, and it's very important for them to prove that they can deliver great things and build next great company. As a result, they do everything to operate autonomously. And when you start diving deep into details, you see that everything is fine, you see their modus operandi and you can understand, okay, if this team is on good track or not on good track. And if it's not on good track, it means that it probably will be one of your next areas as of focus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:53):\nOkay. So what I'm hearing is you said there's 50 to 60 things kind of projects being built at once.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:35:58):\nMaybe closer to a hundred, actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:59):\nOkay. Okay. So there's like a hundred things happening at any point like features being built, products being launched, and this is you and the founders choose 7 to 10 to focus on, or is it just you?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:36:13):\nNo, it's just me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:15):\nJust you. Okay. And by the way, do you have a leadership team that you're a part of with a design lead or is it just you basically at the top?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:36:22):\nSo the way it's structured, my responsibility is a product function. We also have a head of design function. It's also part of my team, but then all the other functions, they are separate like engineering and data function, and all of them report directly into a CEO.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:41):\nGot it. Okay. So out of a hundred things you choose, here's the 7 to 10 things I'm going to go deep on. These are the things that matter most to the business that if they don't go well, it'll have the most downside. And then you basically said you sit next to the engineers, you get really involved in every detail.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:36:59):\nYeah, correct.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:00):\nAwesome. Okay. That is definitely counterintuitive. We had Brian Chesky in the podcast and the way he approached this problem is he just cut down how many things happen at Airbnb because he wants to be involved in everything. And so I think it's cool to hear a different approach where we can still do a lot of stuff, but I'm going to choose, I'm going to go deep on the things that matter most.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:37:21):\nNo, I think we'll never cut down things, it's just the appetite for growth and also entrepreneurial approach in the company is so high that we'll never allow ourselves to give up on some great opportunities, but also this approach is way more scalable. So while leadership and obviously founders themselves keep everyone accountable, go deep into details, it doesn't mean that they micromanage everyone. That's actually a very important thing. So the ideal position for any product owner is to be fully autonomous. And again, it doesn't mean that you will never be challenged, but if when you're challenged, you can show all the logic behind decisions you've made behind the roadmap. And even if metrics are not yet there, you will still let's say have this credit of trust to keep building things the way you want to build them. Eventually, yeah, you will be presenting the outputs of your activity on these weekly product reviews, but again, it's not a micromanagement either. It's more like, let's say a last line of control to make sure that what we're building all makes sense and that's value and is thoroughly thought in all details.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:48):\nAnd then you said still every screen that is shipped, the founders review at some point, so it's not like someone's shipping stuff without the founders seeing it in some form.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:38:56):\nYeah, yeah, exactly. They have a full overview over everything, but also it allows us to build so many things because there is actually little micromanagement. If founders had to be involved into everything, they had to cut things down. But by giving people autonomy, they actually boost company growth. And as a result, I think Revolut is a strong outlier in the industry in terms of how many products being shipped and how fast they shipped. Another thing here is what I mentioned previously is us investing heavily into platform so that every solution is scalable from the get go so that we don't have any custom solutions. And for example, take our credit team, they ship new products like loans or credit cards in the country literally every month. And it is just maybe 300 people. And I think that a credit division in an incumbent bank is maybe 2 or 3000 people building just credit products for a single country.\n\n(00:40:28):\nAnd our team is building it for 50 countries. And yeah, it's enabled through this approach with platforms which we build on top of small lean teams which are fully equipped with necessary functions and also have autonomy in defining what they're building and the flat hierarchy with everyone being accountable and founders having direct view of everyone and intervening if necessary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:07):\nI'm going to give people a list of the things you guys do. I didn't do this at the beginning because it would take too long, but you talk about all the products you're building and all the things that's going on. So I have a list here. It's probably incomplete, but just to give people a sense, so you guys have credit cards, debit cards, savings accounts, multi-currency accounts, domestic international transfers, joint accounts, minor accounts for less than 18 years old, stock trading, cryptocurrency purchasing, loans. Is there anything big I missed?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:41:37):\nI mean, some of those things are a huge by itself, let's say stock trading. It's not just stocks, it's also ETFs, bonds, and we're working on tax efficient accounts in different countries and crypto. We also allow staking crypto for example, we have on-ramp, off-ramp products, we have acquiring products. On credit, we have loans, we have a buy now per later product, we even launched mortgages. We launched first mortgages in Albania recently.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:17):\nAnd then all of these across 50 different currencies and countries.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:42:21):\nYeah, 50 different jurisdictions each with its own regulation, with its own requirements.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:28):\nOh, boy. It's a good example of Paul Graham has this concept of schlep blindness or schlepping where people want to avoid hard problems, but that's where the big opportunities are, solving really gnarly, painful problems. And that's basically what you guys did.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:42:46):\nYeah, that's one of the things that excites me maybe the most at Revolut. The market is so big and there are still a lot of very inefficient players, and as a result, customers have a lot of problems that are unsolved. While we grow insanely and I think will soon be... When I joined, we had maybe just slightly north to 20 million customers. Now we are 50 million customers. Soon we'll be at 100 million customers. The degree of surrounding each customer with the ecosystem of our products extends a lot. So they become more and more people start using Revolut as their main bank account. They start receiving their salary into Revolut, holding their savings into Revolut because they love the product more. And so we can easily do another, I don't know, 2, 3X, 4X in customer base growth, but we can also do another 10X growth in how actively these people are using the product. So it's let's say what, 30, 40X to current, 45 billion valuation. Right? So it's a like a trillion-dollar company easily.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):\nAnd on that note, I mean what I'm hearing is it's still a good time to join. There's a massive upside. So I know you guys are hiring, we'll just note that real quick. You're hiring product owners and a bunch of other roles, I imagine?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:44:24):\nYeah, yeah. Well, as someone who owns the product function, I'm especially interested in product owners obviously, but we hire a lot of roles. I think we have maybe 3 or 400 open positions currently.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:39):\nOh my God. Okay. I want to talk a bit about new stuff that you work on. So new products that you decide to invest in. Is there anything that you've figured out about just how to set up new products for success? Because a lot of the stuff we've been talking about is staying on top of stuff that you're iterating on and making better. What have you learned about just helping new products succeed?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:45:02):\nYeah, so we launched quite a few products that you actually maybe wouldn't expect from a bank starting with crypto that was insanely successful, but also non-financial services like booking a hotel through Revolut app, our loyalty program, rev points, which is sort of disrupting European market where people don't get great benefits from spending with card. In the US you can easily get, like what? 2% cashback with a credit card or in some sort of point. In Europe they don't have it. And we are actually the first to build a program on card spend rewarding people with really meaningful or monetary rewards. In the manner that I described. We understood, okay, what's the recipe of this success to then scale it and reproduce? So we built a new bets framework and essentially everyone can come up with a new idea. It could be a product owner, but it could be anyone, and they need to show some key important things which you usually can expect from a startup like market is there, business case is there.\n\n(00:46:15):\nWe know that we can do it way better than competitors leverage and for example, some things that we have obviously some concepts of product and then what customer problem we're solving and so on. And there is very little bureaucracy, again, thanks to having founder hands-on, we can easily get a green light on anything, start launching it quickly. What we do is assemble same lean team with just a few people to build first version and then iterate and iterate. And the main thing here is to build first version very quickly to get feedback, but then not scale it before you polish the product. But then after we make sure that all metrics are fine, retention is great, we start scaling it. And the good news is that it can be instantly multiplied by our 50 million customer base and get great traction. So for example, one of the products that you mentioned, joint accounts essentially an account that you could have with a significant other one was one of the recently launched feature and it grew significantly and now it has over a million active users.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:33):\nI hear one of the ways you kind of approach these early products differently is you guys invest a lot in actually making it good and not just like a scrappy MVP. Does that ring a bell? Does that resonate?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:47:45):\nIndeed, that's what I may be meant by keeping your first version narrowed down to a small user base. But even in this case, we still make sure that the product is well. So no one is excluded from this requirement of building a super polished product. It takes time, but it pays off. The thing is that when you launch a scrappy version and it's not getting traction, how do you know? Is it because the underlying idea is wrong or maybe your product just sucks and you need to improve it? So by forcing everyone to build a product that people will love by building a wow product, we kind of cut out this part of uncertainty. So bottom line, we can cut down the product in terms of functionality to just most critical features, but we will never compromise on the quality and UX and the aesthetics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):\nAn interesting advantage you guys have that I'm realizing as you talk is most of the stuff you launch is stuff that is clearly something people will want because it's stuff that they get other places, but they get the advantages of it being integrated into all the other features and products you have. So it's like a cryptocurrency product. It's kind of like, okay, yeah, people would love a great cryptocurrency product built into this or joint accounts. So there's almost like a benefit of just like, okay, the people will want this, now let's just make it work really well with everything else we got and not hurt. You almost don't need to be the best at every product, although it sounds like you still try to be the best.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:49:35):\nBut we must be the best. Yeah, a hundred percent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:37):\nBut there's also, if you don't have the best joint account, but all the other stuff is awesome, people are like, \"All right, it's fine. It just makes my life easier.\" But tell me what I might be missing because-\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:49:46):\nSo I think there are those kind of table stakes that we're building that anyone would expect from a bank. For example, savings account, right? It's just a basic thing that if a bank is not providing savings account, you wouldn't even consider it. But then we make sure that our rates are very competitive, if not the best. Then we make sure that there is no bad UX. Some banks, for example, they don't allow you to withdraw instantly and there are delays or they don't pay interest on daily basis. We will never do that. We will allow you if you want to move money out, you will be able to do it. You won't lose any interest. And interest is being paid daily and this is a fully flexible product. And then on top of it, what I would call maybe some delighters is we will allow you to open the savings account in many currencies.\n\n(00:50:49):\nSo we want to add different currencies because now interest rates are going down, so people might find it valuable to open a savings account in, for example, I know in Europe, Swedish Krona interest rates are higher than Europe, but it could be even something like Brazilian Real with 12% interest rate versus 2 or 3% on euros. And then as the cherry on top, there is this all that in an amazing, you have very smooth, you can set custom wallpapers, you can set goals, you can automate a spare change towards your savings and all those features. So there is an underlying basic fundamental layer that where you need to be just on par with competition, but then there are a lot of things on top that just make people love your product way more. And obviously there are a lot of synergies in between those things. So yeah, thinking of crypto, you can just receive crypto on your wallet and then you can just instantly convert it to cash on your account or just spend it with your card. How amazing can it be? Just buy a coffee with Ethereum.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:09):\nI love that. Okay, let me take this opportunity to try to summarize what I've learned from you so far in terms of what you guys have figured out about creating incredible product leaders. They go on to do wonderful things and basically one of the top three most successful companies at this. So there's kind of these two buckets as I talked to you and the Palantir guy, there's kind of like the hiring piece and then there's what you do to help incubate this kind of forge for incredible product leaders. So in what you do internally, kind of the four bullet points I've got here is give people a lot of ownership. They're essentially GMs of the product, the feature.\n\n(00:52:46):\nThere's a lot of focus on depth and complexity and getting really good at solving really gnarly problems. And then there's a focus on building wow products, amazing lovable products that have a very high bar. And then there's kind of a subtle point that I think is probably impactful here is just working closely with detail-obsessed founders or product leaders like you and learning from you all and just seeing the value and impact of being super detail oriented. On that bucket, is there anything else that you think is super core that I missed before we get to hiring?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:53:21):\nYeah, I would just maybe highlight the aspect of this going deep into details. There are two main streams. First is let's say being technical, understanding how underlying systems work, but second is also building empathy towards customers. Understand the possible contexts and making sure that your product will satisfy each one of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:46):\nThat's a great point. So it's actually understanding the bare metal of what is happening and how it's possible, and then making the experience as simple and wowable as possible.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:53:56):\nThere is also a third aspect, but it's a boring one and it's complying with all possible regulations and making sure that your product will satisfy the regulator, but it's also an important part of the job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:13):\nWhat I get from that is just building patience with all-\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:54:18):\nI would say it's actually being able to unblock your team and that sometimes require product owners to steam roll changes because it also means that you could easily get stuck with a lot of people just looking into each other and thinking, \"Okay, can they approve it? Can they not approve it?\" We try to innovate on it. We try to automate as many things as possible. We use even AI models for that, but it also requires a product owner to be able to get things done, just getting people down to consensus and understanding how your stakeholders, how to get them to the necessary decision and then blocking UTM so that eventually the value is shipped to customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:10):\nAwesome. So essentially it's just getting done, plowing through blockers, dealing with many stakeholders.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:55:18):\nYeah. That's always the most important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:20):\nOkay. That's a great addition. I could see why that would be really helpful for folks that are trying to get ahead in their career. And then on the hiring piece, what you look for is raw intellect, drive hunger, passion essentially. Those are the first two. And then interestingly, non-senior, not people with a ton of experience in the problem space, more so focusing on intellect and hunger. Is there anything else in that bucket that you think is important that leads to people being really successful?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:55:49):\nMost importantly, it's again, getting things done, getting your hands dirty, and great product owners are very hands-on. They don't think of themselves as managers who just give tasks to people and wait them to complete it. They just go and get things done and they understand that most important things they will likely have to do themselves, and they understand that there needs to be relentless focus on execution, and if something is 99% done, it's closer to 0% rather than 100%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:29):\nWhoa, say more there. Is the kind of insight there is just things seem like they're 99% done, but they're actually very far from being done?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:56:38):\nSometimes the product is built, but then product owners are the ones who also make sure that, for example, customer care team or sales and marketing team are using it to a full extent because without it, it could be just another useless feature, and no one knows about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:57):\nThat is super cool. I like that mentality. Let me ask you something completely different. What's kind of the story of you landing at Revolut? I know you had to move your family. It was a whole adventure.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:57:08):\nMy journey into Revolut actually coincided with me moving to the UK, so it was a completely new environment for myself. It's a huge stress load for the brain as well. And it's not only about using the other side of the lane on the road in the UK, but also it's a lot of things, for example, in the industry, some concepts that I've never heard about, and actually I've never worked at FinTech before, so I also changed the industry. So it was a complete turnaround for me and for my career, but I was very determined and excited about it because everyone who I've been talking to, they were saying Revolut is like it's top talent is at Revolut, all best product people are at Revolut, and I really wanted to be part of this great team.\n\n(00:58:11):\nEventually it actually appeared to be advantageous for me because I also had this fresh view on things and even in the Revolut app, which is actually way, way better than other banks products. But even there I found some things that for me, because of this lack of context, they were not intuitive and I worked hard with the team to change that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:43):\nOkay, great. I'm going to take us to recurring segment of the podcast. I'm going to take us to Fail Corner. So in Fail Corner, the idea here is people come on this podcast, they share all these stories of success, everything's always going great, but in reality, things don't often go great, and there's a lot of things that don't go right. Is there a story you could share where things went wrong in your career, where you failed with a product you were building or a moment in your career where things were looking really bad?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (00:59:11):\nI think the most spectacular failures is probably were on the earliest stage of my career, which I studied back at university and maybe in my second year of university I started building some things, different startups, and one of them was actually a product that makes me proud even now because it was like what, 15 years ago? So 2010, meaning still no one really had even iPhones back then and me and my friends, we started building a website that allows people to buy tickets to the cinema so that they can skip the line so they don't need to come in advance to select best seats and they can just buy a ticket online and go to the seats directly. Something that today seems as a commodity. Back then no one had it.\n\n(01:00:15):\nPeople were using pieces of paper and we built an end-to-end system because not only we needed to build a website, but we also needed to build hardware to scan those tickets, for example. And to have these tickets in digital format, we needed to hack SMS standard because again, people didn't have smartphones. They had these Nokias and we were sending images, QR codes inside an SMS, which is like a hack of the standards in a way. And then we were scanning those things with our own devices and we built our own devices with scanners, and we actually created these beautiful devices made from stainless steel, which looked really nice inside the cinema halls.\n\n(01:01:12):\nAnd I remember how I was excited about it with my friends. We were like, \"What an amazing thing.\" It's like, look, we are bringing future here, but we actually spent all our investment on this hardware and we were expecting that everyone will just rush into using our system. But it was a very low share of customers who started buying tickets online because people were not ready for it, which was growing quite slowly. And eventually we had to close it because we simply ran out of money because we spent all of it on this hardware without any proven business model. So something that currently looks like an obvious mistake back then, we were just enjoying building a product that we would love to use ourselves, which I think is the right principle, but it also was a very painful lesson. You need to stay lean, you need to validate things before you scale them. You need to think way more about the run rate of your business. So there were a lot of painful lessons for me. Since then, I also try to avoid working with hardware.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:27):\nI was just going to say that's a common challenge for startups trying to get right into hardware, although I wouldn't be surprised now if Revolut launches something another product, and this is a new product line of Revolut now that you've had that experience.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:02:42):\nWe launched a POS terminals required.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:48):\nAll right, there we go. Dmitry, before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that we haven't touched on that you think might be really helpful for listeners to hear? Maybe a last wisdom nugget that you haven't already shared, or even just something to kind of double down on that you've already shared?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:03:04):\nNo, I think that it was an amazing chat and thanks, Lenny. We covered a lot of different topics. I would just maybe summarize that if you're excited to build certain things, never hesitate to do it. The best way to do it is probably your own startup, and it also what will give you the steepest possible learning curve, but then if you want to join a company, try to choose the one that has the highest entrepreneurial spirit and that will allow you to work as closer to a mode of a founder as you possibly can.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:44):\nThat's a recurring theme in these conversations I'm having with companies that produce the PMs that have the steepest career trajectory. And so that advice is exactly what I'm taking away from this too, assuming you want your career to accelerate really quickly after you go work at this company. Okay, Dmitry, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:04:06):\nYes. Let's go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:08):\nHere we go. Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:04:15):\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz. Actually read it quite some time ago, but I found myself recommending it to other product managers most often. It's actually illustrative that to be a great product manager, someone needs to strive to being a great CEO. And besides this book emphasizes the importance of building systematic solutions and scalable solutions, which is critical for scaling a company. Also being honest on how important it is to grind stuff. And then second book is, I read it more recently, Build by Tony Fadell. I was really inspired by this one, especially given how I appreciate how it's not easy to build hardware and what Tony was describing there is just super exciting and inspiring. And also I think that there are different archetypes of product managers. There are people who tend to disrupt things more. Personally I think about myself as a builder, so Tony's principles that he highlighted in the book that they resonate with me a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:44):\nI'm trying to get Tony on the podcast. If anyone listening knows Tony Fadell and can nudge him, \"Hey, say yes to Lenny,\" that'd be great. I've been in touch with his team, but he's not doing podcasts right now, but I'm trying to get him on. Okay, moving on. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:05:58):\nI think the last movie I watched was Oppenheimer and I really liked it. I always love watching biopics. I think they give kind of a perspective and let you think about things in perspective.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:17):\nIs there a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:06:20):\nManus is a great thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:23):\nThe AI agent?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:06:24):\nYeah. Yeah. It's just like I was super impressed how... I was mesmerized. It's so autonomous and smooth, and I just spent a few hours vibe coding and I created this JavaScript app that sends me a rare English word every day to learn and remember, and it worked, and I was just amazed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:54):\nWhat's a word you learned?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:06:56):\nIneffable. It was the yesterday's word.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:59):\nI love that. It's still going. That's great. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, you find useful in work or in life?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:07:07):\nI love this phrase. I think Eisenhower said it, \"Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.\" It's like we often say how important it is to be flexible and agile and adjust to change in circumstances, but it doesn't allow us to actually not have a plan at all. It's important for us to remember that we always need to think many steps ahead and while being flexible, we also need to think things thoroughly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:43):\nFinal question. For folks that are maybe checking out Revolut for the first time that want to play with it or already users. What's the most underrated feature? What's something that you think people should check out maybe they're not aware of, or even just like a UX, I don't know, animation, something fun that people may not know about?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:07:58):\nThe thing that is not yet widely used, but I really loved it, is what we call a wealth protection. So if you go to settings, you can enable a limit for any transfers outside of Revolut. If you want to do a transfer above this limit, you'll have to do a selfie check, which is our proprietary technology. We do a video selfie here. It allows us to make sure that it's you, no one else is doing the transfer, and it's actually almost as smooth as face ID and the way the team built it is really great. I'm really proud of those guys.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:38):\nDmitry, you guys are doing something very special. I really appreciate you spending so much time with me chatting through all the things you guys have figured out. I think this is going to help a lot of different companies level up the way they think about product and for people to join Revolut that want to experience this and accelerate their career. So thank you for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:08:59):\nI think the best way is to find me on LinkedIn and yeah, I would be happy to receive a note from anyone on how we can improve the product and any feedback on the product. And also if you know someone who can be a great fit to Revolut after you've listened to what I've told, then yeah, I would be grateful for that as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:26):\nAwesome. You're about to get a flood of applications. Get prepared. Dmitry, thank you.\n\nDmitry Zlokazov (01:09:32):\nYeah, Lenny, thanks a lot. It was amazing time. Thank you very much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:35):\nSame. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:09:38):\nThank you so much for listening.

And congrats on the book, by the way.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:04:58):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (00:05:00):\nYou actually were a product manager in a previous life. You're also a designer in a previous life. These days you're an executive coach. Just briefly, I'm curious what pulled you from product management design and the things you did before this life into executive coaching. And maybe another way to ask this question is what's your origin story? And this is a little foreshadowing to the stuff we're going to be talking about later.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:05:25):\nActually, it's funny, like all origin stories, there were actually multiple episodes, multiple moments that led me to an epiphany, but the biggest aha moment was when I was working several years ago, almost a decade ago at this point, with an executive team in Silicon Valley. And we were at a leadership retreat, and we were supposed to... At the time, I was a program on effective product leadership, how to be a great product leader, product executive. And the biggest thing that companies wanted at the time and teams wanted was their teams to be better storytellers. And it's still something we hear today, which is, \"To be a great product leader or leader in general in any industry is you got to be a great storyteller.\" And so at the time, I was teaching and facilitating storytelling workshops and exploring that with teams. And it was a few people on this team specifically who I so appreciate their honesty and candor here, which is what this giant tech company is known for, very blunt people working there. And they pulled me aside halfway through the offsite, and they were just like, \"Honestly, storytelling is not going to fix our problems. This is silly.\"\n\n(00:06:56):\nAnd what they were able to tell me is that their leaders wanted them to be more effective by having greater influence. And these are terms that we throw around all the time. Be more influential and be a better leader, whatever that means. And what was happening on the ground with these executives was that they were all fighting. I'd hear, \"Oh, the head of engineering is such a jerk,\" or, \"This person won't listen to me,\" or, \"My team is demotivated. And I get it, but they need to step up and work more.\" And there was just a lot of conflict going on here and there that storytelling wouldn't fix. When that happens, and I talk about this in the book a bunch, no one wants to hear your stories. You have to actually be able to connect with people and to work with people and feel good as a leader in order to really step up and lead. I didn't have an answer for this team at the time, and I left this offsite just honestly feeling terrible and not knowing what to do about it except telling them, \"I think you got to go work with a coach because this is beyond my pay grade.\"\n\n(00:08:05):\nBut when I left that day, I just couldn't stop thinking about this team because I had a hunch that stories were still a part of something but not what they needed. Telling stories was not the answer, and so I ended up spending what now is the next decade figuring out, all right, how do you become an effective leader? And of course because I can't do anything lightly, once I went down that path, I ended up switching up my entire business. And now that's all I do is help people be better, more effective, confident leaders who really make the impact that they want to make.\n\nLenny (00:08:39):\nAlong those same lines, what's interesting is you actually found that this idea of storytelling was actually much more effective in your coaching practice. Instead of helping them figure out the story of the product, it's the story of the person. And so transitioning into the meat of your approach to coaching, I think you call it story-driven leadership. Essentially, your finding is that story and the person's story is extremely important and powerful in helping them level up as a leader and also seeing them as the hero of their story. I guess just with that foundation, can you just talk about why that is so powerful, the idea of figuring out your own story and why you need to be the hero of your own story and just what all this means?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:09:21):\nWe all as humans want to be the hero of our own story. It's how we live our lives, it's how we make choices, it's how we understand the world around us, and it's how we communicate back to the world. With leadership, it's much the same, which is we have a mission that we want to accomplish. No matter how big or small, it's something; we're driven to do something. If you're a leader, you want to be a leader. You have to be taking yourself and you have to be taking people somewhere.\n\n(00:09:55):\nWe also have obstacles, so that's a part of any great story. There are challenges. It shouldn't be easy. It shouldn't be so hard that you fail, that's a tragedy, but there are challenges, and it makes life more exciting. You don't do it alone. It's rare that a story just has a single individual. It happens, but that's not most of life. And there are other elements that I ended up uncovering when I looked deeper into what makes the most effective leaders effective, and the biggest thing is stories that we tell people, it's like the tip of the iceberg. And if anything, it even doesn't matter, I've worked with a lot of folks who their teams say, \"Stop it with the storytelling. Stop talking at us.\" And they don't want any of that.\n\n(00:10:43):\nBut the most effective stories are the ones that we experience as we live life and that we tell ourselves as well because we have the ability by saying things like, \"Oh, I'll never succeed,\" or, \"Oh, she'll never go for it,\" or, \"He's such a jerk.\" Or whatever the stories are, these are all stories. And they may or may not be true, they're usually not true, but our brain doesn't know the difference. It's the most powerful ability our brain has is to understand and see stories everywhere. And so once you can really understand that, you may as well leverage it to be that hero in your life. And even as I say it out loud, it sounds so cheesy, but it's true. This is neuroscience and psychology. We just want to be the heroes, and that's what our focus is.\n\nLenny (00:11:36):\nI want to delve deeper into that idea there. People listening to this might feel like, \"Okay, cool, let me think about the story of my life. This sounds like a fun thing I could do.\" But I think your point is this is central to becoming a better leader, figuring out the story of you and that changing in your perspective on yourself and giving you more... Unblocking you I think is a big part of it. Can you just talk about more just the power and why this is so important? Because it not just like, \"Cool, I'll sit around and think about, oh, here's my story. I was born here, I did this thing.\" Why is this so important to do?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:12:12):\nAnd it's a little antithetical in a way because it goes against what a lot of us believe, especially if we have I'll say product backgrounds or just business backgrounds or tech backgrounds or anything where we've built things for people. For years, we've had this idea that we build companies in a user-centered way where, all right, build for the customer first and all else will follow. And there's some truth to that on the one hand. And I used to think leadership was the same, which is, well, it's not about you as a leader, it's about who are you bringing along on your journey? And how do they need to be heroes? So how do you enable everyone you work with and everyone you want to follow you to join you and feel amazing with it? That's the user-centered approach where it's not about you, it's about who you're bringing with you and the impact you want to make.\n\n(00:13:13):\nBut what I learned is that it doesn't work that way. And you need to flip that, which is when you start with you first at the center of the equation, and then I'm going to do... Everything for me is a diagram. I'm thinking of concentric circles. Ken Blanchard has a great model for this where you start with you, it's the inner circle, then you are able to lead yourself, then you can lead others. It extends to one-on-one relationships. Then once you've got that, you're able to lead groups, teams, and then outward towards the business.\n\n(00:14:00):\nWhen you figure that out and you come from the inside out, it's much, much more powerful because it's not selfish like I would've thought years ago, but it's purposeful. You, as human, we all are driven by a mission, by purpose, by a reason for what we do. And when we're able to have that power us, it then empowers us to connect with others so that we can bring it to life. And especially in a business context, but this is the case in anything, communities and family, but especially in business. It has to start with you. You need fuel from somewhere. And if it comes from without, it's like an eggshell that's just ready to crack. It's not sustainable if it comes from outside.\n\nLenny (00:14:49):\nCan you give an example of someone you worked with that changed their story and what impact it had on their career to make this even more real?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:14:58):\nI can think of a CEO I worked with a few years ago who on the outside was so put together. He was the CEO of a billion-dollar company, successful, raised money like no one's business, was able to get people excited about what he was building, join him. And when we started working together, he had recently hired members of an executive team that were just superstars from Silicon Valley and just incredible. And they were so excited to work with him. He was so excited to work with them as well.\n\n(00:15:42):\nBut on the inside, the story he kept telling himself was he's too nice. Nobody listens to him was another story. \"People don't take me seriously,\" was another story. And then there were what I call horror stories. This is not a scientific term by any means, but horror stories that he told himself were things like, \"We're never going to make it,\" or, \"They're never going to listen to me,\" or, \"I'll never learn to be a real CEO. And the problem with stories like that is they end up taking over your identity, they shadow and cloud your every day and actions you take and interactions you have with people. And when you focus on them so much, they very well will become true. That's one example. I could tell you a little more about that, what we did about it.\n\nLenny (00:16:45):\nYeah, that's exactly what I was going to ask. Yeah, if you could share what you did to help shift his story, and then also just how do people do this for themselves?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:16:55):\nPerfect. In this case... And this is like everyone I work with. And this is absolutely something that everyone listening and everyone in the audience can absolutely do is take a data-driven approach to the stories that you tell yourself. For example, the story, \"I'm too nice,\" it could be true, it could not be true. How did we get down to the bottom of that? In this case, what we did is I went out there and talked to his team. And this is something you can do for yourself as well. If you're extremely busy, you can have someone else do it for you. And I found out how people actually experienced him and his leadership. And I didn't hear he's too nice, I heard he is so heartfelt and so caring. And that's a really cool thing. How rare is that to hear about a CEO, especially a founder? Oftentimes you hear the opposite, which is not really true. Usually when founders are not nice people, they're insecurity's at play. But in this case, yeah, people were like, \"We love him. He's wonderful. That's why he recruited us.\" And so great, all right, validated and a little debunked. Really nice, but not too nice. That was not a problem for anyone.\n\n(00:18:31):\nThen we'd hear things like... Okay, one story he told himself was, \"People don't take me seriously. They don't listen to me. What's going on? I need to command respect and they need to just do what I say.\" And I hear this all the time. I'm using this one example, but this could be anyone that I've worked with. And what we heard from people instead was it's not that they weren't listening to him, but when you're hiring super senior, whip smart executives to work for you, they don't want to be told what to do, they want to have a grand vision that they're excited about, they want maybe some goals to latch onto and help possibly with a strategy to get there, although probably they can got the strategy all on their own. And they want to then show you how they can help you and the business meet your goals and align towards that vision so that you can build the company that you want to build.\n\n(00:19:35):\nThat story, \"No one listens to me,\" it was the wrong story to be telling. What the actual story was is that people wanted him out of their business and wanted to feel empowered doing their C-level and super senior executive level work. \"But we don't want him to be absent because when he does that, it doesn't work. And it's very frustrating when he just disappears for two weeks. So we need him involved, but want him to give us problems to solve. Give us a vision, give us problems to solve and let us do it for you.\"\n\n(00:20:10):\nAnd so they were able to write a better ending of that story together. It was exactly like user research of any kind or customer discovery, which is you find out what could be possible from your customers and then ideally you co-create a better ending together. If you're building products or services, that's how you do it. If you're a leader, you do it by showing up and helping others do what they need to do in a way that feels good for you and that aligns with how you want to be doing things.\n\n(00:20:44):\nAnd so this is one example, but I find using real research and data and actually talking to people is most effective. There are other ways to take best guesses, and I'll use the product metaphor again, which is you can try things and experiment and then see how it works and not talk to your users, but you should probably talk to your customers, in other words, your colleagues and everyone who works for you, and really find out what is the true story and what is possible.\n\nLenny (00:21:19):\nThere's all these stories that people believe about themselves, and to your point, many of them are not true when you actually look at the data, you talk to your customers, AKA your colleagues. I imagine many are actually true or there are feedback you get that is like, \"You are not clear enough about stuff,\" there's things that you actually hear from other people. Does this approach help there as well? Or is there a different tactic for something's actually, okay, you are actually too nice. It's not just a story in your head?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:21:48):\nAbsolutely. There are times when the stories that we tell ourselves are true. And when we go out and find out what's possible, it is something that we're doing that needs to change or isn't working. And so one example is, and this comes up sometimes as well, one executive who I worked with once kept getting this feedback that she was too quiet. And when we went out and got feedback, it was true. People were like, \"She needs to speak up more.\" And this is becoming a problem because she was so quiet that her team thought she was not interested in them. And she would just sit back in meetings, not say anything, and they were like, \"God, she sucks. This is the worst boss ever. I don't even want to be at this meeting. And why is she here? Why am I here?\" And it really was detrimental to them all working together.\n\n(00:22:57):\nAnd then she was frustrated because she was always wondering, well, why are they not performing? They're not stepping up. And so it was frustrating all along. And it was true, as far as they saw it, her not speaking up was the problem. But when we got down to the bottom of what was really going on for her and not speaking up at these meetings is she was just listening. Her processing style was she had to listen, and then maybe a few hours later she'd have thoughts. And so even though the team said, \"We do want her to participate,\" what they really needed to know was it didn't have to do with speaking or not speaking, what they really needed from her was to know that she was listening to them and that she actually heard them and was going to do something about it, and that she was quiet in these meetings, she was not checked out. And so simple solution for that, she could start trying to yell more and talk over people and be obnoxious, but nobody wants that either, and so she just started communicating with them more about, \"Hey, this is my style. I'm a little slower. I often need a couple hours to really process things. I'm here, and I want you to know that.\"\n\n(00:24:12):\nAnd the irony of establishing those lines of communication with your team when they're not getting what they need is that you often end up doing the thing that you've been trying to do but failing to do anyway. Because she ended up talking more with her team just in communicating with them about her style, and then they started communicating their styles with her and with each other. And this is something that, it's not in the book, but you might've heard of this idea of a personal OS that a lot of us like to have, which is, \"Hey, these are my work styles. This is how I process, this is how I do things. These are great ways to work with me, and here's how I'd love to work with you.\" And they ended up doing a lot of that, and worked out really well. But it was true, she was not speaking up, and it was having a detrimental effect. But the answer was not talking more, it actually was listening more and just having a better relationship with people.\n\nLenny (00:25:09):\nThat's an awesome example. By the way, on the personal OS, an another term for that I've heard is README, like your own personal README file.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:25:15):\nOh, I like that too.\n\nLenny (00:25:17):\nYeah, isn't that great? It sounds like there's these two buckets, it's probably more buckets, but one is a story of yourself that is not true that you can disprove by looking at data, talking to people, and then there's almost a story people have about you that they don't quite get what's going on. And then you could change their story by communicating, \"Here's what I'm really doing. I'm actually just listening and I'm actually really deeply paying attention.\"\n\n(00:25:41):\nIf we pick an example, say imposter syndrome, which comes up a lot on this podcast where people feel like, \"I am an imposter in this role. I have no idea what I'm doing. It's all going to crumble if I mess up.\" Say someone has that in their head, everyone can tell I am an imposter and it'll all crumble. How would you recommend someone that this is real or not to understand is this a story in my head or is this real? And what do people actually think? Do you go talk to people? How do you recommend people go about that?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:26:15):\nCertain stories we tell ourselves are actually quite functional and do not necessarily need to be rewritten. Imposter syndrome for an example, if you're going around saying, \"I feel like I'm an imposter. I can't believe I'm doing this,\" you can try to fake it till you make it, you can try to... I always think of... I'm totally dating myself here, but Stuart Smalley in Saturday Night Live in the '80s and '90s, he would look in a mirror and do his affirmations and say, \"I'm smart, and I'm whatever.\" And Doug-\n\nLenny (00:27:00):\nI'm good enough, I'm strong enough, and gosh darn it, people like me or love me.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:27:08):\nThere you go. It's like you could do that, and it's all very mechanical, and there's ways to prop yourself up, but what if you took a counter-intuitive approach and looked at that story, I'm an imposter, and instead asked, \"Okay, that's a good story. How is that serving you?\" Imposter syndrome, it's something everyone has at one point or another. When we default to these behaviors of, \"Oh God, I'm an imposter. Okay,\" over and over and over again, I know it doesn't feel good, but we default to that because it's serving us in one way, otherwise it wouldn't become a habit. And I always think of habits as an itch. If you have an itch, you scratch it, you feel better. There's a reason why we scratch itches; it feels better. If you do it too much, it hurts.\n\n(00:28:09):\nAnd something like that, telling detrimental stories, have that impact. But when you can intercept them at just the right time and say, \"Okay, what if that is true? How does it serve me to constantly say, 'I'm an imposter whenever anything gets hard?'\" One co-founder I worked with a while back, she did this whenever things got too hard. And then she was convinced, and founders have this a lot, \"Who am I to be running this company? And what am I doing here? And oh my God, I can't be doing this.\" But when we looked at how that habit of calling herself an imposter served her, what she realized is that every time it kicked in, she worked harder. And it just meant she was hitting some kind of a growth edge. When she would jump into action, she would learn something new, she would read 20 books, she would go out, take a class, she would listen to podcasts and on and on. And she would get better at this new thing, it was fun for her, and then she would feel less like an imposter over time, so it was a very functional thing for her.\n\n(00:29:32):\nThe problem is when she did that too much... I work with a lot of women who this is the case for. She often did way much work. And so she took on emotional labor for other people. She did 10 times as much work as she needed to do, actual work. In her role, she was playing COO and CFO and CEO. And it's just like she didn't need to be doing all of that. And so on a spectrum of it's actually helpful, give yourself a pat on the back for jumping into imposter zone every time things get hard to the other side of the spectrum, which is, okay, but when it's too much, you burn out. You're doing way too much work for other people. You're falling into these unfortunate conventional gender roles that doing extra work you don't need to, so you want to find a happy medium. But I think that the trick is, with imposter syndrome, to not deny it, to embrace it as much as you can, but not embrace it so much that it ends up holding you back. Yes, functional. Even things that we think are bad for us are actually good.\n\nLenny (00:30:49):\nI love that advice. It's so much easier to just, okay, yep, it's true. Maybe I am an imposter, but here's how he can maybe help me while I feel this. And this actually reminds me of another coach who did a guest post on my newsletter a long time ago, and her advice is, \"Yeah, you probably are an imposter. You're in a role you've never done before. And that's pretty normal, and that's okay. And here's how you should approach it.\"\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:31:12):\nYeah. Especially in tech where half of the roles we have are all made up. You're probably the first person ever to have your role anyway, whether you founded the company or you're doing something else at your company. Yeah, it's a great thing. Embrace it.\n\nLenny (00:31:28):\nThe takeaway advice there is essentially ask yourself, \"Okay, this may be how I feel. How is it helping me?\" And don't try to push it down and convince yourself that you're not necessarily an imposter, but how is this feeling helping you?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:31:42):\nHow is it serving you? I have a whole chapter on kryptonite in the book, which is... It's what I call kryptonite. And I use superhero metaphors pretty heavily in the book because I'm I guess a grown child and I like comics and superhero stories. And so are my clients, so I think because I work in tech, I get to do this. But I liken it to kryptonite, which is the things that we think harm us, actually when we look at how they serve us, they can serve a function. Like kryptonite for Superman, it's how people are able to operate on him. They use a little kryptonite so they could get in there and do some surgery and then get out. It serves a function, but when it's too much that can be detrimental. Yeah, how does it serve you? It's a question that it's so important and so, so powerful.\n\nLenny (00:32:37):\nWhat are some examples of other types of kryptonite that you find leaders have? And how do you find that it ends up maybe serving them and being useful?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:32:45):\nThey're the kinds that you should avoid and can avoid. For example, scheduling things is my kryptonite, but I do meetings for a living. And I love being in meetings, strangely, and so not scheduling is not an option, but there are ways around it. I automate everything. And some people hire assistants. And there are ways to do it. That's the kind that you're better off avoiding. There's nothing that serves me about having to schedule things or my inability to schedule things properly. How is that serving me? You know what? I don't care. It doesn't matter. Just the kind that you need to avoid.\n\n(00:33:30):\nOr you could say toxic people or people who just don't add anything to your life. There are kinds of just like, \"All right, done. Moving on.\" But then there are the kinds that it's usually on the inner kryptonite side where you can look at, \"Okay, well how does this serve me?\" And so wide swath of people example is dyslexia. I work with a lot of founders, CEOs and senior executives who are dyslexic. It's very, very, very common, especially for CEOs. You could say, \"Well, that's kryptonite, having to read things or do things with text.\" And it can feel like that to a lot of people, yet when you look at the science of something like dyslexia, it's not so much an impairment, it just means that your brain is operating at a different level in a different way than most people.\n\n(00:34:42):\nSame thing with ADHD. And you could extend it to autism and ton of other things as well. But when you're dyslexic, you're thinking spatially, you're thinking big, you're thinking visually, you're not... Yes, you mix up letters or you're struggling with big blocks of text; that's fine. If you're founding a company, you're not in documents all day long anyway probably, so that ability to think big and spatially and visually is probably how you created your company in the first place, or if you work at a large corporation, how you catapulted into executive leadership that way because you're a visionary and you do all these things.\n\n(00:35:23):\nI think kryptonite, the inner kind of kryptonite, that's how I like to think of it, which is you think it makes you weak, but when you can look at how it serves you, it's often not the case. It could be something that is often classified as a disorder like dyslexia, ADHD, and it could be quirks like the one earlier, \"I'm too quiet.\" Well, no, she was just a really good listener. She just didn't realize that she had a poker face on when she was listening. And no one knew she was listening. Everything, just look at how it serves you. It's the kind you need to avoid, the kind of kryptonite that you need to really look at and embrace. And once you embrace it, just like with the superheroes, it becomes ideally something that's useful in small doses like Superman, or it could be something more like Hulk, which is you could say his kryptonite is his anger, but that's also his superpower. And he can't get rid of it, or if he does, he becomes Mark Ruffalo being really boring like in the latest Avenger movies and he is all meditating.\n\nLenny (00:36:31):\nJust moping around.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:36:32):\nYeah, I don't know what the point of that is. Yeah, that's how I see Kryptonite. It's actually a really, really amazing, amazing tool that we can all leverage.\n\nLenny (00:36:41):\nThe flip side of kryptonite is a superpower. And I definitely want to spend time here. I'm a big believer in this, you are too, of just how important it is to lean into your strengths and identify what you're better at than most people and use that as your way of getting ahead versus trying to, say, just remove these kryptonite/things you're not good.\n\n(00:37:06):\nFor me, it was really a big deal. I actually worked with a coach while I was working. And this was in the biggest step changes for me is just realizing I'll never be amazing at X, Y, Z, but it turns out I'm really good at these things, and so let me just use those things to achieve the things I'm trying to do. As one example, I'm never going to be an amazing public speaker. I hate that stuff. Even though I do this podcast, it's not my strength. And it turns out I much prefer writing and sitting there and thinking, and that's what led to this newsletter. I started doing the thing that was pulling me and was easier for me and ends up being really successful because that's another way of achieving the same thing, it turns out. Here's the question. Why is it so important to think about your superpowers? How do you identify your superpowers? And just how do you think about this area?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:37:53):\nOn the one hand, there's so many studies that show that when we play to our strengths, we're much more effective than when we try to fix what's broken. It's a waste of energy to fix what's broken for the most part. But when you can amplify your strengths and figure out how to use them productively so that you can fulfill your purpose, meet your goals, do what you need to do in life and bring others along with you, it's just that you're such a bigger impact that way.\n\n(00:38:31):\nI'm going to give you an example. And it's funny that we're here talking about this because a while back, I remember we first met over email. I was thinking of resurrecting my newsletter. And I hate writing. And I've written two books; I hate writing. But more than hating writing, I hate email. I hate sending emails, reading emails. I really struggle with it. But yet I have this newsletter that people love and people were begging me to send more of over the years. And at the time, I was like, \"Oh, maybe I'll dusted off.\" And I remember emailing you about this and asking if we could have a call because I had questions about newsletters. And your answer was, \"No, no, no, no, no. No calls.\"\n\nLenny (00:39:23):\nI don't know if it was that. I don't know if it was that.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:39:23):\nSomething like-\n\nLenny (00:39:28):\nIt was just I prefer to avoid calls whenever I can.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:39:31):\nYes, there you go, \"Prefer to avoid calls whenever I can.\" It was very polite, right?\n\nLenny (00:39:32):\nOkay, yeah.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:39:35):\nBut it was, \"Happy to answer any questions you have. Can you shoot me an email?\" I don't remember if this was my answer, but I think my answer to me was, \"No, no emails. I can't give you my questions written. Maybe if I can record them for you, I'll think about it.\" And I think in the end, the irony is I ended up resurrecting the email list a while later, and now I do send occasional newsletters that I actually like writing and people enjoy. But I knew, okay, it'll take me like five hours to write down my questions for you over email; and I knew that was not right for me. You knew having a meeting was not right for you. That was fine. That was great because in the end, it was easier for me to write an entire book than to write that email to you. It probably was faster to write my book than it would've been to write the email to you. And in the end, here we were having that first conversation, which is really fun, but it's in a way that feels good to both of us. Play to your strengths and good things happen. I could get better at writing emails, but you know what? Not worth my time. And you could have more meetings, and not worth your time either.\n\nLenny (00:40:55):\nLet me tell you about a product called Sprig.

Is there an example you can think of someone that you work with where identifying their strength and then leaning into that made a big impact on them?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:42:15):\nGosh, I see this all the time. I especially see this with founder CEOs because there's this very heavy misconception that when you are again catapulted into some kind of senior leadership position, that you're supposed to be a certain way and you're supposed to be loud and opinionated and controlling and tell people what to do, but I've worked with some amazing CEOs who are just incredible listeners instead. And it's the same thing, which is they embrace what works for them and they don't try to be what they're supposed to be. Well, they have to learn that.\n\n(00:43:01):\nBob Iger as an example from Disney. I haven't met him. I know people who've met him. And I just always hear, \"Such a sweet person. So nice and such a great listener.\" You can control the world and do it in your way. And so yeah, I see this all the time, any of your strengths, they operate again on that continuum with kryptonite. But if you can figure out how to leverage them and really be comfortable with them, cool things happen, cool things happen.\n\nLenny (00:43:31):\nThe big unlock for me was realizing that you can achieve all the same things using different strengths. You can be an amazing CEO being very loud, charismatic visionary. You could also be great CEO, being very quiet and thoughtful and deliberative and working in small teams versus like, \"Hey everyone, listen to what I have to say.\"\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:43:52):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:43:53):\nOkay, how does somebody identify their superpowers, their strengths? I know there's some tests they could take. Very tactically, what do you recommend people do? What do you send them to figure out here's what I'm really good at?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:44:04):\nThere are tests out there. I have personally not found them as helpful, but some people love them. And so if you've ever taken a StrengthsFinder test or there's a V-I-A character strengths test I think it's called. Those are the two most popular. And you can just take a multiple choice quiz and it'll tell you what your top five strengths or characteristics are. And I don't find it useful because if I just get a list of things, I will never remember what the list is. And it also has no context for me, and so what I do and what I find works better for my clients as well is to pull your superpowers out of your stories from your past and your present, and then eventually figure out how to apply them and transpose them to your future.\n\n(00:44:58):\nBut if you look at your peak experiences from life, from work, but especially from life... Because even if you want to be a better leader in a work context, there's a difference between work and life. It's very blurry, so you're better off not separating them. But if you look at your peak experiences from your past, I would go back to when you were a kid, what's something you did when you were a kid, like a project you worked on or something you were a part of that completely, totally lit you up and that you were so excited about? And I would then look at something from your more recent past. What's a project or something you worked on in the last maybe 10 years that just jazzed you up and you were just so excited to do? And then I would also look at just how did you get into your line of work, the thing that you're doing now? What's that meandering path?\n\n(00:45:59):\nAnd when you can look at these three stories as moments in time and you can lay them on top of one another, what you see at key moments is your superpowers popping through. And they're the things that empower you to make an impact, they are the things that do make an impact. And so an example I'll give you is one of... God, another executive I worked with a while ago, she kept being told in this dreaded 360 reviews at her company, they were obsessed with... This is another big, big tech company. They were obsessed with superpowers at this company. And so she would get these 260 reviews from her team telling her what her superpowers were. And so they kept saying, \"Attention to detail.\" And she was like, \"What on earth? I hate details. That's my kryptonite. I cannot deal with details,\" yet they kept telling her, \"Wow, you're so great. You have this attention to detail.\" And then they kept giving her more detail-oriented stuff to do. And she's like, \"I should be doing strategy and high level stuff. What is happening here?\"\n\n(00:47:22):\nAnd she could say, \"My strength is strategy.\" And I hear that all the time. \"I'm a strategist.\" What is that? It doesn't even mean anything. That's not a superpower. I don't know, that means nothing. But when we looked at her past and her stories, what we were able to pull out is that she was really great at connecting things together, connecting themes, connecting pieces, trends and connecting people; connecting ideas together, and then connecting people to ideas. That's when she was happiest and that's when she was most effective.\n\n(00:48:04):\nAnd so eventually, that being a connector, it was a superpower, one of her superpowers. It also became part of her identity. And then over time, she was able to shed the great attention to detail thing as she just started embracing that ability to connect. And it made her much more effective at her job in the end. Yeah, look to your past and you can pull out key moments and see what your superpowers are.\n\nLenny (00:48:30):\nWe'll link to these tests that you recommended just for people to explore. I took a couple of them, and they were actually really useful to me, so I think if nothing else, it's a good little context to have while you do this other exercise. And I don't know if I got this right, but one is think about peak experiences in your life, including childhood or mostly adult life, do you recommend?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:48:50):\nYeah, I would go back as far as you can. Definitely childhood, childhood.\n\nLenny (00:48:55):\nAnd peak meaning amazing, happy experiences? Is that what we should look for?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:48:59):\nIt doesn't have to be happy or sad, it's just you were at your best. It lit you up. And so for example... I have a few, but... Well, no, let me ask. Enough about me, so other people can hear this in action, when was the time when you were younger or a kid or anytime in the past when you were just at your best, really lit up doing something that just fueled you?\n\nLenny (00:49:31):\nTo me, I guess I think of not necessarily an specific example, but just accomplishing things always gets me energized. I did this hard thing. Selling my startup, that was a peak experience. There's one.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:49:48):\nSelling your startup.\n\nLenny (00:49:50):\nYeah. And starting the startup.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:49:53):\nAnd starting the startup. What compelled you to start the startup?\n\nLenny (00:49:59):\nI always had this goal of I want to start a company, which is a terrible reason to start a company, but I had a goal I wanted to start a company. I had set this goal, in two years I'm going to leave this job and start a company. And two years later, that's exactly what I did.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:50:13):\nWhat was it about starting a company that made that something that you were so interested in doing?\n\nLenny (00:50:19):\nI wanted to prove to myself that I could do it, I think is the core of it. I keep reading about startups. All these people are doing interesting things. I want to just see if I can pull this off.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:50:30):\nOkay. You wanted to just see if you could pull it off.\n\nLenny (00:50:33):\nYeah. And I also felt like I had the skills to do this compared to other folks that were starting companies and trying their hand at a startup.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:50:42):\nYou wanted to do it because you wanted to see if you could do it and you thought you could do it.\n\nLenny (00:50:47):\nYes.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:50:48):\nWhat's so cool when you do this exercise, if we were to do it, we are not going to do it now, it'd take a little while. But if you were to unpack enough of those stories, even if you can't go far back to your childhood, because sometimes you don't have those memories. If you could unpack at least three of those scenarios, you would find themes. For example, it could be that one of your superpowers is doing things because you can do them. And that's really cool when applied in the right ways. You said you did the exercise. I'm curious to know what you came up with.\n\nLenny (00:51:35):\nWhat I'm thinking about as you talk about this is I was very shy my entire childhood, and I think people didn't expect me to achieve big things because I was always just this nerdy, shy guy. I think there's always this chip on my shoulder of I'm going to show people what I could do. I want to show that I'm capable of more. I think there's a lot of that there.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:51:55):\nWhen you can look at that in context, what you could see is you could see how it's helped you through life, even if it came from adversity. I'm sure you can also see times when that has not served you and when over indexing on, \"I'm going to do it just because I can do it,\" has actually done a disservice to you. And so that's how you end up using them, which is you really look at, all right, from here to where I now want to go, how can I use this? And what do I need to watch out for if I'm going to over index and use this too much? Yeah.\n\n(00:52:40):\nAnother blanket example that I'll give is problem solving, this keen ability to solve problems. I work with a lot of high achieving especially founder CEOs who are amazing at solving problems. And that's how they got to where they are. It's usually why you start a company. Well, for the rest of us, you do it because you want to see if you can do it. Otherwise, it's just to solve a problem. But when you're a super senior executive, at some point you can't be solving problems for everyone. And if you're just in the weeds solving problems all day, that's when you're not doing your real job and you're going to be the whole team and your whole company nuts. And so you have to figure out, okay, if this keen ability to solve problems is a superpower, how do you apply it differently?\n\nLenny (00:53:37):\nYep. That super resonates. A lot of times, you just are interested in the problem. It's like a puzzle and pulls you in. And that gets you in trouble.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:53:46):\nIt can.\n\nLenny (00:53:46):\nTo answer your question, what these tests told me my number one strength was adaptability, that I could just adapt to situations, which has pros and cons, but I super resonates. I find that I could just fit into things and adapt.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:54:00):\nAnd it's a perfect example. And, as you see, it has its pros and cons.\n\nLenny (00:54:06):\nAgain, just for people to think about, because I really think this is such an important topic and it makes me want to write a newsletter post about this, just how powerful it is to identify, here's the things I'm very strong at and why it's important to double down on those versus think about solving your weaknesses. Your advice here is maybe take these quizzes that'll give you a sense of maybe your superpowers, and then think about your peak life experiences when you're the most yourself I think is how you describe it.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:54:34):\nWhen you're at your best.\n\nLenny (00:54:34):\nAt your best.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:54:38):\nAt your best. Yep.\n\nLenny (00:54:38):\nAnd there's an element of also when you're energized, which came up a few times on this podcast. Look for things that give you energy because there's something there.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:54:46):\nYes. Yep. Because then if you subscribe to... I'm sure your audience is familiar with this idea of managing your energy, not your time, which is great for managers, great for anybody, this will help you do that. If you're using your superpowers, you will have more energy. If you use them too much, then it's going to detract. But you want to be doing more of that, more of what lights you up, more of what you love, and figuring out how to manage the rest, whether it's outsourcing or sometimes fixing. But, I don't know, we're all grown adults. It probably is a matter of outsourcing or getting help or supplementing. We don't have to fix everything.\n\nLenny (00:55:32):\nThere's this guy that we'll link to in the show notes, but another executive coach, Matt Mochary, who we had on the podcast who is just like a walkthrough of how to do an energy audit on your day so that you can identify what gives you energy. And this is actually exactly what led me to this path. When I left my job, I specifically paid close attention to what gives me energy after a meeting I had, after a call, after things I did in the day, and what zaps me of energy? And I just decided I will do more of the things that are giving me energy. And that ended up being this newsletter and eventually this podcast, so it really works.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:56:06):\nThere you go. And I know Matt Mochary works similar to me with a lot of founder CEOs where you have to do that. You have to do that because chances are you're exhausted, you're burnt out; you are spending your energy in the wrong places. And so it applies to anybody, but especially when you are leveling up in leadership and doing something new and hitting that growth edge, you got to be doing it. It's just, yeah, you'll run yourself into the ground otherwise.\n\nLenny (00:56:39):\nI imagine many people listening to this or feeling like, I wish I could not be in these dumb meetings that I'm in all the time and these stupid reviews. And there's a lot of stuff you have no control over that also are very energy zapping. What advice would you give to people thinking that?\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:56:55):\nWell, okay, let me qualify this with this is why I'm not a career coach, by the way. I don't help people navigate how to change jobs or leave jobs because I think if you're spending most of your time in your day doing things that are zapping your energy and you hate things you're doing in your job, maybe you're not in the right job. I don't know, if I was a career coach, I would just tell everyone, \"Oh yeah, quit your job. I don't know what you're doing there.\" But there's a lot of truth to that, which is if there are things that you can control energy wise, great. Manage your energy, not your time. If there's really nothing you could do about it and it's the context and it's the situation, then your next best thing is trying to figure out how to change the context or the situation. I'm pretty ruthless there, I think. This is what I still bring from product management, I'm ruthless when it comes to prioritizing things. And so-\n\nLenny (00:57:58):\nI love it. This is prioritization.\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:58:00):\nYeah. There you go.\n\nLenny (00:58:02):\nThis reminds me of a Steve Jobs quote that I love of... His advice is just, \"If you wake up every morning and you're feeling dread for the thing you're doing, it's okay to wake up sometimes and feeling that and feel like, ah, I'm not excited about this day, but if it keeps happening over and over and over and over, that's a sign that maybe you should make a change.\"\n\nDonna Lichaw (00:58:21):\nYeah. I think there's something there. And actually, to bring this back to kryptonite, if it's something little, like let's say Zoom fatigue for example, I know it became definitely a topic when the pandemic hit a bunch of years ago, but I've been working remotely for, God, years, years, and even pre-pandemic. And I'm in meetings all day long. I love it. I love working with my clients. And they're all over the world, so we can't always travel to be with them. We do sometimes. They can't always travel to be with me. But the video's the next best thing, but it can be exhausting. And so does that mean I'm not just never going to have video calls ever? No, because I love what I do, and so I've discovered little hacks for that. One, which is don't schedule too many meetings a day. Great. Do lots of active stuff in between gym walks, whatever, try to get in-person social time, no meeting days.\n\n(00:59:34):\nAnd for during meetings, right here, I've got one of my squishies. There's the neurological thing with Zoom where we're just getting stimuli through our eyes and through our brains, but we're not getting physical stimuli, the same I would be getting if we were in a room together hanging out. Even having you just be on the other side of the room and we were chatting, it would be a very different physical experience that would close that circuitry for me and leave me more satisfied as opposed to on Zoom, my brain's on the lookout for something. And so I, a lot of my clients do this too, fidgets help ground me when I'm on Zoom calls. And it's like, okay, great. There are things you can manage, but yes, like that Steve Jobs quote or idea is if, God, if you really don't like and are getting energy sucked for most of what you're doing and it's constant, you got to change your situation.\n\nLenny (01:00:43):\nI really like that tip. That's very practical. And buy something that you can play with with your hands. I use this pen, actually, is what I'm playing with usually with these podcasts. I need something squishy maybe.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:00:51):\nYeah. Well, there's-\n\nLenny (01:00:52):\nIf there's anything you recommend, let's link to it in a show notes.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:00:56):\nOh my God, I know, I know. One of my superpowers that's actually my kryptonite, but if I'm humorous about it, I'll call it a superpower is starting things that I don't finish. And so I think I have a picture of it somewhere on my website, a superhero supply kit that I prototyped a while back that has all these different types of fidgets and chocolate and all these things to get you through your meetings. And there are pointy fidgets that give you energy in the morning, and then there are squishy ones for the afternoon. And I've done way too much research. I should send you one at some point. I have a few boxes prototyped, and I never ended up doing anything with them, so I just send them to clients sometimes. But-\n\nLenny (01:00:56):\nI'll take it.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:01:46):\nGood. I'll put that on my list of things I-\n\nLenny (01:01:49):\n[inaudible 01:01:49] finish.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:01:49):\n... need to do, just also my kryptonite.\n\nLenny (01:01:51):\nOkay, there's just a couple more things I wanted to touch on and then I'll let you go. One is you have this interesting approach of using product frameworks that people know in their day-to-day building product to translate that to personal growth advice. And so in your book, you use that design thinking double diamond framework for helping people think about their own life and career. Is there a couple you could share that people can maybe think about and use of just here's something you know in product. Here's how you can actually use this in your life, in your career.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:02:23):\nI trained with Gestalt coaches and therapists when I moved into coaching. Gestalt psychology and Gestalt therapy, the idea is that... Well, it's a lot of what I talk about and especially in the book, this idea of when you want to create real lasting powerful change, you don't do it by forcing change to happen, you instead do it by embracing what is and what's working and then figuring out how to leverage that. And so it works for individual therapy, it works for coaching. It also works more broadly for organizational change and giant transformational development projects or initiatives or any kind of change. But one of the theoretical underpinnings there is when you do understand what's working and you start to get an idea of what's possible or something that you want to go try or do or create or make happen, you don't just go and change everything or do it all at once, you take one tiny step and run a little experiment to get data.\n\n(01:03:41):\nAnd so the way I work and the way I learned to work, at least through Gestalt coaching and Gestalt therapy, was you don't leave a session with me without having tried a little experiment first. The analogy there is we would call it an in the room experiment versus then get out of the building and do an experiment. And if you subscribe to, I guess I'm going to call it lean methodology. Although I feel like these names change all the time, and oh, that's so 10 years ago. And I don't care what anything's called, but the idea of experimenting and getting data and then using what you learn to make informed decisions on how to change things and then how to build things and how to make things even more successful, it works for the digital products that we build, it works for the businesses that we build, and it works for ourselves. And ideally, you do it for all the above. And so anything you think is true or you want to do, it's a hypothesis until you test it. And you go out, get data, and then you can do a bigger version, bigger version, bigger version. It works with human psychology and all the things we want to create and learn in life just as well as with products.\n\nLenny (01:05:08):\nIs there an example of one of those little experiments you ran in a session?\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:05:10):\nBring us back to the example of that one executive from earlier, to keep the continuity here, who thought she was too quiet and her team was complaining about her. And actually the irony, often when people come to me with things that they're embarrassed by, on the outside, she was actually quite loud. As a person, she was really loud and brash and all these things, it's just that in terms of her team, they didn't like how quiet she was in meetings. Especially that dissonance there was confusing to them because she was so loud and boisterous and energetic. But using that as an example, I remember when we first realized that the reason why she was so quiet in meetings is because she was spending a lot of time doing deep listening.\n\n(01:06:04):\nShe started to chill out a little bit about it and stop beating herself up as much and started realizing, \"Oh, that's a good thing. Why am I so insecure and getting so angry at myself for doing this all the time?\" That's good. She started to chill out a little bit, but then the idea of a bigger experiment was in your next meeting later this afternoon, see what it feels like to sit there and just listen for an hour, just see what it feels like. And then see what you make of it, and then we'll figure out what to do about it. But just see what it feels like to listen and be in awe of, \"Wow, I'm really listening.\"\n\n(01:06:47):\nAnd so that would been a get out of the building experiment. But the idea of doing that petrified her, because she's like, \"I can't sit for a whole hour just being like, 'Yeah,' patting myself on the back. 'I'm a good listener. I'm a good listener. Look at me.' Or not even good or bad, but wow, I'm really listening.\" That's all I ever want from people is just this radical appreciation, this awe of, wow, I'm doing this. Everything changes when you figure that out.\n\n(01:07:17):\nBut we decided to run a little experiment because why waste a whole hour of her life when we could just do something in 30 seconds in the room right now? And so we tried a little role play of, all right, what would it be like to just sit here for 30 seconds? And I talked about I don't know what. And just listen to me. We're having a meeting. What does it feel like for 30 seconds to do that? And we did that. And her answer was, \"That was terrifying. That was God awful. Oh my God, I have to do that for a whole hour?\" And eventually over time, it got easier. It was very uncomfortable.\n\n(01:08:05):\nThis is where I'll bring up the whole superhero analogy. Again in superhero stories, when superheroes discover what their superpowers actually are, they don't just say, \"Oh, thanks for this gift,\" and then run and save the world. Every superhero has a really hard time accepting, \"Oh, this is my gift? Hell no.\" Or, \"Wait, what do I do with this?\" And they wreak havoc and they make a mess and it's uncomfortable. And even Superman tries to get rid of his superpowers often because he doesn't like being super. And so it's hard to know what you're really, really great at.\n\n(01:08:45):\nBut when you can run little experiments that get bigger and bigger over time and really learn how to... Whether it's embracing your superpowers or anything. Let's say there's something you want to try, something scary. Or look at me with my superhero supply kit. And I was like, \"I really want to build a gift box. Let me prototype that.\" Okay, fine. Five years later, have I done anything with it? No, but I built it. I saw what it's like. It felt good. And then as I got bigger with my experiment of thinking about how can I mass produce this? Where would I sell it? What about taxes? Oh, God. And not for me. And that's fine, so I give them away as gifts. But whether it's product or you or your business, small experiments, get data, go bigger, adjust, iterate, all of it. You will accomplish incredible things.\n\nLenny (01:09:39):\nAnd I think a lot of the power there is you feel like, \"Wow, there's something new here I didn't expect. And this is a new interesting learning. Let me see where else this can go.\"\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:09:49):\nYes. And I think the biggest difference that took me a long time for me to learn is that as opposed to product development, you're testing things not just how is it working and what are the numbers? Well, even with product, we're not just looking at numbers all the time, but when you're experimenting with yourself and with people you work with and with your teams and with your companies, you run it through three filters. And this is not my term, but I'll say head, heart, hands is what I like to think of, which is head, okay, how's this going? What are my thoughts? You might think, yeah, okay, I'm listening. That's fine. Okay, next. Emotionally, how is this going in your heart? Wow, I'm terrified. This feels awful, or this isn't so bad, or whatever it is. Or it might be, no, that's fine. I hear that a lot. \"That was fine.\"\n\n(01:10:52):\nBut then how does it feel in your body? Our bodies are ultimately where we take in our stimuli and then store all of our experiences. And our body also tells us what next action we should take. And if you run an experiment and scan your body and it's like, \"Yeah, that felt fine. And then how do you feel in your body? \"Oh, numb.\" Well, that will tell you something.\n\n(01:11:19):\nOr I hear this all the time, \"How do you feel?\" \"My hands are on fire.\" Or I was working with one client yesterday, and I think she said something like, \"That was fine,\" and her whole face turned bright red. And then after a minute we were able to say, \"Okay, what's going... Fine versus your face turned bright red. What happened there?\" And then she realized, \"Oh, I'm burning up. This is not okay.\" Yeah, run it through head, heart, hands. Life is like product thinking and it's also not. We have to go deeper and more broad with our experiences, and then we'll learn the most and be able to make the most informed, amazing decisions. And this is so cheesy, but live a good life and make an impact and be a great leader and do all the things you want to do that way.\n\nLenny (01:12:17):\nBeautiful. The point you just made about how much of our thinking is driven by our body, we just had a whole episode on this a few episodes ago with Johnny Miller where we talk about the nervous system and how most of our neurons go up to our brain versus down from the brain and our body's telling our brain what we're feeling, so there's a lot. If you want to explore that as a listener, that's a great episode. We'll link to it in the show notes.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:12:40):\nOkay, good, good.\n\nLenny (01:12:41):\nOkay, let me ask you a question that my colleague suggested. She gave me a few suggestions to ask you. And I imagine this is what worked for her in you two working together. Question she had is how as an executive coach do you help identify/bring out goals or wishes that people have in their subconscious but are unable to realize or articulate?\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:13:06):\nStart with the ending. Come up with how you want things to turn out, and then work your way back. And start as far out as you want. It could be decades from now, it could be five years from now, it could be three years from now, it could be a year from now, it could be a quarter from now. It could do all the above. And really imagine. Close your eyes; imagine you're there. Engage all your senses. What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you see? Who do you see? What do you feel emotionally, physically? And what are you doing? What have you accomplished? What's amazing?\n\n(01:13:45):\nAnd then if you've got something exciting, go back to the beginning and then imagine how you got there and just write that journey out. If you think of it as an experimental roadmap, then start thinking, all right, what's the first thing I need to learn to know if this is right? Work your way towards that and onwards.\n\n(01:14:15):\nIf you do that and you're like, \"I have no vision,\" which I remember is what happened in this case, you sit with it for longer. You can't write that journey if you don't have that ending. And so you sit with it for as long as you need until you get it, and then you create it. And again, it sounds so cheesy in a way. It's not like I'm subscribing to this anything you want in life, you just say it and accomplish it. I know life doesn't exist like that, but dream it, see it, and then start taking steps to get there. What you end up creating will very likely be very different than you ever imagined. But this is what's going to fuel you. We're human, we're visual creatures. And so yeah.\n\n(01:15:08):\nAnd I have the whole mission section of the book and I have lots of choose your own adventure options for troubleshooting and the pitfalls to look out for. But yeah, that's my long-winded answer. Envision it, then figure out how you might've made it happen and go make it happen.\n\nLenny (01:15:27):\nI was going to say this is a great tease for a part of your book we didn't get too much, so a good reason to go buy the book. Something I was going to say as you were talking is with this coach I worked with once, we did this exercise. And I was like, \"Okay, five years or maybe 10 years, I'm not working anymore. Here's what I'm doing. I'm living here. Family.\" She's like, \"Everyone in tech is like in five years they're not working anymore. They're just done, they're retired.\" Everybody's in that. That's their future, which is not obviously realistic, but it's hilarious.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:16:00):\nYeah. I remember years ago, 10 years ago, I was like, \"10 years from now, I'm definitely not working in tech, definitely not working in tech.\" And then here we are. But it's funny how things end up. But what matters is that you're clear on the impact that you want to make. And how you make it, who knows what'll end up being the case. And that you're doing it true to yourself.\n\nLenny (01:16:23):\nAnd impact is another chapter in your book, which we also didn't get to, so there's a lot of context.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:16:27):\nSo many teasers. Yes, go buy the book.\n\nLenny (01:16:29):\nSo many teasers. Donna, is there anything you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:16:36):\nNo, no. It's been so delightful chatting with you. No, nothing else.\n\nLenny (01:16:44):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:16:47):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:16:49):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:16:55):\nHere's a funny thing is I used to have all these different books for different topics. I'm going to give you the worst answer, but it's true. All these different books for different topics. And similar to when I was working in product, I had all these different books and whatever. And then eventually I realized I need to write the book that I really want to recommend, and so I did that with my last book, The User's Journey, which is all about product development. This sounds so conceited, but I really believe it, I now recommend my book the most. And it combines all my favorite ideas, philosophies, books out there. And you can check out the bibliography to see all the 30, 50 books that you can read otherwise. But man, I sound like such a jerk.\n\nLenny (01:17:40):\nNo, I get this because this is what my newsletter was originally is I'll just do my best to define an answer to this question I get often and put it together and make it really good so that I could send people, \"Here's my best answer to this question.\" But every time I do that, they're like, \"Oh, brother, just sending your own blog post to me. Just tell me an answer.\" I'm like, \"But I've written the best version of it here. This is going to answer everything you're looking for.\" I go through the same pain. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:18:15):\nA show I've been watching recently, and I feel funny saying this because the fourth season was on recently, and I didn't enjoy it as much, but the first few seasons were so much fun, was For All Mankind on Apple TV. Have you seen it? The-\n\nLenny (01:18:32):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:18:34):\nIt was so much fun. It was all like what if the space industry was in an alternate reality and the last few decades were different than what they were? That was very fun. And for work stuff, a lot of my clients love watching Ted Lasso for all the leadership stuff. And it's just such a sweet show. But yeah, For All Mankind is recent. That's really fun.\n\nLenny (01:19:00):\nNext question, do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask? Usually this is meant for people interviewing candidates, but is there anything that comes to mind when I ask this question?\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:19:10):\nThe question I always ask when I'm interviewing clients. Because if I'm not excited about what you you're doing, we're not going to work together. Yeah, I want to know what that is. And so imagine it's a few years out and you've had the best however long, year or three years of your life, what would you be telling me? And I like to add a twist to that, which is from Benjamin Zander in a book called The Art of Possibility, where with his students, he used to say, \"Give yourself an A. If you could give yourself an A at the end of the semester, what would you be writing? Write the ending.\" And so I love doing that with clients, just seeing what could be possible that we could create if we work together?\n\n(01:20:10):\nSame thing with job candidates, although it's reminding me, one of my first jobs I ever got out of college, this is in the early .com days, I remember my then who became my boss, he asked me that question when he was interviewing me, where I saw myself in five years. And I remember at the time, my answer was, \"Not here, and hopefully making documentary films.\" And this is like a .com job, but in hindsight, I can't believe I answered it that way. I was like, \"Yeah, I'm going to be doing something else in five years.\" And he loved it so much that he hired me on the spot. And we're still friends many decades later. Yeah, that's my favorite interview question all around.\n\nLenny (01:20:55):\nIt's similar to question people often using product of just what is the ideal experience that... What's the perfect version of what we're building? And let's work backwards from that. Or what's like the 10 X version?\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:21:05):\nExactly. Or if you want to add to that, if you could wave a magic wand, it's the same kind of thing. What could be possible?\n\nLenny (01:21:13):\nI love the leveraging of product thinking into coaching. I love it. Next question, do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love? Maybe you already mentioned the squishy thing. Maybe something else comes to mind.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:21:28):\nMy fidgets, all my fidgets. I have so many; many different kinds. They're so much fun. I'm sure I have a better answer somewhere. But yeah, I would say my fidgets.\n\nLenny (01:21:38):\nWell, if you can point us to your favorites in links, that would be awesome. I'm sure people are curious what you've discovered.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:21:44):\nYes. I curate them. I will definitely do that.\n\nLenny (01:21:48):\nHow amazing. I'm going to [inaudible 01:21:48] that.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:21:47):\nYep. And there's also the long one, the sticky monkey noodles. So many.\n\nLenny (01:21:48):\nBeautiful, purple.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:21:52):\nSo many.\n\nLenny (01:21:53):\nAmazing. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to sharing with friends or family, either in work or in life?\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:22:04):\nIt's a phrase that I got from one of my mentors, and I teach it to all my clients, which is... Her catchphrase is, \"Isn't that interesting?\" And I have it as a sticky note, a physical sticky note on my computer monitor to remind me, which what it reminds me to do is get into what Gestalt folks call an optimistic stance. And I'm a chronic, serious, acute pessimist. Anyone who knows me, I'm cranky, but I love this reminder to be in this optimistic stance. Again, not that Stuart Smalley, \"Wow, everything's great. Woohoo,\" but it's a kind of radical appreciation. Not isn't this good or bad, but wow, I just stubbed my toe and it really hurts. Isn't that interesting? Let me feel that throbbing toe. Or, wow, someone on my team just talked over me in a meeting 20 times in the last hour.\n\n(01:23:14):\nActually, this happened with a client recently. I was there at an executive team meeting, and someone kept talking over the CEO over and over and over again. And often when that happens, you bark right back or you get angry or you get quiet or whatever it is, but when you can really fully appreciate, isn't that interesting? My shoulders are really tensing up right now. Wow. Whatever's going on. You often have more informed... Not often. You will always have more informed, mindful actions that you can take or not take. You can't pay me to meditate or anything or do yoga, but mindfulness, yeah, if you could just think to yourself, isn't that interesting? anytime something extreme happens in life, you will be shocked at what you learn and at what you do accordingly.\n\nLenny (01:24:10):\nVery Buddhist, non-judgmental awareness.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:24:13):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (01:24:13):\nSimilar.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:24:14):\nIt's exactly that.\n\nLenny (01:24:15):\nNot deciding it's good or bad.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:24:16):\nYep.\n\nLenny (01:24:17):\nFinal question. I'm surprised you haven't used any Dolly Parton quotes in this conversation. Clearly in your book, you're a big fan.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:24:25):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (01:24:25):\nI'm curious, what's a wisdom or quote that comes to mind that you think of from Dolly Parton that might be helpful?\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:24:34):\nYes, and thank you for reminding me, because that was originally what I was going to say, which is one of my... There's so many Dolly quotes. And I think all my favorites are in my book, of course, but one of my favorites is, \"Find out who you are and do it on purpose.\" That's amazing. Another one, \"You don't like the...\" I guess my two favorites. \"You don't like the path you're walking on, pave a new path.\" What more in life do you need than that? There's all, yeah, Buddhist and Gestalt and mindfulness or whatever, but you could just do what Dolly does and you'll be all good.\n\nLenny (01:25:14):\nDonna, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, maybe work with you? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:25:25):\nGreat questions, as always. The best way to find me is through my website, donnalichaw.com. And that'll be in the show notes as well. And reach out to me for a conversation. One of my superpowers that's also my kryptonite is accessibility. I'm that author who will always email you back, even though I hate emailing, always email you back within a day if you send me an email about the book. Same thing about working together. I always make time. Or even just conversation, I make time for any conversations with interesting people if it is exciting to both of us to make it happen. Find me on my website, donnalichaw.com. I've also got tons of free stuff there that you can download as well. Everything that we talked about today, a lot of the things that we talked about today are available there to play with as well.\n\nLenny (01:26:21):\nAmazing. I think we're going to create a lot more superheroes with origin stories, superpowers, kryptonites, missions, impact, all the things you've written about in your book. Donna, thank you so much for being here.\n\nDonna Lichaw (01:26:35):\nThank you, Lenny. This was a treat.\n\nLenny (01:26:37):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

It feels like there's almost been these three eras of Dropbox. The first era of you're killing it.\n\nDrew Houston (00:00:10):\nFor the first several years, it was doubling, 10-xing every year. Taping user counts that we printed out to the wall, and then running out of space on the wall. Having to put 100,000 users, 200,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000 on the ceiling.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):\nAnd there's the second era, which I'll just say, everyone's trying to kill you.\n\nDrew Houston (00:00:26):\nWe started getting all the incumbents. Apple, Microsoft, Google. All of them launched competing products, but weirdly, it was sort of like you see the videos where there's the mushroom cloud in the distance. You see it. But you don't hear, or notice it. It was also clear that winter was coming.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):\nIt feels like the year 2015 was a pivotal year where things started to shift.\n\nDrew Houston (00:00:45):\nI'd start to hear a louder set of critics inside, and outside the company. Less than a year later, Google Photos launches. And not only does it provide a lot of the same value, but they also gave you free unlimited storage for life. And so, they just totally nuked our business model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):\nYou end up fighting wars on three or four fronts against the big kahunas that have infinite cash, and can do whatever they want.\n\nDrew Houston (00:01:08):\nSo it killed Carousel, killed Mailbox, went all-in on productivity. And I wish I could say, \"Then, everything got better.\" It was the opposite, actually. The narrative completely flipped on the company. Suddenly, your employees don't want to wear your T-shirt anymore. Everybody's looking to you, and is wondering, \"How the hell did you get us in this situation?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:28):\nToday, my guest is Drew Houston. This may be the most interesting, and most useful episode of my podcast so far. Especially if you're a founder, or if you someday want to be a founder. Drew shares the very real talk story of what it's been like to build Dropbox over the past 18 years. Including the ups, and especially the downs. He shares stories that he's never shared before, the struggles he's been through that very few people know about, what it's like to compete with big tech, how he's thinking about the future of the company. And also, what he's learned about himself throughout the journey.\n\n(00:02:01):\nThis is a very special episode that I suspect founders will be studying for years to come.A big thank you to Drew for sharing these stories and lessons with us.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nDrew Houston (00:04:51):\nOh, thank you, Lenny. It's great to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:53):\nI have been so looking forward to this conversation for so many reasons. One, is I feel like people just don't realize the wild journey that you have been on over the past 18 years building this company. You told me a few of these stories when we had dinner recently, and I was just like, \"You need to come on the podcast, and tell this stuff. I think it'll be really useful to a lot of people.\"\n\n(00:05:12):\nAnd then also, I feel like you're just a very real talk founder that isn't afraid to share what's really going on. I think a lot of founders don't actually tell you the things they're going through. It's always, \"Killing it. We're killing it all the time.\" So for all those reasons, I'm really excited to have this chat, and this opportunity to stand with you and hear these stories. So thank you again for doing this.\n\nDrew Houston (00:05:29):\nMe too, and I've been a big fan of the podcast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:31):\nOh.\n\nDrew Houston (00:05:32):\nI learned a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:33):\nOh, wow. I appreciate that. The way I'm thinking we structure this conversation is, as an outsider, it feels like there's almost been these three eras of Dropbox. And tell me if I am missing something, but essentially, it feels like there's the first era of you're killing it. Just up and to the right killing it. Dropbox is on fire.\n\n(00:05:52):\nAnd then, there's the second era that I think fewer people know about, which I'll just say, everyone was trying to kill you. All the incumbents are coming after you. I like that it leads you to sigh. This is going to be good. And then, there's the current era. I'll say the third era of just rethinking what Dropbox could be. Does that sound roughly right? That's a good way to think about that?\n\nDrew Houston (00:06:11):\nI think that's right. Yep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:12):\nOkay, awesome. So let's start with this first era, and spend some time here. Which is, I think, the era most people know you for. There's the big Hacker News launch, the demo video of the thumb drive you're always losing, the referral program everyone's always studying. You're almost the epitome of viral growth. And so, let's just talk about just things here that maybe people don't know about. Maybe some moments that are really important to you, memories that stand out to you. So maybe just start wherever you want to start about this time of the history of Dropbox.\n\nDrew Houston (00:06:41):\nI mean, I started Dropbox more out of just personal frustration, and it really felt like something that only I was super interested in as far as file syncing. And focusing on one customer, which is myself. And then there's the story of me forgetting my thumb drive on a trip to New York, and things like that, and coding. I won't get into all that. I had a lot of friends who were in Y Combinator, and many friends who had moved from Boston where I was living out to California. And doing that whole pilgrimage, or kind of maybe one-way pilgrimage.\n\n(00:07:14):\nAnd feeling a little bit left out, but then also having this idea for Dropbox. And then I think some of the most memorable things were the moments where Dropbox really felt like it was taking on a life of its own, or maybe it belonged to the internet, and not so much to me anymore. So for example, we had a lot of success with these demo videos. First, was just getting into Y Combinator. It sort of worked backwards from thinking about, \"What does Paul Graham do all day?\" And my hypothesis was that he just hits refresh on Hacker News like everyone else. Like me, like everyone else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:46):\nThis was you trying to figure out how to get Paul Graham's attention?\n\nDrew Houston (00:07:49):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:49):\nI love that. \"What does Paul Graham do all day?\" Okay.\n\nDrew Houston (00:07:52):\nYeah. Well, my first company was doing online SAT prep, and I was 21 when I started that. But in the world, there's a lot that Y Combinator has in common with college admissions. You have 1,000,000 people applying for very few spots. And the more you can get some kind of hook, or find some kind of side door. That was the thinking, and I was like, \"All right. Well, if I can create some kind of viral video, put it on Hacker News, get Paul's attention, that'd be one way to do it.\"\n\n(00:08:21):\nAnd that was inspired by a book called Guerrilla Marketing that I had read, which is basically how to do marketing if you have no money. Which was a good fit for where we were. I say, \"We.\" It was just me at the time. And sure enough, I made this video that was basically a pretty straightforward screencast of Dropbox. Showing it working on my computer, and then it hit the top of Hacker News for two days. I don't think it can really happen anymore, but sure enough, we got a note from Paul saying, \"Hey, this is interesting, but you need a co-founder.\"\n\n(00:08:56):\nWhich was a problem because it's clear that the YC application deadline for the next cycle was maybe a week or two away. So Paul was basically sending me a helpful note that, \"I know you're not dating anyone, but you need to be married in the next two weeks if you want to get into YC.\" So I ended up finding my co-founder, Arash, and there's just story after story like that in the early days. So I'd say the first chapter was characterized by just feels like one moment I'm sort of paddling in the ocean alone on a little board. The next, I'm just like a hundred feet off the ground on this tidal wave trying to stay on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:32):\nHow long does this period last of just Hacker News to something starts to change? How long is this up and to the right period?\n\nDrew Houston (00:09:40):\nIt was the first several years. So I started the company back in 2007. I might have been 24 at the time, moved to California. And so, I'd say it was first probably seven years from 2007 to 2014 were really that crazy fever dream .com experience where it's a blur. I mean, basically, get into Y Combinator. After we finish Y Combinator, that culminates in Demo Day, and getting your first investors. At Demo Day was this guy named Pejman Nozad who is an angel investor who also owned a rug store in Palo Alto. He runs Pear there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):\nOh, and he runs Pear. [inaudible 00:10:25].\n\nDrew Houston (00:10:24):\nYeah, and he runs Pear now. He introduced us to Sequoia. He came with us to the pitch, which I learned later it was unusual. And that was on a Friday, and then Saturday Mike Moritz is in our apartment. But anyway, so we raised money from Sequoia, and that was a seed round in 2007. So right after we finished Y Combinator. And then, basically, you start with a pretty narrow circle of what you're working on.\n\n(00:10:53):\nI mean, right in the beginning it's just really just coding, and talking to customers. But that circle kept expanding pretty rapidly. So in 2007, we were just building the first prototype of the product. It was in closed beta for about a year. And in end of 2008, we launched at what's now TechCrunch Disrupt. Our demo totally failed. The wifi wasn't working on stage, so a live demo is quite underwhelming. So that took a few years off my life, but fortunately, we had accumulated this big beta waiting list from basically doing another version of that Hacker News video.\n\n(00:11:33):\nEngineered to be even more viral, and have all these memes, and things in it. But similarly, a few minute demo video of, \"What's Dropbox? And here's moving stuff between a Windows PC, and a Mac. And here's all these little Easter eggs about the HD DVD encryption key, or [inaudible 00:11:50] who was one of the first YouTubers. Tom Cruise jumping on a couch in Scientology.\" This was a long time ago. 15 years ago, or something. But we put this video on Dig, and Reddit. And our beta waiting list went from 5,000 to 85,000 people overnight.\n\n(00:12:09):\nSo we got this initial seed audience by chasing that early adopter set. And then, we also figured out these viral motions around our referral program, and shared folders. And so Dropbox started expanding virally for the first several years. And then a lot of the engineering that we applied to the product of Dropbox can't have a bad day when it comes to your wedding photos, and tax returns, and all the things people put in Dropbox. So we took a while to get the beta right before we felt comfortable opening up to the broader public.\n\n(00:12:40):\nBut then, we applied that same engineering mentality to these viral loops. And this was all the era when social media was exploding, and Facebook, and Facebook platform. All these startups were setting new land speed records for fastest to 1,000,000 users, or 10,000,000 users. Things like Zynga. And all of this was built on this emerging playbook of virality, which in turn came from epidemiology. The study of the spread of viruses turned out to be a good parallel for the consumer internet. Draw your own conclusions.\n\n(00:13:13):\nAnd then we were like, \"Oh, there's no reason this wouldn't work for Dropbox.\" And some of our early investors, Hadi and Ali Partovi, talked to us about how Facebook thought about growth. And then there were a lot of great people in the early days who had really fine-tuned, and mastered a lot of that. We tried many things. Conventional, and unconventional. But the things around virality, and the referral program really worked.\n\n(00:13:39):\nAnd so for the first several years, it was just doubling, 10-xing every year. Taping user counts that we printed out to the wall, and then running out of space on the wall. Having to put a 100,000, 200,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000 on the ceiling. So it was wild. And it was super fun, but it was also super stressful. But going from maybe $6,000,000 valuation in 2007, to $27,000,000 in 2008, to then $4,000,000,000 valuation in 2011, being on magazine covers. Just that whole experience was wild.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:19):\nThe visual of the user numbers extending onto the ceiling is such a good one. Of just how quickly things grew. Okay. So let's transition to the second era. So things have been going great, keeps growing. Obviously, challenges along the way, but it feels like it's just grow, grow, grow. It feels like the year 2015 was a pivotal year where things started to shift. Does that sound right?\n\nDrew Houston (00:14:43):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:44):\nOkay. Yeah. Let's talk about that.\n\nDrew Houston (00:14:46):\nYeah. Maybe the end of the first era, the start of our teenage years, would've been around 2013, or 2014. And maybe before that. 2011, 2012, we started getting all the incumbents, or all the big platform companies. Apple, Microsoft, Google. All of them launched competing products in one form, or another. But weirdly, it was like you see the videos where there's the mushroom cloud in the distance. You see it. But you don't hear, or notice it. So it mostly just seemed like nothing happened.\n\n(00:15:27):\nWhen Steve Jobs was on stage in 2011 announcing iCloud, calling out Dropbox by name as something that will be viewed as archaic. And similarly, we always felt like we were in the shadow of the hammer of Google launching Google Drive, which had been rumored long before we even started the company. For the first several years, we were just sort of quivering, waiting for the shoe to drop. And the product's launched, but you would never be able to look at our numbers and see when that happened. And the press often writes about competition like, \"Oh, it's a shotgun blast.\"\n\n(00:16:06):\nWhen, later, I would learn it's more of a boa constrictor. But the end of that first chapter really culminated in us recognizing that we experienced a lot of benefits of being this kind of product for everyone. And in fact, it would be kind of hard for me to describe in the early days who Dropbox is for, or what it does. It was similar to what's a phone for, or what's a computer for? And in the beginning, that was a blessing. It meant that those viral loops would really work. Pretty much everybody you would hit would have a need for something like Dropbox. Either a personal need, or a work need, or both.\n\n(00:16:43):\nBut we recognized even back then before competition that, \"Hey, people are using us primarily for things like backup, backing up their devices, or storage. People are using us for photo sharing. People are using us as a collaborative space at work, and often, in huge companies.\" And then, we felt that there was a lot of tension between these use cases. So for example, the ideal file server replacement for an IT admin is going to look quite different from the ideal consumer photo sharing app. And we also recognize things like, \"Well, we're going to be competing in many cases with the device, or the operating system.\"\n\n(00:17:22):\nWhen you look at something like iCloud, it's like, \"Yeah. When you turn on your iPhone for the first time, it's probably not going to give you an ad for Dropbox.\" So we're like, \"Hey, we need to address some of these issues,\" and expanded to some new areas to diversify. The first two things we did were, after getting enough complaints from IT administrators asking us what the hell these photo sharing features were for, we pulled all the photo sharing functionality out into a separate and new app we called Carousel. Where the basic value prop was phones, to that point, were limited in their storage by the amount of physical storage on the device.\n\n(00:18:00):\nWe're like, \"This is silly. You should be able to have your whole life in your pocket.\" So be able to store everything in the cloud, but have the experience be as if everything were locally there through a lot of caching, and sleight of hand, and thumbnails, and things like that. So there's much engineering there. And then, secondly, we saw people were using us at work, and we're like, \"Well, there's a lot of different adjacent workflows.\" And there was a startup called Mailbox that built the first great mobile email client. Had a lot of funny parallels. They had a [inaudible 00:18:26]-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:26):\nOh, that's right. They're famous for that waitlist.\n\nDrew Houston (00:18:28):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:28):\nThat's a really good point.\n\nDrew Houston (00:18:29):\nWhich was crazy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:30):\nYeah.\n\nDrew Houston (00:18:30):\nAnd so we're like, \"I don't know. Maybe this is going to be our Instagram,\" and so we bought those guys. And then 2014, I'm on stage painting this picture of Dropbox's future. I'm like, \"We're going to help be the way that you remember your life. We're going to be your productivity. The new productivity suite on your phone,\" and all these things. But then it was this dissonance where there were so many things that were going right, and certainly the numbers, user numbers, revenue numbers. We were sort of accidentally cash flow positive maybe a year after launching.\n\n(00:19:06):\nIt was also clear that winter was coming, or that things weren't exactly as they seemed. Then the start of the second chapter, 2015, I'd start to hear a louder set of critics inside, and outside the company. And I'd been thinking for a long time like, \"All right, man, we're really fighting wars on all these very disparate fronts.\" We're with storage. We're competing with the device to back up the device with photo sharing, or competing with Facebook, Snap, Instagram, Google, Apple.\n\n(00:19:47):\nOn productivity, we're competing with Microsoft, and Google. And then, there's a whole new cohort of companies like Slack. And then, there's this experience of one day I am standing on stage talking about how Carousel, and Mailbox, and everything are the future of the company. Less than a year later, Google Photos launches. And not only does it provide a lot of the same value, and in many ways very inspired by what we had done, but they also gave you free unlimited storage for life. Not just photos, but video.\n\n(00:20:24):\nAnd so they just totally nuked our business model in ways that were bad enough in terms of just their obvious impact, but even worse because it was so easily anticipated. So this became a very public, and personal embarrassment for me. How could we not have predicted that, or been out in front of that? And then, that started this period. I'd say that was the beginning of chapter two where it was we went from the company that could do no wrong to the company that could do no right, which was a big flip. It was probably early summer, maybe late spring, when Google Photos launched.\n\n(00:21:10):\nAt first, I'm just thinking like, \"Okay. This was a big miss on my part. How do we get out of this? We need to tackle some of these competitive issues much more ahead on.\" And then, what's the problem? Well, the problem is that every incumbent is going to copy your product. They're going to bundle it with our platforms, and then they're going to kill the economics. And that was clear what was going to happen with Google Photos. It was very similar product experience bundled with Android, bundled with all of Google's different touch points, and then free.\n\n(00:21:51):\nSo that was problematic enough for Carousel, but I'm like, \"Wait, this is going to happen with everything that we're doing. Same thing with Mailbox.\" I had even pitch the founders to join Dropbox by saying, \"Look, you're going to wake up tomorrow, and Gmail, and Apple Mail, and everything is just going to have these swipes and snoozes. The UI, it's not a durable source of advantage. We'll buy that problem from you.\"\n\n(00:22:19):\nAnd that's exactly what happened. So I'm like, \"All right. Even in theory, how do we deal with this?\" And I'd gotten the criticism over the years that Dropbox is a commodity, and investors in the early days would be like, \"Hey, this is kind a graveyard of a space, and DOA.\" And I thought, \"Well, how do other companies deal with this kind of competition, and commodities?\" So there's a great book by AG Lafley and Roger Martin called Playing to Win.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:53):\nRoger's been on the podcast.\n\nDrew Houston (00:22:54):\nYeah. I'm a huge fan of Roger's. And I was like, \"All right. Well, if we think we're selling a commodity, try literally selling paper towels.\" Which is what AG, and Procter & Gamble, and a lot of CPG companies do. And AG was the CEO of Procter & Gamble at the time. And basically, he and Roger did this download of how they think about competition, and markets, and advantage. And a lot of it's thinking really critically about where do you play, and how do you win?\n\n(00:23:28):\nSo being very selective about the markets you're in, and only being in markets where you can have a leadership position. And then, being really crisp about what is your leadership position? And so that was a very timely thing to read in terms of, \"All right. Dropbox looks like one product, but it's really participating in many different markets. And our big risk might be that we're the number two best thing in each of those markets, which would be a bad situation.\"\n\n(00:23:55):\nAnother really influential book was Only the Paranoid Survive by Andy Grove, and I'd been a big fan of Andy's. High Output Management is another great book of his, which was my introduction to management. At least, his theory of management. So just loved that book. And then Only the Paranoid Survive talks about Intel's experience where they actually had something like this happen that I wasn't aware of, and we all know Intel as the microprocessor company, Intel Inside. At least in the 80s, 90s.\n\n(00:24:27):\nBut before, they were in microprocessors. They sold memory, RAM. In the 70s, they were running into a situation where they were really high growth, successful business selling memory. But then, they had these Japanese competitors that were just building memory faster, better, cheaper. Just on every dimension. And potentially, also, things like anti-competitive things where the government might be subsidizing these manufacturers. This feeling not only they might just be better at the game, but there's also not a level playing field.\n\n(00:25:05):\nBut meanwhile, you wouldn't see it in their numbers. They're still growing. And just that there were these weird dissonant experiences where salespeople just suddenly have problems selling into accounts that used to be a slam dunk, or things that used to work just stop working. And this happens. Blackberry's, and Nokia's best sales years happened in the years after launching the iPhone. So these things don't actually change immediately. And so Andy labeled these moments strategic inflection points for a company, and I'm like, \"Yeah. Then, we're definitely in a strategic inflection point.\"\n\n(00:25:40):\nBut they were dealing with, \"Oka., our whole business is memory. How do we deal with this competition?\" And there's this little vignette where he and Gordon Moore, one of the other co-founders of Intel, said, \"Hey, let's pretend we're consultants to ourselves. What would we do?\" And what they immediately decided was, \"Oh, well, we clearly get out of the memory business, and put all of our chips on this sketchy little microprocessor thing that was much smaller. But very high growth, and potentially big market.\" And then they're like, \"Well, why don't we do that?\"\n\n(00:26:10):\nOnly problem with that is it's like Google saying, \"Yeah. Let's get out of search, and go all in on Gmail, or something, or YouTube.\" So it just seemed insane. Andy cautions in the book that, \"Look, most of the time CEOs want options. They want to hedge their bets, but what you really want to do in these strategic inflection points is go all in one thing.\" Or as Mark Twain put it, \"Put all your eggs in one basket, and watch that basket.\" And I was like, \"All right. This makes sense to me, but man, this is going to be painful.\" So we go away for 4th of July. I'm with my family in New Hampshire. I reread the book, I come back. All right. I'm like, \"Well, we really got to do it.\" Then, I just killed Carousel, killed Mailbox. Went all in on productivity...\n\nDrew Houston (00:27:00):\nKilled mailbox, went all in on productivity. To some extent, that was a relatively easy decision because most of our subscribers, 80% of people paying for Dropbox were using it at work. But that meant foreclosing on photo sharing and consumer and storage and all these things that Dropbox had become synonymous with and to this day are some of the things that we're most recognized for. And I wish I could say then everything got better. It was the opposite, actually, the narrative completely flipped on the company. The press started, we killed these new products, and then internally and externally, the narrative became super negative. Articles would come out every week or two, like, oh, Dropbox could be the first dead deck of corn. And then sometimes we've all seen this in tech companies get in this washing machine of self-perpetuating negative press. And if it goes deep enough, I mean, Uber had this for a while later, Meta's had this over their history, lots of companies where you just can't get the monkey off your back.\n\n(00:28:06):\nAnd then because what the reporters end up doing is they basically park their metaphorical van behind your office. They interview all the people that you just fired and then print everything that they say anonymously as if it were facts. And there's a lot of truth to what the press were saying, so I can't really blame them or saying they were being unfair, but it immediately put recruiting into this deep freeze. You're just in the situation. You've started this company, it's been super successful, and then suddenly your employees don't want to wear your T-shirt anymore. And frankly, you don't even want to wear your T-shirt anymore. It's just your pride in your own company takes a big hit.\n\n(00:28:50):\nAnd meanwhile, I've talked mostly about the external market competitive forces, but inside the company was a mess too. The business's revenue had scaled so much faster than our ability to hire and build the right infrastructure and operations internally. And so everybody's just panicking and being like, \"All right, well good, Drew, we're not doing Carousel, we're not doing Mailbox. What are we doing?\" And the truth was like, if I knew the answer to that, we would be doing it, but it's just this is going to take some time to figure out. So it was pretty tough when everybody's looking to you as the founder and CEO looking for quick fixes and answers, and also just wondering, how the hell did you get us in this situation?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:36):\nWow. So we're going to talk about how you're actually turning things around and the work you're doing now, learning from this experience. But I have a lot of questions about this part of the journey.\n\nDrew Houston (00:29:45):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:46):\nJust to almost summarize the journey, it's like launch, killing it, viral, find all these opportunities, find all these big markets. You start three different product lines. There's the enterprise use case, there's the consumer file storage use case, there's photo sharing, there's productivity, and then basically every big incumbent's like, okay, great, we're going to come eat your lunch. And you end up fighting wars on three or four fronts against the big kahunas that have infinite cash and can do whatever they want. It's interesting the way you described the Apple launch of just like it was this mushroom cloud you didn't quite see for a while, but the Google Photos launch was like, okay, that was more clear of like, okay, this is bad news. I know it's always easy in hindsight of like, oh, I should have done something different when Apple launched this thing. But is there anything maybe you could have done, or was it even possible to have adjusted course at that point? Or was it like, okay, this is tough and we need time to figure it out?\n\nDrew Houston (00:30:45):\nWell, we panicked about the Apple thing too, because that also, that created a much smaller version of the tempest in a teapot that the Google Photos did. It was just much less public. Or it was just less obvious that we would be so out position. And actually we were more surprised to the upside when it's Google Drive launches, iCloud launches, OneDrive launches. And even as they build version two that we just didn't really notice that much of a problem. And I also studied over the years what happened in Netscape and companies like [inaudible 00:31:27] MySpace or these other cautionary tales. And interestingly, Internet Explorer was a thing that eventually undermined Netscape enough to permanently throw it into a negative trajectory. But Internet Explorer 1.0, 2.0, even maybe 3.0 just weren't that good and didn't really do anything but Internet Explorer 4.0, 5.0 and all the bundling, that really made a big difference, or big negative difference.\n\n(00:31:55):\nAnd then another thing that was interesting was, so there's a big time lag where between when these products launch and when they actually have an impact, because often it's not so much the existence of the product or it's availability, it's the constant bundling or the constant iteration, or it's the boa constrictor, in any given second, it's not much tighter, but over the following day, you're in a bad place.\n\n(00:32:24):\nBut another thing that was interesting was one cool thing that we got to do and moving to California is you get to actually meet people who had been at these companies. And one of those people was a guy named Bill Campbell who was at Netscape during that whole period, and I had asked him, I'm like, \"Man, that's really unfair. That sucks what happened with Microsoft and bundling with Windows and all these things and the antitrust and this and that.\" And he's looked at me, he laughed at and snorted and he's like, \"Microsoft did not kill us. We killed ourselves.\" And so that was the other half of what was the problem within Dropbox was a lot of our wounds were self-inflicted in that we were struggling to keep scaling and launching all these products. And the Dropbox products had stagnated.\n\n(00:33:25):\nAnd I started to learn the hard way that, okay, yeah, I now understand what Bill is talking about, because we were hiring all these smart people, but the things we would do as a company would seem really stupid. And then some of these things were me personally, like yeah, I knew about from reading all these different things, but for whatever reason, I guess we just kept going anyhow. We were just too confident in our ability to respond, or we got lulled into this complacency, we were like, \" Oh, well.\" Because it hasn't been a problem, it won't be a problem in the future.\n\n(00:34:03):\nBut I'd say there's something about the Google Photos launch that just really set things off kilter. And then also for me personally, I think, I'd go from feeling good but stressed out all the time to mostly feeling bad all the time. And I just remember leaving, really trying to get away from the office for a little bit during this period, picked my teeth up off the ground. And the good news, I bought a place in Hawaii, so I was doing that in Hawaii, but didn't feel very good in any way.\n\n(00:34:42):\nAnd then I learned. I had to really figure out a lot of different things for myself to be the leader that could get us through this. Because mostly what I felt was like, man, I felt like we'd been doing such a good job, but now, man, if I really screw this up, or maybe I don't know what I'm doing. And then I had to really reset on a number of fronts. One is I just remember thinking my 18-year-old self would be like, what the hell are you complaining about? You did it. This is so great, and yet I felt so bad about things. And so I'm like, yeah, both of those things are true. How do I navigate that? And I think one part that was really helpful is getting a sense of equanimity basically, and doing a lot around mindfulness and meditation to distance... One thing that happens when you're a founder and your company succeeds is your identity is fused with the company. And so it's easy to get into a situation where you only feel good if the company's... Or how you feel is how the company is doing, and you need to separate that a little bit. So what that looked like for me is recognizing, yeah, there's really not an easy button that keeps things up and to the right forever. And most of the entrepreneurs that are my heroes had various periods of wandering in the desert. Those things instead of just being problems were probably the crucible that forged the people that they became. So the presence of badness is not necessarily you are bad. And it's like, yeah, now you're just getting your stripes as an entrepreneur.\n\n(00:36:41):\nAnd people were really helpful during that period. So I mentioned Bill Campbell. He was nice enough that we just stayed in touch and he would take me out to dinner every now and then. And I would be freaking out, but I was always surprised he'd never seemed to be freaking out. And mostly he'd just be saying like, all right, he'd dust you off and smack you and say, get your ass back out there. And he was literally a coach of the Columbia football team in addition to being a great technology executive and advisor to many of the great founders that I looked up to. He was really helpful because he helped me believe in myself even when I wouldn't believe in myself. And then people like Andy Grove who had written all these books, I'm like, well, at least I'm having this problem. But yeah, then that raised a question for me. I'm like, okay, I've been through this chapter one where everything's up and to the right, but I ran out of merit badges or Xbox achievements to collect. I was like, we did it. We got the product to this many users, we got it to where we got this valuation, or let me back up. So my whole life, or it's common, I think for a lot of founders, especially if you get good grades and stuff, you follow pretty linear path from childhood, from first get the right test scores, then get into the right college, get into the right college, take the right classes, get the right internship, get the right job. And early startup life is like that a lot. It's like, okay, have an idea. Find a co-founder, get into Y Combinator, get funding from Sequoia.\n\n(00:38:22):\nWatch an MVP just in 10 million, a hundred million, billion valuation. And I felt like we'd cleared all that. And so actually one of the other problems was, I don't even know what Dropbox needs to be and I don't even know what I need that I want to be in the world. And so part of this was also reconnecting to some kind of sense of purpose, because if I was really honest with myself, I was like, well, I'm just checking boxes and advancing and leveling up like a video game or something, but now I'm here. I'm like, all right, is it just big numbers bigger? It's also not that fun to just launch something that you put your soul into and then just have it get crushed with these competitors. It's even worse when you're bringing all these hundred other people who worked on that thing through that meat grinder too.\n\n(00:39:10):\nSo are we just inventing things 10 minutes before Google and Apple do? If not, what are we doing? And then if we're really, really honest with ourselves, I think it's hard to argue that no one would've invented cloud photo gallery that wasn't constrained to your local storage. So I had to really rethink what does the company need to do. That actually took a longer time to answer than I wanted, but then also just what do I want to do? And I was like, well, you know what? I'm going to do this.\n\n(00:39:45):\nWhat I ended up settling on was like, look, coming back to my 18-year-old self, I was like, all right, stop complaining. This is a pretty good situation. You wanted something where the learning curve would be steep. Here it is. You get to do this really meaningful work to build things for millions of people, work with awesome teammates. There's always good things about it, and you've chosen this life, so stop complaining about the burdens because it's really dangerous if you start to resent the job or feel like a victim because that's just corrosive to everything else that you can get in this spin cycle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:20):\nWhat helped you come to that place? Because that sounds like a very hard place to get to and a very important place. Was that Bill Campbell advice? How long did it take you to go from this is not going well and life sucks to, okay, let's look at it this way?\n\nDrew Houston (00:40:35):\nI think there were a couple unlocks that were pretty fast, but I think again, this was not like, oh, then I felt better and we lived happily ever after at all. There were some moments of recognition where I was able to, I always try to get away from the mayhem or the whirlwind and recenter myself and do think weeks and things like that. And so those were really helpful because I felt when I diagnosed, well, when I'm on this treadmill and just firefighting or how did I miss this important thing? It's like, well, basically the root causes of being on the treadmills, I was too busy firing to aim, and then I thought I would do my aiming on vacations and things like that. But no, I need to get off the treadmill every now and then and make the space to really address some of these bigger questions.\n\n(00:41:31):\nBecause it's not like I didn't forget about them. They just were always below the fold on my to-do list to deal with. And then until a few years go by and you're like, wait. Yeah, we really were just strategically out of position. The other way I came to some of these conclusions is a combination of things. So I think picking up a meditation or mindfulness practice, having therapists personally, having coaches, having friends and mentors, other founder friends. And so I wouldn't say it was any one thing, but I think you have to build this whole ecosystem of support around yourself and recognize no one's going to do that for you. And it's super important.\n\n(00:42:12):\nAnd then to Bill's other point, he was like, yeah, Microsoft wasn't killing us, we were killing ourselves, I think having to ask some hard questions to myself of, yeah, some of these wounds were self-inflicted. As much as there might be, I could look at this and say, oh, Microsoft is mean, or Google was mean, or Apple was mean, but I'm like, I drove the ship towards these rocks. So that's one downside of being founder, CEO. You can't blame the last guy. I think one of the big questions every founder has to figure out is not just, how do I have equanimity? What's my purpose? But then also, what am I doing that is destroying the company?\n\n(00:42:57):\nBecause everybody's got strengths and weaknesses, but as CEO, both your strengths and your weaknesses are massively amplified and a lot of blind spots in your personality can become huge cultural dysfunctions in the company. And so step one to dealing with that is building awareness. And one thing that floated around the company for a while was the Enneagram, which on the surface is a personality typing thing like Myers-Briggs. I often describe it as it's like Myers-Briggs, but actually useful. The way it works is it's a personality typing system. You get a number from one through nine that's your dominant... Or there's nine types that are numbered. It's similar to Myers-Briggs in that Myers-Briggs has 16 types of letters like ENFJ or different things. But I find that Myers-Briggs is more descriptive. So it tells you, okay, you're an introvert, not an extrovert or vice versa. You're judging instead of perceiving. But I could never really work out what that meant. And so it's descriptive versus predictive or causal.\n\n(00:44:06):\nEnneagram I find is the theory that is really about your fundamental motivations. What are you running towards and what are you running away from? And the theory goes through some combination of your wiring from your genetics and your early childhood. Your autopilot is fixed after your childhood in that you just have instinctive responses to things. Now it's autopilot. It doesn't mean it's your destiny. You could override it, but it's super important to become aware of what are you running from and towards. And the Enneagram gives you a really good map to do that.\n\n(00:44:44):\nAnd so I'm reading this book and it starts by you type yourself, and I'm rolling my eyes. I'm like, okay, I'm a seven. What's a seven? And then you read, each type has its own chapter and you read the chapter and I was like, oh my God, this completely describes who I am down to my core. And I was almost looking over my shoulder. Who the hell did this? I thought I was a special snowflake, but apparently not. Okay, I'm listening. And [inaudible 00:45:16] with a lot of my early coaching experiences, which are, you do a 360, your coach sits you down, they're like, here are your strengths. In my case, it would be things like, oh, you're really creative and you like new ideas. That's okay. And second, you really love people. You build great relationships with people. I'm like, okay. Uh-huh. Third, you're really comfortable in chaos and resilient. I was like, this coaching thing is great. See, yeah, that was my first coach. And then you flip to your development areas because no one calls them weaknesses.\n\n(00:45:49):\nIt's like, all right, one is you're bored by routine and really undisciplined. Second is you're really conflict avoidant. And third is you're intuitive, but you're also pretty chaotic and don't create enough structure for people so they're mostly confused. And when you pair the two together, you're like, oh, wait. Yeah, I'm creative and like new ideas, but I'm bored by routine and I'm a bit of a space cadet. All right, you love good relationships with people, but you don't want to make them unhappy so you don't tell them the truth basically about things that are difficult to hear. And it's going to be a similar map of things depending on your personality type or circumstances. But the Enneagram was that map for me to be like, okay, I've got these things that are genuinely great, but I need to address these downsides of the company's conflict avoidant, so we're not telling the truth and then making a bunch of predictable mistakes, or I'm creating this really chaotic environment where people don't know what they're supposed to be doing.\n\n(00:46:57):\nThat's a problem. My personality is quite directly, I'm going to torpedo the company unless I do something about it. The same is true for any founder. And I'm a type seven, it's the enthusiast. It's like, again, central casting is like a lot of new things and creative and love just interesting things. But then a space cadet, FOMO, some of the shadow side of it, and every type has a thing like that. So really understanding, okay then, I was also just frustrated in the day-to-day of my work, I'm like, yeah, I'm not really getting to do these creative things where I'm too busy firing to aim. I'm missing these bigger picture things that are really taking the ship way too close to the rocks. Okay. Then I need to then understand what those things are and either work on myself or hire the right people who don't have those issues or one way or another, just make it so the company is not so exposed to my personal dysfunction.\n\n(00:47:56):\nAnd so yeah, it was a whole constellation of things like that where it's like, all right, we have to get... I mean, after this whole tailspin, we got to work. I'm like, all right, first business issues. The most urgent issues were just blowing all this cash. We need to get the P&L to look a lot better and get out of this land grab mode or fighting with Google on giving more free storage away or just being in these fundamentally unprofitable things. And so we did that. We cut the unprofitable parts of the business. We turned cash flow positive in 2016, maybe several months after this reckoning, and that set the tracks for getting into a billion run rate in 2017, going public in 2018.\n\n(00:48:40):\nWe had to come up with a new vision and mission for the company, which I'll maybe save for chapter three. And then I was also just trying to do things that helped sustain me through the difficult things. I'm like, well, I am an engineer. As a little kid, I was coding since childhood. I knew I wanted be a founder. I didn't know I wanted be a CEO, so I backed into being a CEO. And then, so I'm like, man, there's a lot of tedious things about being an executive. So I was like, I'm going to find ways to automate tedious parts of my job and learn machine learning in 2016 and '17, and that ended up being really important later on. But then also it's just coming to terms with my job and what I wanted to do from a personal perspective, which included things like, oh, I'm lucky in that being a CEO is, I always wanted a steep learning curve.\n\n(00:49:33):\nIn a lot of professions like in sports or math or chess or certain academic fields, you peak in your twenties or thirties. CEO's not like that. You can go your whole life and still not be a master. So I'm like, for better or worse, it's pretty cool that I can do this kind of work. And then I don't really get that much out of just chasing bigger numbers. The thing that is my favorite thing about Dropbox is looking over someone's shoulder in Starbucks and seeing if the little Dropbox icon is there. Building something that becomes a verb, taking some of the pain out of technology, things like that. So really reorienting. Yeah, it's not about just the external scoreboard just much. It's more about the craft of being a great CEO and building things I'm really proud of or really making a difference. And so those kinds of things, none of them all coalesce. It's like this lens that slowly and stubbornly comes into focus, but making the time to have some of that reflection was super important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:36):\nSo much of what you're describing makes me think about founder mode in a lot of different ways. One is your point about how you didn't have a lot of time to think about where things might be going and how the markets are shifting, and that has to happen, basically, no one else is going to do that if it's not you. Also, just this idea of how much of the solution was you understanding yourself better, reflecting on where you have strengths and weaknesses. Also, I'll mention, so before I had Brian Chesky on the podcast, I asked you, \"What should I ask Brian?\" And you asked me to ask him basically about founder mode, which was the first time I think you talked about it, and now it's like this whole thing. So you've been in the middle of all that for a long time. I guess just any thoughts on the importance of that and how you think about that as a founder?\n\nDrew Houston (00:51:19):\nSo founder mode means a lot of things to a lot of people. So it's a bit of a Rorschach test, but I think parts of it that really resonate with me are, there's this evolution you go on as a founder where you don't know what you're doing and everything is new and unfamiliar. And then you're also very involved in all the details because there's no one else to be involved in the details. It's not like someone else is coding for you if you're just in your room at home. But then over time, you have to, there's this, Ben Horowitz calls it the Product-CEO Paradox, where the first way that companies die is from founders not letting go. And so you need to learn to scale yourself and hand off your responsibilities and operate at a higher level of abstraction. But then the second way that companies kill themselves is the founders get too far away.\n\n(00:52:23):\nAnd I felt like I had done that. That's a big part of the problem that led to a lot of this chaos at the end of chapter two, where I was like, oh, man, I'm on this treadmill. I'm doing stuff, but I'm clearly not setting the right direction. Or people are confused or it's not working, and I was too distant from the product. And then there's all kinds of issues you can get into as you hire an executive team and get that to function well. And so I think there's a debate to what extent founder mode is a mindset or a destination. To me, I think the destination part is pretty important. I think it's like after that learning journey, suddenly you have this conviction from actually knowing, from having lived experience and navigating a lot of these things where suddenly it's a lot clearer.\n\n(00:53:10):\nYou don't have the same kind of confusion or learning curve problem. And then if you start out being too far leaned in, then you lean out too far. And I think a lot of that founder mode flip is when you're like, hey, this is not the company I want to be running. I need to be more involved. I need to stop making excuses. And basically, I also don't want to apologize or negotiate all the time for the kind of company that I want to be part of and run. So I had that too over time, maybe more towards a chapter three, some of those elements of... And I don't know if there's a way to get to this destination without some level of pain. Certainly the Elons and Steve Jobs of the world had big spans of wandering in the desert where they were not as cool as they are-\n\nDrew Houston (00:54:00):\n... spans of wandering in the desert where they were not as cool as they are today. The things they were doing weren't working, and they managed things very differently in that sort of post wandering phase. Suddenly had this level of conviction, and intuition that they might not have had before, or they sanded down some of their more counterproductive instincts. Again, there's a lot of surface area.\n\n(00:54:27):\nI don't know if anybody has a common definition of founder mode, but certainly that evolution, the way I think about is it is very difficult. One of the hardest things when you're running a company is that you're hiring all these execs who the only thing you know is they know a lot more about the subject matter than you do. What does it even mean to bring someone in, bring an exec who had managed a double-digit billion dollar P&L at Google, and what am I supposed to tell him how sales works or marketing? It's easy to be too leaned out there where you're not really setting a clear direction. Each founder is going to have their own things that are easy, things that are harder. Step one is being aware of them, and then being intentional about, how do I offset those things? Then you eventually get to a point where the learning curve flattens out. You actually do have some experience, and you can have a lot more conviction about what the company should do, and where you want it to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:25):\nAwesome. The way you described it to me, which has really stuck with me, is as a founder, as you said, you're in there leaning in, doing, on top of everything, micromanaging. Then you lead out, and hire execs that you think are smarter than you, and delegate more. Then it's like, \"Oh, things aren't going great,\" and come right back into it.\n\nDrew Houston (00:55:40):\nYeah. Specifically, it's often well-intended or it's often even not conscious, but as you hire these execs, and then you also build up an HR function, you get coaches, and things like that, and then the things are not going well, one thing that can happen is you start collecting all this feedback. People are like, \"Wait, if I can give Drew some negative feedback, then maybe I can displace some of the ...\" It's sort of easy to get into a situation where you're sort of being my to-do list of problems, just weaknesses, and flaws I needed to work on was super long, way longer than anyone else's. On the one hand I'm like, \"Yes, I am wholly accountable, and responsible for everything in the company as its CEO.\" That's not wrong. But you can end up just carrying too much of the water, so a lot of it ended up having to be this pushing back a bit. Be like, \"All right, yes, there are things I need to work on, but that can't be an excuse for my execs to somehow evade accountability.\"\n\n(00:56:52):\nThere's these sorts of systemic things that can creep in for sure. Then you get this feedback, and you're like, \"Now, I'm doing all this behavior,\" or, \"Now, I'm behaving in ways that I don't think are really right.\" Or I'm like, \"Everything is just negotiated compromise with everyone on the roadmap or on how we behave or strategy.\" At some point you end up blowing that up as a founder, and that was certainly my experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:19):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

Basically, what I understand from what you're going through right now is you're rebooting the team, you're rebooting the core business, you're rebooting the product. I think it might be good to start with the team. You talked a few times about just how you feel like you got to a point where the team wasn't shipping as much as you thought you would, as much as you think they should. Talk about maybe that part of it, of just realizing, \"Hey, this part of the business needs to change. Then we can talk about the product, and the direction you've discovered.\"\n\nDrew Houston (00:58:42):\nMy playbook as an entrepreneur is to get really frustrated by something, and then try to solve that personally. I'll cover the team, and what direction we ended up choosing together. My first frustration was forgetting a thumb drive, and then wanting to never have that problem again.\n\n(00:59:03):\nBut my second big frustration was like, \"Man, this scaling this company was way harder than it should have been.\" Thank God I had people like Bill, Andy, friends, mentors to guide me along. A lot of people don't have access to that. But I feel like I could have written myself postcards that would've made this a little bit easier. Or, there are just some things that don't make sense about how you scale a company. There seem to be things that are really broken about the way we work in general.\n\n(00:59:40):\nAs I was piecing through a lot of the challenges, I'm like, \"All right, what should Dropbox do?\" We should probably not do things that would've been invented by everybody else 10 minutes later. Where are the problems that are not solving themselves? One problem I felt like was not solving itself was this problem of being just on this treadmill where I'm like, \"I'm working really hard. I'm in meetings all day, emails all night. Is this it?\"\n\n(01:00:08):\nFirst of all problem, no complaints. But I'm like, \"This is so weird. Yeah, I'm making huge strategic mistakes, because I'm too busy firing the aim, and I'm upset at myself about a lot of these things.\" But then I look left, look right, I'm like, \"Wait, everybody is too busy firing the aim.\" Everybody is on the same treadmill.\n\n(01:00:28):\nI'm like, \"This is bizarre. Who's winning here?\" It's like if I was working hard, and the company is benefiting, then no problem. But I'm very busy, but I'm not really productive. I'm not putting in a lot of creative input. Then the company's not getting a lot of creative output. It just seems like lose, lose, lose all around.\n\n(01:00:50):\nI'm like, \"Why are we on this treadmill?\" We know from brain science that people are most happy, most productive, fulfilled, engaged, kind of everything you want, where we'd rattle off the same list, like when people are focused, when there's some kind of flow state, when they've had enough sleep, when they have a sense of purpose. We know all that. Yet we go to work, and it's like this cage fight of who's busiest, who's gotten the least sleep, who's most inbox zero. Then you look at the environment on our screens, now, especially after COVID, we live with that.\n\n(01:01:33):\nThat's where we work. We don't work in an office, no matter what flavor of hybrid you are, you're working on a screen. COVID relocated us from offices to screens. You look what's on that screen, it's like, \"Yeah, if you wanted to design a working environment that made it impossible to ever focus, ever get into a flow state, bombard you with just constant interruptions, distractions, and busy work, then yeah, you can squint and see me even before COVID, but definitely after.\n\n(01:01:59):\nBut that people are like, \"Yeah, I'm really not feeling great.\" I'm not feeling super engaged because half of my work is bullshit, the other half I'm just distracted to death. I'm like, \"Why is this this? All right. Maybe Dropbox doesn't have to exist. Maybe we did the thing. Maybe I should go.\" Maybe I'm ready for the tech bro ascendancy. Maybe I should be flying cars, space, cancer, climate ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:26):\nAyahuasca.\n\nDrew Houston (01:02:28):\nYeah, right. But then I would talk to people who were actually working on those things, and they were on the same treadmill. I interviewed this director of engineering at SpaceX. I was like, \"Oh my God, you're actually going to Mars. This is so cool. How do you guys work together? How are you going to get to Mars?\" He's like, \"I don't really understand the question.\"\n\n(01:02:50):\nI'm like, \"What tools do you use? How do you work together? How are we going to get to Mars?\" The answer was basically, \"We're going to get to Mars through a lot of emails, and a lot of files.\" I was like, \"Oh, my God.\" Most of the time, we correctly think about technology as just like force multiplier, like the amplifier of our abilities. But from another perspective, we're only as good as organizations as our tools, or tools can become the limiting factor. It's really a problem when the mechanism through which we were getting work done has gone from being a force multiplier, and amplifier to a suppressor. We are the frogs in the boiling water where this kind happen one day at a time.\n\n(01:03:36):\nAll the people working on those things, and there are many others, they're all dealing with the same issues of, \"I can't focus my tools. I'm fighting with my tools.\" Somehow the tools went from helping us get the work done to becoming the work, as we layer. It went from 5 of them, to 10 of them, to 500 of them.\n\n(01:03:51):\nYeah. I'm like, \"All right. If Einstein were alive today, what would his day be like?\" He would wake up. He'd have to delete a bunch of LinkedIn notifications. He'd get down to work, start writing equations, and then someone would Slack him, and interrupt him. Then he'd get back to work. Would we still understand relativity if Einstein were living in that kind of working environment? Probably not.\n\n(01:04:17):\nEven just visiting my dad at work when I was a kid, a lot of things were the same. He had a phone, a PC and an office, but he could turn his phone off. He got 5 emails a day, not 500. He would literally come home from work with a briefcase, put it down, and stop thinking about work. Then when he would be in the office, he could close the door, and actually get stuff done.\n\n(01:04:40):\nI'm not saying we should go back to the early 90's, but I'm saying it wasn't always like this. The whole frontier of productivity at the time felt like it was just taking us in the wrong direction. Things like Slack, which are wonderful tools, also chop up your day into little fragments, and make you cognitively diabetic. There's a lot of empty carbs in our collaboration, and our collaboration tools.\n\n(01:05:05):\nI'm like, \"Okay, here is a problem that's not solving itself. Actually, none of our competitors even are framing the problem correctly. What we should be recognizing is that our ultimate non-renewable resource is our time, our attention, mostly our brain power, our creative energy. I think as a civilization, we're going to, hopefully in 5 or 10 years be like, \"Man, we took this crazy detour where we basically hooked up that brain power to this thing that was just burning off half of it as friction with our tools.\" That was dumb. Yet no company was even talking about this, let alone fixing it.\n\n(01:05:49):\nThen we came up with a new Dropbox mission. It became Dropbox is designing a more enlightened way of working, because the way we were working is unenlightened, unexamined. Meanwhile, we were patient zero as the company. No one was doing a lot of thinking. Everybody's kind of busy. Everybody's bumping into each other. There were a lot of cultural problems. Like that we were faster. Your company grows, and rises, the easier it is for new people in the company to think they hit a home run instead of starting on third base. A lot of complacency, entitlement, and preoccupation with things other than our customers or other than our products set in.\n\n(01:06:37):\nIt wasn't all bad. I think there were a lot of good things we had to pay attention to. We were scaling up the business financially. We were getting ready to go public. We had to mature a lot of things, but we lost sight of the place that money is coming from is from our customers, and the thing they really want is a great experience.\n\n(01:06:58):\nWe've been tackling this in a lot of different ways. First is just things like after COVID hit, suddenly the world is working in a completely different way. We saw this as a big opportunity, not just a crisis. Or once you got past the crisis part of COVID, there was a big opportunity. COVID kind of wrecked everything, but we didn't have to put the floorboards back down in the same places. I'm a big fan of people like Peter Drucker, and lots of people who think about the nature of work, and this idea of we're finally decoupling work from our physical location. It's a big deal. It's probably one of the biggest changes to knowledge work in our lifetimes. Or even since Drucker coined that term knowledge work in 1959.\n\n(01:07:44):\nIt's like, \"Cool. For the first time, we can actually design how we work in ways that our parents couldn't, or the way that most of us just receive how we work from our parents.\" But like, \"Hey, we can actually do things completely differently.\" We came up with this whole virtual first model where we're 90% remote, but then most importantly, we're trying to rebuild the new product stack for distributed work. I'll talk a little bit about where the new things we're doing, and then I'll come back to how we're rebooting some of the core.\n\n(01:08:16):\nBut initially, after COVID, we studied a lot of how other remote first companies had worked. We synthesized with a lot of primary research of other companies like GitLab, Automattic, and others who had been doing this for a long time. We collated all that, synthesized a common playbook, open sourced it. If anybody's curious about this, you could find Dropbox. We've open sourced our virtual first toolkit. Then since COVID, designing a working model very in line with our new mission with a lot of benefits. It really works. The employee retention, satisfaction, engagement or offer separates all the things we care about have been significantly up since COVID. There's many factors to that, but there's a lot that's working about the model. But really, we're approaching it from a product standpoint.\n\n(01:09:07):\nIn deciding to turn Dropbox into this lab for distributed work, we're like, \"Okay, when you open up your laptop in 2025, 2030, what do you see?\" Hopefully, there's some new stuff or some things that are different on there. What are those things, and how do we bring them back?\n\n(01:09:20):\nOne of the first things you lose when you go distributed is context. We get a lot. You get a lot for free from osmosis. Just, \"Oh, hey, how are you doing? How's this?\" Or, \"Oh, do you have that thing?\" But then when you're remote, then a lot of that gets replaced with endless video meetings, and lots of Slack messages, which is super inefficient.\n\n(01:09:41):\nAlso, one thing that was clear across the board from all the successful remote first companies was you have to be more documented, but then you have a lot more documents. This started turning up very obvious problems, which is like, \"Wait, why do I have 1 search box at home, and 10 search boxes at work? Why is it easier to search all of human knowledge than my company's knowledge? Why is this problem getting worse not better every year?\" If you think about it, we've got 10 search boxes that you search 10% of our stuff. I'm like, \"We should just fix this.\"\n\n(01:10:14):\nAgain, even just as a frustrated user, maybe 2018, 2019, I'm having this problem myself. I'm like, \"It's really hard to find stuff.\" Plus there's always cool vector search stuff, and deep learning stuff happening. Even for ChatGPT, I'm going to make a personal search engine that takes us, so I shouldn't have to, right? If I search for strategy, and the title of the document is plan, it should get it right, and the matching should be fuzzy. Then I built something like this. I'm like, \"Oh my God, it completely works.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:42):\nYou built this yourself, you're saying?\n\nDrew Houston (01:10:45):\nYeah, it went nowhere for a couple of years, but then after COVID, and after we're dealing with all these information problems, I'm like, \"Yeah, we should be the company that helps you get the right information at the right time to the right person.\" I built that little hacked up search engine thing that I made, might be an ingredient to this.\n\n(01:11:08):\nWe bought a little company called Command E that was doing universal search, and we created this new product called Dropbox Dash. Basically, Dash connects to all your different apps. It gives you universal search. Then obviously after ChatGPT, not only can you do conventional search, but you can ask questions in natural language, and answer a lot of the questions that ChatGPT can't because it's not connected to your stuff. If you ask ChatGPT like, \"When does my lease expire? Where's that slide from last year's product launch,\" can't tell you because it's not personalized. Because it's not connected to your information. We did all of that for this whole connector platform where we index the known universe of SaaS apps, have this kind of intelligence engine that brings all of it into a common representation, and lets you do conventional search, natural language search.\n\n(01:11:58):\nThen more than that, we want to organize your working life for you. Stepping back even further, often it happens that a company likes to starts solving a problem, and that problem is never permanently solved. In a lot of ways, Dash is the biggest, best embodiment of solving the same kinds of problems I started Dropbox to begin with. Because on the one hand, I was talking about thumb drive, but I wasn't, really. If you think about the higher level job to be done, I was like, \"No, the real issue is that it's super hard to find my stuff, organize my stuff, share my stuff, and secure my stuff.\"\n\n(01:12:36):\nIn the beginning that was like my stuff was my files, and the scattering was across devices. Now, the stuff is tabs in my browser, and cloud tools. But it's a lot of the same problems. We've talked a lot about search, but then organize is still a big problem. There's no desktop folder or desktop as in the physical realm, when you're in your browser. It's just this ocean of content that washes by you. Then you get tired. You nuke the whole environment. But there's nothing to come back to. There's no collection concept. Files have folders, songs have playlists, links have ... If you're getting ready for board meeting or remodeling a house, there's no common container. If you have a Google doc, and a 10 gig, 4K video, and an air table, this is a new problem.\n\n(01:13:25):\nDash also has this thing called Stacks, and has basically smart collections that helps make sharing a lot easier. But again, a lot of this was an intersection of like, \"Yeah, how has work changed since COVID? What crazy little science projects have I done? Then how should one find, organize, and share their information in the cloud era? If I were to build Dropbox today, what would it look like?\" Dash is first part of the answer. We're super excited. But we just launched it two months ago, and signed up our first customers. Then I can come back to just rebooting the core business too. I think one of the big challenges or lessons from this whole period is that one, is as part of the problem we had with competition, and this chapter two was external, but a lot of it was internal, where we couldn't organize ourselves effectively. The business has scaled so much faster than our ability to manage it. First is to recognize this is not an unusual problem. Many companies, not all, but certainly many, and actually many in SaaS productivity have this sophomore slump where you have the super successful first product, but then it's challenging to build the next platinum album. Dropbox has fallen into that category. You could say Zoom, Slack, others.\n\n(01:14:58):\nFirst, it's easy to feel bad about it yourself, but no, you're not. This is actually a very common problem. Then there's a lot of solutions. People devise lots of solutions to this. Part of it's structural. Your company has to go from a pretty fun, and stable state of a functional organization where you have engineering in product design, there's one product, and there's one customer. Everybody's working, we are all in the same direction for the same team to then when you have multiple products, then you have all these conflicts. How much should we invest in the core business versus the new thing? Who should have authority in the company? You try to build multiple products in a functional org, but then you lose accountability.\n\n(01:15:50):\nPeople are like, \"I'm spending a lot. I'm trying to make Dropbox work. I'm trying to make mailbox work. I'm trying to make paperwork, and all these things.\" Then you respond by breaking up into groups or business units. We have a product business unit, product GM structure. Then you have to refactor things to have a common technical platform, and all the GNA functions. There's this metamorphosis, and maturation you need to go through that is mega obvious to experienced people. That you're just totally blindsided by this if you're solving it by trial and error. There's a great book, Zone to Win, that talks about some of this, what needs to happen internally by Geoffrey Moore.\n\n(01:16:35):\nThen there's a lot of cultural problems that set in. We just touched on some of them at a high level. But whether you're in a company or an empire, a civilization, what gets you to the top turns out to be pretty similar things. You have this outsider, challenger mentality where you have to eat what you kill, and the odds are against you. Through hard work, learning, and grinding, you start moving up the curve faster. But then once you're successful, then there's a temptation to take the foot off the gas or enjoy the finer things in life or just focus on other things, be it other than what got you there. I think what we experienced, many other companies experienced, Bill Campbell experienced in Netscape, the success plants, the seeds of failure in terms of complacency, entitlements, or taking your eye off of what got you to be successful in the first place, yeah, I went from earning a lot of the early stage startup founder merit badges to earning the stagnation, and irrelevance merit badge. Now, the turnaround merit badge. Part of that is the turnaround playbook.\n\n(01:17:47):\nOkay, first, it's just getting out of this delusional state where you think you're great, just splashing cold water on everyone, and be like, \"Look, we haven't shipped any. Last three years, the only thing our customers have really meaningfully seen from our product is a price increase. What the hell are we doing?\"\n\n(01:18:08):\nA lot of it is getting back to like, \"Hey, we have to focus on craft. We have to embrace a growth mindset and learning. We have to stop blaming external factors or displacing blame. We have to be a high agency culture.\" There's a cultural transformation that you have to personally embody, and be clear about.\n\n(01:18:29):\nThen in our case, we had to reboot the whole exec team. We've had all the time getting the right kind of leadership team in place for the end of chapter two and three. Part of what happens in conjunction with a lot of the cultural stuff I just talked about, is also you can have this as the talent flywheels flying forward, and flies in reverse. You have a new set of issues where you get all these amazing people in the company, but they want to work for Facebook, not MySpace. You start having retention problems when the narrative goes negative. We start bleeding talents, and then it's also really hard to hire people for the same reasons. Especially, as I think about where the big lessons from chapter two that we've addressed in chapter three, the seniority gap is something that can accumulate because much of the talent can fly to the next shiny thing. What you do in response typically is, you promote a lot of people internally, which is good for them. It seems good for them in the short term, because they're just getting a lot more authority, and responsibility quickly. People like that on day one. But it's a problem because suddenly people are solving problems through trial and error. Things may be new to them that are not new to the industry, and suddenly no knowns to the industry are unknown and knowns to those leaders. Then usually you can get around that by hiring a layer of experienced execs or having enough of them in the company. But in the talent wars of the late teens, we were in the situation as were many companies where, any exec you talked to with any experience had five offers from fan companies for three times the comp, and a third of the workload, or 10 offers from pre-IPO startups, and C-level roles. These are offers in hand. The only thing that really worked to even just keep the lights on was basically giving people double promotions so that they could justify someone who's a director at company X, making him a VP at Dropbox. Then you had to do that because they literally had offers in hand of many millions of dollars a year. Otherwise, you'd just hire no one. That cooled off a lot after the correction in SaaS, after we got more of our vision straight, and certainly after we've been working on things like Dash.\n\n(01:20:59):\nBut that seniority gap is really rough. Where ...\n\nDrew Houston (01:21:00):\nSeniority gap is really rough where you need to have enough experienced people in the company who can then train your high potential people. And again, that sounds obvious, but it's very difficult to do that in an environment where the talent flywheel is going in your direction and then starts flying away from you really quickly. And then through the battlefield promotions and these double promotions on hiring, you can end up a situation where there's a huge voltage drop in terms of people's matching between what your company needs and what they know how to do. And that also doesn't mean hire only experienced people either because then you're splicing in a lot of outside DNA into your organism. But what you want is to keep it roughly in balance. I mean 60-40, 40-60, 50-50, whatever. But your high potential people also lose out if they don't have experienced people learning from.\n\n(01:22:00):\nSo that's a little bit, I think that it was a big part of the stagnation. Again, it's not because the people, but this was something that I was doing to my team. So it's not them or certainly on my watch, but I think it's a dynamic you have to be careful of like do we have the right balance of people who are super high potential and talented, but doing their thing for the first time? Are they paired with people who have been there, done that, this is not the biggest job of their life, and that they can help those people up the learning curve faster such that the aggregate learning curve or the aggregate learning rate of your company is what it needs to be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:41):\nMan, I feel like there's a book here of lessons for founders, things that you never hear about until-\n\nDrew Houston (01:22:51):\nMind the seniority gap.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:55):\nThat's one of so many. People think about becoming founders, they start companies, \"Oh, I'm going to start a company, there we go.\" And then, they think about that first part of the journey that you talked about. And most people don't even get that part. And the best case scenario is you experience a ton of growth. And then, the way you described it to me previously is you hit the final bosses where showing all the success and they're like, \"Oh, I see there's a big market here. Let's go after it.\" And you're battling Apple and Google and Microsoft and Meta, and a lot of people don't think about that and how that's the future if you do well.\n\nDrew Houston (01:23:28):\nYeah, every time you move up a league, your reward is a stronger and better opponent and potentially more unlevel playing field. And that's just the way it is. You can't control that. All you can control is how you respond. And so, you want your company's response to embrace that challenge and use it as a mechanism to get stronger. Easy to say, hard to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:51):\nYeah. So maybe just to start reflecting on some of the lessons from this journey, because there's a lot here. One question people may be wondering is, should I even be a founder? Should I start a company? A lot of people, there's a lot of pain that you've been sharing of the challenge of starting companies. What do you tell people that are asking you like, \"Hey, should I start a company? Am I right to be a founder?\" Is there any advice there that you could share?\n\nDrew Houston (01:24:18):\nI don't know what made me want to be a founder. I just showed up that way. And so, there's probably some chemical imbalance of some form that causes people to do it, but I had a lot of insecurity about should I be a CEO? Because coming from the technical side, because I was like, I can do the engineering and technology, but all I know about being a CEO is I do not know how to do all of those things that CEOs do, and I do not look like that, I do not talk like that, it's intimidating.\n\n(01:24:46):\nSo I think first is it doesn't have to be an all or nothing decision. I mean, obviously it's all encompassing decision to become, to start a company, but you'll have many points along the way where you can keep calibrating. And I think the biggest thing is, or advice I got from one of the founders of a company where I worked was I was like, oh, should I be CEO? Should I not be CEO? Should I be CTO? He's like, \"Look, just try it, be CEO, see how it goes.\"\n\n(01:25:17):\nInitially, I thought I was like, all right, well I'm going to get the company to 100 million valuation and the trend will just be going faster, faster and faster, faster. And instead of just getting thrown off of it, I'll just hit stop and retire. And I thought that sounded like a great plan. But then, moving to the Bay Area, you suddenly meet, you throw a rock and hit 10 people who've done that. And what do you learn? This was just shocking to me because I talked to one of the advisors I mentioned earlier. He's like, \"Yeah, the day I sold my company was the saddest day of my life.\" I'm like, \"What?\" As a 24-year-old, and he's like, \"Yeah. Well, I just felt like the company had drifted away from what it was supposed to be and I just didn't like it.\" I think they're certain in the founder mode trough where you're like, wait, things are screwed up and it's on my watch, but I'm not really sure what happened and what do I do about it? So I think burnout is the biggest thing that will kill you. And so, I think that's why these coping methods and getting your own head is important, but if you do that, then it's also this amazing experience. And then often so many founders go back and start another company and another company. And you don't have to, but there's a reason that people do that because there's just a lot of rewarding aspects of it, building great things with great people that impact huge populations.\n\n(01:26:42):\nWhat I found is that founders keep doing this because they love it in some way, or at least have a love-hate relationship with it or can't imagine something else that they would otherwise be doing and I'm probably the same way. But I think to get through that, you have to, Ben Horowitz also said the hardest thing for a CEO is to manage your own psychology. And we've talked a lot about, yeah, first you have to be aware of what your psychology is, and then how do you make sure you're not resenting or hating your company or yourself and view...\n\n(01:27:18):\nI think the hardest thing for a founder, challenge is not optional. You're going to be challenged, but the suffering is optional. You don't actually have to suffer. I mean, look, there's crunch periods or times where it's taxing, but it doesn't have to be this experience of suffering all the way or burning out or being really angry and sad all the time. Although certainly, in my experience that I did get in periods where I was just sad and angry all the time. So you need to figure out how do you work your way out of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:47):\nSo along those lines, I'm curious, so you've shared a few things that have helped you level up as a leader and push through that. You mentioned meditation, Bill Campbell, a coach. You mentioned a few books. What has helped you continue to level up and stay ahead of where the company needs you? Sometimes you fell behind, sometimes you're ahead. What are some tips for founders that are trying to stay ahead of where things are going?\n\nDrew Houston (01:28:12):\nWell, I think first thing is I think a theme that's carried throughout a lot of these different chapters is you have to figure out what game you're playing and what the rules are when the game keeps changing. So I like in addition to the Enneagram or coding, I also like a long time video game player and there's a great game called, everybody's familiar with StarCraft. It's an awesome game. I think it has many lessons and riddles for an aspiring entrepreneur, many parallels with running a company. I'll save that for another one.\n\n(01:28:54):\nBut this idea, Mindshare is a big resource. It's not actually how much money or economy or land or whatever or-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:03):\nActions?\n\nDrew Houston (01:29:03):\nMilitary. Yeah, it's like you can only do so much or think about so much, your attention, but that's actually not the big lesson. In StarCraft and other games, there's this concept of there's a micro and macro, and I would add to that, there's also the meta game. Okay, so what's that? Micro in these games, something like StarCraft is like, all right, can you click really fast and move your people and build things really quickly? And it's like the mechanics. Every second, how many hundreds of things are you doing per minute or how many things are you doing per second? And that's like a conditioning and practice and one kind of thing.\n\n(01:29:43):\nThen, there's the macro game. Well, could come back to the micro, in a product context or in a startup context, that might be things like, all right, how do I, often the stuff around product design and technology and distribution. So early founders especially are going to be totally fixated on here's how I make this great design and here's how the engineering works and here's how we get users and here's how our sales motion works, or here's how our viral loop works or things like that. And it's very in the details.\n\n(01:30:12):\nAnd then, there's the macro game. In StarCraft, that might be things like, well, clicking a lot is important, but overall you're really managing your economy. So do you have more expansions and resources than the other player? Are you building up your military? Are you getting your balance of the investment in economy and military? Are you scouting? Do you know what the other person's doing? It's more strategic and conceptual. So things in the startup realm that would feel more like that are more like, all right, not just the mechanics of how does this feature work, but more like, all right, what's the business model? What's the market? Who are my competitors? How do I differentiate myself? How's this all going to evolve over time as the category goes from super high growth to more mature, things like that? And you respond, okay, we got to go from one product to multiple products, so then we have to reorganize the company that way and we blah, blah, blah.\n\n(01:31:11):\nAnd then I'd say there's also this, the meta game, which in gaming is a pretty specific thing. It's like some combination of the game itself gets updated so that as the creators, they make this unit stronger and this area unit is stronger, and this ground unit weaker and try to keep this big system in balance. And then, also as this community of players figures out new strategies and this big repeated game of rock paper, scissors, people figure out, okay, this one strategy is now categorically better. And it's always this adversarial thing that's always shifting. And so, playing StarCraft in 2020 is pretty different from playing StarCraft in 2015 or 2010 because everything, both the players are shifting and the game itself is shifting. And the game, it's usually not shifting a lot. So it's really more of an ecological effect.\n\n(01:32:02):\nSo I think it's super important. And then, in a startup context, what's the meta game? Well, I'd say some of it is just business cycles. So I think you'll have, as you see, there's this boom in the late teens in SaaS and in tech. There's a bit of an AI boom happening right now. It's not that different from what, or parts of it are not that different from what happened with the dotcom era in '99, 2000 or the web 2.0 era in 2007 or others. And then, you have these bust times like 2008 and 2000, 2001, et cetera. So there's a market cycle thing that often creates similar dynamics where it's like five years ago every tech company was hiring the maximal number of people that it could. And then, that created one talent dynamic. Now, it's a lot of companies are keeping high comp flat or negative, so that's just a very different thing. But even those are cyclical.\n\n(01:33:03):\nThen, you want to identify how is this game of business actually fundamentally permanently changing? So for example, we launched Dash, we usually do a press thing, conventional press, tech press, we got almost no coverage for it. And yet all the stuff we did on social or going direct was way, way, way more impactful. And it's not just Dropbox or in tech, but it's also presidential election. All the candidates are on podcasts. Yes, they're on CNN too, but not really. So that's just a new thing. How do you manage the brand of your company or launch products, things like that. The nature of marketing is changing. And that changed when, in 2007 too, instead of hiring PR firms and buying AdWords and stuff, we were creating these viral videos and we were using math from epidemiology to create these viral loops. In a lot of ways, Dropbox took that, transplanted that consumer internet playbook into business software.\n\n(01:34:10):\nBut the thing is you need to understand what game you're playing and you need to get good at the micro. It's not that the meta is more important than the micro, it's like you need to do all three at the same time. And so, that's really the hard part. And then, when things are shifting. And the way you know what game you're playing is to be systematic about training yourself and probably the single most useful, or at least important to me piece of advice I could give is you have to figure out how to keep your personal growth curve ahead of the company's growth curve. The single most important impactful thing for me has been reading because talk about this micro, macro, meta games or abstractions, this is the kind of stuff you can learn from history.\n\n(01:34:55):\nLearning what happened in Netscape ended up being pretty important to what happened at Dropbox in 2014. Learning what happened to Procter & Gamble and selling makeup ended up actually being pretty relevant. So I think having a broad information diet is really important. And I've collated a list of books that were really impactful to me. You can find a way to share that. All right, I'd be happy to share that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:18):\nAbsolutely.\n\nDrew Houston (01:35:20):\nBut in a lot of ways, as a CEO, you have to be right about a lot of things, especially and including things you haven't done before. And I think from that perspective at least, I'd say there's things that are challenging for your head and things that are challenging for your heart. The head challenge is one that's more like, all right, how do I cultivate wisdom really quickly? And so, in addition to a lot of technical books about here's how you do marketing or product or management or things like that. So it could be around higher level, almost philosophical when it's things like Buffett or Munger or Bezos would be more on that end of the spectrum. But it's not just reading. I think having a community of people that you can learn from is really important. And I've also found it's interesting, you learn having stable of people that are at the same stage as you, couple people, a couple stages ahead, 2 years ahead, 5 years ahead, 20 years ahead.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:23):\nAnd this is founders, other CEOs?\n\nDrew Houston (01:36:25):\nOther founders, founders and CEOs, exactly, because you'll learn different things from them. So first of all, when you're in the early innings, you'll actually get more useful advice often from your peers because they're going through the same thing. So it's like, how do I raise a seed round? You're going to get a lot more out of someone who did that a year ago or is doing that now. Then if I asked the doc, \"How do you raise a seed round?\" He'd be like, \"I don't remember. Just build a good company.\"\n\n(01:36:55):\nAnd you'll see that as you talk to people at different phases. I think again, early stage it's more about the micro, about the product and distribution, then there's this continuum. So then it's about your business model and monetization and the financials, then it's about defensibility and maintaining that advantage. And as you talk to, as I talked to my peers would be more about the product. That was the scaffold I would see over founders.\n\n(01:37:26):\nAnd then, people that were further out, actually they still knew all the micro stuff and had feelings about it, but they're almost philosophical in nature like philosophers and just very broad intellectually and drawing lots of distinctions from lots of different things and knew a lot about a lot. And I think most of the tenured founders that I'm, most of the founder CEOs who've been at it for 10, 20 years plus, I'm at 17, almost all of them read voraciously. So I think combination of reading and community are the most important things.\n\n(01:38:02):\nBut then, the last thing is being systematic about it. So in line with what does it mean to keep your personal growth curve ahead of the company's growth curve? I think one way to do that exercise is think about is always be working back from, in one year from now, what will I wish I had been learning today? Two years, five years? And often, those to-do lists are pretty different.\n\n(01:38:23):\nSo in 2008, I would've been focused on just getting users for Dropbox, but then looking ahead to a year later, I would've been building the first business functions in the company, and then five years later, it would be thinking about how do we fight with Google and Microsoft and all these other things. And then, for my own skills, it would be like 2008 where like how do I raise a scale to venture round and what do all these terms mean and things like that. But then, how do I be a great leader, great manager, comfortable speaking publicly, things like that. And the things that are further out are often the most intimidating, but you also have the most time to learn and you often can psych yourself out in terms of like, oh, this is just new and uncomfortable. And I did say this is one of the hard challenges. You're always going to have that feeling of discomfort. And instinctively, what you're going to want to do is run away from it because you're human. It's uncomfortable to feel like to confront these things that you're not good at or might be embarrassing or threatening. And so, I think an important part of being a founder is learning to run towards that feeling not away from it. That's a big part of your learning rate is the extent to which you're pushing yourself beyond discomfort.\n\n(01:39:43):\nAnd so having that list of a year from now, two years from now, five years from now, what can I start learning today? And then, recognizing these things, they're all trainable. So in five weeks you're not going to be a great guitar player or surgeon or manager, leader, but in five years you can put a pretty big dent in those problems. And people who enter college and leave college often have a lot more relevant knowledge after those four years. So just having that growth mindset.\n\n(01:40:16):\nAnd I'd say the last piece of it that is also tricky in addition to going from a heart or mindset perspective going towards discomfort and in addition to a lot of the other stuff we talked about being like how do you have a sense of equanimity, you're not burning out and finding a sustainable pace. I think the other thing is often smart people have more trouble learning than otherwise. And there's this great article that I, it's probably my most handed out articles probably from the '70s or '80s or something called Teaching Smart People How to Learn. Because what ends up happening is the more book smart you are or the more you were identified as gifted or intelligent as a kid, the more not knowing something or being wrong, it's not just not knowing something or being wrong, it's like an assault on your identity.\n\n(01:41:11):\nAnd so, I found that one of the best predictors of an exact continuity of this scale, it's not just what they know or what they can do, but the extent to which they can actually be aware of their failures and not blame or dismiss things because smart people have a really fast rationalization hamster. They can convince themselves that, well, here's how they were technically right even though clearly they were wrong or clearly the thing didn't work out and they let themselves off the hook. And all of this happens unconsciously as a protective mechanism.\n\n(01:41:47):\nSo I think finding ways to take responsibility or always have a mindset of what if I were a hundred percent responsible for this? What if it was no one else's fault? What if it's entirely in my control? And those things are never true, but that's always... Or with perfect hindsight, what would I have done differently? And just owning things ends up being more painful in the short run, but then some painful hours can save painful years. And there's a great book on that mindset stuff, the 15 Principles of Conscious Leadership, Diana Chapman and some co-authors, and she's been a coach and friend of mine. She's amazing and it has really helped me on that front. But really, how do you train your head and train your heart? There's different things you do for each, but all in service of keeping your personal growth curve ahead of the company's growth curve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:39):\nI love how tactically your advice is. There's this piece of advice of think what do I need to know a year from now, two years from now, five years from now, this reading list, this idea of having staggered staged founders in a community to help you along this journey, this article about how smart people learn and how to get past this block. So I love just how concrete a lot of this stuff is. So then, just zooming out and maybe final reflections on this journey, as you described this, it's basically the epitome of the hero's journey that you've been on here. Things are good, trouble appears, you enter this other land of everyone coming at you trying to squash you in every direction, battling them, and then emerging now into this new land with all the things you've learned, coming back to the original idea of what Dropbox could have been. So I think that's partly why it's so interesting is it's the epitome of-\n\nDrew Houston (01:43:29):\nBut we still got to make it fully out of the, we're on our way up, we're clawing our way back up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:37):\nThe dragon's still out there. The incumbents still exist.\n\nDrew Houston (01:43:41):\nAnd by the way, it will always be like that. You're never done with that. It's not like you reach the A-top or you don't have to if you don't want it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:53):\nAnd it makes me think about, as you're talking, people think about product market fit and something, a lesson from this journey is just like product market fit is not a binary. You will have it now. You've got it and you have it and will last forever. It's constantly being broken by other people or if there's something you've discovered that is a big market. And maybe final reflection on the story you've shared things that might be helpful to people, just the journey you've been on that might be helpful to founders who are going through this right now or will probably go through this.\n\nDrew Houston (01:44:20):\nI think it's important to remember we're all really lucky to be able to do this kind of work. And the things that I got out of... When I was 18, the things I thought I would get out of starting company would've been the things you would think. It'd be like, oh, I'll be really well-known or really rich or build these awesome things. I think there's benefits to that, but what I've grown to appreciate a lot more is over time is this thing or the experience and the journey of starting a company can really be of forge for a better character or there's transfer. A lot of what you learn here is transferable in many different domains.\n\n(01:45:11):\nI just had a little kid, Charlie, he's one-year-old, so I know we're both in new dad mode, but I'm like, it's made me a better husband, it'll make me a better father, made me a better person. And then, I just say, listen, there's no easy button where things are just up to the right and so don't look for one and don't feel bad if things are difficult. But ultimately, one of the biggest surprises about being able to spend time with all these interesting people and founder CEOs who've created these iconic companies is at the end of the day, they do it because they love it.\n\n(01:45:56):\nAnd so, I think learning to decouple... That doesn't mean they're always having a good time at all. Most of them use metaphors like Jensen or Eli, like chewing broken glass, staring into the abyss, and yet for a lot of these people, there's at the end of the day, nothing they'd rather do. So I think finding the gun in that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:19):\nI'm very excited to follow the next chapter of your journey. I am really thankful that you shared these stories. I think this is going to be helpful to a lot of people. I think this is a story that people study for a long time because it's common and not talked about much. Drew, thank you so much for being here. For folks that want to maybe check out what you're building, anything you want to share, where should they go?\n\nDrew Houston (01:46:40):\nI'm just Drew Houston on all the socials and then we got our new product, Dropbox Dash, dropbox.com/dash. Right now, it's for companies. We'll have a downloadable version. You could just get on your phone or your computer soon. But Lenny, this is awesome, super fun, really big fan of what you do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:59):\nAwesome. Same. Drew, thank you so much for being here.\n\nDrew Houston (01:47:03):\nThanks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:04):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
