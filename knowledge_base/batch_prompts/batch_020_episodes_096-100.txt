It puts every customer in the same sort of buckets. It assumes that all customers and all products are the same. It puts businesses, or they, I should say, puts businesses at the center of the business versus putting customers at the center. Right? It's about the values of the business, not the value to the customer that's being measured. Also, it just kind of feels gross for people, this idea of pushing people through a funnel. And then probably a particularly relevant for SaaS companies is that recurring revenue businesses, you cannot think about marketing and growth and the business overall as ending an acquisition, otherwise you're not in business anymore. And the vast, vast majority of these models don't take post-acquisition, retention, expansion, all of that into account. So yeah, in a nutshell, funnels are bad.\n\nLenny (00:01:04):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today, my guest is Georgiana Laudi. Georgiana, aka Gia, runs a consultancy called Forget The Funnel, where she works hands on with SaaS companies to help them unlock and accelerate growth.\n\nLenny (00:01:30):\nAs you'll hear, she often finds huge unlocks and opportunities often doubling or tripling conversion in various points in their product flows. In our conversation, she shares the exact process that she goes through to help companies figure out where their biggest growth opportunities lie, and also how to execute on them. We chat about how to identify your most important customers, how to very practically map their journey through your flows and set goals, and then execute on your ideas. There's a lot of wisdom and some fun stories packed into this episode. So with that, I bring you Gia.\n\nLenny (00:02:05):\nI'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from podcast sponsor Amplitude. Hey, John.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:02:10):\nHey, Lenny. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:02:11):\nJohn, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation and even just launch a CDP. What's the thought process there?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:02:23):\nWhat we've always thought of Amplitude is being about supporting the full product loop, think collect data, inform bets, ship experiments, and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So the big aha was seen how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach, and send data to other destinations. Experimenting CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.\n\nLenny (00:02:44):\nSupporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:02:48):\nYeah. So Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched Starter Templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.\n\nLenny (00:02:57):\nAbsolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John. Head to amplitude.com to get started.\n\nLenny (00:03:03):\nThis episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferriss and Lex Fridman. So I finally gave it a shot earlier this year, and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1: One, with a small scoop that dissolves in water, you are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as a safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently, they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies, and internal testing that they do. And three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself.\n\nLenny (00:03:58):\nRight now it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day, and that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/lenny. Take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.\n\nLenny (00:04:33):\nGia, welcome to the podcast.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:04:36):\nThanks so much for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny (00:04:38):\nIt's my pleasure. So we actually met over a decade ago, I think, maybe just around a decade in Montreal. I was working on my startup. You were helping companies with their websites, optimize their websites. Then you went on to lead marketing at Unbounce and a bunch of other great stuff. So just to set a little bit of foundation for listeners, can you talk about what you've done in your career in 55 seconds? That's your time box.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:05:03):\n55 seconds. Okay. So marketing for probably about 20 or so years, which sounds completely ridiculous when I say it, but I started working for my father's retail business in the early 2000s, probably 2000 actually. Worked there for a number of years, and then eventually left and started freelancing, worked at an agency. Terrible. And then actually probably around the time I met you, I had this little catalyst moment where I joined Twitter in late 2008, and I discovered the tech scene and startups. And that was, again, probably around the time that you and I met, maybe 2010 ish. And that was-\n\nLenny (00:05:43):\n2011.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:05:43):\nAnd then I... What's that?\n\nLenny (00:05:45):\n2011.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:05:46):\n2011. See, there you go.\n\nLenny (00:05:47):\nMm-hmm.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:05:48):\nSo it was right around that time, and then late 2011, I decided supporting five, six companies at a time in their marketing and stuff like that. I was starting to get burnout, I was doing a lot, and I was like, \"What would it feel like to sink my teeth into one brand?\" So I decided to go in-house and I moved out west, and joined the team at Unbounce. I was there for five years. And then in late 2016, early 2017, I decided it was time to move on, and so I decided to go back independent and just started working with companies and supporting them through marketing and growth and product marketing. And that's what I've been doing ever since.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:06:27):\nBut in mid 2017, I actually paired up with Claire Suellentrop who led marketing at Calendly, and her and I have been working together since about mid 2017. That's when we launched Forget The Funnel, and we started pairing up on working with companies and sort of married her customer research background in my strategy, marketing background. And we developed this framework that we now use when we work with predominantly B2B SaaS companies, is who we work with right now.\n\nLenny (00:06:57):\nAwesome. So we're going to spend a lot of time on what you've learned working with companies through Forget The Funnel. Why did you call it Forget The funnel?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:07:04):\nBecause funnels are gross. I mean, it's a really antiquated idea. It's not just funnels that we sort of take issue with, it's buyers' journeys or even... I remember actually at Startup Fest 2012, I want to say, Dave McClure was talking about pirate metrics and I was like, \"Huzzah, marketing has a role post acquisition. Everybody understands now.\" It was a real moment for me. But the problem with funnels and pirate metrics and the favorites that I love to pick on are MQLs and SQLs is that nobody knows what those mean. It puts every customer in the same sort of buckets. It assumes that all customers and all products are the same. It puts businesses, or they, I should say, puts businesses at the center of the business versus putting customers at the center. It's about the values of the business, not the value to the customer that's being measured.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:08:01):\nAlso, it just kind of feels gross for people, this idea of pushing people through a funnel. And then probably a particularly relevant for SaaS companies is that recurring revenue businesses, you cannot think about marketing and growth and the business overall as ending at acquisition. Otherwise, you're not in business anymore. The vast, vast majority of these models don't take post-acquisition retention, expansion, all of that into account. They also leave the problem stage out. So the world that customers are living in prior to discovering you, which is a really critical, that context is unbelievably valuable, especially for marketing. So to delete that out of the equation is a big problem. So yeah, in a nutshell, funnels are bad.\n\nLenny (00:08:52):\nOkay. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of stuff you've learned, but I have a couple other things I just wanted to talk about to set the foundation.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:08:58):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:08:58):\nOne is, can you talk about some of the impact that you've seen working with companies through the process that you've come up with? What kind of impact have you seen? What kind of numbers have you seen?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:09:07):\nI would say, far in a way the biggest, most immediate impact of the type of work that we do is realigning with that ideal customer. Generally, the lowest hanging fruit outcome is realigning around better positioning and messaging. And identifying more resonant positioning and messaging that speaks to that context that I was talking about before, before people discover that you even exist, have that moment where they're like, \"Oh my god, this has to change. This sucks,\" ties that in, ties in what they care about and what is valuable about your product and then also that desired outcome. I mean, for those in the know, jobs to be done is a big sort of influence here, but if you can identify that type of information about your customers and get to know them at that level, then you are in a way better position to be able to not only position your product but also use much more powerful messaging.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:10:06):\nSo typically, what we do is, we'll identify those gaps of almost, I mean I shouldn't even say nine times out of 10, 99 times out of a hundred, a company's website is not doing as much as it could do. It's not being as effective from a messaging and positioning standpoint as it could. So websites tend to get update. We will do a lot of overhauls on messaging on a website and improve performance there. One of my favorite examples of that is a social media tool that we worked with where we did really very simple research for them, honestly, identified two different jobs to be done, zeroed in on one of them, and then updated the messaging on the website.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:10:46):\nWe shortened the trial from 30 days to seven. The conversion on the website went up with this new messaging by 89%. But the thing that I love the most about that particular story is that we didn't even touch anything after the signup experience. We hadn't even gotten there and the trial-to-paid conversion rate increased 40%, and we didn't touch it. It was just because a more qualified, better fit customer was coming through the door. So there was more of them and there were better qualified. So that's a really specific example that is very typical of this type of work.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:11:19):\nThere's other examples, though, of product adoption and using that messaging and positioning past the website, even in the product onboarding itself, email and app, whatever, and just making sure that they're getting to and have the calms to get to the parts of the product that they care about the most, which can increase trial-to-paid or product activation. With Autobooks, the product usage of the North Star product usage jumped by 300% or something within quite a short period of time after rolling out email onboarding to support that product experience. I know SparkToro as well, which I think we might end up talking about again when we talk about the process, they doubled their trial-to-paid conversion rate when we worked with them because of post acquisition optimization to their messaging.\n\nLenny (00:12:01):\nI imagine people are listening to this and they're like, \"This is what I'm waiting for, some kind of huge win, some huge conversion, a success.\" I'm curious, how often do you find companies have something like this, like a latent opportunity to double, triple conversion? Everyone's hoping a conversion like this.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:12:18):\nOh, boy.\n\nLenny (00:12:19):\nYeah. What's the general hit rate?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:12:22):\nSo many. I mean I would say, pretty well every company we've ever worked with has... Not pretty well. Every company we've ever worked with has learned something new about their customers that they can apply at some juncture of their customer's experience, whether or not it is in campaigns to reach the right people out in the world, whether or not it's doing a better job with their messaging and positioning on their website, or their go-to market or acquisition strategy on their website using a sandbox account or getting a faux freemium account to let people kick the tires of their product prior to getting on a sales call. That's something that could potentially happen.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:13:06):\nThe post-acquisition experience I'm talking about, it is so often an afterthought somehow where that additional of layer... I think part of the reason why it's an afterthought is because product onboarding in particular, and you've probably heard this too, it tends to be kind of like no man's land. Who owns that? Is it marketing? If it's freemium, in my opinion it should be marketing because freemium is a marketing tool, but not everybody subscribes to that. Not every company would necessarily agree that that's the case. A lot of companies might say, \"No, it's product.\" So we end up seeing a messy middle there because there's no natural handoff. So pretty well, every company that we've worked with has had an opportunity to improve, especially product onboarding and product activation.\n\nLenny (00:13:53):\nAwesome. So basically everybody will benefit from what we're about to talk about.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:13:56):\nA hundred percent.\n\nLenny (00:13:56):\nAmazing. Great.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:13:56):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:14:00):\nAll right. We've got wrap detention as a way to maybe transition into your process. So you're visiting a site once, and I invited you to the Airbnb office we were having a happy hour, and I gave you a tour. You told me later that something you saw while you're walking around the office transformed the way you think about growth and inform the way you think about approaching this problem. Can you talk about that?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:14:24):\nYes. This is one of my favorite... It was 2013, so you and I might have met in 2011, and then a couple years later I was in town for a conference and we toured the office, HQ and everything. Of course, it was all stars in my eyes because what a beautiful office too. So it was quite like, I would've remembered it regardless. But we went downstairs, very different from the very polished upstairs. We went downstairs to where your working area was, where the product team was, and there were sheets of paper taped to the wall, a bunch in a row. And it would've been easy to miss because it's kind of chaotic down there, but it was the customer journey of an Airbnb customer through two posts.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:15:12):\nWhat struck me, I was like, \"Oh that's interesting. I'm in the middle of building one out for us.\" Leading marketing at Unbounce at the time. And I was interestingly with the customer success, he was also with me. So Ryan Engley was there with me, and it was the perfect sort of that him and I saw it together. It was a customer journey that was focused on the customer. So versus that pirate metrics problem or that the typical buyer's journey problem that I was talking about earlier, it was the complete reverse of that. It was illustrated. The emotional journey was part of it. The role that Airbnb played as a direct touchpoint and also indirect, what was going on in the person's life that had nothing to do outside of Airbnb, which I thought was really interesting.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:16:01):\nIt was like, the beautiful little milestones really encapsulated in a sort of snapshot way, such that anybody walking by it or anybody being reminded that it existed could understand in a glance what the goal was at each of those milestones. I was like, \"Well, shit, this is completely through the lens of the customer versus the business and the grossness of the funnel.\" It's just so far removed from that experience that I was like, \"Ryan, look at this. We need this.\" He was like, \"Oh yeah, this is good.\" I took a picture. Can't find it for the life of me.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:16:39):\nBut we returned back to the office the following week, and co-founder and head of product, head of CS, so Ryan, Carter Gilchrist, who's head of product and co-founder, Ryan, and I, head of marketing, the three of us locked ourselves in the room for two days and made our own. It was a circle. I mean looking back, it's hysterical, but it was sort of democratized to the rest of the team in a way because it had that buy-in. Everybody was like, \"Oh yeah. Okay, this makes sense and I understand.\" It made everybody feel a lot better about what they were doing because it was about value, delivering value at each of the points.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:17:13):\nSo that grossness sort of goes away and we're like, \"Oh cool.\" I don't want to be too kumbaya about it, but it was a bit of a moment. And also, it made communicating with especially the product team and the engineering team a lot easier for me. So we were using a shared language. The rest of the company who aren't necessarily customer facing really understood, I think, at a different level what we were all doing together in KPIs, yada yada yada. So it was amazing. Honestly, I mean I can't credit only that obviously to our growth, but it was a pretty impressive couple years that followed that. I think the alignment that that brought us was huge. Yeah. Anyway, that's the story. Sorry, that wasn't super short, but it was big.\n\nLenny (00:18:02):\nThat's great.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:18:03):\nIt was a big thing. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:18:05):\nWe're going to link pictures of this on the show notes. Internally, it was called Project Snow White because it was inspired by-\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:18:13):\nOh yeah, that's right.\n\nLenny (00:18:13):\nYeah. It was inspired by Brian reading the biography of Walt Disney, and they needed to create the storyboard basically to create Snow White because it was so complicated to make that movie. It might have been the first animated film with storyboards.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:18:24):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:18:25):\nSo it was basically a storyboard of a trip on Airbnb of a host and a guest.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:18:30):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:18:30):\nAnd in detail, I forget if I told you this, but Airbnb hired a full-time storyboard artist from Pixar to draw these key frames.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:18:38):\nI think I did know that. I was very grateful to have seen it. I didn't realize at the time, but it changed the way, like you said at the beginning, it changed the way that I thought about marketing because it really made it obvious to not only me, of course, and to everybody, that customer experience layer, that marketers are so good at, has such an incredibly important role in driving revenue. Not just in building awareness, but in playing a major role in helping customers get value and catching them when they fall off and all that kind of stuff. So it changed a lot for us.\n\nLenny (00:19:19):\nAnd it informed the way that you approach your consultancy with Forget The funnel. So as a transition to talk about that, the way I'm thinking we approach this is, imagine a customer, what is the process you go through? What are the steps? How do you go about helping a company figure out where they should invest, what they're doing right and wrong? I should also mention you're writing a book about this that's going to explain this whole process, that's coming out later in the year.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:19:40):\nRight. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:19:41):\nSo we'll talk about that at the end as well. I'll turn over to you.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:19:46):\nCool. I mean if I go down a rabbit hole and you want to pull me out and have me unpack something, let me know. Well, the process is pretty straightforward. At the highest level, the idea is, understand your best customers, map their experience, like we were just talking about, map their experience through the lens of delivering value to them, make it measurable, and then evaluate what you're doing today that is out of alignment with that. Pretty straightforward. I mean that doesn't sound too hard of a job, of course. But research is an really important part of that. So the story that I was going to use to illustrate this is, there's a company that we work with from time to time. We worked with them at least twice, arguably three times.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:20:34):\nSo Rand Fishkin who was the founder of Moz, he's got a new product. It's an audience research tool called SparkToro. And when they first launched, actually even pre-launched, Rand and Casey came to Claire and I to help with their positioning and messaging as they were going forward to launch. I mean Rand and Casey, they're both very, very thoughtful and they take their time with stuff. So they were just looking for that extra layer of like, \"Is this good enough to launch kind of thing?\" So we help them with their positioning and messaging. And off they went.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:21:08):\nAbout a year later, they came back because though they were doing a decent job generating traffic and interest in SparkToro, I mean Rand is no small fish so he's got a good audience built in, which is fantastic, but those that were getting to the website... Those that were signing up for the product, those weren't issues. But the people that were signing up for their free product weren't converting to paid in the way that they believed they could. So we decided to work with them and basically go to the source and find out, from SparkToro's best customers, what can we learn from them that we can then reflect back in the product experience and the customer experience for them?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:21:54):\nSo I mentioned it before, but we are heavy believers in the jobs-to-be-done theory, which is basically this idea that people don't buy your product, they buy the better version of themselves, yada yada. I don't need to explain any of that. But we use that to guide our research. And with SparkToro, we were in a position, and the purists will hate me saying this, but we were in a position to be able to run surveys. So yes, interviews are ideal always, but we did think that we could learn a ton from surveys to then, if needed, double down with interviews. We didn't end up actually needing to run the interviews because the surface that we ran were pretty decisive and clear in terms of what we learned. So what we did was, we identified SparkToro's best customers. Now, what I mean by best customers is those that get a ton of value from your product as of exist today, pay obviously. They're happy. They're low maintenance. And very importantly, they signed up for your product recently enough that they remember what life was like before.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:22:57):\nSo generally, we say that's in the three to six-month range. Because if you go to somebody that's been your customer for two years, they're just going to fill answers with what they think might have been going on in their life. But if you ask customers who remember what life was like before, you're going to get a lot more interesting responses, a lot more accurate depiction of what was going on. So that's the criteria we went forward. Surveyed their customers. We're trying to uncover from them what was going on in their life when they were seeking out a solution, what happened, what was that trigger moment when they did start seeking a solution, what did they go to, who did they talk with, what were their influences? Which PS, that's what SparkToro does, it helps you identify those.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:23:42):\nBut also, what were they looking for in a solution? What were the must-haves for them versus what were some of the anxieties that they had, some deal breakers, things like that? So basically unpacking what is it that was critical for them in their solution. And then of course, what is it they're able to do now that they weren't able to do before. So that desired outcome. So out of that, we identified a couple of different options, a couple of different jobs, customer jobs, and we have to prioritize one, of course, because if you start right off the bat with like, \"Okay, we're going to solve for all of these different customers jobs,\" then you end up not being as resonant. You can't be as effective. So we focused in on one.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:24:23):\nAnd the way that you make a decision on which one you focus on is similar to best customers. So high willingness to pay. There's no question whether or not they would pay for a product like yours. The handholding that they would need would be minor or less so. And I say that understanding full well the difference between product-led and sales-led. I'm not saying that sales-led is not good, but sometimes there's a decision to be made. If you're not set up today to support a sales-led or high touch, then you may want to opt for the more product-led approach. And the reverse is also true if you've got a robust sales team, well then, you might actually be better off leveraging sales more in that scenario and might want to attend towards that. But there's that criteria that you would think through.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:25:10):\nSo willingness to pay, it's really obvious. Maybe the most important one is that they have an urgent problem. So the whole pain killer versus vitamin thing, you always want to be selling a pain killer. So who has an urgent problem that needs solving, not something that they might have a problem with six months down the line? Who has a high retention or even expansion potential is also really advantageous for very obvious reasons. So customers who would have a long-term need for this type of product and even potentially have that need expand or change over time and evolve in ways that you envision the product can help them.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:25:47):\nAnd then there's other criteria too. So sometimes you might want to prioritize one customer job over another, if those customers congregate in a way that make them really easy to market to. That's an advantage. Or another advantage, and this was the case for SparkToro, is you have an unfair advantage with this market in some way. So there were two different customer jobs that were coming out of SparkToro. One was more focused on service providers and marketing and the other one was more focused on data. And those data purists and those that really wanted verifiable data, well, SparkToro has an advantage on the marketer side more so than on the data analyst side. So that was another thing too. So with that, we made the call to focus on one of those customer jobs.\n\nLenny (00:26:35):\nCan I ask a question here?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:26:37):\nYeah, go.\n\nLenny (00:26:37):\nSo there's two parts of this. There's figuring out who you're going to go after and then what problem you're solving for them. Which do you think is more important at this point? Because step one in this process, just to zoom out a little bit, is figure out your customer and what their problems are so that you can actually solve them well. Do you start with here's who we're going to go after and then here's the biggest problem? How do you think about that?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:27:01):\nThey're sort of one in the same. So because we learned from SparkToro's ideal customers, we already know that they're a fit for the product. They're happy, happily paying, prime them out of their golden hands customers. They're the customers that we want more of. So we've already validated that there's a demand from that customer base. Now, what I'm describing about choosing between two different customer jobs is really just, of those ideal customers, which customer job do you want to lean into? It's not that you wouldn't necessarily still be able to solve for that other customer job, it's just not the one that you would lead with. And I always cautious around this too because sometimes with founders, what'll happen is, there's a level set that just because we were prioritizing one customer job in the short term, doesn't mean you can't serve that other customer job down the line.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:27:57):\nA classic example of that is products that serve both brands and agencies for example. So the customer job for brands will be slightly different than agencies. And if you've got an advantage with one, you would just start with one and then you would go back after it. That's a bit of a level up after the fact. It's not part of the core processes, it's what you would do after. But it doesn't mean you can't solve for the other customer jobs, it just means put one foot in front of the other, do a really good job of one thing first, and then we'll add that on later. I don't know if that a hundred percent answered your question though.\n\nLenny (00:28:32):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:28:33):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:28:34):\nThe reason that you start here is... Basically what you're trying to do is help SparkToro, in this example, grow faster.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:28:40):\nI mean we're trying to help them figure out why they're free-to-paid conversion rate was lower than what they wanted. Right? That was the challenge they came to us with. Our traffic numbers are good. Even our signups on our website, our positioning and messaging on our website is clearly doing a good job. But once people get into the product, there's not enough of them getting to value quickly enough. I mean they still had healthy customer base, but they knew that that number could be increased. So we knew what we were solving for.\n\nLenny (00:29:11):\nGot it. Okay. That helps.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:29:13):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:29:14):\nSo step one here is figure out who do you want to focus on, not just... Because a lot of people would go at this problem like, \"Okay, conversion is whatever, 10%, how do we increase? Let's look at this data. Let's look at it. They're bouncing. Let's look at why people are confused.\" And your approach is, \"No, let's focus on the people we really want to get into this product and focus on making them convert, and not focus as much on the general case of conversion.\"\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:29:39):\nRight. We would get to that though. That's a really important part of the process, but it comes after figuring out who you're even solving for. But it's definitely important to look at those numbers. I mean, I'm not saying don't look at the data. Obviously you have to. They wouldn't have identified a problem had they not been looking at the data. So the challenge that happened so, so often, and I mean this happens with a lot of teams, particularly marketers fall victim to this tactical way of approaching things and piecemealing things, piecemealing campaigns or programs to prove that we're doing something and we're driving up numbers, and they don't take big enough sort of swings. So this is like, zoom out for a second, figure out who is it that you even want coming through the front door. I mean, the social media platform tool that I mentioned, the trial-to-pay conversion rate bumped up 40% because a higher qualified person comes through the front door. So it matters.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:30:40):\nSo if you can zoom out and keep in your mind's eye that ideal customer job, that thing that you're solving for. We're not at personas. We don't care about personas at all. They're important when you start talking about advertising and targeting and that demographic data that you have to know when you're doing advertising and things like that. That is not what I'm describing here at all. I find that jobs be done too helps tie and bond marketing and product and customer success together a lot more because all three of those teams, or arguably four with sales, should all be focused on this theme customer that's not revolutionary. So this is just a sort of helpful way to do that.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:31:24):\nProduct teams know and subscribe for the most part to the jobs-to-be-done theory. So marketers should follow suit, and there's a lot to be gained anyway on the marketing side. So anyway, the short of it basically is that because we knew we were focused on increasing that free-to-pay conversion rate, the next step after the job is the mapping. So it's identifying, okay, for this ideal customer, what are those key milestones in their relationship with our product? What are those big of leaps of faith is how I describe it. I mean I don't need to explain. The Airbnb customer journey tells that story. Where's a value moment in this relationship? Where are they reaching value?\n\nLenny (00:32:06):\nMake some examples of that for folks that are trying to do this for themselves potentially. And then also, how many of these moments would you suggest people have?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:32:13):\nYeah. So it completely depends on the product and the customer for that matter. I shouldn't leave that part over it. Obviously that's important. In general though, what we would do is, we'd break it down into a struggle phase and evaluation phase and a growth phase. Struggle phase is, they're experiencing the problem, life sucks, they're using the old way, something's got to happen, they've got to solve this thing. In general, the struggle phase would break down between out in the world experiencing the problem for the first time. So we call that a problem. And generally there would be another one called interest, where it's like, \"Okay, now they're starting to shop around. They're getting into solution seeking mode.\" They might be on your website. They might be on your competitor's websites. They're reading product reviews, things like that. That's interest stage.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:33:00):\nAnd then there's the evaluation phase, which generally breaks down, I will say two or three milestones within the evaluation phase. I say two or three because if you have a more complex product, more complex customer is the more likely scenario. There may be more leaps of faith or more milestones, heavier lift for you to take. So we have worked with companies where the evaluation phase has been three or four milestones, I would always default to as few as possible. So if I'm cutting it down to lowest common denominator, I would say a first value would be the first milestone within evaluation. So you want to get them to that product activation really, really quickly. And then value realization is the milestone where you're solving that customer job. So they reach a point with your product where they're like, \"Hell yes, this is it.\" And for the first time, they reach this critical threshold of product engagement. Now, what that product engagement is with your unique product for that specific customer is up for debate, but there still needs to be that moment.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:34:08):\nAnd then there's the growth phase, which is about the continued value. So getting to frequency of usage and a healthy building of that habit, getting into a cadence that makes sense. What type of feature usage and end product usage should you want to see there and then on what frequency becomes really important. And then there's another milestone generally after that where you're like, \"Okay cool, they're in. They're pro. Now, what else do they need?\" What else do they need from a product? And also, how else can we amplify them or work with them to either start teaching our tool to other people? I mean there's all kinds of things that can happen about growth. That's where the promise that exponential growth assess sort of comes into play.\n\nLenny (00:34:54):\nAnd as people listen to this, just to maybe help if it's not super obvious, what people shouldn't imagine is like a little key frame, a storyboard frame of like, \"Here's something your customer is doing.\" Right?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:35:04):\nYeah. We often talk about it and describe it as the story of how I met and fell in love with your product. It's like this documentary of being out in the world, finding it, realizing that like, \"Hell yeah, this might actually solve a problem for us. This might be it.\" Getting that enough value to convince them to keep going to full value realization, to continue value-to-value growth.\n\nLenny (00:35:28):\nThis episode is brought to you by Maven. I've been an investor, an advisor, and a customer of Maven from day one. I even taught my product management course through Maven. Maven is a cohort-based learning platform where you learn alongside peers with a direct connection to your instructor. Maven got a ton of courses for product managers, founders, and executives to help them level up in all kinds of ways. Over 10,000 people from Airbnb to Coinbase to Google to Tesla have taken courses from real experts and operators that have spent decades honing their craft.\n\nLenny (00:36:01):\nAs part of their fall season, which Maven just launched, there are over 100 new courses starting in the next few weeks. Many of the people I've had on this podcast are teaching courses like Jackie Bavaro on product strategy, Arielle Jackson on startup branding, Emily Kramer on B2B marketing, plus Annie Duke on decision making, Nir Eyal on behavioral design, and how to break into product management with Marily Nika. Check out all of my favorite courses and learn more at maven.com/lenny.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:36:31):\nNow, again, I'm saying that as if it applies to all customers and products, and that's not actually the case. Sometimes it's more complicated than that, but in general, that is what we have found. So that's what we did for SparkToro customers based on the research that we did. The research that we do, we basically take all the responses, we identify the critical patterns, and that's how we identify the customer job. From those critical patterns, if we segment down just that customer job, we can look at responses and say, \"Okay, here's what they're likely doing when they're out in the world experiencing this problem. This is how they described the pain of their current solution. And then here's what they say about how their search for a solution started. Here's what they told us about how they started to do that research or find a solution.\"\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:37:17):\nAnd then there's questions that are asked in the research like, \"What was the moment that convinced you that our product was going to solve this problem for you?\" And the answers to that question are going to tell you what your first value should look like, which of that first product activation experience, whatever language you like to use, what should that look like for them? What parts of the product do you need to push right up to the front of that experience so they can get to it really, really quickly after they sign up?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:37:40):\nAnd then value realization obviously would be close to, if not, the desired outcome of that customer job where you're solving that customer job. And then you've got all kinds of... Generally, what happens when I'm going through this process with teams is, all kinds of ideas start to come up about what more they could be doing, even post solving that customer job, especially the product team gets really exciting because they've got all kinds of ideas about where the product can go. So that really helps tie everybody together too.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:38:10):\nA critical part of that process obviously is identifying we have to measure success along the way. There should be a KPI for each of those stages in that customer journey. And for the most part, they won't be a big surprise on the struggle side of things. People out in the world experience the problem, how are we going to know we're doing a good job reaching them? We bring in new unique website visitors. In general, that would be the measure of success for the problem milestone. And then next piece of the puzzle is like, okay, once they discover that we exist, even if they are visiting, reading product reviews and visiting competitor sites or whatever, we'll know we've done a good job of convincing them that we can help solve their problem and deterring the people that we don't want.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:38:53):\nWe know we've done a good job when the conversion rate on whatever our primary CTA is on our website, whether or not it's start a trial or request a demo, something like that. Generally, the struggle phase is very straightforward in terms of measurement. That's like marketers' bread and butter, that's where they live and breathe all day long. Where things start to change though generally when we're working with companies is helping them figure out how should they be measuring first value or product activation and how should they be measuring actual product engagement. Generally, what we do there is, we can associate basically what they told us brings them the most amount of value with the product attribute or parts of the product that deliver that value. We try to tie the KPI obviously to some sort of meaningful product usage of that key part of the product or product attribute.\n\nLenny (00:39:49):\nCan you share some examples of that? Because that's a really important piece.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:39:52):\nYeah. I'll use SparkToro as an example just because it's the one that we started with. So for SparkToro, I don't remember the exact customer job statement necessarily, but for them, what they said were, the parts of the product that gave them a ton of value was two specific features: lists. So being able to organize their findings in a way that made it not only easy for them to organize within their own files but also share because a lot of them were with clients or stakeholders that they want to be able to share with. So lists were a specific feature that honestly, it was in there, but they weren't front loading the product experience with that. I'm not going to say it was hidden, but it wasn't front and center enough. So that was one feature that we could associate with being able to organize the data, being able to continue to build on it and make it usable over time and also share.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:40:55):\nAnd then there was another feature as well, which was an exporting feature. Again, it's not that it was hidden, but it wasn't front and center enough. So we tied KPIs to them making use of those features, coupled with obviously the core feature, which is searchability. It was like pairing the search functionality with the list functionality, and then pairing the search functionality with the list functionality, with the export functionality. It's a bit abstract to me just saying the words. It's easier with a visual. But the story is basically, help them use the search functionality first. Right after that, make sure that they're using lists. And if they don't use lists, let's help them get back to using it so that they get to that important critical value moment. And then the same applies for the exporting features that we were talking about.\n\nLenny (00:41:43):\nGot it. And to be clear, you basically said a metric for each of these moments.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:41:48):\nYeah, milestones.\n\nLenny (00:41:50):\nMilestones. Yeah.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:41:50):\nOr just whatever. I mean you have to. I mean it always surprises me when a team is like, \"Oh yeah. Yeah, you're right, we don't do that.\" I'm like, \"What? What do you mean?\" So at a given milestone, unless they've reached that value moment, you can't keep them on the train to something else. If they haven't even discovered that really, to them, most valued part of their product, you would need to focus on getting them to that value. Otherwise, you can't just keep firing off emails and hoping they're going to jump back into the product as if they're going to care. So a lot of what we'd do is actually proactive customer experiences, whether or not in app or email or whatever tool, to help them get to that moment within the product.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:42:32):\nAnd if they don't get to that moment, which is measurable, again, that's why it's a KPI, then we can be reactive in helping them get back in. So identifying, \"Okay,\" not that you would say this like, \"it fell off the train,\" but just helping them nurture them back into, the product didn't really discover that feature if they missed it the first time around. So it's proactive and pushing them forward, but then also catching them if they fall. And the only way to catch them if they fall is if you're measuring something meaningful along the way.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:43:02):\nWe have that storyboard that we were talking about. We also have a map where it's the experience to get them to a certain value moment, but then that win back experience to get them back in should they fall out for any reason. I mean, people get hungry and get distracted, and there's a ton of reasons why. I mean there's a lot of stats on the percentage. I think it's like 70% of people log into an app, log into a product once and never come back. It's wild. So the fact that so many companies don't have some sort of win back or re-engagement always blows my mind.\n\nLenny (00:43:41):\nSo just to recap and then we'll keep going with the process. Step one, understand what your customers are going through, figure out the most important customer and their biggest problem, then map out the journey that they go through, the struggle they go through before they discover your product, the steps they go through to evaluate, decide to use your product. And then once they use your product, then continuing to use your product and using it more and more. And then once you figured out these steps... And is a rough number like 10, 12 steps? What's a good number just to put-\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:44:13):\nOh no, I would hope it's more like six.\n\nLenny (00:44:16):\nSix, okay.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:44:17):\nI'm always trying to bring it down lowest, only as long as it absolutely needs to be. I mean that goes for all pages, landing pages.\n\nLenny (00:44:25):\nOkay, all right.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:44:25):\nSame thing for customer journey mask.\n\nLenny (00:44:27):\nOkay. Airbnb had 12, I think. So you're involved in-\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:44:29):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:44:29):\nI liked that. Okay. And then you've come up with a metric to tell you if that step is performing well.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:44:36):\nIf they'd gotten there, did they get to that value?\n\nLenny (00:44:37):\nIf they've gotten there. Cool. One last question before we move on to the next step. Can you give two maybe examples of an actual movement, say in SparkToro's case, and then the metric that they use to measure, if they've gotten to that point?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:44:52):\nYes. So the measure for success at that tip somebody over into evaluation is performing their first search. So when you're on their website, you perform a search, it's not signing up for a trial or signing up for free, although it does tip you into signing up for free when you perform your first search. So signing up for getting your first search and seeing your first search results is that first measure. And then following that for first value, it is using search again. I mean this is very product specific like I said, but generally, a first search is a kind of an experiment where you're sort of trying the tool on for the first time. Generally, searches start to get better when you do your second and third. So we try to encourage at least five plus.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:45:38):\nSo that first value KPI, I think it was five plus searches, plus at least one list. So it's the combination of those two things that have to happen before somebody's going to really see what this thing does. It's not that they won't get value if they don't use lists, but because we know that SparkToro's ideal customers really get a ton of value out of lists, people can hang out in that stage all day long if they want to. We're not going to worry about them. We're going to worry about the people that really want the actual functionality of the real fully featured tool. So that was the first value, that's how we would know that they got to product activation.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:46:21):\nAnd then the next one, as I mentioned before, is a combination of actually three things. So it is conducting a minimum amount of searches within a span of time, creating at least a certain number of lists, I can't remember exactly what it is, and then discovering exporting at least once. And then that is, they've reached a meaningful enough threshold of product engagement. And then value growth was that they do all of that on a regular enough basis so that we know they're not a flight risk basically. So that we know that they're getting continued value from the product. And if they ever fall out of that ongoing engagement measured success, then we can trigger either one-on-one outreach, an email, whatever. I mean obviously it can't be an app because if they're not logging into the app, then you can't reach them. But to help them back in and to say, \"Hey, what's up? Can we help? Is there anything that we can do?\" And basically be proactive in getting them back in. And then value growth, I believe I think it was expansion or upgrade in their case. I can't remember exactly.\n\nLenny (00:47:27):\nCool. So you end up with these say, six KPIs.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:47:29):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:47:30):\nI imagine this becomes goals you track, and then you probably pick one of these to focus on say, per year, per quarter. Awesome.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:47:37):\nYeah, hopefully not per year.\n\nLenny (00:47:38):\nOkay, per week.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:47:40):\nHopefully short, because I mean I will say that with some of the KPIs, it's very straightforward with new unique website visitors or the website conversion rate. I mean depending on who owns the website, that's not something that should take you a year. You should never be focused on only your website's conversion rate for a year hopefully. But these other KPIs and these other milestones, I mean I have no disillusions about if it impacts the product, obviously there's a lot of implications there. So yes, generally, once you tip over into that sort of in-app and more product experience, timelines vary widely, to say the least.\n\nLenny (00:48:18):\nOkay, cool. Let's move on to the next step.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:48:21):\nOkay. So after that point, we had a rich voice of customer document that came out of that research. We had a messaging guide for them to use not only in their marketing materials but also through the entire product experience, and also identifying the parts of the product that were so meaningful. Actually, their VP of marketing, the new VP of marketing, Amanda Natividad, actually rolled out checklist. They built a checklist, a product onboarding checklist and also product onboarding emails. And their trial-to-paid doubled. We were like, \"Okay, cool, let us know if you need any help or whatever.\" And they're like, \"Oh, we're good. We got this.\" Checked in two months later and their trial-to-paid had doubled.\n\nLenny (00:49:03):\nI feel like you skipped the important staff of, \"Hey, we got KPIs.\" And then you're like, \"Oh, we gave them all this information.\" So I'd love to spend a little more time on there. You came up with messaging for them, positioning stuff. what happens there?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:49:16):\nWell, this is the thing. They have a team in place. They've got very highly skilled, a huge team but highly skilled marketer there at the helm. I mean not the list of which is Rand Fishkin, their CEO. So basically, what we did was we gave them, it's like a framework. So it's like, \"Here are the bones of this. So got a messaging and positioning guide for you.\" Generally, I mean when we do them, they're five to seven pages long. They hit on the value prop. They hit on the major competitive advantages. They hit on the major value themes that you want to focus on. Those value themes can be broken down by the emotional benefits and the functional benefits tied to the product attributes that drive that value. So that document, and there's more that goes into it, but that messaging guide basically can be used as the baseline for all kinds of marketing collateral and material, but also email onboarding.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:50:16):\nSo when they're writing their email sequences for whatever it is they're trying to solve for, whatever milestone they're solving for, they can use that as their baseline like, \"This is what we're going for. This is the goal here.\" And that messaging guide rules up to the job to be done. So the job to be done is sort of like the top line. And then we've got that messaging that serves that job to be done. And then we've got the sort of operationalized customer experience with those milestones and KPIs. And then you sort of zoom in on like, where is the experience most broken right now? We already knew that for SparkToro. We knew that we wanted to influence that first early product experience. So that's where we zoomed in and decided on what programs they should roll out. And email onboarding was a natural, as was the checklist.\n\nLenny (00:51:03):\nFor folks that want to work on messaging, say kind of just like, \"Hey, here's a bunch of messaging advice,\" any tips for how to message well, how to think about messaging once you have a sense of your journey, maybe some goals, any just pro tips here you could share?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:51:21):\nOh, boy. I mean that research and the voice of customer, I mean I'm always going to go back to that. You can guess and you can do use your best judgment. You can use internal stakeholders and the internal team knowledge. And I'm not saying that that is not valuable and that you shouldn't use that at all. You can, but it should never come before learning from and listening to your best ideal customers and using the language that they use. You want to reflect them back to them. That is what is going to show them that you understand the problem that they have and that your product has exactly what it is that they need.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:52:06):\nThe hierarchy of messaging is really important as well. So I mean, there's the classic, sometimes it's hard to see the label from inside the jar, so it's really helpful to get out and be like, \"Okay, how do customers see us?\" Generally, you can identify the hierarchy of what is important to them, what is the thing that they say is most valuable about their product? What was that aha moment or what was that first value moment? Or what is the thing that makes you stand out over everybody else? And it can literally be a numbers game. If you take a hundred or so survey responses, you can break that down like, \"Here's the thing they said they cared about most. Here's the thing they said they cared about second most and third most,\" not to be so paint by numbers about it, but there's art in the science. But in general, you want to reflect back what they said they care about, not what you think is the coolest thing about your product. That's obviously not the best way to go.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:53:05):\nThat's something that we all inherently know, but it becomes really hard when there's a lot going on and things are changing and the product is evolving and there's a lot of teens and people are coming and going. It's easy to lose sight of that, especially when you're just trying to get shit out the door. So that messaging guide is mentally like, \"Okay, here we are. This is my baseline, these are my guardrails for everything that we produce.\" It's also really handy to hand off to copywriters when you bring in... I mean not just copywriters, lots of people, but particularly when you're producing copy, providing that messaging guide is solar platter for them.\n\nLenny (00:53:46):\nIs this available anywhere, the template that you end up sharing with a customer? Just like, here's a guide, the layout, messaging, recommendations.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:53:53):\nOh, we have so many.\n\nLenny (00:53:55):\nMaybe a little-\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:53:55):\nWe have so many templates and stuff. Yeah, I'll include a couple links.\n\nLenny (00:54:01):\nGreat. I'll put it in the show notes.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:54:02):\nWe got lots of stuff like that. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:54:04):\nOkay, great. A few final questions around jobs to be done.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:54:09):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:54:10):\nSo you said that they doubled their conversion from free to paid.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:54:13):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:54:13):\nAmazing. What was their job to be done in the end? And then I just have a few questions about the jobs to be-\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:54:19):\nI think it was when they're struggling to identify opportunities that aren't as obvious. So generally, when you're doing marketing research, you'll end up signing the same things over and over again. And if you are a service provider or if you're in-house for that matter and you're tasked with always coming up with novel and new and more and more and more, you tap that pretty quickly. So what customers were coming to them for was like, \"Give me more. I need to impress here. I need more to work with. I need to identify opportunities that I wouldn't otherwise be aware of.\" Actually that was exactly what it was. I helped me identify opportunities as I wouldn't otherwise be aware of. So the customer job statement is, \"When I am in a certain situation, help me,\" which is filled in by what those things that they're looking, for those motivations, \"so I can,\" which is the desired outcome.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:55:18):\nThe help me was about, I believe it was in a way that is organized and that is shareable and usable over time that I can build on and really rely on over time. And the desired outcome was about, I mean this isn't going to be surprising, but it was about getting stakeholder by hand and getting people on board with, and sharing and looking good, looking like a pro, and doing their job more effectively and driving better results for either their own team or for their clients.\n\nLenny (00:55:48):\nAwesome. We got there. We gloss a little bit over jobs to be done. I imagine many people listening have no idea what this is. So maybe as our final question, can you just explain what this framework is and how folks can learn to use it, or any resources you recommend that comes to mind?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:56:07):\nYeah. I mean a heavy influence for us definitely is Bob Moesta, who's one of the original architects of jobs to be done. There are lots of materials online for jobs. I am not the foremost authority in jobs at all. I think jtbd.info is a good website. There's a bunch. Also, Bob Moesta wrote a book called Demand-Side Sales that goes into it. There's also a lot of books written about jobs to be done. When Coffee and Kale is one that a lot of people love. I digress. Point being that what matters is identifying what it is that customers are trying to accomplish. So demographic data doesn't matter. The classic example is, if you look at... Oh, King Charles, now the example has changed. If you look at Ozzy Osbourne, and it was Prince Charles the original, but now it's King Charles, if you look at those two men, they're the exact same age and live in the same area. They both have a dog. They both love cars.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:57:04):\nFrom a demographic standpoint, they are identical, but they obviously lead very different lives. What motivates them is very different. So that is where typically personas sort of fall down. So what jobs to be done, to us, is help you figure out what is that desired outcome, what does that better life that customers are seeking out. You were just the vehicle to get them there. That's all it is. I mean there's so many tired analogies so I don't even want to use them but-\n\nLenny (00:57:34):\nMilkshakes maybe.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:57:36):\nWhat's that?\n\nLenny (00:57:37):\nThe milkshake analogy.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:57:38):\nThe milkshake one, it's not even the analogy. I think that was one of the original job stories that is the milkshake one.\n\nLenny (00:57:45):\nAny other things you want to share about the process that you go through with the companies, things you've learned, before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:57:54):\nYeah. One of the objections that we often get to this type of work is that research takes a long time and that research can often lead to more questions and can slow everything down. You can end up in analysis paralysis, but it doesn't have to be that way. It can be very straightforward, honestly, in a survey scenario. With SparkToro, in just that scenario, I have lots of examples of companies where we ran surveys, it can be a couple of weeks. Two or three weeks, you can actually come out with something solid to move forward with, and you don't get stuck in the bickering or all those stakeholders, the too many cooks in the kitchen. You can come to something decisive. You can get value out of that.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:58:47):\nThe other thing too, the other objection that we get a lot from founders in particular is because they build products to solve a problem that they had, which is cool and it definitely makes you one of the most knowledgeable people about your solution. But products change, markets change, customers change, teams change in a ball. Not everything can live inside of your head, and there's a ton of value in learning and getting inside the heads of your best customers that you may have been really close to the inception of the product. But if any span of time has changed, you'll always learn something new. I've never been in a scenario like this where a founder has not learned something new from their research and been able to leverage it in a way that makes their product experience better.\n\nLenny (00:59:35):\nAwesome. We'll come back to how folks can reach out to you if they want to experience this process, could work with you, learn more. But before we get there, we've gotten into a very exciting lightning round. I've got five quick questions for you. We'll go through them quick, whatever comes to mind. That's what we're doing. Okay, sounds good?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:59:50):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:59:51):\nOkay. What are two or three books that you recommend most to people looking to get better at marketing?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (00:59:58):\nI very, very, very rarely read marketing books, but there's two that I think are pretty foundational and recent. So Obviously Awesome by April Dunford. I'm sure you've heard that one a ton. It's kind of required reading, I would say, especially for founders. I told April when she first wrote, I'm like, \"I'm going to require every single founder I work with to read your book before we work with them,\" because it's foundational, you have to know that.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (01:00:23):\nAnd then the other one that I really enjoyed flip side was Hooked by Nir Eyal. That one was great too. But like I said, I don't read many marketing books. The other one that I would be remiss not to mention is ours that we're writing about the process, which is really about the step by step how to do this thing. So as much as we love going through this process with companies, I sort of took a page from April here too, in that telling the process and having people be able to rule this out and do this internally themselves has been wildly gratifying. We do it with a training program and this is our next step in getting out into the world even more. So you absolutely can do this stuff yourself. So that process is later in that book. And then another book that I read recently, which has nothing to do with marketing at all, but was really nice was 4000 Weeks. I don't think-\n\nLenny (01:01:15):\nI'm reading that right now.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (01:01:15):\nOh yeah, I enjoyed it. It was a nice sort of coming back to base a bit. I don't know when I read it. I just finished it a couple of weeks ago. It was just the timing was perfect. I feel like what's going on in the world right now and how everybody's probably feeling right now, it's a good solid read for now.\n\nLenny (01:01:38):\nI'm enjoying it. I just started. I'm glad to-\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (01:01:40):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (01:01:41):\nWell, you encouraged me to keep reading it.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (01:01:43):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:01:43):\nOkay. Favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (01:01:46):\nI have young kids. I just bought a second property. We're renovating three houses right now. I do not watch movies almost ever. The only thing that I'm currently binging is YouTubers that do DIY interior design and renos. Reason being my partner and I bought a property with four very, very old cottages lakefront, almost like tiny houses, little cottages. We are slowly renovating each of them. So my sort of fill is learning about interior design and DIY home rentals. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:02:31):\nWho's had the most impact on you in your career?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (01:02:31):\nThis is the worst question. I hate saying this, but it's probably my dad. I have to say my dad because he's an entrepreneur through and through. And I remember very vividly, I worked for him for I think eight years early in my career. One of the things that he always said was like, \"It was the joy of the business.\" He didn't care what, he's like, \"It doesn't matter what you're selling.\" He could be selling anything, but it was the joy of entrepreneurship. And that really stuck with me. So even when I was in house, I always knew that I needed to do something on my own and be in charge of that journey. His joy in it has impacted me a lot. He was the reason why I knew I was always going to do this.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (01:03:26):\nOther than that, I would say I have an incredible network of women that I have been very lucky. We're part of a group that we call Shine Crew. I think I'm supposed to copyright that or something to somebody because I think the term Shine Theory is what it's based on basically. But I'm very, very lucky to be heavily influenced by April Dunford, Tara Robertson, Joanna Wiebe, Talia Wolf. And then obviously my business partner, Claire, obviously changed everything for me. Having that partnership in business, I don't think I would've lasted this long. So yeah, definitely a huge influence for sure.\n\nLenny (01:04:10):\nWhat's one thing that helps you stay focused and productive during the day?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (01:04:15):\nDefinitely carving up time, like time blocking. I do a lot of time blocking in advance with a little brain emoji of safeguarding my time. Because we're a small team and we use Slack obviously, something else that we do to protect each other's time is not time stamp, but we put a little code in all of our messages that's either like, \"You don't have to listen to this before the end of the day,\" or, \"It's timely,\" or, \"It's no rush,\" so that we know when we need to mentally process messages in Slack, so we can drop in there just periodically. And then the only other thing that I would say that I do maybe once a month or once a quarter is, we're pretty buttoned up about our time tracking, so we go back and it sort of keeps us honest about how our time is actually spent. And then we can sort of adjust and time block accordingly to make up for the shortcomings of our previous quarter.\n\nLenny (01:05:10):\nThat was really clever. I haven't heard of that trick. What's the emoji for \"You can do this later\"?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (01:05:15):\nWe actually just use no rush or EOD for end of day, or timely. We do have the alarm emoji, is the \"Now. This is going to be dealt with ASAP.\"\n\nLenny (01:05:29):\nAmazing. Gia, thank you for making time. For this final question, where can folks find you online? How do they pre-order your book? How can they learn more? And then also, just how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (01:05:39):\nThank you for asking. Twitter is probably the best way. My Twitter handle is atrocious, @ggiiaa is me on Twitter. I'm on LinkedIn every once in a while obviously. My email address is gia@forgetthefunnel.com. So if anybody has any questions, whatever, feel free to email me. If you want any templates or whatever that don't get included in the show notes, just ping me. I've no problem with that. And then forgetthefunnel.com, we've got a book page where there is a wait list for the... Well, we're going to do presale, and then the published physical book will be early in 2023. But we are going to do presale because... Get it in those hands. Why not?\n\nLenny (01:06:18):\nLove it. Gia, thank you for being here.\n\nGeorgiana Laudi (01:06:21):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny (01:06:24):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# 35 years of product design wisdom from Apple, Disney, Pinterest and beyond | Bob Baxley\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny (00:04):\nGibson Biddle, whose name is really fun to say, by the way, has directly taught and worked with more PMs than only a handful of other people in the world. Before going full time on teaching, he was VP of product at Netflix and at Chegg, and has written what is almost surely the most popular Medium post on product strategy.\n\nLenny (00:21):\nIn our chat, we learned about Gibson's very popular product strategy and prioritization framework, and we go through a bunch of real life case studies from his time in Netflix to see how they apply in the real world. I love how Gibson comes up with such clear and memorable frameworks, which help demystify the vagueness that surround strategy and prioritization. We're really lucky to have Gibson share these with us, and I hope you enjoy it.\n\nLenny (00:45):\nThis episode is brought to you by Flat File. Think the last time imported a spreadsheet. Did it work the first time? Chances are it did not. You probably got some weird error, had to try a bunch of things like removing the blank title rows above your column headers, or Googling how to save with UTF-8 encoding. What even is UTF? Who cares? You're just trying to get your file where it needs to go so you can do your actual job.\n\nLenny (01:07):\nYour customers run into the same issues when it matters most, right after signing up for your product.

Get started importing millions of rows of customer data in minutes at FlatFile.com/Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:50):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda is an all in one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place. I actually use Coda every single day. It's my home base for organizing my newsletter writing. It's where I plan my content calendar, capture my research, and write the first drafts of each and every post. It's also where I curate my private knowledge repository for paid newsletter subscribers, and it's also how I manage the workflow for this very podcast.\n\nLenny (02:15):\nOver the years I've seen Coda evolve from being a tool that makes teams more productive to one that also helps bring the best practices across the tech industry to life, with an incredibly rich collection of templates and guides in the Coda doc gallery, including resources for many guests on this podcast, including Shreyas, Gokul, and Shishir, the CEO of Coda. Some of the best teams out there, like Pinterest, Spotify, Square and Uber, use Koda to run effectively and have published their templates for anyone to use.\n\nLenny (02:43):\nIf you're ping ponging between lots of documents and spreadsheets, make your life better and start using Coda. You can take advantage of a special limited time offer just for startups. Head over to Coda.io/Lenny to sign up and get a thousand dollar credit on your first statement. That's C-O-D-A.io/Lenny to sign up and get a thousand dollars in credit on your account.\n\nLenny (03:14):\nGibson, I am so excited to be doing this. We've collaborated on some writing. We've done a couple of fireside chats together, but we've never really dug deep into anything, and so I'm really excited for this opportunity to chat. So, welcome.\n\nGibson Biddle (03:27):\nGreat, Lenny. Thanks for having me. It's fun to virtually be in the same place at the same time. Someday we'll do that in person.\n\nLenny (03:35):\nOh man, I can't wait. For folks that aren't that familiar with you, could you just share a very brief overview of your journey through product?\n\nGibson Biddle (03:43):\nIt's hard, because I'm older than dirt, to be very brief, but I'll give my best shot. The intro was, I discovered I loved teaching early. I ran a sailing school, took a year off from college. That was my first startup. And then, the three chapters of my life. The first one was in marketing, so I actually started in the mail room at an ad agency, and then went into account services and created a service that helped name new companies and products, like if you're in the Bay Area, the Versatel, or the Versateller, it's a Bank of America name.\n\nLenny (04:10):\nI've always been so curious about that industry, but that's a discussion for another time.\n\nGibson Biddle (04:14):\nOh yeah, well, we can come around to that. But at the end of the day, it's all about packaging and positioning and branding. And so, I was curious about that. I got good at it. And then, I lived in Silicon Valley, and I wanted to go into tech, and so I decided to go back to business school, and I went back to Tuck, which is at Dartmouth. It's the only ski... it's the only business school that has its own ski area, which is why I went there. It's in Hanover, New Hampshire.\n\nLenny (04:35):\nOkay, that feels like a product market fit for Gibson.\n\nGibson Biddle (04:37):\nExactly. And then, after the school, this is the tech journey, I joined Electronic Arts. Punk kid in the right place at the right time. I joined in marketing, and then I switched over to product. It was a great place to learn product. They called it Producer College. I learned a ton, and my first startup was actually a joint venture between Electronic Arts and Disney. We created what's called EA Kits at the beginning, and that became Creative Wonders, and we sold that company to Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank. He was the CEO of the Learning Company that made Reader Rabbit software and Oregon Trails. That dates me, because most of the listeners have probably played Oregon Trails as a kid.\n\nLenny (05:13):\nDying of dysentery. That's what I remember.\n\nGibson Biddle (05:15):\nYeah, yeah. And so, the product roles I grew up into, I call it a muckety muck, but a VP of product or a chief product officer. Joined Netflix in 2005. I left out some failed startups. That's important. It's important to let folks know I had some failed startups, but you can gloss over in the brief version. Netflix 2005, and then 2010 I went back to my heart, which is teaching. Chegg was a textbook rental and homework help company. It continues to exist. We took that public sort of 2014.\n\nGibson Biddle (05:44):\nAnd then, last five years I stopped direct deposit, and I'm really back to the coda in my career. I'm back to teaching, which I really love to do. So I do talks, workshops all over the world. I do more writing, which really saves my voice, and then experiment with different ways to really try to be helpful to product leaders around the world.\n\nLenny (06:02):\nAwesome. We're going to be spending time digging into some of that stuff. Did you describe this point in your career as stopping direct deposit?\n\nGibson Biddle (06:08):\nI did.\n\nLenny (06:09):\nThat's amazing. Wow. I've never heard it that way.\n\nGibson Biddle (06:14):\nAt least you understood that.\n\nLenny (06:15):\nI totally get that. Amazing. So, a question I ask folks in your line of work especially is, how many PMs would you say you've helped train, free workshops and advising and online courses, and anything else you've done?\n\nGibson Biddle (06:28):\nI thought it was going to be a, how many PMs does it take to screw in a light bulb? I thought it was going to be a joke. Yeah, yeah. Okay, my SWAG. SWAG is a stupid wild-ass guess, important idea. So, my guess is, in real life I've worked with product leaders where I was in the building with them. It would be like 500 to 1000. When I would manage an organization, there might be 200 or 300 people in it. So, that's in real life.\n\nGibson Biddle (06:53):\nThe next one would be via talks, workshops, newsletter. That's probably, I kind of can SWAG my way into that. Probably 50 to 100,000 a year. The reason I sort of know, I'm a feedback freak, so there's a Survey Monkey at the end of everything I do. So for instance, every morning I wake up, it's always feedback for the same talk. I did a Branding for Builders talk for Product School and there'll be like 10 surveys. I've got like 6,000 surveys for that. They're all watching and recording. My guess is, that means like 60,000 people have watched that one video, for instance.\n\nGibson Biddle (07:26):\nAnyways, and then lifetime, it's probably getting into 500,000 to a million. So, that's my SWAG. I could be 2X wrong on either side.\n\nLenny (07:34):\nOkay, a million, potentially.\n\nGibson Biddle (07:36):\nWell, your number's bigger. You could just go off of, what, 115,000 subscribers your newsletter?\n\nLenny (07:43):\nYeah.\n\nGibson Biddle (07:44):\nYou're getting to a billion, Lenny. You're going to get to the next level. 500 million to a billion.\n\nLenny (07:49):\nI feel like the level that you've helped PMs is at a deeper level for most of the folks, especially the courses you've done and things like that. So, it's a little hard to compare. But anyway, that's really impressive, and I feel like when I ask people this question, I feel like this is going to be a high bar to meet.\n\nLenny (08:04):\nSo, I'm excited to dig into a lot of the stuff that you've learned along this journey. Maybe the area you spend most of your time on is helping PMs build their product strategy, muscle through your workshops, and you have these legendary Medium posts about product strategy. So, I'd love to spend the majority of our time talking through just helping people build this muscle. And maybe just start, you have this really simple model for describing what product strategy should be for companies: to delight customers in hard to copy margin enhancing ways. So, there's kind of these three parts, customers, hard to copy, margin enhancing. I'd love to just kind of hear your take on each of these three parts, how you came up with this, and then maybe a story or two of how you relied on this and used this at Netflix.\n\nGibson Biddle (08:42):\nSure. You got the model right. And I mean, the short answer is, I definitely learned it from Reed Hastings when I started at Netflix. Actually, he did a reference check to a friend of mine, checking up on me, and the only question he asked my pal, whose name is John Daz, was, \"Hey, John, is Gib ready? Can Gib delight customers?\" That was the only question he asked in the reference check.\n\nGibson Biddle (09:05):\nLuckily, I built really delightful kids software. Back then, people were talking about satisfying customers, listening carefully, understanding them, et cetera. And the delight, it just said, no, no, no. The job is to delight customers. Like Peter Thiel, his book, From Zero to One. The job of an entrepreneur at the beginning is just to find out something that's 10X better. Delight is trying to work in that magnitude.\n\nGibson Biddle (09:28):\nThe hard to copy part, definitely I learned that. I had a product leader who worked for me, his name was HB Mock. He was focused on the non-member page. That's where people sign up for. They put in their email, their credit card, they would get a free trial. He'd looked like crap, like everything at startups sucks at the beginning, but he put a happy family on the couch on this screen, and that's where you put in your email. And that got a lot more people engaged. And so, it delighted customers, but it was helping to build the business, because more folks were setting up for a free trial.\n\nGibson Biddle (09:58):\nI'm like, that's great HB, but I'll bet my paycheck that within a week, Blockbuster's going to put a happy family on their couch, too. And this is the problem of doing things that are easy to copy. So in the long term, if you can delight customers and create hard to copy advantage, things are just a lot better.\n\nGibson Biddle (10:17):\nAnd so the last phrase, margin enhancement, that's just a fancy phrase for making money. Margin technically would mean profit. I just gave you example with that non-member page, with the happy family on the couch. It delights folks, it helps build a better business, but in that case, Blockbuster was able to copy it.\n\nGibson Biddle (10:37):\nSo, that's the model. The hardest part in that model is, how do you balance delight versus margin? So if Netflix said, hey, everybody, you're paying $20 bucks a day, but you're going to get exactly the same service tomorrow for $5 bucks a month, you'd be just like, this is fricking awesome. You'd be really delighted. But Netflix would not, the business wouldn't work.\n\nGibson Biddle (10:56):\nSo, one of the first places we sort of experiment on how to evaluate trade offs between delight and margin, in the old days, Netflix was a DVD by mail company, and if you ask customers what they wanted, then they all said the same thing. I want my new release DVDs faster, right? Back then, most customers would have to wait a week or two or four weeks. Back then, a movie came out in the theater, two months later it came out on DVD. We just couldn't afford to buy for that initial demand. So, the way it worked was, some people got it the next day in the mail, and some people had to wait two months.\n\nGibson Biddle (11:31):\nAnd so, the A/B test we set up, we said, okay, everybody says they want this, in focus groups and qualitative and surveys. Well, let's A/B test and see what we really learn. So, the AB test was called the Perfect New Release Test. Imagine we're at about a million customers circa 2005. 10,000 peeps are in a test cell. They get their new release DVD the next day in the mail. Awesome, right? And the control gets it whenever. Let's say, average maybe two weeks later.\n\nGibson Biddle (12:01):\nAnd so, the way we measure delight in this A/B test is, will you improve retention for the folks that are getting their DVD the next day in the mail? That's how we measured, it was retention. When Netflix started, it was like 10% canceled every month. 2005, it was about four and a half percent canceled every month. Today it's about 2% cancel every month. So, I'll just put it back to you. Do you think, when we looked at the AB test results... By the way, you can't get this wrong, Lenny, so just relax.\n\nLenny (12:35):\nExcellent.\n\nGibson Biddle (12:35):\nDo you think the Perfect New Release Experience improved retention?\n\nLenny (12:40):\nMy guess is, because you're telling this story, it's going to be a surprise, and I would guess that it did not.\n\nGibson Biddle (12:45):\nOkay, so your guess is we won't see an improvement in retention. And I'm guessing people listening to us right now, there's going to be some folks that, oh, shit, yes, that's what everybody's asking for. Of course we should deliver it to them, right? Well, in this case, both right, right? We saw a very small change in retention. That was the surprise. And so, it went from something like 4.5% canceled in the control. It was 4.45. Very small change. We can measure it.\n\nGibson Biddle (13:13):\nAnd so, now you get in the math of delight versus margin. If you push this out to all million customers, you would essentially save 5,000 customers. And so, what's the value in saving 5,000 customers? The way we valued it, we said, well we've got 5,000 customers. The lifetime value of a customer then was a hundred bucks. And then we multiplied it by two, which is our word of mouth factor. So our theory was, if you loved it, Lenny, you'd tell your friends about it, you'd rave about it, and you'd bring in one other customer for free into Netflix. And so, we used this 2X word of mouth factor. And so if you do that math, it was worth about a million bucks to us as a company.\n\nGibson Biddle (13:52):\nSo now you get into, okay, what's the cost of that additional inventory? And the answer was $5 million bucks. So on one hand, you're bringing in a million bucks of value by retaining more customers, but you're spending $5 million more, so it doesn't seem to make sense.\n\nGibson Biddle (14:06):\nOkay, so easy question. I don't overthink this one, Lenny. Would you roll this out to all customers?\n\nLenny (14:10):\nI would not.\n\nGibson Biddle (14:11):\nYou would not. Okay. Can you help build an argument for somebody who would choose to roll it out?\n\nLenny (14:17):\nOh, no. Give me the hint. I'll take it.\n\nGibson Biddle (14:18):\nThe hint was, there was an assumption in my formula. I said 5,000 customers times $100 bucks lifetime value, times a 2X word of mouth. So the argument for why somebody might do it, they disagree with the 2X word of mouth, and what the algorithm is.\n\nLenny (14:33):\nYeah, I see where this is going. Basically, the experience is so much better that word of mouth increases. It's so delightful.\n\nGibson Biddle (14:38):\nYeah. Amazon would use a 10X, right? And so, sort of a wash there. You'd probably lean forward and do it. We actually worked hard to try to isolate what that word of mouth factor was. It was really frustrating. And then, the reality was, Barry McCarthy was the CFO. He was apoplectic about the idea of using a 2X, because it means you'll invest more in building a better product. If you let the product team use 10x, Barry's like, \"We don't have the money. We don't have the money to spend $5 million on DVDs.\"\n\nGibson Biddle (15:03):\nAnyways, this is where we sort of refined our thinking about the model of delighting customers in hard to copy, margin enhancing ways. Pop quiz, I know the answer, Lenny, but want everybody else thinking about it. What makes Netflix hard to copy?\n\nLenny (15:18):\nThe licensing deals and content that they're creating.\n\nGibson Biddle (15:22):\nOriginal content, yeah. Keep going.\n\nLenny (15:24):\nTheir brand that they've built over time.\n\nGibson Biddle (15:26):\nYou trust them with their credit card every month for $20 bucks, right?\n\nLenny (15:28):\nOh, absolutely. I think I've been a customer for five years.\n\nGibson Biddle (15:31):\nYeah, yeah. What else makes them hard to copy?\n\nLenny (15:34):\nI imagine, their tech that used to be the ranking algorithm recommendation engine.\n\nGibson Biddle (15:37):\nYeah, so there's unique technology. Personalization is a great example. You just brought that up. There's only one other idea that I think is... Well, there's probably be two others for Netflix. So keep going, dig deep.\n\nLenny (15:48):\nMaybe, I don't know if this is an answer you're thinking, but just the talent they've built up over time is probably something.\n\nGibson Biddle (15:53):\nThat's really interesting. People go to culture, and then I sort of specify, what makes the Netflix product hard to copy? So, I won't allow that one.\n\nLenny (16:01):\nOh, man.\n\nGibson Biddle (16:02):\nOkay, keep going.\n\nLenny (16:03):\nWhat makes Netflix hard to copy?\n\nGibson Biddle (16:05):\nI'll give you one clue.\n\nLenny (16:06):\nOkay.\n\nGibson Biddle (16:06):\nWhat made Facebook wicked hard to copy?\n\nLenny (16:08):\nTheir network effects and growth loops.\n\nGibson Biddle (16:12):\nYeah, yeah. We actually tried to experiment with friends and social, getting movie ideas from your friends. The idea is, your friends were on the network, you wouldn't want to leave. And you'd also get great movie ideas. By the way, that was a failed hypothesis.\n\nLenny (16:25):\nRight, I was just going to say, I remember that did not work out. I don't see it anywhere.\n\nGibson Biddle (16:28):\nYeah. It did not work out. Yeah, I guess we could make an argument today, every screen in the world is magically prewired so you can watch Netflix anytime, anywhere. There's sort of a kind of flywheel or network effect at work. But anyways, that's great. So, that's just a model. But I have found that model to be helpful in my thinking a bunch of times.\n\nLenny (16:44):\nThere's a couple things I wanted to follow up on there, because there's a lot there. One is this idea of testing the ideal almost, and kind of working backwards from that. That's something I always find found really helpful. Is that something that you espouse and find to be really powerful?\n\nGibson Biddle (16:58):\nHonestly, I think of these product strategies as these high level theories, these hypotheses about how you will delight customers in hard to copy, margin enhancing ways. I just gave a failed hypothesis, the social one. You actually brought up a winning hypothesis. Personalization delights customers, because it makes it easier to find movies you'll love. It's hard to copy. Netflix sort of knows the movie tastes of a billion people worldwide. That's 222 members times about five profiles per. And then the margin, this is an interesting one.\n\nGibson Biddle (17:27):\nWhen Netflix is making an investment in a TV show or movie, they kind of can guess how many people will watch it. So, they guessed that 100 million people would watch Stranger Things, so they were willing to invest $500 million. They guessed that 20 million people would watch BoJack Horseman, I'm a freak, so they're willing to make $100 million. I call that right sizing the investment, but that's how personalization helps Netflix to build margin, or to build a better business.\n\nGibson Biddle (17:54):\nAnyways, back to your original question. I mainly was just trying to find these high level theories and hypotheses that I hoped would delight in hard to copy, margin enhancing ways. The reality was, we'd have 10 ideas and probably six of them would fail, but a lot of value in the three or the four that worked.\n\nGibson Biddle (18:10):\nWhen we went to TV based systems, we actually couldn't A/B test at first, so we were going back to qual and they were looking over people's shoulders, and focus groups, et cetera. But eventually, Netflix could A/B test what's a good experience on a TV based system. They have server based systems now where they can create different experiences for different folks. So I guess my short answer was, so hard to find these product strategies that worked. There was no notion of building a perfect experience of all these things together, so we just took it one theory at a time.\n\nLenny (18:40):\nGot it. And then, on that concept of delight, I always wanted to ask you this question. I've never had a chance. For B2B, do you find this is also something companies should really prioritize and do? Because not a lot of B2B products are delightful, and a lot of them are still really successful. How do you think about that kind of framework in B2B?\n\nGibson Biddle (18:55):\nOkay, first, I think that most all of the frameworks I use work for both consumer and B2B. Personally, I've spent my whole career on consumer. The thing about consumer is, you're sort of trying to catch lightning in a bottle, right? Where enterprise, you can actually walk into it a little bit more thoughtfully. You can always find your first customers, et cetera.\n\nGibson Biddle (19:15):\nAnyways, I was thinking about what's different. For instance, one of the hard to copy advantages of B2B is switching costs, right? I didn't bring that up in the context of Netflix. It's wicked hard to cancel. It's wicked easy to cancel Netflix and restart Disney+, whatever you want to do.\n\nGibson Biddle (19:29):\nI was thinking about, I used to complain that the user interface for B2B software was horrible, and it's like, you've got to do better than this. And of course, at Netflix we proved that a simple, easy experience actually improves retention. So I would advocate, this is important, and they would explain to me all the basics. Hey, Gib. Actually, one of the basics surprised me. The people that are using our software are using it 10, 12, 14 hours a day. That's very different from a Netflix experience. And in fact, they want and need to engage in the complexity. There's stuff that they're trying to do that is really complex.\n\nGibson Biddle (20:07):\nYou can just think about our use of spreadsheets to build a cash flow statement. I'm highlighting some differences, but the model I think is still there. If you're starting a punk B2B SaaS company, I think at the end of the day, you're trying to find something that's 10X better than what's currently out there today, and then over time, your hard to copy advantage. It will be different from Netflix. It'll be different for every startup. But if you can delight your customers in these hard to copy ways, that also builds a business.\n\nGibson Biddle (20:36):\nI mean, the reason you do that, you want to feel like you don't have to compete with peeps, really. You don't like it when you're always on guard about what your competitors should do. You sort of want to get to this place where you don't really care, and your sort of true North is okay, how can we best serve our customer? And that's what I really love about that particular model.\n\nGibson Biddle (20:53):\nLenny, I would be very careful about anything I say about enterprise and B2B, because I've spent zero hours in this, okay? Now, you said half of my audience is in B2B and enterprise, and you hear a lot about the consumerization of enterprise software, and I think that's good. I think that's helpful and important.\n\nLenny (21:13):\nAwesome. That's a really helpful caveat for folks listening, that if you're building a B2B business, maybe don't follow all this advice to the letter. But I imagine there's still a lot you can pull out.\n\nGibson Biddle (21:21):\nWell, honestly, it's so idiosyncratic. It's going to be different for each company, or each startup, or different stage. And that's why the tools, the models, the frameworks I use, they have to work generally, but then people have to apply their own good judgment.\n\nLenny (21:33):\nSweet. Okay. What I'd love to do is get a little more concrete using this model, and go through a few examples of how you may have thought through problems you were tackling at Netflix through this lens, to kind of see how it actually works in practice. Does that sound good?\n\nGibson Biddle (21:48):\nThat sounds like we're going to do some rapid fire mini cases.\n\nLenny (21:50):\nThat's exactly right.\n\nGibson Biddle (21:51):\nAnd I'm going to put you in the hot seat, Lenny. You're the proxy for the listeners today.\n\nLenny (21:55):\nAll right. Just make sure they're easy questions.\n\nGibson Biddle (21:58):\nNo matter what you say, I'll make you look smart.\n\nLenny (22:01):\nI like this. I just want that applied to all of life. Okay, so the first mini case study is something that I've seen a lot of people build, kind of hack together, is this idea of watching Netflix together with friends. I think one app is called Netflix Party. So the question there is, should Netflix launch a Netflix Party feature? Basically letting people watch Netflix together but in different places?\n\nGibson Biddle (22:22):\nYeah, yeah. It's kind of a real case. A bunch of engineers at Patreon, six or seven of them, they actually enabled, if you're using Netflix, they let you connect with your friends on Netflix, watch the same TV show or movie at the same time, and chat with each other while you're watching it, trash talk each other or use emojis, what have you. They called it Netflix party. The Netflix lawyers noticed it, and so they renamed it Teleparty. It exists. You can use it across multiple games, across Disney and Netflix, whatever you want.\n\nGibson Biddle (22:52):\nOkay, so the hypothesis is, Netflix should launch this idea for real, not just download the silver light, download the...\n\nLenny (23:01):\nChrome extension?\n\nGibson Biddle (23:02):\nChrome extension. There you go.\n\nLenny (23:03):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I think I've tried it, actually. It's pretty cool.\n\nGibson Biddle (23:06):\nYeah. It's complicated, right? I mean, you and I are both freaks, so we can figure it out. So the idea is that we'll delight customers, because this sounds like fun, especially during COVID. We can have this connected experience when we're also disconnected. Hard to copy advantage. We're kind of building a network effect. You and I will be connected and watching on Netflix. We don't want to quit because we don't want to leave each other behind. And then, the margin. For Netflix, it's largely about will it improve retention? Netflix today, 2% are canceling. Netflix has just ticked away at it point by point. It's just, it's these kinds of things that create a little bit more value, that improve retention.\n\nGibson Biddle (23:45):\nThe way I think about this is, the way that addition of this feature would actually improve retention is if some reasonable number of customers actually used it. And so, what I look out for is, I don't like two percenters. So if you find an idea that only works for 2% of your customers, now you're creating complexity, one more thing to choose. What happens when I hit this button?\n\nGibson Biddle (24:10):\nAnd frankly, some complexity that everybody else building the product forgets, right? This happened to me a lot. We'd have, in the old days, there was a profiles feature. When we launched streaming, we forgot about the profiles feature for DVD. Like, oh, crap. So, as a rule, I never used rules as thumbs, but these two percenters, I would kill them. If I launched something and it was only 2% we'd, we called it scraping the barnacles, just get rid of it.\n\nGibson Biddle (24:34):\nSo, I think the key question here is, what percent of Netflix members would use Netflix Party if you launched to all? You want to guess at that, Lenny?\n\nLenny (24:44):\nLet's say 5%.\n\nGibson Biddle (24:46):\n5%. Okay. I think that's good guess. I'm going to give you some historical context. We actually did Xbox Party back in 2008, 2009. My guess with the Xbox team was it would be a two percenter. I think it barely squeaked to 5%. And then, because it was only at 5%, we killed it. So I think that's a great guess. If you had said 10 or 15%, then I would've been scratching my head. Could that actually have a shot at improving retention?\n\nGibson Biddle (25:14):\nAnyways, Netflix hasn't launched this. They could, of course, test it, but I think the history, the failed hypothesis of social, kind of leans against it, and I just gave you two examples. The friends network getting, giving ideas of friends and Netflix, and the second, the Xbox Party. Those are two failed instances of social. Netflix will keep experimenting with this, but in this case they chose not to. So, not enough delight despite the fact that it could build hard to copy advantage. And if you don't have enough delight, enough usage, there's no shot at improving margin.\n\nGibson Biddle (25:45):\nOkay. You were awesome, Lenny. I told you, you sounded exceedingly smart. Okay, what do you got? What's the next one?\n\nLenny (25:51):\nNailed it. Just real quick, I really like the reminder of just focusing on reach and making... As good as the idea might be, just always coming back to what is the reach of this thing? Even if conversion increases like 50%, if like 10 people see it, it doesn't really matter.\n\nGibson Biddle (26:05):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (26:05):\nThat's such a good reminder.\n\nGibson Biddle (26:06):\nCool.\n\nLenny (26:06):\nOkay, next one is, something that you've shared is that during COVID, Netflix auto-canceled, apparently, something like half a percent of its members because they were inactive. And so, the question there would be, why do they do that, and how would Netflix have thought about that?\n\nGibson Biddle (26:20):\nYeah. Probably seen Netflix's stock history. But the beginning of COVID, they thought they were going to have 8 million new members, Q1 2020. They picked up 16 million. So, that was awesome. It was about that time that my perception as the product manager at Netflix was looking at the data focused on non-member experience, I think his name is Eddie Woo. And he was looking at the data, and he noticed half percent of the members weren't actually enjoying the service, like for a year. They clearly had entered their credit card, their email a year ago, and then just forgot that they had the service.\n\nGibson Biddle (26:51):\nAnd so, when he thought about it, he said, you know, I feel like it's the right thing to actually auto cancel people who aren't using the service they're paying. Of course, he was doing it a time where there was great growth, okay? So, let's use the delight and hard to copy margin enhancing model. Is this a delightful thing to do?\n\nLenny (27:10):\nAbsolutely. I feel really good.\n\nGibson Biddle (27:11):\nThat's my question. Okay.\n\nLenny (27:11):\nYeah, if a company's like, hey, okay, here, take your money back. You're not using this thing.\n\nGibson Biddle (27:15):\nExactly. And what's the hard to copy advantage that you'd be building by engaging in this best practice?\n\nLenny (27:22):\nI imagine there's kind of a brand halo, just you feel good about Netflix being really good to you.\n\nGibson Biddle (27:27):\nTotally. So if I told you, and this is the case, Netflix chose to auto cancel these folks like, huh, that's a really cool thing to do. And then the margin, the bad news, you're going to lose a hundred million bucks. So, there is delight, there is hard to copy advantage, and you're going to lose a hundred million bucks. Does that delight and hard to copy advantage outweigh the negative of losing a hundred million?\n\nGibson Biddle (27:50):\nI'm just going to ask you two more questions. Is this a high stakes decision or a low stakes decision? Eddie's decision to auto cancel these folks and lose a hundred million bucks. High stakes or low stakes? You're the product manager, Lenny.\n\nLenny (28:04):\nIt all depends on how much a hundred million is worth to the business. I imagine Netflix is such a large scale where it's not a huge deal, and it's a one off that's not recurring, and so you could give it a shot.\n\nGibson Biddle (28:13):\nOkay, so you've skipped ahead. You're looking too smart. On magnitude, it's a hundred million against a company that's doing 30 billion in revenue. And then, the second thing you brought up is, it's reversible, which is, he could do it now, but he doesn't have to continue this practice forever. And so, my joke there, I got married 30 years ago. I was anxious about getting married. My friend said, \"Gib, if it doesn't work out you can always get divorced.\" So they're saying it's reversible. Now I've been married 30 years, so it's worked out.\n\nGibson Biddle (28:39):\nBut my point here is, as product managers, we feel like every decision we make is high stakes. It's good occasionally to think about, hey, what's the magnitude? And then, is it reversible? Amazon calls those, this was a two-way door decision. It's reversible. The one way door, those are the bigger deal. And I think frankly, most people would argue that getting married is a one way door, but hey, half of folks don't.\n\nLenny (29:01):\nYeah, very hard to reverse. Reversible but expensive.\n\nGibson Biddle (29:04):\nOkay, what else you got?\n\nLenny (29:05):\nOkay, so you touched on Netflix's recent troubles with growth. And so, something that's always come up is this idea of why don't they offer a really cheap plan, or a free plan that's advertise supported. And so, I imagine you've thought about that a lot, and Netflix has thought about that a lot. How does that work with your framework?\n\nGibson Biddle (29:21):\nWell, let's fast forward two years. Netflix earnings Q1 2022 were bad. For the first time in 10 years, they actually lost customers, and they'd like to get the growth going again. Okay, that's a different context, right? Today.\n\nLenny (29:37):\nThis episode is brought to you by PostHog. PostHog offers a suite of product analysis tools, including funnels, heat maps, session recording and experimentation, all in one easy to use platform. PostHog is open source, so you can host it on your own infrastructure, which means that you have control over who has access to your data and makes regulatory compliance a breeze, because you don't need to send user info to third parties.\n\nLenny (30:00):\nPost Hog's app system works seamlessly with your data warehouse, both for importing and exporting data, which enables you to bring your data into one place and easily understand user behavior across a range of touchpoints. If you'd like to learn more, check them out at PostHog.com/Lenny.\n\nGibson Biddle (30:18):\nSo your question is, should Netflix have a lower-priced, advertising-supported plan?\n\nLenny (30:25):\nOkay, great.\n\nGibson Biddle (30:25):\nOkay, let's do it. We'll DHM it. Would an ad-supported plan that's lower price be delightful for customers, Lenny?\n\nLenny (30:33):\nI don't know if delightful is the right word, but if I didn't have a lot of cash, it would feel really nice to be able to use Netflix.\n\nGibson Biddle (30:39):\nOkay, so the possible delight is, it might only cost you five bucks, or who knows, it might be free, I don't know. But for a set of customers who are ad tolerant, that might be a reasonable trade off, right? You don't have to pay $10 or $15 or $20 bucks. You could pay maybe five, or two? I don't really know what the right price is.\n\nGibson Biddle (30:56):\nOkay, so the next one is, would Netflix be building hard to copy advantage if they did this?\n\nLenny (31:00):\nI guess the hards of copy pieces, if there's a network effect, they just accelerate that further, and that gives them some advantage. I don't know.\n\nGibson Biddle (31:06):\nMaybe. So if they pick up a new set of people, a new set of profiles, it's a technical term, as you get big, is you build economies of scale. So if they are able to grow, Netflix, they'll spend about $18 billion on content this year, whereas poor Amazon will only spend $8 billion. I just love saying poor Amazon. Because Netflix can amortize it across 220 million members. So, more growth, more customers, and hopefully a different segment of customers that they haven't gotten yet, so it's not just cannibalistic, could build more hard copy advantage.\n\nGibson Biddle (31:39):\nMy argument, I'm just going to skip ahead, if you cross fingers, I mean, you are picking up a new customer profile, new customer type, so you're going to have incremental revenues, which is really what Netflix is looking for. For me, I just want to tell you why Netflix hasn't done advertising yet. We actually did do it, 5, 6, 7, 8... 2005 through 2008. We put big-ass ad banners on every page on the site, even for the members. We did a retention test, and it actually did not hurt retention. A big surprise. And that was the first year that we generated an operating income of $20 million bucks. It was like the first profitable year.\n\nGibson Biddle (32:14):\nWe also did this at our business. We were selling used discs, previously viewed discs. That's how we first made money, and Reed Hastings, the CEO, came to me in 2008 and said, \"Gib, I need you to kill advertising and previously viewed, because I think we can deliver a profit in our core business.\" And he wanted to keep things simple, create this simple experience that's part of a subscription.\n\nGibson Biddle (32:34):\nYou have had this. We had a lot of pride and ownership. He didn't involve me in the decision, all of these things, right? He's just sort of sticking a gun to my head. He only asked me two questions. He said, \"Gib, who's going to be the best in the world at advertising?\" And I said, \"Google.\" And then his second question is, \"Who needs to be the best in the world of personalization?\" I said, \"We do.\" And his argument was to kill previously viewed and advertising to create a simple experience for the customers, and so that we could stay manically focused on personalization.\n\nGibson Biddle (33:02):\nNow fast forward, so on the earnings call, for him, the debate is really between simplicity, which he's a huge fan of. But during the earnings call he said, \"Actually, there's something I believe in even more, and that's customer choice.\" And he was saying, you know what? I think for this new set of customers, giving them the choice to have a $5 a month plan with advertising... He did not say the $5 bucks. I'm just plugging that in. In this case, customer choice may be more important than delight. And in this case, rather, customer choice may be more important than the complexity of advertising, or maybe the stinky experience.\n\nGibson Biddle (33:39):\nWhew. There's something important. What he said is, today it's relatively straightforward to execute an advertising-based business doing this. There's a zillion partners who could do it, so we could continue to focus on the core of what we do, which is personalization. Which I thought was a really thoughtful response. So my guess is, they will do advertising, but he was very contrite. Stock had half of its value. He felt he had disappointed shareholders. So I think he was looking for ways to earn back that trust.\n\nLenny (34:05):\nYeah. The market sometimes forces you to do something you didn't expect. I really like the Socratic Method that Reed uses in the story you shared, where he kind of asks you these questions that help you get to the same conclusion he got to.\n\nGibson Biddle (34:16):\nHonestly, I reflected on that for five years. Why didn't he engage me in the decision? And then I just realized... I mean, by the way, this being a CEO is a really hard job. But I realized I had so much pride and ownership, he just knew that I wouldn't want to kill it, that it would be hard for me to be objective. And he felt strongly that he believed he knew the right answer and said, hey, I just need you to do this. And he was right. So, it took me five years to process that, but there's a lot of things you do to support the CEO, because that job is really hard.\n\nLenny (34:47):\nWe're going to talk a bit about the role of a CPO and what you learned on that journey, but one final mini case study. Should Netflix charge for customers to share their accounts with other people, outside of their home, especially?\n\nGibson Biddle (34:59):\nYeah, this one's got a lot of history. Okay, so I sort of told you a bit of the story, which is Netflix's growth has been excellent until now, and the reason they had that challenging earnings call is, it was just really hard to forecast. They had the influx of customers at the beginning of COVID, I call them fence sitters, that just happened to join en masse. And then, are they going to leave when COVID lifts? Are they going to leave when the theaters open up again? They shut down, for 700,000 Russian members, they shut off the service. You can imagine that in Eastern and central Europe, churn was a little higher than expected. Just nasty.\n\nGibson Biddle (35:38):\nOne of the things that this cloud of COVID forecasting did, obscured how the large extent to which sharing happens. And so, what they said was, in the US and Canada, there's a hundred million customers total. They think there's about 30 million folks that are sharing their email password outside the home.\n\nGibson Biddle (35:57):\nSo, how did Netflix get here? Netflix generally, they've got three prices, $10, $15 and $20 bucks, and they're always trying to give people reason for choosing the $20 one. And so, if you looked at their, I call it the price and plan page, it looks like a gas pump. Do you want to the left one, the middle one, or the right hand one? One of the incentives that they provided for folks to choose the $20 a month was the number of multiple streams. They had gone all the way to four streams at the same time. So in my household, four people could be watching the same time.\n\nGibson Biddle (36:27):\nAnd of course people shared outside the house, right? And by the way, I don't think Netflix was clear that you couldn't. So now, if you look at the price and plan page today, they're not sort of pitching for multiple streams as the reason you should go to $20 bucks. They're pitching other things. There's better resolution. That's the key one. Better sound quality. You're going to have HDR sound and video. And then, they did clarify in the fine print that you can use one, two, or four streams for members in your household.\n\nGibson Biddle (37:00):\nAnd that was a new clarification, because it used to be kind of with a family. Kelsey and Brit are my daughters. They're in the house, of course they can use it. They go off to college, they're still my daughters, they're part of the family. Of course they can use it. Kelsey gets married. Okay, so this is the first time they clarified it.\n\nGibson Biddle (37:14):\nSo now, I come all the way back to your question. As a potential growth opportunity, they'd obviously like to clarify how this should work, and they started testing in three different countries. Peru is one, and I think in the Caribbean. These smaller countries, I'm sure they're focused with new members to figure this out first. And so, they have two different things. You could let a person outside your household, you could actually pay a little extra for them as the primary, as the sponsor, if you will. And the other is a function where a person who's sharing your account in a different household can bump up to their own membership.\n\nGibson Biddle (37:48):\nSo, this is just complicated. Can I make the DHM model work with this? Well it explains why they did it. They were giving multiple streams because it was a really delightful experience. And Netflix says it in the rules. They were very permissive. I don't really think they worried about this. Was it building hard to copy advantage? Absolutely. More taste profiles, right? And you wouldn't leave because you didn't want to cancel the service to your daughter's and using out on the east coast. And was it building margin? Actually, it was driving people up to the $20 price point, and it was improving churn. You're getting more value out of service, okay?\n\nGibson Biddle (38:21):\nSo now, what do they do? For me, this is just testing and math. Like, honestly, let's try it, Lenny. Well, think about those 30 million folks. If you get an email saying, hey, we've noticed you're enjoying the service on somebody else's nickel, would you like to upgrade to your own plan? What percent of those folks are going to say yes, right? I mean, do you have a guess on that? I don't have a guess and I don't have an answer. But this is the game, right?\n\nLenny (38:47):\nI find with emails, open rates and all these things, it ends up always being really tiny. So I guess, again, probably 5%, maybe 3%.\n\nGibson Biddle (38:54):\nOkay. I think that's a fine guess. I'll just give you a different perspective. This is kind of like a free trial, right? they've been using a free trial. And the free trial conversion at the end of a month was 90% at Netflix, right? 90% enjoyed their first month so much that they continued with the service.\n\nGibson Biddle (39:13):\nSo, I mean, I agree with you, it might be five or 10%. I was just giving you that 90% to get you to imagine, huh, maybe it could be 10%, right? Maybe it could be 20%. This is just speculation. I think they're experimenting in these smaller countries. As we do this, if it were 10%, they'd pick up an additional 3 million in a quarter. I think that's going to help them when their growth is at a standstill.\n\nGibson Biddle (39:36):\nThe other question would be, would the primary account quit when you tell them their daughters on the east coast can no longer use the service, right?\n\nLenny (39:45):\nRight.\n\nGibson Biddle (39:46):\nI think where I'm going on this is, I don't know if we can give any real insight. The team at Netflix, this is what they live for, and the team at Netflix is testing and experimenting. They've probably put in an assumption like yours, 5% will convert, and now they're seeing if they're right or wrong, and they're figuring it in on these smaller countries, and a year or two from now, they will have worked it all out and we'll see the answer in North America. But I think it's going to take them a year or two to figure this out, because it's really hard. But they're keenly motivated, because they're trying to get the growth going again.\n\nLenny (40:17):\nI was trying to watch Super Pumped on Showtime recently, and Showtime wasn't working, and I have to call my dad, because I'm leaching off their cable login account. And turned out that they moved and they changed their cable plan, and I'm probably the reason they're keeping a lot of it.\n\nGibson Biddle (40:32):\nWell, so, Lenny, I was thinking about it. I'm open. I don't know the answer on this one, but just you and me comparing notes, what do you think? This is the kind of behavior that I love all product leaders to engage in. I call it building your personal board of directors. You're on mine, because I've been learning a lot about newsletters from you, right? Super helpful.\n\nGibson Biddle (40:51):\nBut when I would have questions like these, I would reach out to my pals, like, okay, what's the right level of investment on a mobile app versus desktop? That was a moving target for years. And I would just text my pals, and they would just give me the data. That's amazing insight, just by having peers in the business that you talk to, which this is the behavior that I want everybody out there engaged in. I call it building your personal board of directors.\n\nLenny (41:14):\nI'd love to hear a little bit more on that, actually. How do people do that? Is it pick a few people on a topic and have them as your standing board?\n\nGibson Biddle (41:21):\nI didn't even know I was doing this. This concept began for me, I was probably 30-ish. 30, yep. I got promoted to VP and I asked my CEO, \"How do I learn how to do the job well?\" And he said, \"I don't know. Reach out and build your community of peers.\" Like, oh, that was good advice. It really was.\n\nGibson Biddle (41:39):\nSo, at any moment in time... You actually had one of my board members on a podcast, Melissa Perri. She's on my board, right?\n\nLenny (41:46):\nAmazing.\n\nGibson Biddle (41:46):\nYeah, you voted for her. So, short answer is, it's really easy to build your community of peers. Just keep up your former colleagues. Keep up on LinkedIn. The harder part is building the mentors. And the first rule of thumb is, don't ask a person to be your mentor. That's really awkward. First, identify them. Say, this is a person I think that could be helpful to me. And then, find ways to be helpful. Everybody needs help. Everybody, everybody, everybody.\n\nGibson Biddle (42:13):\nSo, to help you understand the kind of help I need, my greatest fear is aging ungracefully, right? So I'm trying to understand what's going on. Okay, I asked you earlier, should I be on Discord, right? Like, oh, crap, do I have to be on Discord? But in many cases, somebody can help me to understand Discord. That's super helpful to me. And that's how those sort of mentor relationships eventually end up, and between the peers and the mentors, the mentors can help you to see around corners.\n\nGibson Biddle (42:43):\nActually, my favorite story of somebody who did approach me, they were in data, they wanted to be in product. They kept asking me, \"Hey, do you have any startups I can work with on the weekends?\" That's a good idea. I didn't have any answers. I got sort of frustrated with them. I said, \"Just build me a website, a baby website.\" He said, \"I can't build a website.\" So I gave him my credit card and said, \"Get on Squarespace.\" If you go to GibsonBiddle.com, that's my baby website that John Lou built for me. That was incredibly helpful to me. Someday I should get a real one, but I've decided it's not that important.\n\nLenny (43:13):\nI also have a baby website on Squarespace.\n\nGibson Biddle (43:15):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (43:16):\nWe're in good company.\n\nGibson Biddle (43:17):\nAnyways, that's the concept of a personal board of directors. It's really important and helpful career advice in the long term.\n\nLenny (43:23):\nAwesome. I'm glad we chatted about that. That wasn't something we planned to chat About. Something else I wanted to dive into, beyond strategy, is prioritization. You have a really great model for our prioritization called the JAM model, that I share often with folks. I'd love to just kind of hear your overview of this model, and when it makes sense, and just roughly how to use it.\n\nGibson Biddle (43:39):\nYeah, well, it's a lot easier because it spells something, right? As opposed to saying... I'll just give you a good case. I joined Chegg 2010. We were inventing a concept of renting textbooks to students instead of buying them, saving them a lot of money. And my first week was challenging, because on one end of the hall, the CEO, Dan, was saying, \"Grow, baby. Grow. The most important thing we can do as a startup is grow.\" And at the other end of the hall, I had my CFO partner, Greg, saying, \"Slow, slow, slow. We actually don't know if we have a business model that works.\" And I could tell he was sort of, the company's got like 40 people, sort of driving folks crazy.\n\nGibson Biddle (44:15):\nSo, as the product leader, what the heck should I do? And the answer was, I got them in a room and I said, \"Listen, I just need you to force rank these three factors for me: growth, engagement, and monetization. And I need the two of you to agree.\" So, you could say growth is most important. When we say growth, it's basically year over year customer growth. Do you want it to be 50% or 10%?\n\nGibson Biddle (44:40):\nWhatever the answer is, engagement is how I think about product quality. A more engaging product is a better product. So if you think investing in building a better product is super important, then you go with engagement, and the proxy metric that I use for that at Netflix was retention. And then, the third is monetization. You have these customers, you have this product, and how much effort do you put into turning that into a business?\n\nGibson Biddle (45:04):\nSo, Dan said, \"Well, that's easy. Growth, engagement, and monetization.\" And Greg said, \"Yeah, that's easy. Monetization, engagement and growth.\" He did the flip, right? I'm like, \"I'm going to come back in two hours. You guys got to fight this out.\" Which is sort of what happened.\n\nGibson Biddle (45:19):\nSo, they agreed on growth first, engagement second, monetization third. And then, a couple months later, it started to happen again. Greg started to say, \"No, no, no.\" And so, it was that point that Greg actually left the company. Which was, these are the kinds of fundamental misalignments that can wreck startups. I'm not saying that one or the other was right or wrong, but as leaders in the organization, we've got to get some of the basic stories straight, including how do we fundamentally prioritize growth versus engagement versus monetization?\n\nGibson Biddle (45:56):\nThis is really the number one source of misalignment that I discover among startups. And startups, you're always flipping back and forth between growth and engagement. Grow faster, build a better product. Grow fact forth, and then later, you get a little later to monetization. But this model, I find it super helpful to get leaders across an organization fundamentally more aligned.\n\nLenny (46:17):\nSo, if you're a PM, or maybe a founder, thinking about using this model, would the first step be get your leaders above you to kind of align with you on, of these three things, here's how we stack rank it?\n\nGibson Biddle (46:27):\nPersonally, I'd start with a SWAG. I would take a shot, a stupid, wild-ass guess of what I think is right, so at least I started with a point of view before I shared it with my team. And frankly, the next most important thing that happens is, if you're trying to create a metric focused organization that appreciates data and learning through numbers, deciding, I mean, the hardest one is, what is your engagement metric? How do you measure product quality?\n\nGibson Biddle (46:52):\nAt Netflix, it's monthly retention, but that's a hard conversation. The growth story's pretty, like, it's usually some percentage year over year of customer growth. I mean, but it's always different, but the only variation on what you said was, have a point of view yourself, and then get everybody's feedback.\n\nGibson Biddle (47:07):\nThat's frankly, when I would join a new company, I would give myself two weeks to develop the product strategy for that company, which is a little outrageous, but I would just do it fast. I would develop the SWAG, but then I'd go to one person. \"Hey, this is my best thinking, what do you think?\" And of course, they had been there for four years. They were much smarter than I, and they would refine my thinking.\n\nGibson Biddle (47:25):\nI'd do that one by one, and then maybe six weeks later, I could share a product strategy across the company. But this is the value of a SWAG, which is a stupid, wild-ass guess. And don't be afraid to start at that level.\n\nLenny (47:36):\nI really like that strategy, versus going in a little hole, spending months just thinking about the perfect answer, and only then presenting. I find this works better.\n\nGibson Biddle (47:44):\nWe're hiring a consulting company to do it. Go shoot me, okay?\n\nLenny (47:47):\nI like that you're hiding your mouth as you say that.\n\nGibson Biddle (47:50):\nYeah. Only Lenny can see. Yeah, but this is a podcast, Gib. Nobody can see you.\n\nLenny (47:54):\nYeah. I will reveal. Okay, so on that topic actually, I'd love to transition and talk about our last topic, which is around career, or product manager. So, you're the CPO at two very successful companies, or maybe you're called the VP of product, but roughly a head of product. You have these two muckety mucks, right? Chief Muckety Muck. And in theory, this is kind of the end state of a PM career if you stay along the path. A lot of PMs go on different paths, but in theory, this is kind of where your career is heading. What would you say it takes to become a CPO someday? What kind of skills do you think you need to build that are maybe not obvious to someone that's not in that role yet?\n\nGibson Biddle (48:28):\nYeah, let's take a little step by step. Individual contributor, and then to manager. When you're just starting, you're just trying to learn the job. And I'd say, at a high level, you're just trying to optimize for learning in your entire career. But for individuals, building products is hard, and there's a number of technical skills that are required. So yes, some technical, but a lot of creative skills. There's some consumer science, that's the A/B testing. There's the management. How do you get people working together to actually build stuff? These are technical design skills, right? These are the technical skills.\n\nGibson Biddle (48:59):\nSo, early in your career, you're just trying to learn the job. And by the way, the job is hard. And second, it's different from every company to company in different stage. So you, Lenny and I, we're just trying to be helpful in a leveraged way. But the key thing is, the job's a little different in everything. So, just try to become expert in your area, expert in whatever your one thing is that you're building.\n\nGibson Biddle (49:19):\nAnd then, the next step to become a manager is, there's a lot of, communication is sort of the heart, and that's why I try to... Product strategy is a great way to communicate what's important and what's not, try to demystify it. If you're early in your career, ask if you could be on interview teams, even if you're not hiring, because then you're starting to practice something that's really important as you want to grow your career later, which is it's really hiring and recruiting people.\n\nGibson Biddle (49:45):\nWhen I was in the thick of that, I spent one to two days a week hiring and recruiting. It's really the most important thing. And then, some amazing opportunity would come along at the company and they'd say, you know what? Maybe somebody on Gib's team should do it, right? Because they knew I could replace people. There's always somebody new to pop in. So, I really was expert in hiring and recruiting later in your career.\n\nGibson Biddle (50:07):\nIf you want to be a muckety muck, my theory is the skills of a leader are the same, whether you're head of product, or the chief financial officer, or head of data. When I'm interviewing any of those kinds of candidates, I am looking for leadership skills. Can they do inspired communication of a vision? I do look for product strategy skills. That helps you to frame what that vision is. I do look for management skills. Have they built and managed teams?\n\nGibson Biddle (50:38):\nI look for people who are proactive, results oriented. For me, leaders lead. You can't be a follower. So, I look for really proactive, results oriented folks. And this is pretty nuanced, but later in career, I look for folks who understand how important culture is, because culture helps people to understand the skills and behaviors that are wanted of everyone within the building, and they let you provide leadership in a highly leveraged way, instead of using evil processes and meetings and rules. I look for people who appreciate culture as a tool to help lead organizations.\n\nGibson Biddle (51:18):\nAnd then, of course, they had to grow up as a builder. They had to learn all those damn technical skills for product manager. If I abstract outside of all that, honestly, the thing that I probably did best, I think maybe I did three things best. To know me, I was an English major. I'm non-technical, and I didn't care. First I was in marketing, and then I went into product, which I just loved.\n\nGibson Biddle (51:37):\nI think I did a good job with sort of optimizing for learning. Actually, one of my hacks was, I started doing talks. I used to call it Topic This and That, on Friday mornings, about something I had just learned. That was the easiest way for me to learn something. So, optimized for learning.\n\nGibson Biddle (51:50):\nWe talked about building a personal board of directors, and that has been incredibly helpful for me, and that probably gets to the third thing. I was a pretty good picker, and the reason I was a good picker of companies is, I would lean on my personal board of directors. Some of them were CFOs. I'm like, \"Hey, Barry, I'm thinking about joining this startup, Chegg.\" Hey, as a CFO, as a VC, would you invest in it, right? It's the same question I have to ask, should I invest my time?\n\nGibson Biddle (52:16):\nSo, I had people like that who helped me to isolate, was Electronic Arts a good company to join in 1991? Yes. Was Netflix a good company join in 2005? Yes. Was Chegg a good company to join in 2010? Yes. So, I was fundamentally a good picker, and I would really give a lot of credit to that personal board of directors that I had for that.\n\nLenny (52:36):\nWhat about just day to day as a PM, what have you found to be really good habits, and kind of like a routine that PMs follow, that you've seen to kind of contribute to the success of an ICPM, especially?\n\nGibson Biddle (52:49):\nMy short answer is, begin your day with intent, okay? What are the three to five things I'm hoping to do today? Second, minimize meetings, okay? Minimize meetings. That sucks the life out of everybody, including you.\n\nGibson Biddle (53:03):\nSpend a lot of time with your customers. It could be focus groups, it could be usability, it could be looking at survey data, it could be digging the dirt to understand their behavior to the data, and it could be designing and executing A/B test results. Those are all ways of becoming the voice of your customer, and that's a big part of your job as a product leader.\n\nGibson Biddle (53:24):\nFind a balance between doing and thinking. Most of us do, do, do. Occasionally stop and ask yourself, okay, what's important here? What should I really be doing right now, as opposed to the things that I enjoy doing? Self-managing yourself. The only reason people need managers is that we need someone to force us to do the things that are important that we don't enjoy doing. So, I'm always self-managing myself. Gib, you have to do an invoice. Crap, I've got to bill people. That's no fun, right?\n\nLenny (53:56):\nThat inside voice, inside Gib.\n\nGibson Biddle (53:57):\nYeah, that invoice voice. Yeah, our in-voice. Gib, you should write a damn book.\n\nLenny (54:02):\nOr not.\n\nGibson Biddle (54:02):\nWe're ignoring that inside voice. Yeah, you and me both. And then, I don't know, for me, exercise is awesome for me. It keeps me happy. And don't watch too much TV, and I watch too much TV. So, there you go. And don't do what I do. Do what I say.\n\nLenny (54:17):\nRight. Yeah. I also probably watch too much TV. Funny coming from someone that helped build Netflix, but I totally get it. So, too good. It's too good.\n\nGibson Biddle (54:25):\nWell, my wife's trying to cure cancer. She's like, \"Oh, congratulations, Gib. You helped invent binge watching, you idiot. What good are you doing for humanity?\"\n\nLenny (54:34):\nOh, man. Brings us delight, and that's valuable.\n\nGibson Biddle (54:37):\nYeah, yeah. Thank you very much.\n\nLenny (54:39):\nFinal question. You've had this illustrious career. What's one piece of advice that you'd give a PM in the beginning stages of their career, and then maybe as a bonus, I want maybe mid stage. What comes to mind?\n\nGibson Biddle (54:50):\nYeah, I think I did the early stuff. Pick the right company. At some point, understand that you are responsible for your career, not your workplace. And that's one of the reasons I encourage people to start building that personal board of directors, so you can compare notes. The other thing I say is, don't listen to your parents, because they're a generation ahead. They really don't know what the future looks like. I mean, I know I would give bad advice to my daughter, and so don't listen to your parents.\n\nGibson Biddle (55:16):\nAnd then later, ever since I stopped direct deposit, I think of myself as just purely career hacking. So in your career, it's just a lot like building a product. You have theories and hypotheses, you find ways to experiment with them, and then you were successful or you failed. So one of my hypothesis, whenever it was, six years ago, was I would enjoy teaching. I actually tried it. I taught at Stanford, entrepreneurship for graduate level engineers, and I really liked it, but I didn't love it, largely because I was required to be in Palo Alto every fall. I couldn't travel as much as I like to, right?\n\nGibson Biddle (55:52):\nOkay, so on one hand, okay, don't teach in the classroom, and my next vector was, what if I teach outside the classroom? That's what I really love to do. I do talks, workshops, all around the world in the last two years, virtually. I just love doing that, and I have a ton of flexibility. So, that's just a little example of me treating my career like, what's my hypothesis? Finding where to experiment with, and then, based on the results, do the next thing. And I've really been doing that my entire career,\n\nGibson Biddle (56:16):\nSo, if you embrace this idea of experimentation, you're like a product, you need to have hypothesis, you need to try see what works. The next thing you need to do in building a product or building your career is be bold. So, don't wimp out. At some point, when I'm working with different companies, they all kind of get attracted to the small, incremental wins, and they sort of forgot what made them a successful startup in the beginning, which is taking on fundamental risk. And so, I just nicely encourage people to be bold, to go a little bit out of your comfort zone, because that's where you learn more, and that comes back to this idea of optimizing for learning.\n\nGibson Biddle (56:52):\nAnyways, and how do you encourage people to be bold? How do you encourage them to try new things? And the simple thing is, just start. Try it tomorrow. For me, the baby step was when I, on talks, I would just ask my friends if I could drop by and do a talk. I just did it. I didn't overthink it. I didn't spend 97 years setting up my display and getting the right clicker. I just gave a really bad talk. But that's how I started, and then I sort of optimized from there.\n\nLenny (57:21):\nWhat a perfect way to end our chat. Really inspiring and helpful advice that I'm going to try to re-listen to and use myself. Just to close, where can folks find you, reach out to you, and then also just, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nGibson Biddle (57:33):\nThat's a great question. Thank you. The first, I would say that Lenny has been a mentor for me in \"Ask Gib\" Product Newsletter. So, I reached out to him via a Twitter and asked him lots of stupid early questions, so he was incredibly helpful. So, probably the most important thing is to know that I write a newsletter every two weeks. That's the cadence I'm on now. Lenny knew me at the beginning when I was doing dailies. He's like, \"Dude, don't burn out.\" It's called Ask Gib. I've answered like 63 questions so far. I really have enjoyed it.\n\nGibson Biddle (58:04):\nSecond thing would be my baby website GibsonBiddle.com. I have the advantage of being the only Gibson Biddle on the internet. I'm sure you're the only Lenny, but nobody can spell your last name, right?\n\nGibson Biddle (58:15):\nYeah, and then the third, how can people be useful? I'm a feedback freak, so you'll notice at the end of every talk I do, every essay, whether you find me on Medium, or Ask Gib, wherever, there's a link to give me feedback. And it's always the same question: On a scale of zero to 10, where zero sucks, 10 is excellent, how likely would you be to recommend this to a friend?\n\nGibson Biddle (58:38):\nThat has been incredibly helpful to me, and that's how I've learned to slowly get better at everything I do. The insight I get each day from folks is amazing. And I'll ask one follow up: but what'd you like, and what could be better? And it's just been incredibly helpful. So, don't ignore that link at the end. Don't treat it like United Airlines asking how is your flight? This is important, damn it! And your feedback is incredibly helpful to me, so thank you.\n\nLenny (59:04):\nI'm going to go answer some of your surveys now. Thank you so much for doing this. I learned a ton, and I really appreciate your time.\n\nGibson Biddle (59:10):\nThat was great fun, Lenny, and thanks a ton for your help with my Ask Gib newsletter, as well.\n\nLenny (59:15):\nForever and Ever.\n\nGibson Biddle (59:16):\nOkay, cool. I'll hold you to that.\n\nLenny (59:19):\nThat was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at LennysPodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode."

  "transcript": "# Scaling Duolingo, embracing failure, and insight into Latin America’s tech scene | Gina Gotthilf\n\n## Transcript\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:00:00):\nCommunication is constantly underrated.\n\n(00:00:02):\nAnd communication isn't about being able to convey a message, it's about being able to convey a message in a way that the listener receives it, and understands it, and remembers it. And that's really hard to do.\n\n(00:00:13):\nOne of the things I've helped employ at Duolingo that I think is still there today, it's definitely not just me, it was an amazing team, is a unique voice. And what that means is not just another language learning app where we give you instructions and you follow directions.\n\n(00:00:25):\nThere is always a quirk, like it's unexpected. The way we talk to you is a little bit funny. It doesn't take ourselves too, seriously and it makes the person receiving this message feel something. Again, it's about how you make people feel. And you feel like either you giggle, or you're like, wait what? They just did what? And using that to your benefit.\n\nLenny (00:00:48):\nToday my guest is Gina Gotthilf. Gina is most known for leading growth and marketing at Duolingo, helping take them from 3 million to over 200 million users, primarily through organic and non-paid growth channels, which we explore in depth.\n\n(00:01:01):\nShe also worked on the Mike Bloomberg presidential campaign, where she oversaw a historic digital ad budget, and she shares learnings from that experience. She also led growth in community for Tumblr in Latin America.\n\n(00:01:12):\nCurrently, she's the co-founder and COO of Latitude, which is a company dedicated to helping build the next generation of iconic tech startups in Latin America. In our wide-ranging conversation, Gina shares a ton of new insights and tactics on how Duolingo grew early on, how they grow today, and most interestingly, what they did to become one of the very rare successful consumer subscription businesses.\n\n(00:01:35):\nWe also talk about how every life and career has an A-side and A B-side. Also, why PR and brand are way underappreciated by most startups. She shares a bunch of stories of failed experiments, and also some of her biggest wins. Also, why Latin America is so interesting right now as a hub for startups and for innovation. Also, there's a bit of philosophy sprinkled in, and a bunch of real talk.\n\n(00:01:58):\nThis was such a fun conversation. Gina is delightful. I am excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Gina God Gotthilf, after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:09):\nYou fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-Day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates, and you're spending your days basically putting out fires.\n\n(00:02:26):\nA better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and road-mapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian.\n\n(00:02:36):\nWith Jira product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place, and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets. Create and share custom product roadmaps with any stakeholder in seconds. And it's all built on Jira, where your engineering team's already working, so true collaboration is finally possible.\n\n(00:02:56):\nGreat products are built by great teams, not just engineers. Sales, support, leadership, even Greg from finance, anyone that you want can contribute ideas, feedback, and insights in Jira Product Discovery for free. No catch. And it's only $10 a month for you.\n\n(00:03:12):\nSay goodbye to your spreadsheets and the never-ending alignment efforts. The old way of doing product management is over. Rediscover what's possible with Jira Product Discovery. Try it for free at atlassian.com/lenny. That's atlassian.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:29):\nThis episode is brought to you by Hex.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:04:39):\nLenny, I'm so excited to be here. It's been awesome to see how you've built this, and just how far it's gone. Thank you for inviting me.\n\nLenny (00:04:47):\nReally appreciate that. I'm more excited to have you on the podcast. And I know you just came off hosting a massive event somewhere in Latin America, I think you had 5,000-something people. You had Ben Horowitz keynoting.\n\n(00:04:59):\nAnd I wanted to start with the talk you gave. I think you described it as people having this A-side and B-side to their life, kind of like a record as an A-side and B-side. So could you just share what it was this conference? And then two, kind of just briefly share this concept as much as you can\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:05:17):\nFor sure, and thanks for that Lenny.\n\n(00:05:18):\nLook, I think for those of us here in the US, I became an American last year. I love the US. I've been here for 19 years. It's hard to imagine just how much is going on south of the border. There's actually 660 million people living across Latin America, and it's an economy of $6 trillion.\n\n(00:05:36):\nAnd Brazil is a huge market, just in terms of sheer size, over 200 million people. And also in terms of where the ecosystem is. I am Brazilian, so I am Latin American, even though sometimes Brazilians are not sure if they are Latin American because we speak Portuguese.\n\n(00:05:52):\nAnd so the future of the region really matters to me. And helping people get the opportunities that I've had, in terms of access to information and resources that could help them build scalable, very successful startups, can really change the economy across the board. I believe in that much more than I believe in government, and whether we're going to vote this guy or that guy next.\n\n(00:06:14):\nAnd so that's sort of the impetus for the company. The conference was a conference put together by my company. I'm a co-founder. We're three, Brian, Yuri, and I. We put this conference together to bring together the top entrepreneurs, operators and investors across Latin America, but also people who are interested in investing in the region, of which there are more and more here in the US and abroad.\n\n(00:06:34):\nMore than 5,000 people came. We had over 70 speakers. It was across two days. We had amazing people like Ben Horowitz, who never gave a talk, or did a fireside specifically for and about Latin America and the opportunity. But we also had incredible founders who you, in terms of US operators, may not be as familiar with.\n\n(00:06:54):\nBut if you've ever heard of Rappi, it's a really important delivery company in Latin America. So the founder of Rappi flew down from Miami for that. And then we had VCs from a lot of the top names that you've heard here in the region as well. And then a lot of unicorns. We've had a lot of unicorns in the region.\n\n(00:07:09):\nSo they were all there. And the idea was to share learnings along the way, successes and failures, so that people can skip by not making the same mistakes as others. And I was asked to open both days. And then the first day, the opening talk that I ended up giving was this concept that I really like, which is the A-side and the B-side of a story. Which is that if you are old like me, and maybe you Lenny, I think we're similar age, you remember what a CD or what a mixtape was like. And we had the A and the B-side.\n\n(00:07:41):\nWe are very encouraged in our lives, especially professionally, to talk about our A-sides all the time. Because that's what impresses people, that's what opens doors, that's what allows us to keep growing and it's so important. It means that a lot of what you hear in podcasts and on stage ends up being the Instagramable version of someone, or a company, or a country's trajectory. It's just the highlights.\n\n(00:08:06):\nAnd when I talk about my A-side, it's very impressive. I did things like we'll talk about, I met President Obama, I worked on the Mike Bloomberg presidential campaign. I helped Duolingo scale from three to 200 million users. I worked with Tumblr, helping them scale in Latin America. Andreessen Horowitz invested in my company, et cetera.\n\n(00:08:22):\nBut between all of those highlights, there were so many B-moments that get shoved under the rug because it's just easier for me and it's more impressive for others. But I really like to highlight those. Because I think that most of us have a lot of B-moments every day, every week, every month and every period of our lives. And it's easy to think that things aren't just not going to work out for us because we're in one of those B-moments, if we don't recognize them as moments.\n\n(00:08:47):\nAnd the story I ended up telling was how, much I have these A and B-sides that I don't talk about my B-side so much. Latin America also has A and B-sides. Because it's really easy to focus on, it's dangerous, we're behind the governments are a mess. There's financial insecurity.\n\n(00:09:04):\nBut there's a lot of A side in there, and a lot of the A-side is the opportunity we have in terms of tech. Because in terms of percentage of GDP that tech occupies compared to other markets, it's very promising. We're at one third of India, one 10th of China, one 30th of the United States. Meaning that tech companies can grow a lot so that they occupy that space in terms of the GDP, which is believable. So that was the concept of the talk and the reason for this conference.\n\nLenny (00:09:34):\nI love this concept. We're going to talk, as you expected about a lot of your A-side stuff. Is there any example of a B-side story of your life that would be interesting to share?\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:09:44):\nLook, I think those are the most interesting, because they're funny or ridiculous. But I'll just say that I had a lot of B-sides and I still do. For example, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I actually, I thought I wanted to be an actress. I either wanted to be that person in SeaWorld who goes like this with a dolphin, this was before SeaWorld was canceled. Or I wanted to be an actress. But then my parents convinced me that I was probably not going to succeed because the odds weren't in my favor.\n\n(00:10:13):\nI applied to schools. I didn't get into any Ivy League, I didn't get into any of the top schools I wanted to go to. When I got to college, I actually ended up dropping out because I got so depressed, incredibly depressed. Couldn't get out of bed, depressed.\n\n(00:10:26):\nIronically, I dropped out of Reed College, which is the same college that Steve Jobs dropped out of. So I was just destined for greatness. I knew it at that moment.\n\nLenny (00:10:35):\nIt all makes sense looking backwards, as he said.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:10:37):\nTotally. I was dropping out, being like, yes, this is exactly the path. No, I was miserable. I thought there was no path forward.\n\n(00:10:44):\nAnd when I finally went back and graduated, the college counselor looked at my curriculum and said, \"What have you even done with your life? There's nothing to show for.\" And it was shocking. Because I was always the overachiever who wanted to do the maximum curriculum, and ace all of my classes, and do whatever. I did three diplomas in high school, the international, the American, the Brazilian. My one learning there that has stuck with me, and I think can work for other people too, is that it's not just about doing things that actually matter, and learning. It's about being able to tell the story, and it's about understanding what other people perceive as valuable.\n\n(00:11:22):\nI'm not talking about net value. But I'm talking about, if you want to grow in the world, it's understanding that psychology of how humans react to what you're showing them. So that was one lesson.\n\n(00:11:32):\nBut then I went on to, I applied to a hundred companies. I didn't hear back from most of them. I finally got an internship at kind of like a tier B-slash-C digital marketing agency in New York City, because I wanted to live in New York so badly. And they forgot to apply for my visa on time, so I lost my visa and had to go back to Brazil.\n\n(00:11:53):\nAnd then I ended up leaving that organization to go work for another one. And I won't even go into the details of the shadiness of that company that I worked for, but then they ended up laying me off. So I lost my visa again, had to go back home. Found another opportunity, got fired that time. So there was just a lot of rockiness in my start that I don't think you would imagine when you see someone up on stage leading a conference for 5,000 people. That, I think, is important.\n\n(00:12:19):\nAnd even when I started working for Tumblr, I was like, this is it. I made it. This is a really interesting company. This is going to work out. That was super rocky because it was an early stage startup. So for example, they couldn't figure out how to wire money to Brazil. So I was not paid for six months. And at one point me and my colleagues were trying to get money out of the teller to pay contractors, because we had no money to pay them. And we borrowed money from people. And finally they also laid me off because they decided to sell to Yahoo.\n\n(00:12:47):\nAnd then I had to figure out, what am I going to do? No one's going to hire me. I've been fired and laid off so many times. This is all before I started an agency to help US-based tech companies and startups grow in Latin America, because I figured I was in this really great place to make that happen.\n\n(00:13:02):\nAnd it eventually worked for, well-known companies such as Duolingo. At the time, they weren't well known. They were a tiny little startup. They didn't have an Android app. And that's how I started working with Duolingo. Because their head of marketing connected with someone they had worked with at Flickr and said, \"I noticed Tumblr grew a lot in Brazil last year. Can you recommend a company or an agency to help?\" And they said, this girl. And I was 26.\n\n(00:13:26):\nAnd so that's how they connected me with Duolingo, and I started helping them grow in Brazil as a consultant. They were like, this is great. Can you help us grow in Chile, Argentina? And I was like, yes.\n\n(00:13:35):\nThey were like, how about Mexico? And I was like, yes. Did I know anything about these places, Lenny? Did I know people there? No, but you can figure it out.\n\n(00:13:44):\nAnd then they ended up asking me to come on full-time, do that across the world. In Japan, China, Korea, Turkey, Spain, France, et cetera. And then to own growth, which ended up meaning communications, social media, government partnerships, anything to grow.\n\n(00:13:58):\nAnd then eventually became an AB testing growth engine with engineers, and PMs, and designers of which I knew nothing about. And even after that, I left Duolingo five years later, didn't know what to do with my life. You'd think, oh wow, you have it figured out now. You left Duolingo, you have the world in front of you.\n\n(00:14:18):\nAnd I'm like, maybe I can finally go work for nonprofits, which is what I actually wanted to do in the first place. Tried my hand at that, had a couple of experiences before going to work for the Mike Bloomberg campaign.\n\n(00:14:29):\nWorking for the Mike Bloomberg campaign is impressive, but you know what? Mike Bloomberg didn't win. He's not the president. So that was not a successful campaign, if you really look at it. And yeah, latitude seems like it's a really promising path. But there's A days and B days.\n\n(00:14:46):\nSo it's just a lot of that, and just staying resilient, and believing in yourself, and getting back on the horse when you fall on your face.\n\nLenny (00:14:53):\nAmazing. That's such an important message. I think one of the threads from what you're describing, something that I think about a lot, is people kind of underestimate how long their career is. There's just so much time to do stuff, and for things to start to work.\n\n(00:15:05):\nThis is going to sound really fancy, but I think Marcus Aurelius has this quote about how our life is actually very long, we just use it really badly. And we just waste a lot of our time.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:15:14):\nWow. I think you're so right, Lenny and I love that. Because people are going around being like, life is short, life is short. But that's so true. We waste so much time. But also I think we don't recognize how much opportunity we have in front of us. And as a 26-year-old, I definitely thought my career was over. I was like, I blew it. And looking back, it's funny.\n\nLenny (00:15:33):\nYeah, I know exactly what you mean. I spent nine years at my first job, at a random company in San Diego in a startup. And I was like, what am I doing here so long? And it turned out that was really useful for the thing I did next. And then eventually, wow, things started to really take off.\n\n(00:15:48):\nSo I think that's a really good lesson for people, just for a long time. This is my fourth career. I've switched careers many times. I was an engineer, then I was a founder, then I was a product manager. And now I'm whatever this is, whatever you call this thing.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:16:01):\nOkay, cool.\n\nLenny (00:16:03):\nYeah.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:16:03):\nI guess me too. I was an operator. I was a consultant. Well, I was an employee, I was a consultant. Then I was an operator, which is a fancy way to say employee at a startup. And then, now I'm a founder and a VC. And an angel, and whatever this is.\n\nLenny (00:16:20):\nAwesome, awesome. So I think that's a really important takeaway. Just, there's a lot of time to do stuff. And don't stress if things aren't moving as fast as you want.\n\n(00:16:28):\nI want to try to bounce around between A side and B side in this conversation, that'd be a cool framework. And so we're going to definitely talk about Duolingo, and a little bit more about Latin America.\n\n(00:16:36):\nI wanted to touch on this Mike Bloomberg story. So what I understand from your experience there is, you deployed a historic amount of money into paid ads as a part of that campaign. I am just curious what you learned from running paid ads at that scale for a campaign or just broadly.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:16:53):\nSo we deployed historic amounts of money in the campaign. It wasn't me, Gina, personally.\n\nLenny (00:17:02):\nIt wasn't just you spending that money, yeah.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:17:03):\nI think that's important to share. So my Bloomberg presidential campaign was spending roughly a million dollars a day. Which is crazy. And you can do a lot with a million dollars a day.\n\nLenny (00:17:11):\nIt's good to be Google.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:17:12):\nIt's good to be Google. But yes, it's good to be Facebook. I'll share what I think is most useful here, and also what my experience ended up being.\n\n(00:17:22):\nWhich is, they brought together a lot of great talent from across the US, especially in terms of tech. This is an organization called Hawk Fish, that they started working with the Mike Bloomberg. Basically, he created it. I don't know, it was embedded in there.\n\n(00:17:37):\nThere were a lot of us who had large eagles, and had been sharks in our previous organizations, who had to figure out how to come together and work and in a very short amount of time. That was a very interesting experience, because it's hard to do that. It's not just important to be great and smart, but it's also important to understand how to most effectively deploy your resources and talent across an organization.\n\n(00:18:02):\nAnd that sort of takes a little bit of time to happen. And for a presidential campaign, I find that very hard to do, from that one experience. That said, it also meant that when you're looking at the paid ads, and the fact that we were deploying this massive amount of money, there were a lot of cooks in the kitchen when it came to figuring out exactly what we were going to do with those ads.\n\n(00:18:23):\nAnd how we were going to target them, and what are the campaigns we're going to run, and what's the copy, and what's the design? And after maybe a few days there, I realized that my best bet in terms of actually adding value was not to be another cook in the kitchen trying to figure that out, but to move into the next step of the journey, which nobody was paying attention to.\n\n(00:18:45):\nWhich is, once you click on an ad, you land somewhere. And then whatever happens there is super important. Because if people then take the action you want them to take on that landing page, or don't, is definitive. But everyone spends all of their effort and money on the ads. And I think that this is true of almost everything. We forget to think about the step-by-step in growth, and what that experience looks like. And even just the second or third screen in an experience are as, if not more, important than the first one. Because that's where your \"leaky buckets\" can happen.\n\n(00:19:17):\nSo if you're able to 2X the effectiveness of a landing page, you are able to actually, in a compounded way, increase the effectiveness of that first ad. So I spent a lot of time going rogue and figuring out how to make landing pages. Because the designers and the copywriters were all allocated to the actual ad.\n\n(00:19:36):\nSo I was just there being like, I'm going to do copywriting and design, and figure out how we can increase these conversion rates. And the cool thing about that level of dollar deployment is that you're able to reach statistical significance very quickly.\n\n(00:19:50):\nWhereas in a company like Duolingo, where you already have a lot of users and you can reach statistical significance on an AB test within two weeks, at the Mike Bloomberg presidential campaign on a landing page, we could see that three times a day, so four times a day.\n\n(00:20:04):\nSo I would be able to do something and be like, oh wow, this has a 3% conversion rate. And then get approval for a new version and deploy it and then be like, okay, we're at 6% now. And then actually improve. There was one day where I brought one page from three to 12% conversion rate with statistical significance. So that's, I think, the biggest benefit of having those dollar amounts.\n\n(00:20:25):\nI think the drawback, and that's the same for startups that have a lot of money to spend, is you start going a little wild in terms of like, oh, the world's our oyster. We can do whatever we want. And you lose sight a little bit about effectiveness, which is where growth is so magical.\n\nLenny (00:20:40):\nWhat was that change on the landing page you did that increased conversion so much, do you remember?\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:20:44):\nNone of this is going to blow anyone's minds, I think, because it's very best practices. But it's easy to overlook when you're so focused on so many different steps of a process. The first one is making it mobile-optimized.\n\n(00:20:56):\nPeople who are working, are working on their computers, on desktop computers, even today. We forget that most people are looking at pages on our phones. And that has been the case for a while, and I think it's just increasing. So you need to make sure that that experience of looking at something on your phone, whatever your phone is, is great.\n\n(00:21:11):\nAnd what that means is from a landing page perspective, super simple. First, the core copy, the message and button need to be above the fold. Or, if you're not going to keep the button above the fold, which I still recommend, but if you're not going to do that for whatever reason, then you need to have a very clear indicator that there's something to scroll towards on your page.\n\n(00:21:35):\nThe second thing, applies to both desktop and mobile, is people skim. And copywriters don't like to believe that, much like journalists don't like to believe that people just read headlines. It's just how it is. People are busy and lazy, myself included.\n\n(00:21:47):\nSo you can write all of this beautiful messaging that you've thought through, but if people are not going to read it, it doesn't matter. So you have to approach a landing page with that perspective in as much as possible.\n\n(00:21:58):\nAnd so for me, what makes something particularly skimmable is first restricting copy a lot. And even copy that seems short is probably not short enough. Second, so people normally like to have a title, some sort of subtitle, and then an image and a button. Those are kind of core pieces of some sort of landing page experience. Having the title and the button speak to each other is really cool. Because if people only read the title and the button, they got it.\n\n(00:22:24):\nIt can't be like, \"Wouldn't you like the next President of the United States to blah blah blah?\" And then a whole explanation of what. And then the button is like, I don't know, apply. Whatever, right? It's like, apply for what? Now I have to go read the thing and I didn't get it.\n\n(00:22:36):\nSo just keeping those two things super speaking to each other. And then of course, making sure that that landing page speaks to the ad experience. And that's something that I think people do pay some attention to.\n\n(00:22:47):\nFinally, there's an element of emotion to it. Which I didn't get super deep in, but just very basic. My job was to create a landing page that made people ... So it was actually, funnily enough, before Covid hit the US. And then Covid hit the US. Half the people in the campaign got Covid on our sad goodbye Mike Bloomberg party. And I had already bounced, and I left New York. I was scared. I was like, the city's going to be a Petri dish.\n\n(00:23:13):\nAnd I spent months trying to convince the whole United States, as much as I could, that Covid was going to hit the United States. And there were going to be a lot of deaths unless we had a different president. And so I, of course, convinced myself very effectively that we were in grave danger.\n\n(00:23:28):\nAnd so to do that, we had images in the background of different sorts, Mike Bloomberg and whatever. But fear really inspires people, and that's just a truth about human psychology. Especially when it comes to a presidential campaign.\n\n(00:23:43):\nSo having dark colors like black, having Trump in sort of a black scenario, kind of looking down and looking a little menacing is more powerful than having Trump looking ridiculous, for example. In the context of, we need to take action, otherwise there will be deaths because of this.\n\n(00:24:02):\nSo it depends on the concept, but don't underplay the importance of understanding how people are going to feel when they see something, and whether that's going to lead them to take action. Keeping it super, super simple.\n\n(00:24:13):\nBecause also the other thing I see is a lot of images. It is like, no, the image can't distract from your core message. It has to be a background thing that aids in the digestion of that message.\n\nLenny (00:24:22):\nI feel like all these startups are going to start adding Trump, menacing Trump to their landing pages because they worked for you guys.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:24:31):\nWell, they're going to alienate 50% of the American population.\n\nLenny (00:24:34):\nTrue. There's a few other things I wanted to dig into. One is obviously Duolingo, so let's just spend some time here.\n\n(00:24:40):\nSo it's really interesting. With my newsletter, I've written over 200 posts. The number one, most popular post of all time, did not expect this, was about the story of Duolingo. And the way that the team reignited growth after it started to plateau.\n\n(00:24:55):\nThis was by Jorge Mazal.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:24:55):\nMazal.\n\nLenny (00:24:56):\nMazal, okay, cool.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:24:59):\nJorge Mazal, yes.\n\nLenny (00:25:00):\nOkay, there's the right pronunciation. And so...\n\nLenny (00:25:01):\nThere's the right pronunciation. And so clearly, there's a lot of interest in the Duolingo story. And you were there before Jorge. You were there really early. I think you were there from 3 million users to 200 million. That's what I hear you describe it as.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:25:16):\nThat's right. That's my claim to fame.\n\nLenny (00:25:18):\nGreat. That's a large growth trajectory. So one thing I wanted to ask broadly is it feels like B to C subscription apps never work. They never last. There's so few success stories of consumer subscription apps. There's Duolingo there, Calm maybe, but I don't know, it feels like it's slowing down, Headspace, Grammarly. And there's a few that are okay, but most die. I guess I'm mostly curious, what is it that you think Duolingo did right to make it basically and continue to thrive, even these days?\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:25:56):\nVery few people really believed that we were going to make it, not surprisingly. Even though we had this amazing team, et cetera, now it looks almost obvious, it's like B to C language learning just seems so niche. And plus education, there's no money in education. It's been stuck for so long. And what I kept hearing, \"You guys, did you hear about Rosetta Stone? This solution already exists.\" So I think that there are a couple of things that really made Duolingo's success, which are very hard to replicate.\n\n(00:26:25):\nNumber one, an obsession for the mission. That sounds cliche. I think a lot of founders and startup people like to talk about the mission, and I get it, and I think it's real. But I really mean it, because this obsession for solving a problem for hundreds of millions of people, and the problem wasn't just a vitamin. It was a problem in the sense that if you don't know English in today's world, your opportunities to get out of your socioeconomic zone are very diminished. More specifically, you can double or triple your income potential by learning English in a developing market like Latin America. And there are lots of those around the world. That belief that education should be free and that people should have access to that opportunity, not just in developing countries, but of course, also in the US really drove the organization in a way that drove how we built our marketing, how we spoke to our users, how we designed the experience, how we put barriers in front of taking decisions that would actually impact that mission. It helped our users rally around the business. It helped us hire the best people even if we were based in Pittsburgh and couldn't necessarily pay the Google dollars. So it's really hard to measure the importance of just really being obsessed about that mission. But I speak to a lot of education founders, ed tech founders, and I am very biased probably because of this experience. I will say that I had one of those, what's it called, the experiment where they looked at all of the shots that some plane got when it came back from war and then started fixing the plane. There's a name for this. And then they realized that-\n\nLenny (00:28:04):\nI forget the name, but it's the pictures. The pictures are famous with the red dots.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:28:06):\nYou shouldn't fix those spots because if they got back, they survived, they were missing the plane that fell. So I got to ride in a plane that survived. So I have, oh, it's called survivor bias, maybe?\n\nLenny (00:28:18):\nThat sounds right.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:28:19):\nI have survivor bias, but I really believe in this-\n\nLenny (00:28:19):\nSurvivorship bias.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:28:22):\nSurvivorship bias. So if I speak to a founder and I can tell that they're building an ed tech because they believe that they will be able to make money from it, there's nothing wrong with making money, nothing. I want to make money. I think it's a capitalist world that we live in, and it's fine, but just that drive is what brings people to you, and it's what leads you to make long-term thinking decisions that really end up mattering. And it's what allowed us in many ways to grow organically versus with paid ads, which I think is crucial for an early stage tech startup. It's not the only thing, but I think it's one of them that's super important.\n\nLenny (00:28:59):\nJust to follow that thread, that's something that I actually found. I wrote a post about this looking into of the ones that made it, what did they do consistently across them all? And one is just stay very lean and scrappy for a long time. Because to your point, it's so hard to build a big business, and you can't afford, like you said, the best people, you can't pay them as much as everyone else. So essentially it's just a long time of just being very lean and scrappy. That was the most consistent pattern across all these B to C subscription apps.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:29:27):\nAgree. And that's number two. When I was hired by Duolingo as a consultant and as an employee, my mandate was make Duolingo grow. Here is no budget. I had no budget. And people are shocked. They're like, \"Oh, but when did you turn on the ads?\" We're like, \"We just didn't.\" Because I know this is between you and me, Lenny, I actually am quite bad at paid ads. It's just not a muscle that I ever developed.\n\nLenny (00:29:48):\nWe won't tell anyone.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:29:49):\nI'm only good at ... huh?\n\nLenny (00:29:51):\nWe won't tell anyone.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:29:54):\nPlease keep this a secret. I think I could develop that muscle if one day I need it, but I'm particularly good at thinking about organic growth because I've had to, because that's what Tumblr and Duolingo required of me. And the logic behind it was, listen, with Duolingo, we started monetizing the platform very late, and it was a luxury because we had so much venture capital money to sustain us for a while. But we had some bets that we made in the early days that we thought were going to help really sustain the company, like translations that didn't end up panning out. And then the Duolingo English test that we started developing really early with Burr Settles, an amazing guy who basically was developing this test, we realized that was going to be super long-term. We didn't start really charging for subscriptions or having ads until, I don't know exactly, but something like year three.\n\n(00:30:47):\nSo we didn't have an LTV, which meant that having a CAC made no sense. So that's number one. You need that CAC-to-LTV ratio that everyone talks about. That's an important thing. But it's more than that. First, I think there's the CAC-to-LTV ratio thing. The second thing is that even if you have a low CAC, I was just talking to an entrepreneur this morning, he was like, \"Oh, we were able to hit a 10-cent CAC.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, but that grows.\" As you start targeting more people, the low hanging fruit dry out, and you end up having to pay more money. And then once you have those users coming in because of those paid ads, you can't cut it off because you still need that growth, because you're trying to prove to your investors that you're growing, or you need those users in order to continue AB testing or whatever. Then you become completely dependent, and it's really hard to turn it off. So it's almost like an addiction, that as much as you're able to limit in the beginning, the better.\n\n(00:31:38):\nAnd the third thing is that I really believe that ... I don't believe. I think we all know at this point that the most important thing for the growth of anything tech, maybe in general, is retention. Of course, you need acquisition, but retention is important. And I simplify it a little bit because retention, I don't think of it in terms of like, wow, I must retain this user. It's like, is this thing valuable or not? That's what retention is to me. Either it's actually providing real value or it's not. If it's providing real value, people stick around. It's as simple as that.\n\n(00:32:11):\nAnd if you don't force yourself to pay attention to retention and finding the users to whom this is the most useful really early on, you risk convincing yourself of metrics and glossing over some of this other important stuff, which means that even if you succeed at acquisition, you're just not going to succeed long-term because those users fall through. And you won't really understand why because you were building retention based on acquired users that weren't the ones who weren't necessarily going to ... And I don't mean to say that I don't believe in paid at all. I think paid has its value, I think especially when it comes to testing. Sometimes you don't have as many users as you need to run statistically significant tests. But with paid users you could, or you could just use paid ads to understand messaging and images and even value prop. On a landing page, that's super valuable. Or you find an amazing niche, and you know exactly who your target users are, and you figure out a way that makes sense. But then again, I would argue that if you found your perfect user and where they are, you should go figure out a way to get them organically, because if you can really provide them value, they would come and they would stay.\n\nLenny (00:33:16):\nSo far I've heard be really focused around a mission and be very clear about what you're trying to achieve. Two is just very low spend, essentially don't expect to grow this into venture scale business. Focus on a sustainable profitable business for as long as you can and constrain your spend basically. And then third is this focus on retention, which I think is a really important point. And this is true for any app you're building, but I think especially true for consumer business where people are just like, \"Nah, this is cool. Okay, what's next? Okay, let's check out Snapchat.\"\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:33:47):\nTotally. And I was going to have a different three, but I think it's related, so maybe we can add it as three B or four.\n\nLenny (00:33:54):\nThree B. Let's do it.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:33:56):\nAn obsession for the product. Again, sounds obvious but isn't. When we look back to products that existed before the internet, before the app store, you built this thing, you made it, and then you tried to convince people to buy it. That was it. So look, I made a chair, this is a beautiful chair. And then you spend all this money trying to get it out into the world, and people buy the chair. And you hire all these salespeople, and you hire an amazing marketing agency, and you try to sell the chair. It's no longer at all that because products are constantly in motion and evolving. And unless you're able to own that data and understand what it can tell you, you're never going to win.\n\n(00:34:33):\nSo I hear a lot of people come to me and say, \"Gina, Gina, we built Duolingo for this.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, cool.\" And then they show it to me, and it looks exactly like Duolingo. And I'm like, \"Okay, cool.\" And then I'm like, \"How did you get to this design?\" They're like, \"Oh yeah, we used Duolingo.\" So I'm like, \"Great.\" But then as I started talking to them, I understand they don't have the engineers and PMs there looking at Mixpanel or whatever it is that they're using every day, understanding how every single change is leading to other changes that enables them to ask the questions and come up with the hypotheses that allow them to get to the next step. So it's almost like they just copy-pasted something.\n\n(00:35:09):\nYou know how I think of that? It's like those students who are able to copy the best student's answer on the math test, and then they get frustrated that they didn't get an A because the work wasn't there, but they copied the answer. But if you don't know how to do the work, you get another math question and you're not going to get it right. And so that I think still misses, and I would venture to say most early stage tech startups out there. It's certainly the case in Latin America, where people think they can outsource the code or outsource the growth, and they're not just looking like hawks at the quality of the data and statistical significance and running hypotheses and questioning them. And that rigor is a culture at Duolingo that was there from day one before me and continues to be there today.\n\nLenny (00:35:58):\nAmazing. So I think if a listener is trying to build a subscription consumer app, I would suggest just rewind and listen to that again. I think there's so much gold there. And in my experience, I get a lot of decks because I do a bunch of angel investing. I just discount consumer subscription apps because they never work, except when they do once in a while. And so my advice is if you're building something in this space, just listen to exactly what you just said. There's a lot of important stuff, and actually internalize it. Stay really lean, stay really focused, obsessed with retention, obsessed with making sure the product is solving the problem you're going after.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:36:33):\nI'm so glad that you agree, Lenny. I really admire you. So it makes me very happy.\n\nLenny (00:36:37):\nWell, we're both happy then. I wanted to switch to the B side, and I'm curious, what's a mess-up or a big mistake maybe that you made or your team made that was like, \"Oh, wow, that was a big waste of time?\"\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:36:50):\nLook, a lot of things didn't work out. More than 50% of our AB tests didn't work out. We made bets that didn't make sense. I will say, though, that in the spirit of A and B sides, I, and think in general, we are really good at forgetting the B stuff. I talk so much about all the stuff that worked that it's hard to remember all of those moments that didn't actually work. And the thing that I tend to talk about, which is this mistake that we made as the growth team, is almost like one of those, when you get asked in an interview, \"What's your biggest weakness?\" And you're like, \"I'm a perfectionist.\" It's one of those things that actually makes you sound good because it's the story about how my team really wanted to implement badges. We spent a lot of time playing all the games that were popular at the time, trying to understand how those gamification growth hacks that we could find in those apps would potentially overlay onto Duolingo and how we would do that.\n\n(00:37:48):\nAnd badges was just pervasive in all of the top games. And so it seemed like a no-brainer. But since we ranked all of our experiments in terms of ROI and return being how many users we think we're going to get from this, DAUs and time investments, it never made sense to focus on this, because we thought that the time sink would be too high. So I actually ended up not letting the team run this experiment for six months so that we focus on lower hanging fruit. So that's a mistake on my end. Then we decided to run this experiment in the most lean way possible. We're like, \"You know what? There's MVPs, there's minimum viable experiments. We don't have to run a whole badges thing. We can just do something more simple and actually see if that leads to growth in an interesting way, and then we'll know.\"\n\n(00:38:32):\nAnd we ran this very simple experiment that was like, \"You sign up and then you get a badge.\" And it was like this girl with a balloon, I don't know, she was happy or whatever. And of course, in retrospect, it led to no results, because no one is proud of signing up. It's not an exciting moment, and you don't even have badges to collect. You can't show it to other people. None of the things that make badges compelling were there, but we were like, \"Well, we does it. It didn't work.\" And then we moved on. So we moved on for another, I don't know, eight months, and we didn't look back. And then when we did look back, first of all, at that point, we discovered that we hadn't been dogfooding, which also was embarrassing.\n\n(00:39:06):\nLooking back, we hadn't been dogfooding in the growth team. We'd just come up with hypotheses. We were super careful about prioritizing them and making sure that we were doing the best possible write-ups and all these things. But the dogfooding piece just, I didn't come from a product background. I was a marketer, and I didn't really understand the term dogfooding. But when we had a conversation, we were like, \"You know what? If we had just tested that, we would have all known that this was a super lame badge.\" And I was like, \"Why are we not testing our experiments?\" And so that became part of our practice.\n\n(00:39:38):\nIt's still relevant. I just had a conversation yesterday with engineers at Latitude. I haven't explained what we're building yet. Maybe we'll get there. But I was talking yesterday to engineers at Latitude, and they're awesome. In terms of product team, we have have the number eight employee at NewBank. You might have heard of NewBank, but it's this massive banking fin tech in Latin America, and we have people from other fin techs, and then we have this guy who's a lead PM at Twilio, and I was explaining to them why we should be dogfooding. And they were all like, \"Oh yeah, we should dogfood.\" It's just easy to forget stuff like that.\n\n(00:40:10):\nSo that was a mistake that we could have probably gotten to the growth that we got to with badges much earlier on. And not only did we get to growth with badges, but it became this amazing treasure trove of opportunity. Because once you have badges and people want them, you can now ask people to do anything like go find friends, go buy things, whatever it is. And so we impacted almost all metrics across the company positively, including some we hadn't expected, but it's easy to talk about a mistake that ended up being a win. So that's why I compared it to the interview thing in the beginning. But we tried making Duolingo a social app really early on and failed. It was called Duels, DuoDuels. You could duel.\n\nLenny (00:40:55):\nVery clever.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:40:56):\nI know. We were clever, but people didn't use it, and we didn't figure out why. We tried making a Duolingo for Schools platform. We couldn't get it to pick up. I went and launched Duolingo in China, and it got downloaded by a million people in the first day, and then the app got blocked because of the government, and then we couldn't figure out what to do. And then everyone rated the app one star because it didn't work, and so then we had a lot of trouble actually recovering from that. We launched Duolingo in India and didn't realize because we couldn't have unless we went there, which we finally did, that most people set their phone UI in India to English, because typing in Hindi is hard, and of course there's a lot of languages throughout India. And we were making it so that when you downloaded Duolingo, whatever UI your phone was set to, we offered not that language for you to learn. That was your base language.\n\n(00:41:48):\nSo we were telling people learn French, Spanish, German from English, and they were all trying to learn English, so they didn't find what they were looking for and they left. There were so many mistakes, and luckily I think we were able to bounce back from most of them in terms of how Duolingo is doing today.\n\nLenny (00:42:05):\nMan, there's so much there. That was awesome. I like that you're like, \"Oh, I don't remember any of my failures.\" And then like, \"Oh, here's all these awesome stories.\" That was great. Just one thread there that comes up again and again in this podcast is the dogfooding piece, especially I think people don't trust their gut and personal instinct enough. I think a lot of times PMs are just like, \"I need to do user research to understand what we should be doing.\" Versus just use the thing, see what feels wrong and keeps you from being excited and really trust that. I find that more and more. I don't know. When I read a thing and when I'm writing, I'm just like, \"Oh, I don't like that. I should change that. I don't need to run this by three people.\" So I think that's a really good lesson there. Just don't underestimate the power of you just using it and relying on instincts and feelings you have when you're trying to use it.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:42:50):\nTotally. And that's so hard to do, especially when you're young. And I think I'll add that, especially when you're female as well, or maybe other minorities. It's just really hard to trust your instinct because you're constantly telling yourself, do I really know anything or am I just being lucky? But you have to, and I think that forcing yourself to pretend that you know answers and just finding out what this pretend person who would know all the answers would think is really helpful because it helps you develop your point of view, your voice, and to trust yourself, even when you're working on something that you don't fully understand.\n\n(00:43:22):\nAs in we're building a banking platform at Latitude, I was looking at it, and they were having trouble understanding why people were having problems with wires. And I told them all about how I'm an idiot when it comes to wires, and I make these mistakes A, B, C, because I don't match the line. It's like, whatever. There's all this information you're supposed to input, and sometimes the information you get is not in the same order. And they're like, \"Wow.\" And I'm like, \"This is just me as a user making dumb mistakes.\" But that is our forte. When you're able to understand that when you don't get something, probably other people don't get it too at scale.\n\nLenny (00:43:56):\nAbsolutely. It's like if you're thinking about asking a question in class, many people are thinking of that same question, and they will appreciate you asking it. The other thing that stood out there, so the Hindi mistake you made, I actually made the same mistake with my podcast recently. I was noticing that the second biggest market of listeners is in India. So I'm like, how do I lean into that and help people in India find this podcast even better? So I added subtitles in Hindi to a number of the episodes and tweeted it being, \"Oh, look at me go, I'm going to make this so great for people in India.\" And everyone's like, \"We don't need this. We prefer English. People in tech in India, we know English.\"\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:44:33):\nThat's true.\n\nLenny (00:44:33):\n\"This is even harder.\" They're like, \"I can read a lot faster in English, so please don't do this.\" So that was a really good learning-\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:44:39):\nThere's so many languages in India.\n\nLenny (00:44:41):\nThat, too.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:44:42):\nReally, it's crazy how people don't speak the same languages across the whole country, but also it means that people in India are fluent in so many different languages.\n\nLenny (00:44:52):\nWe live, we learn. I want to go back to the A side and just a couple more questions about Duolingo. You said that most of the growth was organic and you basically had to grow it organically. Is there anything that you can share that worked really well? Because everybody wants to grow organically through word-of-mouth. Is there anything tactical you did that really helped Duolingo that other startups can do and try?\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:45:12):\nAbsolutely. So first of all, I would actually say that AB testing and product-led growth is organic growth, because you're not spending money on it. And so the first thing that you can do, no matter what stage your startup is, is make sure that you are not overlooking the importance of people in your product team who really know how to evaluate data and how to use that and learn. And if you're too early stage, you're not looking at 5% growth, you're looking at 20, 30% growth opportunities. But I think that's number one.\n\n(00:45:44):\nNumber two, actually, this is something I might have said is something that Duolingo did really well, but I think it goes hand-in-hand with mission. But throwing the mission thing aside, brand and PR. So the importance of building a lovable brand that really resonates with people and makes people feel something and want to stand behind an idea that's bigger than themselves is not easy to do, but possible and core to being able to increase word-of-mouth.\n\n(00:46:19):\nSo at the bottom of this is the mission, which is Duolingo, the mission was always originally to bring free language education to the world, then to build the best education to make it accessible to everyone. I don't know how they're wording it today, but that's something most people can get behind. It doesn't matter if you think Bloomberg or Trump should be president. Do you think everyone should have access to great education? Most people would say yes. And so that's much more powerful than, do you want to download an app and learn a new language?\n\n(00:46:48):\nSo if you're able to have that and things that you really believe in about what you're building that's changing lives or impacting the world, even if it is just helping business people do their jobs better in a way that's going to improve their lives and their ability to make a living, or it's going to improve a company's ability, whatever it is, the bigger idea behind it and focusing on creating something that people like, whichever your audience is. It might be a more serious audience and something like Duolingo, but for Duolingo it meant we have this owl, the colors, and then the way that the owl talks and the notifications and the emails that you get and the product experience.\n\n(00:47:26):\nAll of that ties back into how people feel about your brand, which makes it so that people are more likely to talk about it, which makes it so that you are much more likely to get a reporter to write a story about you, if you have something that's meaningful outside of like, \"Hey, TechCrunch, did you know that my app grew by 20% last month?\" They're like, \"I don't care.\" But if you're able to tell a story about people whose lives are completely transformed or something like that, that's much more interesting and has played an important role in, honestly, my work at Tumblr, at Duolingo, not my Bloomberg presidential campaign, but definitely Latitude as well.\n\nLenny (00:48:02):\nThat's amazing. I was going to ask, what does that actually mean, and how do you build a lovable brand? And so what I've heard so far is there's this personality and voice that was really fun that you all lead into make it not just a generic translation app. It's like, oh, this is really fun and interesting. And then this other piece is these stories of transformation.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:48:21):\nYeah, there's more, there's more. So I think a brand that stands for something, that truly stands for something, that's where the mission piece comes in.\n\nLenny (00:48:30):\nHow do you communicate that? How do you people even know that the brand stands for that?\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:48:34):\nSo that has to be an integral part of your communication. In the early days, we tested a lot of stuff on social media. We made, again, mistakes. At one point we were posting photos of our team on Facebook being like, \"Check out the behind the scenes.\" Guess what? No one cares. But we had a calendar, this is very tactical, but a social media calendar where one post a week is about effectiveness, because we knew that proving that Duolingo was an effective way to learn a language and actually having data behind that moved the needle. So making sure that was part of our communication in terms of our social media calendar, in terms of the PR pitches that we were making, in terms of whatever we were able to communicate out into the world, and then make sure that one post a week was something about the mission and what we were actually trying to accomplish.\n\n(00:49:17):\nBut it also got embedded into a lot of things. For example, when we were testing screens to get people to convert into paid users on Duolingo, we found that including something like, \"By paying for Duolingo, you're making language learning accessible to millions of people,\" that actually improved the metric. People cared enough to make the payment. So it really can be anywhere. In addition to that, I love copywriting, and I believe that communication is constantly underrated, and communication isn't about being able to convey a message. It's about being able to convey a message in a way that the listener receives it and understands it and remembers it. And that's really hard to do. And one of the things I've helped employ at Duolingo that I think is still there today, it's definitely not-\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:50:00):\nI've helped employ at Duolingo, that I think is still there today, it's definitely not just me, we're an amazing team, but I've helped employ that I've used at Latitud in other places is a unique voice and what that means is exactly what you said, Lenny, not just another language learning app where we give you instructions and you follow directions. There is always a quirk. It's unexpected. The way we talk to you is a little bit funny. It doesn't take ourselves too seriously and it makes the person receiving this message feel something. It's about how you make people feel and you feel like either you giggle or you're like, \"Wait, what? They just did what?\" And using that to your benefit. We use that a lot at Latitud today as well in terms of especially our newsletter, just self-deprecating humor and that's what's helped us grow so quickly in Latin America in such a short amount of time. People identify with it, they see themselves as part of that. Again, much like the mission versus your company, and I'm a consumer.\n\nLenny (00:50:59):\nThis episode is brought to you by Mercury, who I also happen to use for my business checking account. I've tried a lot of business banks and there is nothing even close to the experience you get with Mercury. I moved cash over from another bank and it literally took less than half an hour to set up the account and wire money over at no cost.

Is there an example of that, kind of like a message you remember for either from Duolingo or from even Latitud or something that worked that was really funny or different?\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:52:09):\nLook, I think for Duolingo we constantly looked at every copy we wrote and asked, \"Could this have been written by other companies? Could this have been any other company or is it Duolingo? What makes this Duolingo?\" And it was tough because the more people you hire who come from other backgrounds, they're not used to that style and they might even think it's unprofessional or whatever. You're like, \"Nope, this is the Duolingo way.\" So, it helps figuring out, exactly what does that voice, what does it sound like? What are some words that it tends to use? Why yes, why not? What's too much, what's too little? In terms of specific examples, this is something that I didn't write myself, but I wrote a lot of notifications for Duolingo for the passive-aggressive messages that I'm sure people have received, which started and then became a meme and then Duolingo used as well, but the whole, \"This doesn't seem to be working. We'll stop sending them for now,\" message, which you got after five days of inactivity. In addition to that message, around the same time we decided to send an email to people in New Year's because that's when people make a resolution to do things and we wanted them to make learning a language a resolution for the year. So, we created an email and it had Sad Duo because there was... I don't know if the screen is still there, I haven't used Duolingo in a while, but there was always a screen of Duo really sad when you fail something and that [inaudible 00:53:24]-\n\nLenny (00:53:23):\nDuo the owl.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:53:25):\nDuo is the owl, sorry. The green owl will cry and we A/B tested the size of the puddle and the number of tears that came out of his eyes in terms of effectiveness. So, we used Sad Duo in one of those emails and then someone picked it up on Twitter and the passive-aggressive message and this Sad Duo, they started making their own versions, which was like, \"Study now or Duo will eat a poisoned loaf of bread,\" or, \"The next email will be a funeral e-vite,\" things like that.\n\n(00:53:58):\nAnd so that's an example, I think, to me, which can now be seen very much throughout Duolingo's brand where we could have just said, \"Oh no, this is a PR disaster. We need to go back to being this friendly, nice little fluffy thing that everyone loves.\" Instead being like, \"No, we get that people think this is funny and we're just going to run with it,\" because using the Duo voice, it gives us the permission to do that because we're not square, we're not going to do that thing that you read in the textbook in school. We're kind of going to play along with it.\n\nLenny (00:54:29):\nThat's an incredible lesson. It reminds me of this famous Duolingo meme that I'm sure you've seen where someone shared these... They got these two notifications in a row, I just pulled it up here, where first they got this Duolingo push notification, \"It looks like you forgot your Spanish lessons again, you know what happens now,\" and then the next push was from their security system, \"Intruder alert, backdoor, proceed with caution,\" and I imagine Duolingo even leaned into that, I think when this started spreading.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:54:54):\n100%, and it wasn't an easy decision because of course a lot of people in the company were really concerned about the brand image and, what are people doing and how do we revert this, that kind of thing. So, it was a bet that we made where we're just going to, \"No, we're going to lean into it because that's what having this unique voice means. It's about getting it. It's about being part of something bigger. It's about connecting with people outside of just teaching them a word a day,\" or whatever it is. And with Latitud, I think we do that all the time in our newsletter and it's a lot of self-deprecating humor for Latinos and using expressions that could be almost offensive, but they're not in terms of Latinos only, but also the tech world, making fun of being a tech founder and the things that we do that we think are okay and it's just a lot of that where I think I would call it irreverent.\n\n(00:55:45):\nIt's a tough line, it's a lot easier to be, I think, a copywriter in a place that doesn't want to do that because the lines are a lot clearer and you don't have to take as many risks, but it's so less fun, which I think makes it so less fun for the user because people are used to getting emails from their banks with corporate lingo that you don't understand, but if they get an email from their bank that's funny, ironic, but also very informative, that's a bank email I'm going to read.\n\nLenny (00:56:12):\nI think that's a really good lesson. Part of this is just taking a risk. I think that's one of the big takeaways here is just take some risks. We had Lulu Cheng on the podcast who is a huge advocate of that. She is a PR comms person that's worked at Substack and Blizzard now, and that was her advice to people-\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:56:27):\nTake risks?\n\nLenny (00:56:28):\nTake risks, do things that are a little controversial because that'll get attention. I definitely want to talk about Latitud, just a couple more questions on Duolingo. One is, today feels like one of the most interesting things about Duolingo is their TikTok presence and it feels like they're doing so well, kind of leaning into exactly what you're talking about, just being really silly and different with the owl especially. I guess the question there is just, what is it that you think allows for that? Is it just this very special social media person they hired that was just incredibly good at this thing and being irreverent as you said, or is there something else that contributes and allows a company to win in social media the way that Duolingo has?\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:57:07):\nLook, I haven't met the person who does a TikTok and they're fantastic. I definitely don't want to demerit their work. It's awesome, I don't think it's easy to do, especially on a consistent basis. So I think, yes, finding someone who gets humor, who gets the platform, who's able to produce content quickly, but also reacts to learnings, all of that is not easy to do. However, I do think that everything we just talked about is at the bottom of that because if Duolingo didn't have this unique voice and leaned into the humor and wanted to be irreverent as a brand and was so focused on connecting with people where they were and ready to take risks that might seem maybe unorthodox, especially in terms of education, then an opportunity to build a TikTok like that wouldn't exist. So it's both, and I think it goes back to the brand DNA, it goes back to the culture of the company and to the attention, as I said, to every single text that was published and whether or not it wasn't the right voice or not.\n\n(00:58:06):\nIt has to do with having those conversations with the executive team where you talk about who is Duo and what are they like and how do they talk and what do they sound like and is this a Duo thing to say, is this not a Duo thing to say? And committing to this idea that you're going to be remembered, that you're going to do things that sometimes are going to rub people the wrong way, and you're not just going to sit squarely in one place. I think that opens the possibility for a TikTok like the one that Duolingo has today to exist, but again, whoever's running the TikTok, you're amazing.\n\nLenny (00:58:42):\nThat's such a good lesson. A lot of people are looking at Duolingo, we need to find that person at our company. And what you're saying is it takes a lot more than that. That person is not going to have a good time if the culture of the company isn't set up to be that... To have that approach to try to just take risks and be irreverent, so that's a really good point. One final question around internationalization, you said that you helped drive internationalization of Duolingo, and I read somewhere that one of the learnings you had there was essentially treat everyone the same almost across countries, which I think people think is the counter. They should often like, \"No, we should be super personalized for every country we're in.\" What did you learn there?\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:59:22):\nI think this is very controversial because not only is it the case that when you're working in regulated industries, maybe in more B2B situations, looking at specific countries is important. Looking at specific countries and elements of these countries are important, especially when you're looking at, I don't know, laws and if you need legal differences and there's a lot of things that make countries different is what I'm trying to get. However, humans are very similar and we think we're very different. I don't think we're that different. I think that maybe we were brought up differently, and so for example, in Brazil we like to dance. In Mexico, we like to dance salsa, in some places it's okay to hug and other places it's not okay to hug. Yes, there are cultural differences and it's important to love everyone and to adapt, et cetera, but a lot of these differences when it comes to core human behavior are that final 5% of understanding people.\n\n(01:00:27):\nAnd if as a startup, whether it be early stage, but as a startup you focus too much on those marginal differences between groups of people, you can run the risk of making big mistakes, which is making too many changes too soon and learning very little and adding crazy amounts of code complexity and overall organizational complexity to what you're building. And with Duolingo, because it was a consumer app, because we weren't dealing with a lot of regulatory issues, except for China where we had to watch out for certain words and phrases, in general, people want to learn a language and people learn a certain way and people use apps a certain way. So, there's a lot of commonality. We just found that by treating the world as one, and whenever we deployed an A/B test or tried something new in terms of marketing, we would just look at it as like, \"Well, if this worked here, it will work there and we should just try it out everywhere,\" which meant every time I went and launched Duolingo new market, I got the same feedback.\n\n(01:01:27):\nWhatever country it was, \"Here, it's different. People are different. You don't understand and what you're doing is not going to work and here's why you need to change.\" And if we had actually listened to that, it would cause all kinds of problems. In our country, we think that green is a negative color, owls are poorly seen as an animal, or here people think that free things are actually of low value, they like things that are expensive. Oh, people here really like free things and I'm like, \"Everyone likes free things.\" They're like, \"Oh, in this country...\" Whatever, so yes, I think that countries are different, but it's more important to realize that people like to think they're different and people like to think their countries are different and highlight those because it makes them feel special, unique. We're all special and unique in all of our amazing ways, but this is not necessarily it.\n\n(01:02:13):\nAnd when you're trying to be super cautious of your resources, you have to ignore some of that because then you're able to roll out things once, which is important, but in addition to that, every new A/B test you want to run or every new hypothesis you have, if you now have a version of your app that's different in Mexico, in China, in India, whatever, you're going to have to run that test and whatever change you have in all of those versions, and then you just start having all of these different versions of the app everywhere and good luck managing that in terms of code, in terms of processes, in terms of personnel, in terms of costs, and most importantly in terms of time because now every single experiment or hypothesis is going to take you way longer to be able to deploy, and time is almost more important than money when you're a startup. So, it's important to keep things super simple, and this was something that we did that actually ended up paying off with few exceptions like India and China.\n\nLenny (01:03:12):\nThat is such cool advice. It reminds me of a quote that I think of that a friend of mine shared once, \"Life is maintenance. Anything you add to your life is just something you're going to have to maintain from that point forward,\" and similar in products. Any time you add new code, you're going to maintain that code forever, and the more you can not add anything new and not make things really different, the easier everything gets. People forget that. It's like, \"Oh, we're just going to spend a bunch of time to make it awesome in China or Brazil,\" and then, oh, they have to maintain that forever and every you feature has to...\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:03:42):\nAnd it's an 80/20, so just focus on what will get you the 80 and not the 20. And then when you have the luxury of focusing on the 20, then you can.\n\nLenny (01:03:52):\nSo, speaking of different cultures and people being different but not that different, you pivoted your career basically to focus on Latin America. First of all, why did you decide to do that? That's a pretty unique path and what pulled you there?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:04:09):\nSo Lenny, I don't see it as a pivot because as we were joking in the beginning, I've been an employee, I was an operator there at early stage startups and now I'm a founder and I'm a VC, so I'm still kind of in this little stack of roles that we have in our little tech ecosystem. And in my time working with Tumblr and my agency and Duolingo, I had the pleasure of speaking with entrepreneurs all over the world, in part because I started getting some media because of the work that I've been doing starting at Tumblr, so a lot of entrepreneurs reached out to me, but also because I became a mentor for an organization called Endeavor, which is global. So, I started working with entrepreneurs in Japan and Brazil on my free time, just mentoring. And I know that the opportunity for growth in terms of tech in Latin America is huge because first of all, the opportunity for growth in tech is huge all over the world, meaning there's just more and more to do.\n\n(01:05:09):\nThere's more pieces of our lives that can become more efficient or better or cheaper by making them digital in some way, shape or form because digital products scale. We are behind when it comes to that in terms of Latin America, and our economy is also not doing super great right now. There's a number of things that make it tougher to succeed in Latin America, but make the outcome of potential success much higher. And simply put, there's a lot of low hanging fruit because a lot of what has already been digitized and productized in the US and more developed markets just hasn't in Latin America. And every time I took these calls, I would think like, \"Well, this is not very efficient for me to be doing this one-to-one call. I feel very good about myself, I feel great, and this entrepreneur learned a lot, but I wish I could do this more at scale.\"\n\n(01:05:56):\nAnd also it doesn't seem like this is what's going to help this entrepreneur succeed. Maybe it's a little bit of advice, but it's like... And not only that, but I had a lot of experiences where I would mention something about growth that I had learned and that would blow the entrepreneur's mind. And I would think, \"Why do I know this, but not this entrepreneur who honestly is smarter and more ambitious than me?\" Oh, it's because I've had a career in Silicon Valley. It's because I've gotten to work with some of the best people in the world and I have access to this information just free flowing in my way all the time, and we take it for granted. So, how can we make this more accessible to Latin America's entrepreneurs, so that they can have access to that? What else is hard to get access to that could really get in the way?\n\n(01:06:34):\nOh, like access to capital. So, what's the VC in the angel ecosystem looking like and what can we do that can actually impact that at scale? And then there's other pieces of the ecosystem that are missing, like if you're going to start a company, you have to incorporate it. It sounds super boring, but Brazil is one of the countries that takes the longest time to incorporate a company in the world, but then if you're going to get investment, you probably can't get investment in your Brazil entity because investors are like, \"I don't know anything about Brazil, and sounds like a lot of employers get sued by their employees and lose,\" which is totally true, \"And there's all this liability. I feel much more comfortable investing in a Delaware company.\" So then entrepreneurs are like, \"Oh man, now I have to create this entity in Delaware. I don't even know where that is and what's the C-core? What's this other thing?\"\n\n(01:07:19):\nSo, there's just stuff that needs to happen for Latin Americans that we don't think about here, \"Silicon Valley\" talking about it as in the cloud in the US and developed markets, but also then you're able to raise money, how do you get money down to your country? That's not simple at all. How do you think about the FX transactions and not get screwed in the process and who's going to do it? And so anyway, there's a number of these things that make it super hard. And so, that's some of the problems that we wanted to solve.\n\n(01:07:47):\nWhy it matters to me? I'm Brazilian, I'm Latin American, and I know that I had all of the opportunities in the world. I went to an American school, I got to go to school in the US, I got to work with some of the best tech companies in the world, and 99.9% of people in Latin America will not have these opportunities. And so for me, if I don't use this privilege to somehow make a huge impact where I came from, that will last, then I kind of wasted my life. So, that's why this matters so much to me, and I met my co-founder, Brian Requarth at On Deck. If you've heard of On Deck before, I'm a big fan.\n\nLenny (01:08:24):\nI'm wearing On Deck socks right now. Yeah, I am.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:08:28):\nI love their socks, and I just had a conversation with them yesterday. I am a big fan of what they built. I met Brian doing On Deck... I actually was thinking of starting a completely different company, but also focused on community. As we were talking about, people want to find connection, and I think that there's a lot of business opportunity there, but I met my co-founder and he was working with our third co-founder, Yuri, who was actually the guy... We joke he's the guy who builds things.\n\n(01:08:53):\nHe's the CTO, he actually knows how to build and started talking about what it is that we can do to make an impact in the speed at which tech startups succeed in Latin America because we think we can have a huge impact on the GDP of the whole region, developments, job opportunities, and so on and so forth. So to me, that's what motivates me. It's like figuring out how I can use my time as leverage to make the biggest impact possible in terms of socioeconomical mobility for people in the world and focusing on the part of the world that I came from made the most sense.\n\nLenny (01:09:26):\nSo you referenced this company, that you started Latitud. Maybe just describe briefly, just broadly, how do you pitch what Latitud does to folks that might find it useful?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:09:35):\nI will, and I still do a pretty bad job with pitching it, but the pitch is basically we're building the operating system for Latin American early stage tech startups, and what that means is that building a startup is hard anywhere, but it's extra hard in Latin America for some of the reasons that I outlined. Some of the things that we decided to solve for are one, it's super lonely to be a founder. And if you're able to meet great founders who are just a step ahead of you in anything, be it in product or growth or marketing or incorporation or finances, you can save yourself so much time from trying to read books and Google if they can just tell you what to do or connect you with the right person, that if we were able to connect these people meaningfully, we could make a huge impact.\n\n(01:10:16):\nSo, that's number one, it's lonely. And number two, you build a startup in Brazil and you're like, \"Wow, this is working. I'm going to go to Silicon Valley.\" I've seen this happen a lot in the past decade, and Silicon Valley is a completely different place. The US, it's a different place, the competition's different. 3% of people in Brazil only, and that varies in Latin America, speak English. So, the likelihood of you being taken seriously is low. Your chances of success are low, but at the same time, Latin America has so much in common as a region, but we don't actually actually see that if we're Latin Americans. We just think we're countries, especially Brazilians don't think that they're part of the rest, and Mexicans don't think about Brazil. It's so far, look at it on the map. In the US you're like, oh Latin America.\"\n\n(01:10:58):\nBut if you're there, it's just not at all connected, but the opportunities of growth are huge and dependent on whether you meet the right people are able to open doors and understand that our problems are so similar that a solution for one part of this region could potentially be great for another part of the region. I'm not doing a great job of pitching, but in addition to it being lonely and it being difficult to find the right resources and really trustworthy knowledge, it's really hard to raise capital and it's really hard to do things like incorporate and bring your money down, et cetera. So, that's what we do. First, we have a fellowship program. We have 1,500 entrepreneurs who got in, we run four cohorts a year, about 600 applicants per, and so you get in and you get access to all of these resources we've put together.\n\n(01:11:44):\nYou get to find out what everyone thinks about other investors in the region because I think it's important to disseminate that information. You get access to introductions to investors through each other and advice and events. In addition, we have a fund, so we've invested in 100 startups and we're raising our second fund now. It's going to be around $25 million with a $30 million cap, so that's another thing. So we invest, you figure out your investment game, but you might become one of our investments as well. And in addition, we have products that make it a lot easier to navigate the super, in my opinion, boring and frustrating stuff behind starting a company that you don't want to think about it as an entrepreneur because you're trying to solve a problem and build a team and build a product.\n\n(01:12:25):\nYou're not trying to figure out what's the best incorporation method and how to open a bank account in the US and how to figure out the foreign exchange prices and bring the money down and how to manage that money or how to stay compliant in your country, and then in two other jurisdictions, if you have a Delaware and a Cayman. So, we do all of that for you and make it easy through a dashboard we built, a bank that we built, and so on and so forth. So, it's not an easy to describe business because it's kind of an ecosystem play. We're trying to elevate the tech ecosystem in Latin America, and it's a lot of moving parts.\n\nLenny (01:13:02):\nYou basically help them do everything, which is what I'm hearing, and it sounds like you'd be a fool not to take advantage of this. The customers essentially are founders in any Latin America country, is that right?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:13:14):\nFounders in Latin America, but we also have a lot of US-based founders who are building for Latin America because they understand that the opportunity there is huge.\n\nLenny (01:13:22):\nAwesome, and then what is the arrangement? Do you take equity if they join the program? Is it free?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:13:28):\nWe don't, joining the program is free. You just have to be able to get in. For a number of reasons, we just don't want to deter anyone who's amazing from being part of this community, and so that's why we made that decision. If we invest, we take equity. If you choose to use our products, that's a paid thing. So, you can choose what makes sense for you.\n\nLenny (01:13:47):\nSomething I wanted to ask about is what is it that Latin American founders and companies are uniquely good at? Is there kind of a thread across Latin American startups that are like, oh, they're so good at this area, pay attention here?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:14:03):\nIn general terms, startup founders have to be really scrappy and resourceful and resilient. Latin Americans tend to be very scrappy, resourceful, and resilient because of just the realities in which we were brought up in. We have words for that that we don't have in English and Portuguese in Spanish, which is like dancing around things and figuring out things when you don't have other solutions. So, I think that's something that we see a lot. In terms of what we're really good at, I would say first of all, there's opportunity in every single vertical in Latin America because it's such a wide open field, so there's opportunity everywhere.\n\n(01:14:40):\nIt's not that we're particularly good at FinTech, for example, but if you look at the FinTech opportunity in Latin America right now, it's so hot and there's so much money and there's so much happening because of the huge problem of people not having access to bank accounts or access to credit, or just all of the bureaucracy that exists in trying to get those things or to make payments and so on and so forth. So, there's just huge opportunity there. I'm trying to think what else-\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:15:00):\nSo there's just huge opportunity there. Trying to think what else I would highlight. Ah, Lenny, you talked about B2C. I think again, because there's so much open field, there's so much opportunity when it comes to B2B, especially when you're talking about SMBs. There's a lot of small and medium businesses doing things on paper, so figure out what they are and how you can make them not on paper and deploy them effectively. So I think that's an advantage we have.\n\n(01:15:28):\nOther than that, I wouldn't highlight anything in particular. I think that there's amazing people all over the world. It's just a matter of what are the opportunities that exist. And because there's so many opportunities that are Latin America specific or that are emerging market specific, which means that if they work in an emerging market in Latin America, they could work in other emerging markets. And you know what? Most of the world is not developed markets and understanding what it's like to not have access to amazing wifi and iPhones and all the things that we have access to, that can be a huge advantage because that's the reality that most of the population lives in. And that's a huge TAM.\n\nLenny (01:16:08):\nThat makes me think about WhatsApp. And one of the reasons they made it is they were just obsessed with making the app incredibly small and fast. And they started, I think with international markets and then that just ended up being an amazing app so fast and so easy to use.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:16:22):\nAnd still, and now there's things being built on top of WhatsApp. We just invested in a company called Leadsales, and they basically turn your WhatsApp into a CRM, which is amazing because so much business is being done on WhatsApp, and that's not the case here in the US. So you want to understand that you can build something for that. And there are other markets that are using WhatsApp for which that's also going to be useful. And the other thing is I think that emerging or developing markets tend to sometimes skip over things because we're so behind.\n\n(01:16:48):\nSo for example, there's examples of these in India and in some countries in Africa where, I don't know, the desktop was skipped, people just went straight to mobile. I think we can see these catapult opportunities because then when you start building something and you didn't even build for the previous version of whatever it is that was being used because in the US or more developed market, you had access to them, then you are in a way at an advantage. So I'm excited to see how that plays out in the next few years, and I'm particularly curious to see how that plays out when it comes to AI.\n\nLenny (01:17:21):\nOne last question around Latin America. It's going to be a broad question. What do you think people should be paying attention to, whether it's specific companies you want to call out, big companies that are doing great or just trends or patterns, what do you think people should be paying attention to? Anything you want to shout out?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:17:39):\nLenny, the truth is I would love to call out all of our portfolio companies. I believe in all of them, and there are some of them that are growing incredibly impressively. One of them is Pomelo, which is a FinTech platform for FinTechs that is just grown incredibly. To me, it's more about paying attention to Latin America. I think for the US, that's already a lot. I don't think people know what's going on below the border, I have no idea what Brazil is like, but paying attention because it's not just a place that's behind and trying to catch up. It's a place where the opportunity to make a lot of money exists. It's a higher risk region because of all the political and economic instability. But given the scenario that we're in right now, which is that we're still behind in terms of all the solutions that we know will be built to give people access to health, to education, to financial services, et cetera.\n\n(01:18:36):\nBut we actually have a lot of money flowing into the region in terms of venture capital. We have the best talent we've ever had because now we've had, I forget how many, but a lot of IPOs that came from Latin America and unicorn companies, people who have worked at those companies or who have worked places like Duolingo are coming back to build now, know what they're doing. And so there's a number of things that have come together that make now a really exciting time to build a startup in Latin America and to scale it. So from an investment perspective, I just think that there's a lot of hot opportunities now in terms of knowing what's a good opportunity versus not. I think the same rules probably apply to those anywhere else, which is most importantly, the entrepreneur. Does this person know what they're talking about?\n\n(01:19:23):\nDo they have an unfair advantage in terms of knowing what a problem that exists and knowing how to solve it in a way that others couldn't do? They have access to the best talent in the world, not just in the region that will actually join them and build the best thing possible. And yeah, what's the TAM? And not just what they put on the slide, but what you actually believe the TAM to be. So that's what I would say. I think everyone's looking at FinTech and Latin America right now. It's hot, it's profitable. Money is where the money is, but I'm super excited about what happens with health and education in particular because I think that that has the power to truly transform the region in a massive way.\n\n(01:20:05):\nAt Latitud, I think I mentioned in addition to FinTech, we tend to invest a lot in B2B SMB platforms that are helping businesses scale and work more effectively because there is a huge need for that and there's an opportunity to build. And I think that that can have an impact on the region. So I think that would be my advice. It's a little broad, but other than that, if not, I would just now sit here and tell you 15 companies that we love at Latitud and I won't.\n\nLenny (01:20:33):\nWell, we can point people to your portfolio page on your website.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:20:38):\nI would love to highlight our portfolio companies. Maybe I'll just send you a list or something. I don't know.\n\nLenny (01:20:42):\nPerfect. We will figure out a way to share that. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Gina, are you ready?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:20:50):\nI'm ready, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:20:52):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:20:57):\nThe one book I recommend because I truly, it really changed the way I think about things. It taught me a lot about a discipline I had never really thought much about, but also because I think it makes me sound smart and it's a really short book, so it's easy to get through is The Design Of Everyday Things. For me, that was the first time that I realized that design wasn't just this sort of cool thing that some people were into and they had to get and it made things beautiful. It was about understanding how everything is designed and how to think about design and usability.\n\n(01:21:28):\nSo for someone like me who didn't have any experience in product before, I think it could be transformative. And then the second book, it has nothing to do with what we do. I recommend Viktor Frankl's Man's Search For Meaning because at heart I'm a philosopher and I tend to think a lot about life, the meaning of life and what differentiates one life from the next and how to live a good one. And no matter what profession we choose that continues to be important. So those are my recommendations.\n\nLenny (01:22:01):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoy?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:22:04):\nSo first of all, I love Succession, but I don't think we have to go into that. One that was recommended to me by a friend who I very much admire was Mike Krieger, co-founder of Instagram is How to with John Wilson. It's a really weird TV show that I would've never found if it wasn't for him. But the premise is basically this guy, I think he's a filmmaker and he's awkward and it's cool that he's awkward. It's just his style and he decides to make a TV show about creating to help people who are really worried or scared of doing something and helping them prepare for that moment in their lives.\n\n(01:22:42):\nSo for example, someone is really scared of telling their friends that they lied about how many college degrees they had or whatever that they said they had a master's degree, but they didn't. And it's now been five years and it's not the debate club, but I forget what it is, but something that requires some sort of intellect and he doesn't want to confront the group. And so he recreates everything that could possibly happen that day in order to make this easier. Or another one about having kids. Someone's really scared about making the decision about whether or not they want to have kids. So it's kind of a documentary, but it's not. It's awkward. It's weird, but it's so good. And then I would say White Lotus, just like so good.\n\nLenny (01:23:25):\nI do that song to my new child often because it's so funny.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:23:29):\nMy husband and I do it at home.\n\nLenny (01:23:30):\nLot is a recurring,\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:23:31):\nYeah,\n\nLenny (01:23:32):\nYeah. I'm not going to do it, but it's a recurring favorite on this podcast. So we had a short drinking game where every time someone said, White Lotus, we drink. So I'm going to have some tea here real quick.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:23:41):\nOkay. I'm sorry to be predictable, but like I said-\n\nLenny (01:23:45):\nNo its great.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:23:47):\nWe humans are a lot more similar than we'd like to think. What's amazing Lenny is just my realization more and more of how much this is true because I like to think of myself as unique much like everybody else. And then I started seeing that all of these really creative decisions I made are what all of the other millennial white girls did. It's just fascinating. Oh, I like whatever, mid-century modern furniture. Oh, you know what? Actually, I'll tell you what movie is my favorite one? Bo Burnham's Inside. I love-\n\nLenny (01:24:19):\nOh my God,\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:24:20):\nI don't know if that's a movie, but I'm in love with Bo Burnham. My husband knows about this. I know all of the songs and what is it? White Girl's, Instagram? White Woman's Instagram. Such a good song. That's what I'm talking about.\n\nLenny (01:24:33):\nAlso, I've been re-listening to How is the best case scenario, Joe Biden,\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:24:40):\nThey're going to make me vote for Joe Biden. I was singing this to my parents. They didn't get it.\n\nLenny (01:24:45):\nThat's amazing. We'll link to that video, that movie. It's even after COVID, it's incredible. Anyway, I was actually going to say that first show you mentioned, I think it's called The Rehearsal, maybe there's a different title.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:24:57):\nOh my gosh, you're right. So he has two shows and one of them is called How To and the other one is called The Rehearsal. And you're right, I am recommending the rehearsal. I have also seen How To, which are shorter episodes where he films in New York and he just goes like How to find a parking spot. And then it takes him on this down a rabbit hole of how cars are made or parking in the city. But it's also very good. But I prefer The Rehearsal.\n\nLenny (01:25:22):\nAnd Nathan Fielder's the guy behind all this who's incredibly hilarious. He has a new show, actually I think it's on HBO with John Wilson or something that he's producing or it's this other guy. He's going around talking about stuff in New York and I think he's a producer.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:25:37):\nThat's the one I'm talking about. That's How To with John Wilson.\n\nLenny (01:25:41):\nOh, there we go. So I think he's behind that. Okay, look at us. We're figuring things out.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:25:45):\nWe are figuring things out. So I think he has maybe a new season.\n\nLenny (01:25:48):\nThink season two. I haven't started that one yet. Anyway, here we go. We're going to keep going. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:25:57):\nWhy do you want to work here is what I really like to ask because it tells me a lot. Of course, everyone wants a job. People could just be like, because I want a job and it seems like you guys pay well and whatever. I think this is a good next step in my career, but I want to know if this person knows what it is that we do, if they did a minimum level of research and if they connect with our mission because we're going to talk about mission a lot and I don't want them to gloss over it and to make decisions that are short-term thinking that go against our mission because of the reasons I mentioned with Duolingo. So I think that's one, it's not very unique, but I think gives you a lot of information. And then I would say, what are you world-class at and how do you know that you're at that?\n\n(01:26:41):\nAnd the second part is almost more important. What are you world class at? It's okay if someone says, look, I'm working on becoming world class at whatever, and this is why I think I'm great at it or whatever. But the second part is important because it tells me if people actually care about metrics, and I don't care what the metrics are, but just how do you know this to be true? It has to be more than like, \"Oh, because my boss loves me,\" or \"Because my mom told me,\" \"because I gave a talk,\" or whatnot or whatever I want to hear, \"I'm proud of having accomplished this.\" And maybe if you have some numbers to show, that's also really important.\n\nLenny (01:27:17):\nWhat is a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really like?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:27:21):\nI have not been trying any products, I would say. So nothing to recommend. I would say though that I am very curious to try these gut health tests that are out there now or microbiome ones. I'm really interested in how little we know about our body and how tech can actually help democratize this information. And going on a tiny rant. I'm also feeling very resentful of doctors right now because we've always lived in a world in which doctors are sort of like these authorities and we must just believe whatever it is that they tell us, and we rely on them for information that is crucial to our survival.\n\n(01:27:58):\nBut we're now in a world where we can Google things and that's even more scary because you have to know how to filter that information really well and you don't find explanations to things. But doctors don't like you Googling because they say it's scary, but also because they don't like being questioned. I think we're finally coming to a place where a lot of these devices that can give you great information about your body so that you understand your nutrition and very core things about ourselves that we don't today are becoming accessible to a lot of people just to the population. It's still expensive but we're getting there, and I think that will be magical. So I will call out the company Levels by my friend Sam Corcos because I think that what they're doing is awesome.\n\nLenny (01:28:40):\nNext question. What is a favorite life motto that you like to think about? Come back to share with other people.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:28:47):\nOne is \"This too shall pass.\" And I will tell you this one right now is particularly meaningful to me right now because I'm going through a really tough moment because I have long COVID and lost my taste and smell, and it might be long-term. So, but I think it applies to the A/B thing that I was talking about when everything in life is moments except for a couple of diagnoses. And so, \"This too shall pass,\" is something I say to myself a lot. The second one is also not particularly motivational, but I really believe in it, which is, \"Fake it till you make it.\" That's something I've held onto for a long time. And even today, I don't mean lie. I don't mean pretend to be something that you're not, but it's almost like a way to overcome imposter syndrome and by opening rooms for yourself to be who you want to become so that you enable opportunities to become that.\n\n(01:29:39):\nAnd I'm not saying lying, but early in my career, I did fake it until I make it from the point of view of not saying no to things. When companies were saying to me being like, \"Hey, can you help us grow without a budget like Tumblr,\" right? I was 25, 26. I was like, \"Yeah, and then go figure it out.\" And when Duolingo turned to me and said, \"Hey, can you be head of growth?\" And I didn't know what growth was and I had to Google and find Andrew Chen's blog, I read it and I found out and I just said, \"Yes,\" and then kept going with that. So fake it till you make it as kind of that for me.\n\n(01:30:07):\nBut even today I have a lot of imposter syndrome, which I actually think is not imposter syndrome, is just acknowledging that I don't know a lot. My team says I have too much self-deprecating humor that actually puts the company down. It puts me down. So fake it till you make it to me means knowing how to stand in front of your team or a reporter or Lenny in a podcast and almost like being that person that you would like to be or being your best self. You could call it whatever you want, but I think it can really help you get out of the little hole that you would put yourself into and limit opportunities for yourself.\n\nLenny (01:30:44):\nAmazing. This question elicits so many interesting insights and stories. I appreciate you sharing all that. Final question. You majored in philosophy, if I'm not mistaken. I'm curious, do you have a favorite philosopher or someone that most influenced the way you think about the world?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:31:04):\nI use a lot of philosophy in my day-to-day, but it's not because I have deep knowledge, it's because I have light knowledge that I draw on that helps people think I'm smart and relates to ideas. I often talk about Theseus's ship, to me that allegory is one of the most interesting ones because it's about identity and building and whether if the allegory is like the ship-\n\nLenny (01:31:04):\nNo, please share.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:31:27):\nSo Theseus is on this journey. I think he leaves Crete and he's going somewhere else and he's on a boat. And then over the course of the trip so many things happen. They've hit so many waves and they have storms that they have to replace planks, and re-sow the sail and by the time they arrive at the next port, nothing on the ship is the same as it was before. They'd replace every single plank. They'd replace all the masts, they've replaced all the sails. And so the question is, is this the same boat that left the dock? And to me, that's a really interesting concept around transformation and what it means to have an identity that exists over time, even when so much of us or so much of a company or so much of a country changes, and what is that core identity?\n\n(01:32:14):\nAnd to me that shapes I think a lot of ideas because it's a cool allegory and it resonates a lot. But yeah, so I would say at this point I embarrassingly have very cursory knowledge of philosophy. I could probably remember a lot of it if I went back to it, but I don't use it in my day-to-day, and I would love to take time off at some point and go study, but I'm also embarrassed to admit that I'm not a person who just finishes work is completely depleted and then wants to bury my face in a philosophy book. I would like to acquire all of this philosophy knowledge, but I want to watch White Lotus. Or if I'm going to force myself to work out, I'll listen to an audio book that makes me feel good about myself, and it's a fiction one.\n\nLenny (01:33:01):\nI think this is actually a great example of exactly what you're talking about, where we change and we are not necessarily the same person we were. That makes sense that you're not obsessed with philosophy having finished that a while ago and now working on something totally different.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:33:16):\nYeah, I think I still am because I consider myself to be very existential. I'm an atheist, so I like to find meaning. It's not like it doesn't exist so much for me, and I think about the big questions and I am interested in philosophy. I'm just not interested enough to make time and effort for it in my life right now.\n\nLenny (01:33:34):\nAs a hidden gem. At the end of this episode, I'll share, I'm also an atheist and I actually ran a website called atheistspot.com. It was like a Reddit for atheist news. I went to conferences.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:33:45):\nWhat does it do? We didn't see God again today, still no God to be found.\n\nLenny (01:33:53):\nYep. The funniest thing is we had Google AdWords on there and the ads were based on the stories around different religions, and it says all like christianmingle.com, the atheistspot.com. Anyway, Gina, we covered so much ground. What an amazing episode. I learned a ton from you. I'm so excited for people to hear this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:34:18):\nYes. Okay. Thanks, Lenny. So people can find me online if you want to see just ridiculous posts. That's where my Instagram is, and my Instagram is impressive because I'm Gina on Instagram. Yes, I am just Gina.\n\nLenny (01:34:30):\nWow.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:34:31):\nSo that's super impressive. You won't even find it when you look for me because you'll see all these other Gina's, but it's just at Gina. That's me. I do share some professional things as well there too, but I think it's my more entertaining channel. You can find me on LinkedIn. I'm a little more serious on LinkedIn. I have a photo with Obama, which will certainly impress you, so find me. Gina Gotthilf on LinkedIn.\n\nLenny (01:34:51):\nSo many stories we haven't covered.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:34:52):\nI know I'm Gina G on Twitter, and that's probably, you know what? I did a Harry Stebbings podcast and then that got me 600 followers on TikTok, but I've never posted, but maybe at some point. I feel self-conscious, but I think I could be a good TikToker because I think I'm amusing.\n\nLenny (01:35:08):\nWell, you're not going to get followers by saying there's nothing good there. I think if you want people, they'll follow you. You should tell them it's going to be great there.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:35:15):\nCome see my amazing contact content on TikTok. I will definitely start posting it soon, and you can influence what kind of content will be there because I'm listening to my followers right now, and then how you can be useful. Look, if you know of an amazing founder in Latin America, if you are an amazing founder in Latin America, or if you are in touch with VCs who are interested in this, then definitely tell them about Latitud. You go to latitud.com. Do not misspell Latitud. It doesn't have an E at the end. That's because latitude in Spanish is latitud. However, it's also because we couldn't buy latitude.com with an E, but now that's what it is and it's grown a ton, so get in touch, join the fellowship, join our community. We're particularly useful by the way to us people who are interested in getting plugged into Latin America, because if you get in, you just meet all the top people in one fell swoop, and that helps you make friends relationships, find clients, find your business partners, and understand the ecosystem in a hacky way.\n\nLenny (01:36:16):\nAmazing. Gina, thank you so much for being here. Bye everyone.\n\nGina Gotthilf (01:36:21):\nGoodbye everyone.\n\nLenny (01:36:24):\nThank you so much for listening.

I know that you're an intensely busy human and I really appreciate you being here.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:02:53):\nThank you Lenny. It's awesome to be here. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:02:54):\nIt's absolutely my pleasure. You're on the boards of Coinbase and Pinterest, you're a really big deal at DoorDash. You're even bigger deal at Caviar. You worked at Square, at Facebook, at Google. Plus you're an incredibly prolific investor. I'd probably put you in the top 1% of investors based on what I've seen. And so I'm just curious kind of just to set context, how did you get into tech and product originally? And then just what was your journey like to becoming this luminary of tech?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:03:24):\nFirst of all, let's not start use the word luminary. I think it's people like Elon and Mark who are luminaries, I think. I've just been lucky to work at good companies and observe the creation and growth of these companies. I'll give you an interesting story. Crazily enough, I joined Google as a PM after I applied to Cisco. This was in 2003, and I wanted to be a hardcore networking product manager in the layer three, layer two of networking. I was like, layer seven software is for wimps. I'm going to go hardcore.\n\n(00:03:50):\nCisco had a... In 2001, 2002 right after the bust, the first dot com bust. Then Cisco actually rescinded my offer. They made me an offer, they rescinded it, and then basically that's how I ended up at Google. Was my second choice after Cisco. So literally you can see some of these decisions. You're just saved from yourself by [inaudible 00:04:08], and otherwise I would have been in networking, probably. Maybe still at Cisco. But at Google I got put on something called syndication, which is taking Google searches results and ads and then syndicating it to other properties like AOL back in the day, Yahoo, et cetera.\n\n(00:04:21):\nAnd I was working on that product and at about 6:00 PM... We had offices then, back then at Google, 2002, 2003, people would go home and some people would stay back. I'd just walk around and a few doors from me, I basically found a group of engineers in an office and they were working on something. I was like, \"What are you working on? They said, \"Well,\" Serge Brin, the co-founder had given them a project of essentially reversing what Google had done with search. You type in a phrase, set of keywords and then Google identifies the webpages that are most relevant to the set of keywords. So we have an index that matches keywords and webpages, so why don't we extract those keywords for any given webpage and basically see if we can target ads based on that? So that seemed interesting. Google's AdWords product, which was such, ads had just started scaling up and I was like, \"Hey, do you have any PMs working with you?\"\n\n(00:05:09):\nThey said, no. \"Can I be your PM?\" They said, \"Aren't you working on syndication?\" I said, \"Yeah, but I can do this nights and weekends.\" So I basically became a part-time PM for them and help them talk to customers, even did presentations with them. And while my full-time job was this other thing. And essentially within three months this thing grew big enough and fast enough and became a product that my boss saw this and she moved me over to full-time work on this, and that became Google AdSense. So a lesson for me I realized is that it's very important to do a core job really well at any company, but it's equally important to have curiosity and be open to serendipity. I think Zoom makes it harder, but it's very important to understand what else is going on at the company, what else people are working on, and just keep talking to people and build relationship with the company, because those are what will lead to the next set of opportunities.\n\n(00:05:57):\nI think many opportunities don't come linearly just working in your job and making sure you get promoted. That's not how I think great careers are built. I think great careers are built by knowing a lot of people doing great work so they know and want you on their teams, and just waiting for serendipity and then seizing it and jumping. Another example is I had advised a company which was acquired by Square, and the fundraiser in Google. And Jack, the CEO of Square, asked the founder who was one of the best product people he knows. My name was mentioned. So then they reached out to me and I would never have really... I mean, informal advising. I didn't have any equity of something in the company. I just helped them out because they reached out to me because it was a former colleague and I said, \"Sure, I'll help you out.\"\n\n(00:06:38):\nAnd then that resulted in him saying good things about me and that led to the inbound from Square. So I think you got to prioritize this stuff. I mean you got to be careful it doesn't take up your life, but I think it's very important to be curious and open to serendipity. I realize in today's world there are lots of crazy serendipity things that happen. If you take inbounds from smart people and you just chat with them and you help them out.\n\n(00:06:58):\nPaying it forward is the other thing, paying it forward. Lenny, you're a great example to this, you pay it forward so much. Your articles, stuff you write, good things happen in ways that you don't even realize. You build up a reservoir of goodwill that comes back to help you in different ways.\n\nLenny (00:07:12):\nI love this advice. I don't know if you know this already, but I actually did a TEDx talk once about serendipity. It's called Losing Your Serendipity. It's out there on the internet, in case people want to-\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:07:21):\nI'm going to check it out. Wow.\n\nLenny (00:07:22):\nLong time ago. But I love, love that concept and it's such a good story. Just kind of pulling that thread a little bit, I'm curious, when you're looking for opportunities, would you suggest people focus on things they're excited about and passion that's pulling them in?\n\n(00:07:36):\nOr more, I just think there's a big opportunity and maybe I'm not so excited about doing the work, but I'm just going to follow it because it may lead somewhere. Or some, right in the middle? How do you think about that?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:07:46):\nI think you got to think about the day to day. In many cases I feel people don't realize whether they're passionate about something or not until they actually start doing the work. I could never ever imagine that I could be passionate about payments ever in a million years, but the environment of the company Square was so infectious and great and the culture was so good that we even made working on payments... And you're serving these small businesses. I always think of, not what you're working on but what problem you're solving. In many cases, I get more energy from the problem I'm solving and who I'm solving it for and I realize that I get much more energy from personally solving problems that affected a small business or basically people or small business that I can relate to. It is harder for me to get energy solving problems of big enterprise and companies.\n\n(00:08:28):\nSo I've always somehow ended up working at companies like DoorDash or Square or even Facebook, building ad product for small businesses, Google AdSense for small publishers. And so consumers for small businesses is what I've seen. And so I think it's important to know what kind of problems you get energy from and really think about the problem versus the customer segment. Maybe even more than the problem because I've saw different kinds of problems, but I realize that it's those kinds of customers I enjoy because you can meet them in the day to day. You can see them on the street or you read their articles. A small blogger for example, I remember I used to go to a lot of blog conferences when I was a PM for AdSense. It was great to meet these bloggers. They would be hundreds of thousands of them back then.\n\n(00:09:10):\nIt's probably different, Medium and so on, now, Substack, but back then it was blogger. I think the word doesn't even exist today, but it's amazing to meet them and they literally... Till today I have people emailing me, \"Gokul, I know you right? We used to make a hundred thousand dollars a year based on purely AdSense, and that was our living and that's how we built this other company on that.\" So big companies, you don't ever get to hear something like that. So I got energy from things like that. The other one is founder. I think, Lenny, it's very important if you think... Talking about company, is to have a founder, when you talk to them, you don't get the sense that they're in it for the money. I think it's very important for founders to really live and breathe the mission themselves in an authentic way.\n\n(00:09:48):\nAnd if people are smart, and I think you've got to really honestly think if this person is constantly talking about revenue and trying to convince you that you're going to get wealthy or they're going to get... Whatever the case is, that's not the kind of founder that's going build a really large company. And so if you look at everyone, whether it's... You've worked with Brian Chesky, I'm sure he embodies that. Jack at Square, Tony at DoorDash, Larry at Google, all of these folks embody that mission. Mark at Facebook. That they care about winning. They will win and money will come, but it's a side product. It's not the main thing they're aiming for.\n\nLenny (00:10:18):\nThat's a good segue. A question I wanted to talk about is when someone's looking for a company to join, knowing that you've worked at a lot of really successful companies, what else should people look for when they're trying to decide where to go? So what we've talked about so far is, a founder that really wants to win and is really driven, and then a problem that you want to solve? Is there anything else?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:10:35):\nI think those are the two things. One thing to look at, I would say, is that it is important to see if this company can become the number one player in its segment. I'll give you an example. I convinced someone who's going to take a very senior role, let's just say a tier two or tier three e-commerce company, to become a, not... So, basically take one step down at different company, which is at Coinbase, basically. I sat on the board of Coinbase, and I think that person still thanks me because I think they were focused too much on the title, that they were going to be the super senior person at this company on the management team, et cetera. But I said, \"Ultimately you don't realize this, but the value of working at a leader in any space, the quality of talent you work with, the brand, the network effect, so many things accrue to you. I would much rather be the number two or number three person.\"\n\n(00:11:25):\nIf you think of it that way, and the leader in a space, than the top person. Say Google versus Yahoo. I saw even if you're the VP of product at Yahoo or the head of product at Yahoo versus a ICPM at Google, you probably want to be the ICPM at Google. I bet you all day long, all day long. Yahoo is a great company, but Google is just a different caliber and different class. So I think it's very important to try to work at, obviously you don't know who the winner is, but if you think that's that something is a winner in a space, in large space, so many benefits that recruit from working at winners. You get unfair brand halo because you worked at a winner. People attribute a lot of the... \"Oh yeah, you worked at a winner. Hence, you must be a winner.\" Probably not the case, but you can... I'll take it.\n\nLenny (00:12:07):\nSo along those lines and kind of touching on your investor experience, what should folks look for to think about, is this going to be a winner? Or should they maybe join when it's like a series B, series C when it's kind of clear that it's doing well? Do you have any thoughts? Maybe for either a new person joining the workforce, maybe PM, let's say, or even later?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:12:25):\nPersonally, I feel like Hunter Walk wrote a very good post on it. He said that people who are joining the workforce new should generally join mid-stage companies because mid-stage companies you get some mentorship and it's not just basically whatever needs to be done and ultimately you don't build any deep skills. So mid-stage company I would define as something that is a multi hundred person company, but not maybe a thousand person company.\n\n(00:12:46):\nSomewhere from 300 to 500 people that has not just reached product market fit, but product market, channel fit. And the first product ideally is, the current product is on the way to becoming almost bulletproof. It's going to be a very, very strong product. And then it's really a path to becoming a platform beyond a product, where the company's thinking about, \"How do I become a platform?\" They have multiple products that serve the same customer, different problems, and they all complement and interlock with each other.\n\n(00:13:12):\nSo because, looking back on a career, always without really thinking about it, as employee number six, seven or 800 at Google, employee number, few hundreds at Facebook, employee number seven, 800 at Square. DoorDash was slightly later because just through an acquisition. So it was like I think 1,500 or something like all around. But DoorDash also, I think, yeah, but I think that's basically, at least for me, has worked.\n\n(00:13:35):\nAnd this is even when I was not a newbie, as I was in my career. So it's really a good spot I feel if you're joining a company. For many reasons.\n\nLenny (00:13:43):\nAnd this advice is for, you're saying new people but also maybe people further along in their career?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:13:48):\nI think unless you know the founders very, very, very well, joining a very early stage company is, especially now for the next one or two years, it's going to be a brutal market out there. So you've got to be really careful. There's going to be the days of raising around, few weeks after raising your prior round, of couple of months without much movement, without much company progress have... Are probably gone for most companies. And we all have seen now companies that have raised round at crazy valuations, deflate or die quickly. And so that's happened very quickly. You might just join and your company could die a week from now. So I think the other one is to really look at the financials and really understand that better.\n\nLenny (00:14:29):\nAwesome. That's really helpful advice. You mentioned Brian Armstrong, Brian Chesky and some of the other folks that you have worked with and gotten to know. I'm curious, of the companies you've worked at, say now Coinbase, on the board, Google, Facebook, Square, DoorDash, what are some things that have kind of stuck with you?\n\n(00:14:46):\nThings you've taken away about how to run a company, build a product? Or anything else that's just taught you a lesson about how to do what you're doing?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:14:54):\nOne of the most interesting things I've realized is there are multiple paths to greatness. What I mean by that is if I were to look at one word to describe each of the companies I have actually worked at. Google would be technical. It is very, very technical, technology focused, because Google believe, if you build great technology, they will come. Facebook was very growth focused. Very much, here's a goal, we want to hit 1 billion MAUs, let's work backwards from there. Square was very design focused. Let's build the cleanest minimalistic design, the most well designed product, then good things happen. DoorDash by nature is more operational, probably the right word to use where product and operational intertwined. Uber probably is the same word. So I think there are multiple paths to greatness, but I think the founder and market fit in terms of even the type of company that's needed is very strong.\n\n(00:15:46):\nIn other words, I think founders have to be authentic to themselves. The other thing I saw is that each founder, whether it's Tony Shoe at DoorDash or Jack, they all had their distinctive styles but they didn't try to change their style. In some ways the company was built almost in their image in some ways and that was fine. I think if you try to build a company that's inauthentic to who you are as a founder, that's not going to work. So ultimately you want to... If Jack tried to build a company that sold enterprise software, I don't think that would've worked. That's not who he is. And so you want a founder and a company culture that are essentially synonymous and founders to be authentic. And I think finally the one other thing that I've seen is, the product itself ideally needs to have some remarkability.\n\n(00:16:33):\nWhat I mean by that is, it needs to be better than anything else that solves that pain point along a few dimensions that really matter, even if it's worse along other dimensions. So I think every great product, it needs to have a lot of word of mouth. I think especially nowadays, I'm seeing a lot of consumer companies challenged because they relied on Facebook or paid media to drive customer acquisition, and bunch of young companies are coming to me saying, \"What do we do now?\"\n\n(00:17:01):\nI'm like, \"Look, the biggest thing you did wrong initially was you didn't pay enough attention to organic growth. Basically, was this product compelling enough that people talk about it and bring other people along? And you completely relied on paid and that's coming back to bite you.\"\n\n(00:17:16):\nSo a good metric is that 40 to 50% of your new customers should ideally come from organic channels and 50% from paid. If 90% come from paid, that means at some point that the music is going to stop.\n\nLenny (00:17:27):\nUnless you've got some magical insight or someone that's just killing it.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:17:31):\nA growth pack, right? Everyone's looking at this growth tag, but there is no... There's nothing like the silver growth tag bullet.\n\nLenny (00:17:37):\nIt's interesting, there are a couple companies I'm an investor in that are actually still working really well through paid. And so it's definitely possible but incredibly hard.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:17:45):\nYeah, those are exceptions that prove the rule.\n\nLenny (00:17:48):\nWhat I think of when you talk about this is that something Seth Godin shared a while ago that I always come back to you, this idea that your product has to be remarkable where people want to remark on it, for it to have a chance, especially in consumer, because that's how things start to grow. People just can't help but talk about it.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:18:04):\nExactly. Very well said.\n\nLenny (00:18:06):\nEasier said than done. Okay, so getting a little tactical. I'm curious to get your take on just the product development process at companies. How do you think about founders setting up a product development process? What do you recommend usually? And then maybe further down the line, when they get to like 25 people, maybe 50 people, how do you advise founders think about their product development process in the early stages and then as they evolve?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:18:30):\nI think first of all, the planning period is different at the very early stage. At the very early stage, it needs to be a weekly plan, where while as you grow the granularity, you still need weekly plans, but you also need quarterly plans that wrap around that. You start with quarterly goals. In fact, I was talking to a series A company and they were just starting the first several quarterly plan. They just did series A round, so they need to plan at a quarterly level and then it translates back into the weekly level. When you're very young, you're literally going week to week. And then once you become much bigger, you get to annual planning, which then leads to quarterly goals and so on. So the granularity is different. The second thing is the tools you actually use. I think initially you just have a very simple spreadsheet.\n\n(00:19:13):\nI am a big believer that you can have all these fancy project management tools. Whenever I've been a leader in a product team, I've never imposed a certain tool because I feel different PMs and teams find the right tool for them. It's about keeping it super simple. If you have too many complex tools, people don't know how to use them. Engineering teams typically use something like Jira, and as a product person you don't want another complex tool for them to use to figure out things. So a simple spreadsheet, and your founder that you update with things to do and people who are going to do it. And then that's basically it. I think as you grow, you start wanting to write a little bit more surviving, the first thing you start doing. And then as a very young company, you don't have a separate product strategy from a company strategy.\n\n(00:19:55):\nThe product and company strategy are the same. As you start growing, you have a go-to market strategy, product strategy, et cetera, et cetera. So you start more clearly separating out the company strategy from the product strategy. The first thing you start seeing is when a product manager joins... So I think of course what happens is that the 25 person status, you have a PM who sometimes joins the company. I think the right time for PMs to join the company is about eight to 10 engineers or so. Anywhere between five and 10. But 10 engineers is... Unless the founder themselves wants to be the PM, but that's when you start seeing a professional PM join and the PM typically wants to clearly articulate. Good PMs want to articulate what the product strategy is based on company strategy. So you start seeing the emergence of a separate product strategy doc that is written at the 20, 23 person stage, and the product strategy then makes choices. What customers are we serving? More clearly articulates what have been implicit hopefully earlier.\n\n(00:20:51):\nAnd then that guides product development. And then I think when you get really large, you have essentially multiple interlocking products that there are multiple product strategy docs. And then you get into more cross functional strategy docs, into product strategy doc, et cetera. But I think at the very core of it, there are two things. One, the team still needs to meet on a daily basis. There is a standup cadence, and that atomic team of six, seven people, which is engineers, product person, designer, hopefully an analyst, they are the product development team. And they still review the tasks on a weekly basis, but where it emanates from when you're young, it doesn't have any roots. It's literally, they're just living and dying on a week by week basis, trying different things till they get product market fit.\n\n(00:21:38):\nAs you go bigger and you have product market fit, you start building plans around that. And these iterations, these sprints then emanate working back from the goals that you set on a quarterly basis.\n\nLenny (00:21:49):\nWow. So much good advice. There's a couple things I want to follow up on there. What are some common pitfalls you've seen in startups trying to set up product development processes or the way they build product? What do you find are some of the more common mistakes that founders make? That early teams make?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:22:04):\nThe biggest one I think is, the founder becomes too tactical and disempowers their team. I think the founder thinks they know what customers want. I think they don't empower their teams enough and they basically just tell the engineers what to build. And I think that leads to teams that are basically tactically just shaping feature after feature without truly solving problems. And I think that then creeps into when you hire a PM, they see this is how the company's working and they then also start working the same way. I think the best founders early on trust their engineering teams and product development teams to solve problems and more clearly present a problem to them and help them. And this is true for PMs also. They help them brainstorm solutions and try to work with the team to understand why we chose a certain solution versus another solution. And then the team feels empowered to go build it versus it dictating them.\n\n(00:23:00):\nWhy should we build an iOS app, while the actual problem to solve is we want to increase the percentage of people using a service to five times a week versus two times a week. And building an iOS app is one tactic, but there are many other tactics. Which is improving our web experience, et cetera. So decision making and transparency of decisions around how products change customer behavior is probably the... And that leads to the culture of what is called a feature factory, where product teams basically are very proud of shaping feature after feature without truly knowing how much impact the feature has. If a feature is shipped, but it doesn't change customer behavior at all, is it really a feature or no? It's like a tree falling in the forest.\n\nLenny (00:23:41):\nOh my god, I love that. And I've definitely seen these teams that you're talking about and that only becomes worse once they hire a PM. I like your rule of thumb of hiring a PM when you've gotten eight to 10 engineers. What points to it's time to hire a PM, other than that? Is there other things you've seen of just like, \"Oh my god, this team really needs a PM,\" or they should wait longer? What have you seen there?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:24:04):\nI always feel that you should hire to solve a problem you're facing. You should never hire... Or you feel you're going to face. But especially I think just over-hiring, especially... You want to be efficient and smaller teams are always good. Smaller companies are always good, part of the problem. So there are many teams. First of all, the question is if the founder is able to play the role, someone needs to play the role of a product manager. If the founder is able to and willing to play the role of product manager. The problem is with eight to 10 engineers, if the founder is doing other things besides playing the role of a product manager, then the eight to 10 person engineering team is not being cared for and fed.\n\n(00:24:39):\nEngineers are by far the most expensive resources in the company. By far, right? I mean if you look at the composition of engineers versus... And PMs versus any other function, it's two to three, equity, cash, everything.\n\n(00:24:52):\nAnd if you think of it that way, then if you're not caring and feeding and not leveraging this amazing most expensive resource, well, that's a crime. That's a crime. In some ways you got to think about yourself. Am I, as the founder, is this 10 person team or 8 person team being leveraged? Are they solving the right problems? Do they know how to brainstorm? Do they know how to solve problems? Do I have the bandwidth to sit with them and present the right problems, talk to customers, figure out the right sequencing, the right prioritization of problems to work on, et cetera?\n\n(00:25:25):\nAnd if you're not able to do that, you've got to have someone who can do that full time. And it might be someone from the team. I mean there are two... We can talk about how to hire your first PM and there are many, many-\n\nLenny (00:25:36):\nYeah, let's do it. I definitely wanted to ask that. I know you wrote a great post about this, just how to actually hire your great PM and you have a strong opinion about that.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:25:43):\nYeah, I have a strong opinion and it might be just based on every single company I've been at. The first PM at every company has been someone who's either been an analyst or an engineer or a designer who's worked there already and they just move from their role to being a PM. Why? Because many cases, the role of the PM is actually to be the liaison between the founder, founders and the engineering team. And so it needs to be someone that the founders trust and the engineering team trusts and also they know how the founders and the engineering team work.\n\n(00:26:16):\nAnd many times if you bring a PM from the outside with a completely different process, many times the organ can be rejected by the body. And so they may not be the best PM you could get in terms of just functional skills, but they would be the best PM from a cultural assimilation. And getting the engineers just to understand the value of a PM and getting the founders to be comfortable, slowly being more hands off. Was it true of Airbnb, also? Was Joe not the first PM?\n\nLenny (00:26:46):\nHe was. And he was actually an engineer when he joined, so that's exactly how you describe. So say that you hire, or you transition someone from PM into their... Being the first PM. What are some signs that maybe they're not doing too well and things aren't going well and maybe you should go in a different direction?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:27:03):\nI think the biggest one is I always feel with PMs it's actually two or three things you can look at. One is, you can actually just ask the engineers themselves. Engineers are fairly blunt. And when I manage PMs, I've seen that they always tell me... Engineering managers in particular, they're very, very quick to tell you, \"Look, this person is not working, they're not being effective.\"\n\n(00:27:27):\nWhat value are they adding? And I think just number one thing you have to do is you have to, just because you hire a PM doesn't... You can't abdicate that responsibility of understanding how the team is doing. It's not gone. You've got to talk to the engineers and designers constantly to see, is the product manager adding value? Second, if you see the PM, the newly anointed PM still get too much into the how to build the product, which is really the domain of the engineers and designers.\n\n(00:27:53):\nSee? That's the other failure case where you've got to... And this is something through coaching comes. Obviously they just were an engineer or designer two weeks ago and now they are a PM. There's a immediate impulse to start going back into their comfort zone. And the key is to really push them to go more strongly biased towards customers and push them more towards talking to customers, understanding customer problems. And I think every PM, we all know this, all of us as PMs, there was no class to be a PM. So there are some people who joined APM programs directly out of school, but most of us are engineers, marketers, analysts, designers. And we became PMs after that. So we all come with inherent biases and ways of doing things and it's only a function of how long it takes us to shed... Or at least to not be that persona, but to actually take on a PM persona.\n\n(00:28:45):\nAnd so I personally believe in the growth mindset a lot. The reason that hopefully this person was chosen to be the PM is the founder saw that this person has the characteristics, traits, which is curiosity, the customer centricity, communication skills, being able to facilitate discussion, all of those things that a PM should have. Problem solving skills. And so hopefully those are things they didn't just pick a random engineer out of the 10, but they picked the right engineer, the right designer. And I think if you do that and you surround them with some good mentors, I think in six months they'll make good PMs.\n\nLenny (00:29:21):\nI love that. Maybe just try randomly. You never know.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:29:21):\nGood work.\n\nLenny (00:29:25):\nJust to close the loop on the idea of when it's time to hire a PM, somebody may be listening to this and feeling like, \"Oh, we got to get a PM in ASAP.\" What are some signs or reasons to wait a little bit longer before you hire your first PM?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:29:39):\nIf everything is going well? In other words, if your product team is clicking, if they're empowered and if you feel that they can take problems that you're giving them, not just tactics, but they're able to take a problem. Hey, we need to improve new user acquisition and the product team, the whatever, your product development team, which is just engineers able to take that and essentially act on it and suggest three different ways to improve user acquisition.\n\n(00:30:04):\nFor example, choose the one that has the best ROI, how you measure it, and then execute on that and then run a test to say, \"Look, it did improve user acquisition?\" That's a well defined product team. So I think you need an empowered product team that takes ownership and can take a problem, figure out all the options to solve the problem and then prioritize them. And so if you feel that's happening, you don't need a PM. But I've seen that it's hard as engineering teams grow. To engineers, I think they do need that partner. They really that partner to help facilitate that for the most part.\n\nLenny (00:30:39):\nThat's awesome advice. And yeah, I think that's going to be-\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:30:42):\nI think infrastructure is a great example. I think Stripe for example, is famous for not hiring PMs because I think when your audience is developers, they know their audience really well. And so I think many dev ops and developer facing companies, they don't have that many PMs. The PM to engineering ratio is very small. Even in Stripe today I bet it's much smaller than other companies. So those are exceptions that engineers truly understand the domain better. So the machine learning companies, infrastructure companies generally I think need fewer PMs. And this is true for any consumer product company. I bet Airbnb's infrastructure team had zero PMs, or very few PMs because they are serving other engineers. So I think those products, I think you need much fewer PMs than consumer facing products.\n\nLenny (00:31:27):\nThis episode is brought to you by Productboard.

Visit Productboard dot com to learn more.\n\n(00:32:15):\nYeah, I have a post where I have a whole table of how long companies waited before they got their first PM. I think Snapchat had like 200 people also, but I think it's because their designers basically played the role of a PM.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:32:27):\nThere we go, that's right. The designers played the role of the PM.\n\nLenny (00:32:30):\nSomebody's got to be doing the job, right? Hopefully they enjoy it, sometimes they don't.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:32:35):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:32:36):\nOkay. So say you've hired your first PM, you're building a product team. Something I wanted to get your take on is, as PM teams grow, sometimes they end up changing who they're reporting to. Sometimes it ends up being a CPO, sometimes a GM, sometimes like even a CTO in some cases. Do you have any thoughts on when it makes sense for product teams to report to say a GM versus a chief product officer or something else? Do you have any advice there?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:33:03):\nYeah, I've worked at companies where it's both functional, products orgs are functional. Where all the PMs report into the head of product, reports to a CEO, as well as a GM structure where PMs report into a GM, as do an engineering leader and a design leader and even a sales leader, marketing leader, et cetera. So both can work, but ultimately you want, I do think once you have three to four PMs, you do want those three to four PMs to report to a functional product leader just because I feel they want a mentor, first of all. They want a coach. And you want to build a product culture and hopefully discipline across those four or five PMs because the leverage you get. Someone said this, I think a few years ago, I remember this, engineers are obviously very important to hire, but a bad PM... You can get incredible errors from a good PM, but a bad PM can really screw up, can screw up the work of 10 engineers.\n\n(00:34:01):\nSo it's much more important to hire good PM than it is to hire a good engineer. Any good one. Because there's so few PMs for every engineer, that one good or bad PM can really screw up everything, compared to the impact of one good or bad engineer. So what that means for me is that if you have four or five PMs, and the one way to up level them is to actually make sure the four together are sharing best practices, learning, hopefully building a culture. And I think it's hard for a GM who's also managing other functions to do that.\n\n(00:34:32):\nSo I would say yes, maybe one or two PMs could report into a CEO or a GM or someone else, but once you get into a four or five PM team, they probably should report to a dedicated of product manager whose job is to be a mentor, be a coach, attract strong new folks to the team, hire, build a strong culture, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n(00:34:57):\nThat product manager, I think they could report to the CTO, they could report to the CEO, they could report to the GM. I don't think that matters. But the ICPMs is what I'm more worried about. Who do they report into? I think they should report into a dedicated manager once it gets a certain size.\n\nLenny (00:35:12):\nAwesome. I could not agree more. Another thing I've seen, as a lot of companies go one direction, they go GM models, then they go back to something else where it's completely business unit oriented and functional reporting and then they go back. So I found it, just try something. See if that works. You can always change it in the future. That's super common.\n\n(00:35:30):\nI wanted to transition to hiring, talk about hiring. You recently had this incredible thread on Twitter about how to hire a leader and I think maybe just a product leader, maybe broadly, leader. And so for folks that haven't seen that or have time to go on Twitter, I'd love to just hear your advice on how to hire a leader for a company.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:35:49):\nThat post actually was triggered by, that morning, one of my company CEO messaged me that, \"Wow, I hired someone from this company. How'd you know this person was available from this company?\" I was like, \"I didn't know about this person, I just knew this company was really good at sales. And so that's why I recommended the company.\" And he said, \"This is the third time I hired based on advice you gave and these are all senior leaders here. How did you do that?\" I'm like, \"Actually, thinking about it, you're right.\"\n\n(00:36:19):\nWhen companies ask me... Because the number one, if you ever ask a company, \"What's the thing that's keeping you up at night?\" They'll always say one of the things always that's keeping them at night, \"I want to hire a leader for X, Y, Z function.\" And I never respond with, here's a person. I'll always say, \"Well, you're in this space selling to this kind of customer or serving this kind of customer. Let's think about the best in class companies, who's also, who's very good at functionally the thing you're hiring for, serving the similar type of customer.\"\n\n(00:36:48):\nAnd so basically that was the origin of the post. And really what it says is, in order to hire, if you want to have a playbook for hiring good leaders or strong leaders for any function, look at best of class companies or companies that are best of class at that function in the similar space. Not your competitors, but you've got to look beyond your competitors. You've got to look at folks who are serving SMBs or enterprises or whatever this... Or consumers. And then say, \"Okay, I want to hire a head of marketing.\" Great. This is the hardest thing. Go to find the top three or four companies who are excellent at marketing to consumers. If that's what you're... Then you don't hire the person, the head of marketing at these companies.\n\n(00:37:31):\nYou hire the person who's reporting to them, the lieutenant. And actually, Adam Zamos, who was the head of people at Square chimed into say, \"At Square, early days we used to go...\" He used to run people, the people team at Square. \"We used to go and hire the up and coming lieutenants of the lieutenants.\" And so I think you basically have to build almost an org chart and it's not that hard. You just have to spend time on LinkedIn, to say who are all the people in the org? Who reports to? And you can ask some of your friends who work at a company to better construct the org chart and you just literally go through that company and pick out the people. And I saw this in practice because once Square went public, we were the only public finTech in 2015, one of the very few public fintechs.\n\n(00:38:16):\nAnd so my goodness, our teams were raided. The next two years, I literally saw the full team, a huge chunk of a team in different parts of payments, compliance, risk, just being raided by other fintechs. And I saw that this was being followed. Because you say, \"Okay, who's the company who's best in being in compliance? Square.\" And I'm sure there are other companies also, but Square was well known because it was public and it was large, they had done it at scale, et cetera. They didn't go after our head, they went after the lieutenant and the lieutenant of the lieutenant, et cetera.\n\nLenny (00:38:46):\nI see. So you saw this happening to you and then you've weaponized it in reverse. I love it. Great advice. I've never heard this advice before and it sounds incredibly good. And so thank you for sharing all that. Thank you. On the front of hiring, how much time do you think founders and leaders should spend on hiring? What percentage of their time have you seen the best founders and leaders spend?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:39:07):\nObviously you've got to always be hiring. Even today, I think Tony and DoorDash, if you have good strong people, you'll always say, \"Please make the intro if you have some amazing people,\" because you never know what you learn from these people, even if you don't end up hiring them. So, always want to meet great people. But I think in general a founder of a young company should spend I think two hours a day hiring and you should do it during the time. I think the challenge in hiring is, you've got to build a process first of all, and that takes a lot of heavy metal work, the right process for you to make sure you do reach out. And again, there are two parts of hiring, there's a lot of reaching out to people and then there's actually talking to people. So I would suggest spending one hour a day doing the reach outs and there it should almost be busy work because you almost figure out the process.\n\n(00:39:56):\nSo you should do it during the time of day where you don't have to put a lot of mental... Like, you don't need to be fresh because you need the fresh work for your actual company that you're running. But you need some time, fresh time to come up with the right process. How do you do LinkedIn reach out? Or whatever tools you use to reach out to. Who are the types of profiles, what roles you want to prioritize. So you need to find the right hour to do that in. The second hour should be devoted to actually meeting one or two people on a daily basis, and that's two half an hour conversations.\n\n(00:40:26):\nSo I think if you just do that, you'll actually, over even 30 days, think about it, you'll meet with 60 people. And you'll do 30 hours of LinkedIn's, just two hours out of say 10 hours a day. And let's say 20 hours, 20 days. So instead of 30. Because of weekday, that's still a lot of time. So I think two hours. Use Calendar. Calendar is your best friend there, use calendar. And I think that's more than enough to do really well on recruiting.\n\nLenny (00:40:50):\nI'm guessing that you can see a pretty big difference between the founders that you work with that do this sort of process and put in the time, and don't?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:40:57):\nOne hundred percent. I think putting in the process upfront is really important because you can flounder around, and then just spending a few, four, five hours upfront, talking to a few folks, coming with a good process can massively improve the because they say, right, it's all about once you aim the strategy or the direction you're going is much more important than the speed you go in.\n\n(00:41:18):\nIf you go in the wrong direction, it doesn't matter how fast you go, you're screwed. But if you go in the right direction, even if you go slightly slower, you're going to get there. So I think it's very important to set the direction of hiring, how exactly are you going to hire, what the process is, what your messaging is going to be, and really make sure you nail that before you do stuff.\n\nLenny (00:41:38):\nOnce you've hired someone, you give them a title. I know you have some strong opinions about titles and how to think about titles at startups and I'd love to hear your take on that.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:41:48):\nYeah, I think on titles, I personally feel that if you're young, you have a unique opportunity as a founder to set a culture in place where people care about scope and impact much more than they would titles. The titles I'm most opposed to, to be honest, I'm not opposed to titles. I think, tweeted about this and people interpret to think no one should have any titles. Titles, people... You want someone to be called a software engineer so you know what they're doing. But the titles I'm most against are director and VP titles. Director, senior director. Because those are the titles that lead to the most contention in the company, that lead to the most conflict, that lead to the most disgruntlement and heartache and managers having to constantly... And people basically staying on for the title, to put it bluntly, versus because their scope and impact.\n\n(00:42:39):\nBut I'm also against giving titles too early in a company. For example, I think the general counsel is a good title. I think Wall Street cares about it. It's important to hear who general counsel is, but I was meeting with a 25 person company today and that CEO told me... I was like, I always talk about what keeps you up at night? And this company's in somewhat of a legal heavy space. He is like, \"I need to hire a general counsel instantly.\" I said, \"Listen, yes, I know you need to hire a lead lawyer, whatever you call them. Or head of legal, but do not give the general counsel title at a 25 person company because the person at a 250 person company, hopefully you're going to be that in two, three years. It's going to be very different than the GC now. And you might, you still want to retain this person most likely because they're good.\n\n(00:43:22):\nYou just don't want them to be the general counsel. She's over and over again. And so, there are certain times you only can give once and if you give it to early, you can't then... That's the reason to avoid title as long as possible. If you give the VP engineering title at 25 people, how the heck are you ever going to have upgrade that person, upgrade that role? You have to basically let them go because you can't then say, \"This VP of engineering, now you're going to be made director of engineering or something,\" et cetera. It's very challenging.\n\nLenny (00:43:50):\nWhen I look at your LinkedIn, it's always funny because I think you're just like, \"Startup helper,\" or when you were running Caviar, I think it was like, \"Someone at Caviar,\" or something very vague. Clearly you live that yourself.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:44:01):\nAnd I saw the impact of it. I saw at, Square I think was the company, and I think Jack came up with this because he saw that Twitter titles were weaponized in different ways. And so he started this at square and that's where I truly saw the impact and never had a single discussion at Square with my team about what the title should be. And that was amazing. At other companies, always, \"I want to be promoted director. I want to be promoted to senior director.\" It's always, during promotion time. If you ask person what their goal is, even personal goals, sometimes they'll even write, I want to be promoted to director, but never had that.\n\n(00:44:37):\nHad stuff of course around scope, impact, compensation, that's great. I want to have conversation about that, but title? No.\n\nLenny (00:44:45):\nAnd just to summarize your advice there, what's kind of the role of thumb of titles if someone hasn't read that post?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:44:51):\nDelay it as long as possible and try to avoid granting director and VP level titles as long as possible, in particular.\n\nLenny (00:45:00):\nEasy. And then delay it, meaning have-\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:45:02):\nVery simple. [inaudible 00:45:05]\n\nLenny (00:45:04):\nAnd delaying titles, meaning like anything other than just software engineer, product management?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:45:08):\nSoftware engineer, lead. The word lead, or head of are both good, because the head of very clearly describes what they do or lead also very clearly describes what they do. So my title was Caviar Lead and then the people who reported to me were Caviar product lead, Caviar engineering lead, Caviar strategy and operations lead, Caviar sales lead, et cetera. And so the more words that are in the title, the more focused their role is. In fact, you can look at Jack's new title, it's Block Head, so it's literally not senior anymore.\n\n(00:45:40):\nIt's head of block, a block leader I would say probably should be more appropriate. He's a leader block, and then so on, it premieres down.\n\nLenny (00:45:48):\nAmazing. That's incredibly valuable advice and thank you for getting into the details there. I'd love to transition in to talk about investing a little bit before we get to our exciting lightning round. And so you spent a lot of your time angel investing, investing in a bunch of different ways. What's been your trajectory from just starting to angel invest early on to the scale you're at now?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:46:09):\nI started angel investing in 2007, 15 years ago. And like many people, I started because my friends and colleagues were leaving to start companies. This is when I was at Google and they were leaving to start companies. So I literally, without going much, I just wanted to support them because I'd worked with them. And so I just put a small check into their companies and some failed, some did really well. But ultimately I realized that for me, investing is all about supporting people much more so than companies themselves. The company itself, it's about the entrepreneur and the person. So till today, I think I have enjoyed the most and I've really come to believe in myself that I am a founder centric. I believe in the founder much more than I do the market. I think there are market centric investors. [inaudible 00:46:56] is amazing and they are very much believe in a big market.\n\n(00:46:59):\nI strongly believe that great founders, and Airbnb's a great example. They create new markets themselves, or they pivot. I mean, if they realize that a certain market is not good, they'll figure out a way to move. And I'm basically, with my check, the biggest mistakes I made early on were after a few checks I said, \"Oh, I'm going to be much more selective. I'm not just going to write checks with all my friends. I'm going to look to see what the market they're in.\"\n\n(00:47:25):\nSo I basically just started making these assumptions, \"Oh, well, I should not invest in this company.\" And turns out, almost all of them were sins of omission. I much more care about sins of omission because you can only lose one X your money. But for me, the relationship with the person, a person I know and respect and good friends with, and I'm not investing in them, I don't want to lose that.\n\n(00:47:48):\nAnd it's an optionality for me to invest in not just this company, but in every other company they start. Because one of the most interesting patterns I see is, folks who are unsuccessful the first time around, but then use those learnings to start a company in the same or similar space and then succeed. And I'm seeing this more and more happen and I want to have, if you don't invest in their first company, even though you thought they were great because the marketers are great, they won't probably come back to you for the second company either.\n\n(00:48:16):\nSo very, very founder centric style of investing, almost like YC, I would say. Closer to YC than anything else because YC invest in just founders at this point, they don't care about the idea. They just care that you're a builder and that you can pivot fast. And if you're a team of builders who can pivot fast, they will invest because they know within three weeks, if you don't have product market fit, they'll get you to pivot three times, and under that excitement, you'll find your product market fit four times. I see this again and again.\n\nLenny (00:48:41):\nI love that advice and it's the way I think about it too. The only downside is if you have worked at an awesome company or two or three, it becomes a very expensive hobby because you end up knowing a lot of awesome people that are doing great things. So you have to be a little bit careful.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:48:55):\nYou've got to really make sure what the motivation. That's what I really want to understand. You don't want folks, there are awesome people, but I do want to make sure they're doing it for the right reason. In other words, they're doing it to solve a problem that they've experienced themselves, or seen. So I really try to get into why they're starting the company and I want to make sure the reason for starting the company is authentic, in that it's a problem that they have observed deeply.\n\n(00:49:18):\nVersus, it's something they read about in Tech Crunch or it's a new US Web three or crypto thing or NFT thing. So I think that's how I suss out. So I don't invest in people, even if they're awesome, when I feel their idea for... The reason they're starting the company is mercenary and they're doing it, because they haven't immersed themselves in the space. Famously, I think the Collison Brothers bought a book, I think on payments, very old book or something I think... Or paper maybe, and read it to fully understand why you want people who really immerse themselves in an industry and live and breathe it before they tackle it.\n\nLenny (00:49:50):\nAre there other things like that, that you look for? That are just like, \"Oh wow, I really need to invest in this.\"\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:49:55):\nThe ability to hire talent before even you have... Or ability that, if you can show me that you have this set of amazing people lined up to join you or that you have commitments, or even your founders. I mean, the other thing I look for is definitely two person founding team. At least two is the ideal. I've seen solo founders I'm very nervous about because I think no one person has all the skills you need to start a company. And it's also a lot of things to do.\n\n(00:50:18):\nSo I do like to see a really good mix of basically a builder and a seller or a hustler and a hacker, whatever you call them. And I think that two person, I really feel comfortable, however good the one person is, I just feel it's... There are obviously one person founding teams that have worked well, but I think the two or three person founding teams, I feel much. Two is the ideal number. So I look for the two person founding team, complementary skills.\n\nLenny (00:50:43):\nThese are really, really handy rules of thumb that everybody could use. How do you find time to do this? So you have a full time job, I imagine it's extremely demanding, and then you're also doing a lot of investing for folks that are thinking about doing this on the side. How do you time box this and keep it sustainable and not just to go crazy and burn yourself out?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:51:00):\nTime boxing. Exactly what you said, Lenny, it's time boxing. Most of the time ironically is spent on DoorDash and... Not ironically. Logically is spent on DoorDash even though it may not appear it. So I spend on DoorDash and what I do is a small percent of my time, I basically... I keep looking at my calendar to see, am I spending more than I've worked, say 10 hours a day? Am I spending more than two to three hours, maximum three, ideally two hours a day on things that are needed to do my work?\n\n(00:51:25):\nAnd three hours actually is a lot. If you think about half an hour meetings with people, that's six meetings you can do a day, out of 10. And I also do two hours each on both Saturday and Sunday so that I can do four meetings each. So if you think about it, six times five is 30, or four times five is 20, plus another four, plus 4... 28 meetings, that's a lot of meetings you can do with people, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, so I think it's really time boxing and knowing... I think it is knowing what matters. Because if you find yourself doing the opposite, where 70% of time is investing, then you should actually become a full-time investor.\n\nLenny (00:51:59):\nThat's amazing. I don't know how you keep your brain capacity focused on so many things. Meeting with that many founders, even outside the time, is a lot of mental load.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:52:08):\nI enjoy it. I think the thing is, I enjoy it because I have been a founder myself, not a very successful one. So one of the things I love hearing, I always start with, \"Tell me your founding story.\" And every founder likes to tell the founding story. And that's where I listen closely for authenticity, to understand how they met each other, the two founders or multiple founders, how they knew each other, and how they came up with this idea that they're going after. Versus what problem they're tackling.\n\n(00:52:36):\nI have a standard set of questions I ask so that way I can spend my time not thinking of questions to ask but just listening and just learning. And then I also have a good ability to forget instantly. I take notes and then I just forget and go into the next meeting. So compartmentalizing well.\n\nLenny (00:52:52):\nHave you thought about publishing these questions that you ask? Or do you think that would hurt your chats?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:52:56):\nNo, I think it seems... Yeah, it seems too formulaic then. I think there's questions that then change based on what the answer. So it's not exactly a set of questions, but it always starts with, \"Tell me about your founding story of the company.\" I introduce myself and then asked them for their founding story. They're all nervous, pitching, et cetera when they pitch someone who could be an investor. We ask them to tell stories. It's the same for customer interviews, right? You never ask customers, \"Tell me your top three problems.\"\n\n(00:53:23):\nNo one knows what they are. But, \"Tell me the last time you used a food delivery service. Tell me the last time you used a payment service. How was it? Tell me the last time you took a payment, credit card payment. Tell me about your last customer.\" People love telling stories about themselves. Everyone likes talking about how they did something.\n\nLenny (00:53:40):\nFor somebody that's thinking about getting into angel investing, other than having capital and finding capital, what advice would you give folks?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:53:49):\nSee, the number one thing you need is, I think, besides... Number one thing is capital. Number zero thing. Number one thing is then you need to have deal flow, as they call it, or companies that you're meeting with and deciding. And then you need to know how to pick these companies. So you need to meet companies, you need to know how pick them. As an angel is generally easy. So I think you need to figure out how to get deal flow. And there are three ways to get deal flow to companies. One, you build your own brand. You can be like Lenny, who's built an incredible brand, or none of us can be like Lenny, but you can try to, we can all publish. The reality is, I used to tell every single person, \"You can build your brand on the internet. You can build your brand, social media channels.\"\n\n(00:54:29):\nThere's so many channels. And you have the person here who can teach the masterclass in that. You can build your brand. And just by doing that, you'll get people coming to you. Second, you have a lot of... Anyone in technology has other people they know who are angel investors. So it's just tell them, \"Hey, I'd love to help companies. If they're investing in a company, please let we know.\" And the more people you tell, the more likely it is, they'll remember you. And every time you meet them, reinforce that. And third, investors. If you do know venture capitals or investors, many of them are looking to bring on... There's typically a round when they lead companies around, there's typically an allocation for angels. But for all of those, the first and most important thing is you need to understand, how are you going to add value to these companies?\n\n(00:55:13):\nWhat is your differentiation? What do you stand for? Why should a company take your money? The best companies have much more than... As Lenny and I both know, their rounds are over subscribed. It is hard enough to get even $1 into their round, let alone a hundred thousand dollars or $5,000. So why would they take your money? And so that's the thing, you have to really figure out. What is your unique differentiation? What do you bring to these companies that no one else can? And I know that's hard, that's painful to figure out, but that is the introspection each of us needs to do.\n\n(00:55:44):\nThe way you do that is by just sharing your non-obvious insights. And don't just like... Basically just write. That's why I think writing is so powerful because it shows the world. My rule of thumb is when they do a search for you on Google, if your LinkedIn profile is the first thing that comes up, you've probably done something wrong.\n\n(00:56:02):\nWhat should come up is an article you wrote. Is a tweet you published. Is someone mentioning you on something else, et cetera. Because that's when, clicking on it, they know what you stand for by that content about you, by you, et cetera. Yes, Mike Morritz can get away with LinkedIn because no one needs to know what he has done. But for the rest of us, we need to build our brand, what we stand for. And it'll change over time. I used to basically believe I should just think about product development, how to lead product teams, engineering teams. For over the last five years, since I've led broader teams, I now share stuff which is much broader than that. And so what I stand for and what value I add has changed and evolved and hopefully increased over time. The same will happen. But you've got to take ownership of your brand on the internet.\n\n(00:56:46):\nNo one else can. No one else can. It's not your company. You've got to transcend the companies you work for. If your identity is X, Y, Z, worker drone at A, B, C company, that's not enough. You've got to be X, Y, Z expert in A. Or whatever that A is, even if it's a niche thing, that's okay. Every company leads... So many companies come to me, \"I want a payments expert.\" And then I'll find someone who's a payments expert for them because they're trying to build a fintech practice or something. So be an expert in payments, if that's what you know. Write about non obvious insights on payments. Doesn't need to be a functional discipline like, Lenny and I are doing product or something. Can be a domain. Risk, payments, crypto. Think about crypto, right? The people who got into crypto, and I just read a post by this guy, Richard Chen, he graduated from Stanford.\n\n(00:57:33):\nI don't know him, but I read incredible post. He runs this firm fund called One Confirmation, which is a top fund. He graduated from undergrad four years ago. That's all he did. I mean, he was head of Stanford Blockchain. He wrote, he writes amazing stuff. He's built a brand for himself. Kudos to him. 25 years old, probably.\n\n(00:57:50):\nNever met the guy, but I was like, this guy knows what he's doing. Watch his LinkedIn. Oh my God, he's never worked at a company. He's basically been out of school for four years, but he has incredible insights.\n\nLenny (00:58:00):\nWait till he hears this podcast. He's like, \"Holy shit, they're talking about me.\"\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:58:04):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:58:06):\nI hope he's a listener and if not, we got to find him. Okay, we are now at the lightning round. And so what I'm going to do, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions real quick. Whatever comes to mind, let me know. If nothing comes to mind, that's also cool. And then we will wrap up. Are you ready?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:58:21):\nPerfect. Ready.\n\nLenny (00:58:22):\nOkay. What's a book that you've recommended most to other product leaders?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:58:27):\nPlaying to Win: How Strategy Really Works. It's a book called Playing to Win and the subtitle is How Strategy Really Works. Very good book.\n\nLenny (00:58:34):\nAmazing. I have not read that. I will check that out. What's a company that you recommend to people that are looking for new gigs? Maybe product managers, maybe any other function?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:58:44):\nDoorDash. Incredible operational excellence. And what you learn here, I have myself learned a lot in the two years I've been here, about new ways of the attention to detail. Operational excellence, unparalleled.\n\nLenny (00:58:56):\nI usually include, you can't mention the company you're working at now. Is there another company by any chance? And if not, you can have that.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:59:02):\nI would say Coinbase, if you're interested in crypto. I am technically a board member. I truly believe. I think if you are interested in crypto, Coinbase has such a diverse set of things that they work on that it is literally, you can work on almost any part of crypto, from NFTs to wallets to custody to infrastructure. They have a company they called Bison Trails, which does infrastructure. So you can truly, it's like Google, worked on everything. You could work in YouTube, you can work in search. Coinbase, I think the same thing. You can work in 10 different products and within two years or three years, learn the complete spectrum, crypto ecosystem.\n\nLenny (00:59:37):\nAlso an Airbnb alumni founder.\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:59:39):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:59:40):\nWhat's your favorite app right now?\n\nGokul Rajaram (00:59:42):\nOver the last few weeks it has been Coinbase wallet. I've been playing around. I just was a hoarder. I basically just had held Bitcoin Ether for many, many years, but then over the last couple of months I just said, got to just... In the Coinbase board meetings, you listen to all of these things. I'm like... Got to now diverse and beyond and actually got to start staking stuff, going on distributed exchanges, or decentralized exchanges and just basically playing around with Coinbase wallet because earlier I wasn't using wallet. I was just using Coinbase dot com where you can't do any of this stuff. And then DoorDash is the other one. I think I truly use it to order food every day. But Coinbase wallet is one I'm using a lot now.\n\nLenny (01:00:24):\nAwesome. I got to check that out. I just got access to the Coinbase NFT stuff, and so yes, it'll pull me into the Coinbase ecosystem. Okay, a couple more questions. Who is a favorite person to follow on Twitter or Instagram? Especially these days?\n\nGokul Rajaram (01:00:38):\nExactly. [inaudible 01:00:40].\n\nLenny (01:00:39):\nEasy choice. All right. Who's a favorite manager that you've had over the years?\n\nGokul Rajaram (01:00:44):\nAll of them. I've learned different things through them. So no easy choice there.\n\nLenny (01:00:49):\nNo favorites. All right. Taking the easy way out. And then what's a favorite interview question that you like to ask in interviews? Not with founders, but with hiring.\n\nGokul Rajaram (01:00:56):\nWhat are you most proud of? The interview question is a good one. Tell me about something that you're most proud of. What is the accomplishment, career accomplishment you're most proud of? Because it tells you how they measure their impact. Tells you a lot about what they care about, how they measure their impact. If they say, \"As a PM I launched X, Y, Z feature,\" they're talking about the impact and the kind they value it. Something about that. Or if they talk too much about them versus the team, et cetera. So you get a lot from that question. It's a loaded question.\n\nLenny (01:01:24):\nAmazing. I love that question. Okay. Where can folks find you online and how can people listening be helpful to you?\n\nGokul Rajaram (01:01:31):\nI am on Twitter, G-O-K-U-L-R at GokulR on Twitter. And I always say the best way to help me, just help the broader ecosystem. Pay it forward, and if you pay it forward, at some point, whoever you paid forward helps me at some point. But if all of us paid it forward, the world would be a better place. Pay it forward. And then, like I said at the very beginning, believe in the power of serendipity, and I need to listen to Lenny's TED talk on that.\n\nLenny (01:01:58):\nOh boy.\n\nGokul Rajaram (01:01:59):\nSerendipity, paying it forward.\n\nLenny (01:02:01):\nAmazing. What a great way to wrap it up. Thank you so much for being here. Gokul.\n\nGokul Rajaram (01:02:05):\nThank you, Lenny. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (01:02:06):\nThat was awesome.

And you rub the lamp and this genie comes out and the genie says, \"Hey, I can give you one wish. Whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life and your career, it's going to turn out great.\" If that were true and you had that genie, what would you wish for? At some point in this one life we get, you want to get yourself on that path of that journey.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):\nThis whole exercise connects to something that you're a big advocate of, this idea of getting out of autopilot mode in your life.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:00:40):\nYou're unconscious, and you may not even realize why you're doing what you're doing or even realize what you're doing. So for example, I get up, work out, drive into work, fight traffic, commute, maybe I return some emails, fight traffic on the way home, rush through dinner, go to bed. It's not a day that is intentional. It's not a day where I've said, \"Where do I want to be going with my life? What's important to me in this world?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):\nYou another quote, which is, \"Everything that you want is on the other side of worse first.\"\n\nGraham Weaver (00:01:07):\nPick anything. You want a better body? Okay, you're going to need to go to the gym. When you go to the gym the first few times, it's going to not be that fun. The first move is negative. If I'm optimizing for tomorrow and I just want to have a great day tomorrow, I'm going to stay exactly where I am. So many people I see have this happen, where they hit a plateau and they never move past it, because they're not willing to have that hard day, month, week, year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):\nWhen should you quit something, because some things are just not worth it.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:01:37):\nI think the time to quit is when you can no longer ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:44):\nToday, my guest is Graham Weaver. Graham teaches a top-rated course at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, a course which is technically called Managing Growing Enterprises. But as you'll hear in our conversation, he ends up mostly helping students figure out what to do with their lives and how to get out of the autopilot mode that most people are in. He recently won Stanford Graduate Business School's 2024 MBA Distinguished Teaching Award. And teaching is actually his side gig. His full-time job is founder and CEO of Alpine Investors, a private equity firm, which based on my research, is one of if not the top-performing private equity fund in the world. So the advice you're going to hear today is coming from someone who is actually doing the thing, not just teaching the thing.\n\n(00:02:28):\nIn our conversation, we cover practical exercises that can help you figure out what you should do with your life, including something he calls the genie framework and the nine lives exercise. We talk about why life is suffering, and you may as well choose something worth suffering for, also, why most things in life that are worthwhile take more time than you expect, some practical advice for creating accountability in your life to help you achieve your goals, and so much more.\n\n(00:02:53):\nIf you listen to this episode and actually try some of the exercises that Graham shares, I promise you that your life and your future will be better off.

Product leaders, yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration. They're not fun for you to scope, build, launch, or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place. Lucky for you, the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS. Organizations like Ramp, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customers' accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases in their product, or HRAS data to auto-provision and deprovision access for their customers' employees. And yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all? Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny, and receive a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny.\n\n(00:04:23):\nThis episode is brought to you by Persona, the adaptable identity platform that helps businesses fight fraud, meet compliance requirements, and build trust. While you're listening to this right now, how do you know that you're really listening to me, Lenny? These days, it's easier than ever for fraudsters to steal PII, faces and identities. That's where Persona comes in. Persona helps leading companies like LinkedIn, Etsy and Twilio securely verify individuals and businesses across the world.\n\n(00:04:52):\nWhat sets Persona apart is its configurability.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:05:38):\nThanks so much for having me, Lenny. I'm super excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:40):\nOkay, so you are ostensibly a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, of a class called Managing Growing Enterprises. But I was reading an interview with you, and you shared that when people come ask you for advice, they're not asking, \"How do I start a company? How do I manage my growing enterprise? How do I make my company grow faster?\" Most of the questions, the most common question you get, which is surprising to me, is, \"What should I do with my life?\" First of all, is that accurate?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:06:10):\nYeah, that is accurate. About half of all the times I meet with students, that's the question they ask. It's really funny too, because sometimes they'll come with a PowerPoint presentation and a two-by-two matrix and an expected value and all that. But really they're asking the question of, \"Hey, what should I do with my life,\" which is, by the way, a great question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:29):\nWhy do you think that's the case? That's not what I would imagine someone at an MBA school in a business class asking for advice on.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:06:36):\nMy typical meeting with a student will say, the student will start to tell me about these two or three different career or job alternatives that they have, A, B and C. Let's just use two, A and B. And then they go through and they start talking about A, and they tell me all the pros and the cons of A, and they go through it. And then they go through B, and they start telling me all those things. And I start asking some questions.\n\n(00:06:56):\nAnd after about five or 10 minutes into that, I can tell that their heart and their soul and their energy is really for B. That's really what they want, but they're talking themselves out of B, and they're going to talk themselves into A. So what I try to do is, A, first, I try to let them realize that their real energy is for B, just let them feel that and understand that. And then secondly, I try to figure out, what are the limiting beliefs they have? What are the fears? What are the obstacles? What are the voices in their head? What are all the societal pressures that are keeping them from doing B? And then we try to deconstruct those and get them to go do B. So that's the process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:41):\nIs there an example of a student going ... just this actual conversation you had with someone?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:07:45):\nAbsolutely. So there's a great example of a student of mine was from Brazil. And he came in and his prior job prior to business school was he worked in consulting. And that was more or less what he wanted to do. And then at some point I asked the students, \"Okay, imagine you knew you were going to be successful and you were going to have a dream. And whatever you dreamed was going to come true, what would you dream for?\" And he wanted to start a nonprofit in his home country of Brazil to help students have more access to education. That was what came up for him.\n\n(00:08:27):\nAnd over the course of our class, we just chipped away at all the fears and limiting beliefs of why he shouldn't or couldn't do that. And by the end, that's what he did. And so that's a real life example. And there's all kinds of other examples, but that second one of going and starting a charity, it's not on the beaten path. It's not what probably your parents are thinking you should do. There's probably 100 reasons not to do it. You probably don't know exactly how to start, and so it's intimidating. But if you start with this idea, \"Hey, five years out, 10 years out, I know I'm going to be successful,\" and work backwards from that, you're going to come up with a better answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:07):\nThis is a framework that you call the genie methodology or the genie framework, this question that you just asked that we should spend more time on, which is ... I guess, you tell the story of the genie and how to think about this [inaudible 00:09:20].\n\nGraham Weaver (00:09:19):\nWell, when I was 13 years old, I used to listen to these motivational tapes, mowing lawns. And I'm pretty sure it was Brian Tracy had this exercise. And I've adapted it, so I'll use my exercise now. So I say basically imagine that you're walking home from work and you see this bright, shiny object. You walk over and you realize it's a magic lamp. And you rub the lamp and this genie comes out and the genie says, \"Hey, I haven't been in this bottle for 10,000 years yet, so I'm not fully formed. So I can't give you three wishes. But what I can do is I can give you one wish. And the wish I can give you is whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life and your career, it's going to turn out great. It's going to work out great. It's probably going to take longer than you think. It's going to be harder than you think, but you're going to be really happy you did and it's going to work out beyond your wildest imagination.\" If that were true and you had that genie blessing you with that wish, what would you wish for?\n\n(00:10:19):\nAnd then the students come up with an answer that's really close to their heart. It's a thing they would do, absent the fear of failure. And then the second part of the exercise is basically that's what you should go do. You should be spending your life in pursuit of your genie goal. Maybe you can't start that tomorrow; you have financial obligations, maybe there's some experience you need. But at some point in this one life we get, you want to get yourself on that path of that journey. And that's the exercise that I go through with the students.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:56):\nIt's such a simple idea, that I can totally see how it could be so powerful. And I love the way it's framed as not like it'll guarantee you'll be successful. It's instead, I'll guarantee you'll be happy.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:11:09):\nYou'll be happy that you took the path. And the reason I say that is that usually the genie goal is the not well-trodden path. So you don't even know exactly what the goal is. This charity to start education for underprivileged kids in Brazil, that takes its own form over the course of a decade. And it will almost certainly turn out differently than you think. So it's more that you'll be really happy you went and started that journey, and it will go great. It'll probably go differently and take longer than you think though.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:46):\nWhat are some other examples of genie goals folks have followed that are kind of non-traditional and they've ended up being happy about it?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:11:52):\nMine was buying companies in my dorm room at business school. I have a student who's starting an amusement park in Texas. That's a pretty crazy example. Many students who are leaving their job and doing startups. A lot of students who going in the nonprofit world. So really just lots of examples. It's as variant as the number of students I have. And that's the magic of it, because you have inside of you some really unique dream that you maybe haven't even shared. And the goal is that that's your uniqueness, and that's what you should be bringing into this world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:37):\nThis whole exercise connects to something that you're a big advocate of, this idea of getting out of autopilot mode in your life. And the way I think about it is people ... and I'm going to ask you to describe it, but just it's almost like you're driving and you've never turned off the cruise control in your car, and you don't realize it. Talk about this idea that most of us are in autopilot and why it's so important to realize that and get out of it.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:13:00):\nYou start off and you're unconscious, and you're kind of going through the motions. And you may not even realize why you're doing what you're doing or even realize what you're doing. So for example, a typical person gets up, they have whatever their morning routine ... I'll use myself. I get up out, work out, take a shower, drive into work, fight traffic, commute. I'm late. I get in, I'm late to a meeting, I'm kind of rushed meeting; meeting, meeting. Okay, quick break for lunch. Maybe I return some emails; a few more meetings, a couple of Zoom calls. Fight traffic on the way home, rush through dinner, get back on email. Go to bed. Okay, that's my day. And that's a busy day. I felt like I did a lot. I'm exhausted, but it's unconscious.\n\n(00:13:45):\nIt's not a day that is intentional. It's not a day where I've said, \"Where do I want to be going with my life? What's important to me in this world? What are my values? What 10 years from now will I wish I was starting to embark on?\" Adding that level of intentionality and then working backwards from that is really the magic of getting to that 10 years from now and looking back without regret and getting to a later point in your life and feeling like you're doing the thing you're put on the earth to do as opposed to just going through the motions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:22):\nSo the question then here is, how do you get out of that autopilot mode? Because first of all, no one really realizes this is the case. And I'll tell a quick story. We're going to different preschools and daycares for our son. He's a year and a half oldish. And we went to this Montessori school, and the teacher's like, \"I'm going to be very clear: what we're doing here is informing your child's subconscious. That's what they're learning here. And that's a huge responsibility. We put a lot of love into that idea, but it's very important you understand that's what we do at the school.\" And I never thought of it that way.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:14:56):\nThat's amazing that they said that. So you just opened up another part of this, which is depending on what research you read, somewhere between 95% and 98% of our thoughts are subconscious. And those get programmed in somehow, some way. A big part of that, by the way, is media, our friends, our parents, our boss, our coworkers, what we think we're supposed to do, social media: \"This is cool, buy this Ferrari,\" all these different things. And then you're just operating out of that. And so the idea of being intentional is create space, get out of that, get out of the fog of war, make some space. We'll probably get to this in a little bit, but I do it with an executive coach, and really ask deep questions, make space, ask questions, create the intention that you want in each of the areas of your life. And then start having your calendar reflect that intention.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:58):\nAnd so this genie exercise is one approach, is just ask yourself this question. Can you say it again just for folks so they don't miss it, what's the question you should ask yourself?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:16:08):\nI mean, the biggest question I think with respect to your career is, within reason, what would you do if you knew you wouldn't fail? That's the biggest question. I'll give you a few more if you want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:24):\nYeah, please.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:16:26):\nDifferent questions trigger different things with people that could be helpful, trigger in a good way. So here's a few more. If you didn't have to make money, what would you do? And that'll answer what you enjoy. Naval Ravikant has a great question, which is, what's play for you that is work for other people? So for you, Lenny, that might be a podcast. That might be play for you; that's really fun. You're always going to do better at that. You're going to spend more time, you're going to enjoy it more. That's a good one.\n\n(00:17:00):\nAnother one is, what's the thing you really want to do? But you're just too embarrassed to say it? And my answer to this question was that I wanted to be a motivational speaker like Tony Robbins. And I was super embarrassed to say that, but that actually works into a lot of my life at this point. Another question, who are some people that you admire and want to be more like, and what do they do? Where do you find those people? What are some things you want to learn and how do you want to grow over the next five, 10 years? So I know a lot of your listeners are working in tech. So five, 10 years from now, you're amazing, you're best in the world at X. What's X? And how do you start to work toward becoming great at X? So there's just a few more other questions you could throw in to help you figure out some things you're excited about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:55):\nYou mentioned this idea of limiting beliefs. And I think a lot of people listening to this are probably having these beliefs right now of, \"Okay, but I have a family to support. Am I going to go start a charity in Brazil? That's absurd. It sounds easy, but I can't actually change my life this radically.\" Can you just share something to help people get past that in some way?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:18:14):\nSure. The first thing I would say about limiting beliefs is they're the most powerful and the most dangerous when you don't even know what they are. So when they're in the recesses of your subconscious mind, that is 95% of your thoughts, that's when the limiting beliefs are the most dangerous.\n\n(00:18:32):\nSo a simple example might just be like I have a limiting belief that I'm not funny. That's in my subconscious and I don't even realize I have it. So I avoid things where I'm trying to be funny or tell jokes. I mean, that's a silly example. But let's use your career now and come up with some maybe deeper ones. Let's use that charity example, the Brazilian charity, \"I'm going to start a Brazilian charity.\" What are the limiting beliefs? Well, oh my gosh, there's a million. \"I don't know how to start. I don't know how I would pay for myself. I have business school debt. I don't really know what I'm even talking about. I don't even have a plan for it. How would I get funding?\" Those are all these things that are flooding your mind.\n\n(00:19:15):\nSo the first exercise is just write all that down. Just get it down on paper, and then two things will happen. One is when you get it down on paper, it will almost immediately strip that limiting belief of a lot of its power and a lot of its scariness. Because now it's just something like, for example, \"How would I fund this?\" So the second thing that is that a lot of that scariness becomes just a to-do item. In the recesses of your subconscious, that is a very scary, limiting belief that will actually keep you from doing the thing you love. Once it's on paper, now it's just a to-do item that you can actually deal with with your conscious mind, just like you do anything else. So, \"How would I fund this,\" just becomes a plan, like, \"I need to design a plan where I'd get funding for this charity.\" And then that just is a problem like any other problem. It's not this nebulous, scary fear. It's just literally a to-do item.\n\n(00:20:14):\nSo the first part of limiting beliefs, write them down, understand what they are, look at them in the cold day of light on paper, and then translate them into things that are just obstacles to be overcome. And by the way, if you're listening to this podcast, you've overcome millions of obstacles in your life, and these are no different once they're down on paper.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:34):\nAre you actually doing these exercises with your students? They're taking a class about growing their enterprise and then it's like, \"Okay, let's analyze what you want to do with your life\"? Is that how this class goes?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:20:42):\nThat's a really good question. So I'll give you a little bit of background. So I was a case guest at Stanford Business School while I was buying companies in my dorm room. And it was talking about all the things that went wrong. And so it's kind of a really fun case. And I did that for 12 years. And I started to realize that was my most energetic day of the year. And so long story short, I started teaching a class full time. So I did that for four years. And I was teaching the Xs and Os of being a CEO, basically: hiring, firing, having hard conversations, managing a board, fundraising, selling, all the things you would imagine that a young CEO would need to know.\n\n(00:21:20):\nAfter about four years, I started to realize that was great, except that no one went and did it. So the class is on entrepreneurship, and they learned how to be an entrepreneur. There was only one problem: they didn't actually become entrepreneurs. So then I said, \"Well, wait a sec. I have to readjust my class a little bit, and I have to spend some time on the stuff we've just been talking about: finding out what your dream is, your limiting beliefs, starting to map out goals toward your actual entrepreneurship dream or whatever your genie goal is.\"\n\n(00:21:53):\nSo the way I say it is the university allows me to teach the class because I teach them entrepreneurial tricks, tactics, tools that will help them become a great CEO. But the real reason I teach is because I'm trying to help people really go find the thing that they're excited about and get into the life path of doing that thing. So I do both, but I do the second one kind of ... maybe that's not the headline of the course, although I think that's probably why people like the course so much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:30):\nIt's like a Trojan horse element.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:22:32):\nExactly, yeah. Tony Robbins used to say that people hire him for success, and he has to give them that so that he feels like he earned his money, but what he really delivers them is fulfillment. And it's a little bit like that. People take my class to learn how to be a CEO, but what they really get is hopefully on the path of doing the thing they want to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:54):\nA lot of what you've been talking about, it's almost an assumption that you'll be more successful and happier if you follow your energy, your passion, versus the, \"Here's how I'll make a bunch of money. Here's how I'll move up the ladder.\" Can you speak to that?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:23:09):\nYeah. Gosh, Lenny, it sounds so cliche when you say it like that, that I almost cringe a little bit. Let me try to give it a little bit different framework where it won't sound as ... because cliches are cliches because they're true. But let me try to give you a little bit different framework to think about it.\n\n(00:23:29):\nI think about it as you have sort of your heart or your soul or your internal scorecard, and then you have your head and your mind and the world's external scorecard. And I'll speak from this from experience. So when I graduated from business school, I took the job I was supposed to take. And it was the safe job at the big private equity firm that paid well and looked great on my resume. And I took that job. That was the external scorecard. My head said that. I built an expected value calculation, all that stuff.\n\n(00:24:02):\nThe problem was it wasn't my internal scorecard. It had nothing to do with what I actually cared about and wanted to do with my life. And so the way that shows up is just this tension, friction, stress, anxiety, burnout, all those things. And you can will that, you can will yourself through for long periods of time. In fact, if you want, you can will yourself through that your whole life.\n\n(00:24:31):\nBut then once I got into the path of the thing that I was excited about, that's when I really felt my energy change dramatically. And I developed almost a superpower in that thing, because I had more energy. I was willing to work longer, I was willing to do it. I've been running my company now for 23 years. I was willing to do it for a longer period of time. I thought about it in the shower. I thought about it when I went on runs. I talked to people. They wanted to join because I was excited. And it was a whole different level of power and life force that I was able to bring to that.\n\n(00:25:14):\nSo I'm saying this from experience, that you're going to show up so much differently in the thing that you're excited about, that that alone is going to make your life a lot better. But the great irony is you're going to do so much better in that thing than you are the thing you are, quote, \"supposed to do.\" And I certainly, certainly understand that people have real life constraints on their finances. And I 100% get that. And so a big part of what I do with students is work through those things and say, \"Okay, great. Let's talk about this job you're going to take for X years and you're going to pay off your loans or whatever. But during that time, let's get you on the path of the thing you really want to do.\" So sometime soon in your life, you want to get on that path.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:02):\nThere's a bunch of directions I want to go here. One is I'll just share, what you're describing is exactly what happened to me, without knowing this advice. I just started writing things online because the poll was there and people seemed to enjoy it. So I just kept following that path. And the whole time, my wife's like, \"You can't make money writing on the internet. That's not a thing. Why would you do this? You have all these skills, that you can make a lot more doing other things.\" But I just kept doing that, and that's what led me to this life now where I make much, much more than I made as a product manager at Airbnb. And also, it's a lot less stressful. And so, I'm a living example [inaudible 00:26:39].\n\nGraham Weaver (00:26:38):\nYeah. And if you go back to what I was saying before, you probably were answering the question, \"What would I do if I didn't have to make money?\" You just did that because you enjoyed it. What's play for you that's work for other people? What do you do in your free time? You were answering all those questions. And then I think a lot of people just say, \"Oh, well, that's just a side hustle or a hobby.\" It is until it isn't, right? And you're a great example of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:04):\nJust to set it some expectations with folks, you tell me, how often does this actually work out for someone where this ended up being the right path for them, that it ended up working well for them? Just because people can hear this and be like, \"Yeah, okay, I'm sure it works for some people; probably not for most people.\" What's the success rate, however you define that, for your students?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:27:25):\nOkay, so the short answer is I don't know, because I don't have full information about how my students do or what their path would have been had they not done it. So it's a kind of difficult question to answer. But what I would say is that the formula you're solving for is you, excited about something for a decade or more. So what has to happen? You excited about something. We just talked about what that is. The decade or more is going to come true more likely if you're excited about it. But also, you have to go in at the beginning with that mindset and the structural ability to stay at it for a long period of time. So the missing ingredient in most of the people that fail is time.\n\n(00:28:18):\nAnd I'll use myself as an example. I started Alpine. We lost money on our first fund. We started doing well. We got hit by the recession, we started digging out, whatever. But long story short, I was 14 years into running my firm until I could say with confidence we were going to even stay in business, let alone be really successful. And probably 18 years until we were what I would say really successful by external standards. And now 23 years, we've had a great run. But if you take away the time period, then I would've gone down as one of the, quote, \"failures,\" as opposed to, I would say, one of the success stories using this methodology.\n\n(00:29:10):\nSo time is the variable. And I think the biggest part of that is it's really, believe it or not, not typically the finance or the structural piece. It's the entrepreneur or the individual's willingness to actually stay with it. And then upstream of that, it's their belief about how long it's supposed to take. And I really hate this about the social media and just media in general, where they try to paint this picture that things are going to happen overnight. And we've invested in 600 businesses. Let's say 550 of those are founder-started businesses where we're the first money. I've never, in one of those examples, seen anyone who did something quickly. They've all been very, very long stories to get to that point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:12):\nThis reminds me of a quote I read. I don't know if you wrote this or you shared it, this idea that the life is suffering, so choose something worth suffering for.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:30:20):\nI wrote that, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:22):\nYou wrote that. Talk about that, because it feels like it's exactly what you're describing. It's going to take a long time to figure something out.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:30:28):\nExactly. Yeah, exactly. I'm glad you brought that ... Yeah, I mean, think about it. Again, using myself as an example, the first job I had, I wasn't suffering any less. I was getting on planes, I was working late hours. My time was not my own. If I would've had kids, I'd be missing their little league games and all that stuff. So I'm doing that anyway. I'm just doing it for something I don't care about. And then I start my own company and I was, quote, \"suffering,\" getting on planes, doing all that. It was just something that I cared about. So yeah, the quote, \"Life is suffering. So figure out something worth suffering for,\" you're going to suffer either way. And that's another thing I think people don't realize, is there isn't really a path that is easy that I've ever found.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:16):\nYou have another quote along these lines, which is, \"Everything you want is on the other side of worse first.\"\n\nGraham Weaver (00:31:21):\nYeah, I mean, I know those are two non-super optimistic quotes perhaps, but I think they're true. The second one, everything you want is on the other side of worst first, and this is something where I almost can't think of many exceptions to this. Pick anything. You want a better body? Okay, you're going to need to go to the gym. When you go to the gym the first few times, it's going to not be that fun. You're going to set your alarm, you're going to get sore. It's not going to be great. You're going to have to probably make some changes to your diet. That's not going to be fun, at least initially. And so that's one example.\n\n(00:32:05):\nYou want to change careers, you're going to have to learn a new career. You're going to have to leave your career. You're going to have to maybe interview for new jobs, or whatever it is. In each case, the first move is negative. The first move is negative to getting in shape. The first move is negative to get out of a bad relationship, to get into a career you want to be in. The reason I think that's important to say is because if I'm optimizing for tomorrow and I just want to have a great day tomorrow, I'm going to stay exactly where I am, because my life will be better tomorrow if I don't make any changes. I don't have to break up with my girlfriend, have a hard conversation, have the tears, be alone, go on dating apps. I don't have to do that if I just stay in it one more day.\n\n(00:32:55):\nSo if you realize this and instead ask the question, the version of myself five years from now, what would they wish I was going to do right now? So I can guarantee your five-year version of yourself will say, \"Get out of that toxic relationship, no matter how painful it is for the next two months.\" And if you can make decisions from that, and then on top of that, realize it's going to get worse first, then that's why I say everything you want is on the other side of worse first. But if you don't do that, you just end up plateauing. And so many people I see have this happen where they hit a plateau and they never move past it because they're not willing to have that hard day, month, week, year whatever it is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:45):\nI am imagining many people hearing this right now are like, \"Yeah, I see what I need to do now.\" That was really powerful advice. It makes me think of parenting advice, some parenting advice I recently saw. Dr. Becky has this advice of your job as a parent isn't to make your kids happy, but it's to make them resilient.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:34:02):\nI love that, yeah. By the way, watch how people parent. They parent exactly the opposite of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:07):\nExactly [inaudible 00:34:09].\n\nGraham Weaver (00:34:09):\nYou and I both live in Marin. I don't know if you have kids or how old they are, but when you get kids in school in Marin, you see parents, they try to clear all obstacles away from their kids. It's the worst thing you could do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:25):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Liveblocks, the platform that turns your product into a place that users want to be.

Okay, this is great.\" I'm going to share this in intro, and we're not going to talk a lot about your fund, but I did some research on it. And from what I understand, it's one of the top performing PE funds in the world, which is very hard, considering how many smart people run PE funds and how ruthless that industry is. Anything you can comment on there? Yeah, I think that's important for people to know.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:35:48):\nWell, I think one of the things I would say is that I never stand up in front of students or be on a podcast like this and say anything that I'm not doing myself or that I'm advising students or people who work at Alpine to do. And so I appreciate the kind words. And I think that the things that I'm talking about are rooted in real results. And this is not just happy talk podcast. The formula, I think, for greatness is to be intentional, get in the path of the thing that you're most excited about, and then give yourself several decades to do it. And that's based on investing in 600 companies and building my own business. So I appreciate the kind call out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:37):\nYeah. For people that are listening and be like, \"Okay, I'm motivated. I want to do this,\" other than taking your class, anything you can recommend to just do these sorts of exercises, ask yourself these questions that you've seen work?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:36:49):\nI mean, the answer is accountability. How do you keep yourself accountable to living the life you want to live? And the analogy I would use is let's say that your number one goal in life is you've got to get in better shape. You just have to. Let's say you have even medically, you're going to have real health problems if you don't do that. I would say you hire yourself a personal trainer, pay what you need to pay. Okay, maybe you don't have a ton of money, but that's where I'd spend it. That person, A, they're going to hold you accountable to showing up at a certain time, and B, they're going to show you the exercises. They're going to call you if you're not there. You're just increasing the chances of success. Plus you spend some money, you want to get your money out of it.\n\n(00:37:40):\nThe equivalent of that in your life is an executive coach. And I figured this out in 2009 in the dark recesses of the recession. I hired my first executive coach. And I was like, \"Wow, it's a personal trainer for me for two things.\" Number one, make space to ask yourself the big questions in life about your career, your relationships, your health, your spirituality, your children. Whatever the big things are in your life, ask the big questions, find out what your intention is. What are you looking for in those areas? And just have, in my case, several hours a week to get clear on those things. Okay, so that's part one.\n\n(00:38:25):\nAnd then part two is that person can hold you accountable. I have one coach that I can't even have the call with the coach unless I fill out a piece of paper or an online form that says, \"Here's what my one year goals are, outcomes I want to have this year are. Here's what I did last week, based on those. Here's what I'm going to do next week toward those. And here's the outcomes I want to have for the call we're about to have.\" And even if I never had the call, just having to fill that out every single week is incredibly powerful and allows me to hold myself accountable.\n\n(00:39:03):\nSo 100%, that's what I'd recommend. Let's back up and say, okay, let's say you can't afford a coach or you're worried about that. And this is the same thing as, let's say you couldn't afford a personal trainer. I would give you the same advice, which is find a very like-minded friend of yours and sit down and do it for each other. So if you're using the workout example, okay, you're going to go on a run Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays with your friend, and they're going to meet you at 7:00 AM at this trail, or 6:00 AM at this trail. That's your accountability. And you're going to be more likely to do it. You don't want to let them down. They're going to beat you up if you don't get there.\n\n(00:39:44):\nSame is true with this. This is how I started. I did this with my roommate in business school. And we would go on a walk for 30 minutes and talk about my dreams and hopes. Then we'd turn around and talk about his. And it was great, because we made room for each other to have those conversations, and we also developed a great friendship. So short of having an actual executive coach, find a really-minded person that could get into this with you, and that would be another thing. But accountability is huge. I'm going to just say one more thing. I'm sorry. I'm going on a little bit long on this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:20):\n[inaudible 00:40:20] please.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:40:19):\nThere's another thing that happens that's kind of magical, which is you activate a different part of your brain when you talk. You actually activate more of your brain when you talk than when you think or write. So thinking activates the least amount of your brain. Writing is a little bit better, but talking activates a whole different region of your brain. So that's the other big benefit of not doing this just on your own, is being able to talk about it with someone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:54):\nI love that there's a whole spectrum of ways to create accountability for yourself. I love the second coach you've shared, where just filling out that form was basically the biggest benefit.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:41:07):\nI learned this from these audio tapes. When I was in college, I had this green notebook. And I was trying to row crew, and I never row crew before. And I wrote down at the top of the page every single morning, I wrote down, \"I am the number one rower in the country.\" I wasn't. I was a freshman novice, 135 pound Midwesterner, never had been in a boat. But I wrote that down. And then I wrote down three things I was going to do that day to move toward that goal. And I did that every single day that I was in college. And it's just incredible. We talked earlier about your subconscious mind. You're just locking your subconscious mind into your goals and where you want to go and who you want to be and how you want to show up. It's really powerful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:46):\nAnd that's advice anybody can implement. \"I want to be the best [inaudible 00:41:51] founder\"-\n\nGraham Weaver (00:41:50):\nYou could do that. You could do that [inaudible 00:41:50] exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:53):\nYeah. It's such a simple thing. \"I want to be the best product manager. Here's three things I'm doing today to help me along the lines.\"\n\nGraham Weaver (00:41:59):\nAbsolutely. My students have to do this twice a week. It's one of their assignments, and they actually have to turn it in. And I have so many students that say five years later, \"I still do this a couple times a week, and it's been unbelievable.\" I'd say this to all your listeners: you will get more done writing down your goal and three things you're going to do to move toward that goal, you'll get more things done in three months than you will in three years without that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:28):\nThat's an awesome thing to just try tomorrow at work. Write this down, see how it goes. The coach point, I just want to highlight that. What convinced me to get a coach back when I was working is I just realized, one, every athlete has a coach that tells them, \"Here's how to become better,\" slash, everyone that you work with that is a leader and exec basically has a coach. And the people that have an exec coach will do better in their career and life than those who don't. So why would you not have someone there just helping you become better at this craft? It just makes so much sense if you can afford it. There are different price points for different coaches. Most people can probably afford it in some [inaudible 00:43:09].\n\nGraham Weaver (00:43:08):\nThat's right. That's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:11):\nSweet. Okay. Let's talk about another framework that you have that you call nine lives. And this is essentially another way, it's like another way to hack your brain to come up with things you really should be doing, probably. Talk about this exercise.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:43:23):\nSo this idea of what's my passion and what's my career goal, it can be really intimidating. And it is intimidating. And so this exercise is to make it less intimidating. And you basically come up with nine lives. So you say your first life, life one is the life you have now. So when I did this exercise ... let's pretend I did this exercise when I'm right out of school, taking that job. So life one is I'm working at this big firm, I live in the Bay Area, here's what I'm doing. That's life one.\n\n(00:44:05):\nThere's two rules. The first rule is all the lives have to start from today. So you can't go back in time. They all start from today. And the second rule is you have to be excited about all these lives. So I might say, \"Hey, my second life is I want to start a private equity firm and be a founder and be a CEO.\" And that's life too. And life three is I want to be an author and I want to write whatever fiction or nonfiction. And then life four would be I want to be a professor and teach. And life five is maybe I want to make videos and be on social media. And life six, I want to be an actor. And you go through this whole list of these lives.\n\n(00:44:43):\nAnd the idea is that ... A couple of things from this exercise. One is let's say that you're in a position where you need to be working in the job you're in. There might be one of these lives that gives you the most energy, and it's the thing if you knew you wouldn't fail, you would do this one. And it's good to recognize what that is and then pull that life a little bit into your current life.\n\n(00:45:10):\nSo let's say, Lenny, that you were a product manager, but you really loved doing podcasts, and that was one of your nine lives. Do a podcast every other week, and just pull it into your life, which it sounds like what you did. You started doing it as a side hustle. And then that'll have two amazing effects. One is you will just have more energy everywhere else in your life. Forget if you ever do this full time or not; just the act of pulling something into your life you're really excited about will give you a tremendous amount of energy.\n\n(00:45:45):\nAnd then the second thing is you'll ideally find the path that is the thing that gives you the most energy. The other thing that I've learned in doing this exercise is you actually can have pretty much all nine lives. You can't have them at once, but if you're fortunate enough to live long enough, you can have all of these things. So I have had the corporate job, been the founder, been the professor, been a writer, had videos, taught people. I've been able to bring most of those lives into this current life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:25):\nThere's a couple things there that come up as you talk about. One is, on that point, what I do now is my fourth career. First I was an engineer, then I became a founder, then I was a PM, and now I do whatever the heck this is. And I think people don't realize that's how life often goes. You think you're going to do one thing, and then you have many different careers that pivot into [inaudible 00:46:46].\n\nGraham Weaver (00:46:45):\nExactly. And I think that's the thing. It's just trying to make it a little less intimidating. You don't have to have this one life purpose, passion, thing that you do for the rest of your life. If you just follow the thing that gives you energy at each time, it'll probably be a good indication of where you want to be going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:03):\nThe other thread there is, I know one of your other really important pieces of advice is to avoid this not now idea, where everyone's like, \"Here's the thing I should be doing, my genie goal, but not now.\" Thoughts on just how to think about that, of just like, \"Okay, I know I have these lives I could live, but not now,\" on this or that?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:47:21):\nYeah, I mean, in 20 years of teaching, I've never had a student come to me and say, \"Hey, Graham, my real dream is to do X, but I'm just going to give up on it. I'm not going to do it.\" No one's ever said that. Instead, they say, \"Not now.\" And not now, if they're not careful, will turn into not ever, because not now is just really another way of saying, \"I'm not going to do it.\" And then there's a million reasons why you can't do it now. And those reasons, some of them are legit and some of them are just fear in another form.\n\n(00:47:58):\nIn terms of how to overcome that, I think it's kind of hopeful to realize that it's never really the right time. When you're making a change or you're going to go do something different, it's never going to feel secure and safe. You're always going to have some fear. You're always going to feel like you're not ready. You're going to feel like it's too soon. You're going to feel like you don't know exactly what that path looks like. And so just understanding that's normal. That's called entrepreneurship. That's called life. And if you wait for the clouds to part and this ray of sun to come down and say, \"Now is the time,\" you're going to wait your whole life.\n\n(00:48:43):\nAnd so I think that realization can maybe be helpful. And then try to figure out, what are the things that need to be true for you to launch? And usually for my students, it's something financial that is the big bottleneck. And what I tell them is, \"You know what? People have raised money to start a business before. That's happened, where you've had people who've started businesses without their own money that have been able to pay themselves. And that's not a reason to not do it. It's an obstacle. It's something you have to solve, but it's not not an insurmountable obstacle.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:30):\nThis touches on a quote I definitely wanted to get to, something that you wrote not long ago. Here's the quote: \"The most important thing I've learned in the first 50 years of my life is that the true game of life is an internal one, not an external one. And that journey starts with three powerful words: I am enough.\" Talk about that. Why is that so important?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:49:51):\nWell, I mean, that's a really a deep topic, but I'll talk about the internal and external journey. So life presents itself as a series of external obstacles and events. And it feels very much like an external journey. And it can feel that way your whole life. But I think what you'll realize, and I started realizing this when I really started meditating and spending time distancing myself from the subconscious thoughts, is a very, very large part of life is internal. I say a very large part because obviously you need some food, clothing, shelter, some basic needs that are external. But for most people that have the ability to even listen to this podcast, I would say the vast majority of your life is internal.\n\n(00:50:52):\nSo what do I mean by that? I mean that you're writing a story about what it is you think you need to be happy, or you're writing a story about things you think you need to be to be enough or to be respected or to feel worthy or to get admiration of other people. You're writing that story, and it's just a story. And if you really follow this logic, you'll realize that. You'll realize it is 100% just a story, or it's a story that you should even care. And then that opens up a lot more agency that you have over deciding what is important to you, what is your internal scorecard, what are the things that matter to you, not what the external world thinks or the story you've been writing for a long time. When you start to open this up, it's really kind of scary at first, because you'll start to realize most of the things you're operating from are really just stories that have been written at some point in your life. And so it's actually terrifying at first, and then it starts to become really liberating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:10):\nWas there an example of that in your life? Because externally, it feels like you're killing it: a killer PE fund, teaching at Stanford. The scorecard is looking good. So it's interesting you say that.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:52:21):\nThe first time I really realized this, it was in 2015. I mentioned to you it took me 14 years to be successful. So we had just sold the last company from our second fund, which is where we really got paid. I had a financial event that was ... it wasn't like I never have to work again in my life. It was just like I could exhale a little bit. I knew I was going to be able to pay my mortgage and put my kids through college. It was that kind of an event. And for a couple days I was euphoric, because I felt like I'd worked so hard for this. I'd been, again, at this for 15 years, but really longer than that, if you go back to getting into college. And the whole thing had been a long journey.\n\n(00:53:05):\nAnd then it hit me that nothing changed. Nothing internally changed at all. I still had the same problems. I still felt the same way about myself. I still had a lot of negative thoughts about myself. This goal that I thought that I had for this whole long period of time, it didn't actually change anything. It changed externally, for sure. Like I said, I could exhale and pay my mortgage. And those are all really good things. But that was the first time when I realized, \"Oh, wait a second. It's really up to me to find things that are going to give me joy. And the achievement of some kind of external event is not one of those things.\"\n\n(00:53:54):\nAnd I know that sounds really, really weird, but there's so many people that I've heard that have had very, very similar stories. And so it was really disorienting for me. And actually it was the first time in my life where I experienced depression, because I just had this thought of, \"I think I was working my whole life for that, and it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.\" And so now I was thinking, \"Well, what is it then? What is the thing that's going to give me joy?\" And that takes some introspection to ask those questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:34):\nI was just having a conversation with a friend who's an angel investor, and he just had a bunch of exits. And he's like, \"Cool, I got some money in my bank account now, but I don't feel anything. I thought I'd be like, 'Holy moly, this is exactly what I was hoping for. And nothing changed.'\" Exactly how you're describing.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:54:53):\nI think you get a little bit of peace of mind when you have some financial security, which is valuable. But in terms of now my life changes, now I'm enough, now I am happy, now I feel good about myself, none of that changes, for really anybody that I know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:15):\nAnd the hardest part, as you said, is you think it will. You think, \"Oh, I'll be so happy once I achieve this thing.\" And I think an example of this is there's a lot of miserable billionaires, from what I've read and see. And that should tell you a lot.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:55:26):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:27):\nMaybe a second-to-last question; I'm curious if there's anything recently you're focused on, have been thinking a lot about that maybe you changed your mind about, or has changed the way you think about the world?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:55:38):\nThe last two years, I had my two oldest boys go off to college, 2022 and then 2024. And that really hit hard. You would think that I would've been preparing for that for 18 years for each of them, but for some reason it just really hit me really, really hard. And I think it was a real wake up call of mortality, I guess, and to realize that nothing goes on forever. And these wonderful people that I had lived with, each for 18 years, were no longer going to really be a part of my daily life.\n\n(00:56:17):\nAnd that really set me off on a journey of a lot of spiritual work, doing a lot of meditating and working with some gurus. And it's been really profound. And it's put me a lot closer in touch with the things that really matter to me. I've given myself more permission to spend time doing those things than the normal external world type things. So that was a pretty profound change for me. And the spiritual journey is arguably really the important journey. And this could be a longer conversation. And maybe you have the luxury of doing that journey as you get older or something, but it's been a really profound, profound journey.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:17):\nI'm excited to see what insights come out of this part of your life. Final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. We have this segment on the podcast called Failure Corner, where people come on this podcast, they share all these wins: \"Oh, I have this amazing PE fund that's killing it. I teach at Stanford. I've launched all these things. All these students, they're so great. Life's amazing. Nothing ever goes wrong,\" when in reality, it does. And those stories often aren't told. So I'm curious if there's a story you could share of a time you failed in your career and, if you learned something from that experience, what you learned.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:57:51):\nYeah, I'll tell a couple stories. So when I was in high school, I wrestled. And I cut a lot of weight to make the varsity team. And I was not in the best mental place because of cutting weight. But anyway, I lost a big match my junior year. And I quit and I never wrestled again. And that haunted me. So first of all, that was a failure, a big failure for me. And it really haunted me. And so I, after that, made a promise to myself that it wasn't going to have that happen again. When I went to college, I tried to row crew. I failed year after year trying to make the team, trying to make the boat. Eventually had some real success my senior year, but prior to that, just failure after failure.\n\n(00:58:44):\nAnd then at Alpine, I mean, we lost money on our first fund. We had real trouble during the recession. I think five of my first eight investments I ever made in my life, I lost money. And in venture world, that's one thing, but in private equity, that's a whole different ratio, which is not a good ratio at all. When I first started teaching, I wasn't good at teaching, had a lot of insecurities. I was really young when I started, and I didn't feel like I had really anything to share with the students. And I think that showed up, and it took me a long time to kind of figure that out.\n\n(00:59:26):\nSo I guess almost my entire track record is one that starts with things not going well, and then just over a long period of time of chipping away, looks like a success on paper. But anytime early in the process would look like an abject failure. So I'm quite familiar with failure in the form of setbacks. I think the ultimate failure though was the wrestling one, where I just quit. That was really the only one I would characterize as a failure. The other ones, because I kept going and staying with it, turned out to work out well, with a lot of scars and bruises, but the failure would've been quitting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:15):\nI love that the circles back to your core advice of stick with it. Most things that are important take a long time and there's a lot of suffering [inaudible 01:00:24].\n\nGraham Weaver (01:00:24):\nYeah, they do. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:26):\nSomething I wanted to ask, I can't help but ask at this point, because I think a lot of people are wondering this, just when do you quit? When should you quit something? Because some things are just not worth it. Is there any advice there you could share?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:00:37):\nYes, for sure. I think the time to quit is when you can no longer see the vision and you can no longer really believe the vision. And then when that happens for a long period of time ... or maybe you're no longer even excited about the vision; somewhere in there, I think. The excited one, you have to be a little careful of, because in the dark days, exciting is not the word you're going to use. But at least in our company, for the first 10 years it was not going well. But each time, we'd make fewer mistakes, we'd start to see something working. We'd do one really good deal in this fund, we'd start to learn from that. We'd get one really good hire, we'd learn from that. We would little by little start to see these green shoots.\n\n(01:01:24):\nAnd I have this unbelievable statement. I didn't write it. Dan and Chip Heath wrote it in their book, Switch, which is \"Scale your bright spots. Find what's working and do more of that.\" And as you start to progress, for me, for example, at Alpine, almost all the time, we always had at least a small glimmer of a bright spot. And then we'd scale that and then we'd continue forward and we'd find some more and we'd scale those. And over time, all those bright spots became our business. That became what we did. That became our strategy. That became how we hired people. That became where we recruited from. All those bright spots just started to magnify until the entire business was pretty much a bright spot. But it took time, because we had to figure out where those were. And we had to do a lot of things wrong to figure out where the bright spots were.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:19):\nGraham, is there anything else that you wanted to share or you think is important to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:02:25):\nI mean, I think what I would say is just in general, you got one life, you get one shot. And so take the time to really figure out and answer the question, what does a wonderful, amazing, incredible life look like? And just get as clear as you possibly can on that. No matter how crazy or aspirational it seems, write it down. Write down that thing is write down that thing that would make this life amazing. And write it down for your life, your career, your relationships, your friends, your body, your spirituality, your financial situation. And just the first magic is just knowing what you want. And I'd say 90% of people never even know what they want. So take the time to do that. And the more clear you are on that, the more invested you are in that, the more likely you are to make it come true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:18):\nWhat I love about that is you don't have to do this thing, just step one is understand what it could be if you could do that.\n\nGraham Weaver (01:03:18):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:27):\nAnd it's almost like understand where your Google directions could take you if you turned off autopilot. Oh, man. Okay. Well, with that, Graham, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:03:37):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:39):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:03:44):\nSo in the realm of a lot of the topics we've been talking about, which is your internal and external game, I love the book Untethered Soul. And I love the book, Don't Believe Everything You Think. They have very similar themes, but they come at it differently. But I think both of those will really change your perspective if you read them.\n\n(01:04:08):\nAnd then a very, very practical book that's probably the book I've read more than any other book, is How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie, which was written in like 1930. There's no other book it. There's a reason that people are still recommending it 100 years after it's written. So it's definitely worth checking out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):\nYeah, that book, I still think about it often, even though I read it 30 years ago at this point. I love that recommendation. And it's like a very old book to read, but you have to get past the fact that it was written a long time ago. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:04:48):\nI, for the first time, watched the movie Where the Crawdads Sing. And I just loved it. It's kind of a romantic comedy, or not comedy, sorry, romantic love story meets murder mystery, meets coming of age. And it really, really touched me. Then I promptly read the book as well, so I love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:14):\nDo you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:05:17):\nI'm a really big fan of sleep. I think it makes a massive difference in your life. And that's a whole other topic we could go down another time. So I have a few things that have helped me on that. So if you saw me sleeping, I have earplugs, I have a noise machine. I have a sleep mask, and then I have a Chilipad that goes on my bed to keep the bed cool. And I sleep great. All those things really help. The earplugs and mask and noise machine allow you to not hear the ambient noise. And then there's a lot of research actually on the temperature at which you want to sleep. And your body goes up and down throughout the night. So this Chilipad that goes under your mattress, there's a whole bunch of versions of that. And that helps a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:11):\nI also sleep with an eye mask. My wife and I rotate the earplugs, because someone has to pay attention to the baby, in case he wakes up.\n\nGraham Weaver (01:06:18):\nThere you go. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:20):\nAnd this Chilipad, is this the Eight Sleep, or is this in just a cold bag?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:06:24):\nWell, no. So I actually bought the Eight Sleep, and it was too much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:27):\nYeah, it's a lot.\n\nGraham Weaver (01:06:28):\nIt would turn on and off. And I would wake up. And then it would track my sleep, and then I'd start to freak out because it'd tell me I wasn't sleeping well. So I actually returned it and I got a really simple one called OOLER. And it just turns on and off. There's no timing. There's no any weird functionality. And it was a lot cheaper, and it works better for me. So everyone use their own thing, but that one worked better for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:55):\nOkay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about that you find useful in work or in life?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:07:02):\nI love this quote that sums up a lot of what we talked about in the podcast. It's by Howard Thurman. And he says, \"Don't ask what the world needs. Ask instead what makes you come alive, because what the world needs most is for you to come alive.\" And I think that just talks about it's really about you coming alive that's the most important thing. And that is going to have so much positive exhaust in the world. And things from that will come that you can't even imagine right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:38):\nI was thinking of that quote as you were describing your philosophy. Final question. I feel like a lot of people might be listening to this being like, \"I came here for one of the most legendary private equity investors of all time, and you don't talk about private equity at all.\" So let me just use this opportunity to ask you just a question here. What do you look for in a company that you want to buy that maybe other people don't? Is there some insight you could share?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:08:04):\nYeah. Well, I'm happy to talk about private equity, by the way. It's just that we talked-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:10):\nWe'll do another episode on that. This could be a whole podcast episode. I understand.\n\nGraham Weaver (01:08:13):\nReally happy to talk about that about. So I'll answer the question more like, what's a little bit of a different philosophy that we have? So when we were coming out of the recession and I hired this coach, we looked at all of our companies. And we were looking for where did we make our most money, and what was the most consistent trend? And we looked at valuation, growth rates, capital structure, geography, industry. We cut the data every way you could imagine. And we had these three companies that kept showing up on all these lists that were three of our top performers, but they didn't seem to really have anything in common.\n\n(01:08:53):\nAnd then we're like, \"Well, they have one thing in common, which is they started off really badly, so badly in fact that we put our own person from Alpine in to go run the company, and then they ended up becoming our best companies.\" So we said, \"Wait a second. Maybe that's the highly correlated thing, is us putting our own team in place, and even upstream of that, maybe just having an incredible management team.\" So that was foundational. And now, we put our own leadership team in 100% of the time. And not only that, but we have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to build a program to help people who are in their late 20s, early 30s learn how to become CEOs. And that's been foundational.\n\n(01:09:38):\nSo the thing that we probably believe to be true that not that many people agree with us on is that the management team is really where we think all the alpha comes from. You can't get the industry wrong, because if you hire the best management team in the world to run a typewriter business, you're going to lose money. So you can't be wrong on the industry, but you also don't have to be perfect on the industry. You have to have a good enough industry and then a world-class management team. And we found that to be a really good formula for consistent returns. And it's way more fun because you're literally in a board meeting with someone that is on your side of the table, because you hired them and put them in. And so you're building the company together. And they're bringing a lot of similar values. And so it's been a real differentiator for us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:32):\nI have so many questions, but I'm going to cut it off there. We could do another episode going deep on all this. Graham, this was amazing. I think we're going to be helping a lot of people with what they want to do with their lives, and if nothing else, give them a little opportunity to break out of autopilot, at least for a little bit. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to maybe follow up, ask maybe some other questions that they are thinking as they hear this? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:10:56):\nMy website's grahamweaver.com, and I have a blog on there as well as a lot of videos and different things. And then on Instagram and TikTok, I'm grahamcweaver. And then on LinkedIn, I'm Graham Weaver. And on YouTube, I think I'm Graham C. Weaver. So Graham C. Weaver will pretty much get you on all those channels.\n\n(01:11:16):\nHow can listeners be helpful? I would say I'd love to hear from you. So my best way to reach me is grahamweaverblog.com. And tell me what's on your mind. I may not respond 100%, but I will read all the emails. And then if you're interested, subscribe to my blog. So go to my website, grahamweaver.com, and I have a blog where I talk about a lot of the topics that we're talking about today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):\nAmazing. Graham, thank you so much for being here.\n\nGraham Weaver (01:11:45):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:46):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
