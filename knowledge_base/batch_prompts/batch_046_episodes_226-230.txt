Because again, I've observed this sort of surprising result that even small bug fixes, even small changes can sometimes have surprising, unexpected impact.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:00:22):\nAnd so I don't think it's possible to experiment too much. You have to allocate sometimes to these high risk, high reward ideas. We're going to try something that's most likely to fail. But if it does win, it's going to be a home run.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:00:38):\nAnd you have to be ready to understand and agree that most will fail. And it's amazing how many times I've seen people come up with new designs or a radical new idea. And they believe in it, and that's okay. I'm just cautioning them all the time to say, \"If you go for something big, try it out, but be ready to fail 80% of the time.\"\n\nLenny (00:01:05):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard win experiences building and growing today's most successful products.\n\nLenny (00:01:14):\nToday my guest is Ronny Kohavi. Ronny is seen by many as the world expert on A/B testing and experimentation. Most recently, he was VP and technical fellow of relevance at Airbnb where he led their search experience team. Prior to that, he was corporate vice president at Microsoft, where he led Microsoft Experimentation Platform team. Before that, he was director of data mining and personalization at Amazon.\n\nLenny (00:01:38):\nHe's currently a full-time advisor and instructor. He's also the author of the go-to book on experimentation called Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments. And in our show notes, you'll find a code to get a discount on taking his live cohort-based course on Maven.\n\nLenny (00:01:53):\nIn our conversation, we get super tactical about A/B testing. Ronny shares his advice for when you should start considering running experiments at your company, how to change your company's culture to be more experiment driven, what are signs your experiments are potentially invalid, why trust is the most important element of a successful experiment, culture, and platform. How to get started if you want to start running experiments at your company. He also explains what actually is a P value and something called Twyman's law, plus some hot takes about Airbnb and experiments in general. This episode is for anyone who's interested in either creating an experiment driven culture at their company or just fine-tuning one that already exists.

And so I'm excited to dig quite deep into the world of experimentation and A/B testing to help people run better experiments. So thank you again for being here.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:04:54):\nThat's a great goal. Thank you.\n\nLenny (00:04:56):\nLet me start with kind of a fun question. What is maybe the most unexpected A/B tests you've run or maybe the most surprising result from an A/B test that you've run?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:05:06):\nSo I think the opening example that I use in my book and in my class is the most surprising public example we can talk about. And this was kind of an interesting experiment. Somebody proposed to change the way that ads were displayed on Bing, the search engine. And he basically said, \"Let's take the second line and move it, promote it to the first line so that the title line becomes larger.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:05:37):\nAnd when you think about that, and if you're going to look in my book, or in the class, there's an actual diagram of what happened, the screenshots. But if you think about it, just realistically it looks like a meh idea. Why would this be such a reasonable, interesting thing to do? And indeed, when we went back to the backlog, it was on the backlog for months, and languished there, and many things were rated higher.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:06:05):\nBut the point about this is it's trivial to implement. So if you think about return on investment, we could get the data by having some engineers spend a couple of hours implementing it.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:06:19):\nAnd that's exactly what happened. Somebody at Bing who kept seeing this in the backlog and said, \"My God, we're spending too much time discussing it. I could just implement it.\" He did. He spent a couple of days implementing it, as is the common thing at Bing, he launched the experiment.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:06:37):\nAnd a funny thing happened. We had an alarm. Big escalation, something is wrong with the revenue metric. Now this alarm fired several times in the past when there were real mistakes, where somebody would log revenue twice, or there's some data problem. But in this case, there was no bug. That simple idea increased revenue by about 12%.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:07:01):\nAnd this is something that just doesn't happen. We can talk later about Wyman's law, but that was the first reaction, which is, \"This is too good to be true. Let's find a bug.\" And we did. And we looked for several times, and we replicated the experiment several times, and there was nothing wrong with it. This thing was worth $100 million at the time when Bing was a lot smaller.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:07:22):\nAnd the key thing is it didn't hurt the user metrics. So it's very easy to increase revenue by doing theatrics. Displaying more ads is a trivial way to raise revenue, but it hurts the user experience. And we've done the experiments to show that. In this case, this was just a home run that improved revenue, didn't significantly hurt the guardrail metrics. And so we were in awe of what a trivial change. That was the biggest revenue impact to Bing in all its history.\n\nLenny (00:07:57):\nAnd that was basically shifting in two lines, right? Switching two lines in the search results.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:08:02):\nAnd this was just moving the second line to the first line. Now you then go and run a lot of experiments to understand what happened here. Is it the fact that the title line has a bigger font, sometimes different color? So we ran a whole bunch of experiments.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:08:16):\nAnd this is what usually happens. We have a breakthrough. You start to understand more about, what can we do? And there suddenly a shift towards, \"Okay, what are other things we could do that would allow us to improve revenue?\" We came up with a lot of follow on ideas that helped a lot.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:08:34):\nBut to me, this was an example of a tiny change that was the best revenue generating idea in Bing's history, and we didn't rate it properly. Nobody gave this the priority that in hindsight, it deserves. And that's something that happens often. I mean, we are often humbled by how bad we are at predicting the outcome of experiments.\n\nLenny (00:09:01):\nThis reminds me of a classic experiment at Airbnb while I was there, and we'll talk about Airbnb in a bit. The search team just ran a small experiment of what if we were to open a new tab every time someone clicked on a search result, instead of just going straight to that listing. And that was one of the biggest wins in search-\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:09:18):\nAnd by the way, I don't know if you know the history of this, but I tell about this in class. We did this experiment way back around 2008 I think. And so this predates Airbnb. I remember it was heavily debated. Why would you open something in a new tab? The users didn't ask for it. It was a lot of pushback from the designers. And we ran that experiment. And again, it was one of these highly surprising results that made it that we learned so much from it.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:09:49):\nSo we first did this. It was done in the UK for opening Hotmail, and then we moved it to MSN, so it would open search in new tab, and all the set of experiments were highly, highly beneficial. We published this. And I have to tell you, when I came to Airbnb, I talked to our joint friend Ricardo about this. And it was sort of done, it was very beneficial, and then it was semi forgotten, which is one of the things you learned about institutional memories. When you have winners, make sure to address them and remember them. So it was at Airbnb done for a long time before I joined that listings opened in a new tab, but other things that were designed in the future were not done. And I reintroduced this to the team, and we saw big improvements.\n\nLenny (00:10:35):\nShout out to Ricardo, our mutual friend who helped make this conversation happen. There's this holy grail of experiments that I think people are always looking for of one hour of work and it creates this massive result. I imagine this is very rare, and don't expect this to happen. I guess in your experience, how often do you find one of these gold nuggets just lying around?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:10:57):\nYeah. So again, this is a topic that's near and dear to my heart. Everybody wants these amazing results, and I show them in chapter one in my book, multiple of these small efforts, huge gain.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:11:13):\nBut as you said, they're very rare. I think most of the time, the winnings are made this inch by inch. And there's a graph that I show in my book, a real graph of how Bing ads has managed to improve the revenue per a thousand searches over time, and every month you can see a small improvement and a small improvement. Sometimes the degradation because of legal reasons or other things. There were some concern that we were not marking the ads properly. So you have to suddenly do something that you know is going to hurt revenue. But yes, I think most results are inch by inch. You improve small amounts, lots of them. I think that the best example that I can say is a couple of them that I can speak about.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:12:00):\nOne is at Bing, the relevance team, hundreds of people all working to improve bing relevance. They have a metric, we'll talk about OEC, the overall evaluation criterion. But they have a metric that their goal is to improve it by 2% every year. It's a small amount, and that 2% you can see here's a 0.1, and here's a 0.15, here's a 0.2, and then they add up to around 2% every year, which is amazing.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:12:28):\nAnother example that I am allowed to speak about from Airbnb is the fact that we ran some 250 experiments in my tenure there in search relevance. And again, small improvements added up. So this became overall a 6% improvement to revenue. So when you think about 6%, it's a big number, but it came out not of one idea, but many, many smaller ideas that each gave you a small gain.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:13:00):\nAnd in fact, again, there's another number I'm allowed to say. Of these experiments, 92% failed to improve the metric that we were trying to move. So only 8% of our ideas actually were successful at moving the key metrics.\n\nLenny (00:13:17):\nThere's so many threads I want to follow here, but let me follow this one right here. You just mentioned of 92% of experiments failed. Is that typical in your experience seeing experiments running a lot of companies? What should people expect when they're running experiments? What percentage should they expect to fail?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:13:31):\nWell, first of all, I published three different numbers for my career. So overall at Microsoft, about 66%, two thirds of ideas fail. And don't think the 66 is accurate. It's about two thirds. At Bing, which is a much more optimized domain after we've been optimizing it for a while, the failure rate was around 85%. So it's harder to improve something that you've been optimizing for a while. And then at Airbnb, this 92% number is the highest failure rate that I've observed.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:14:09):\nNow I've quoted other sources. It's not that I worked at groups that were particularly bad, Booking, Google Ads, other companies published numbers that are around 80 to 90% failure rate of ideas. This is where it's important of experiments. It's important to realize that when you have a platform, it's easy to get this number. You look at how many experiments were run and how many of them launched. Not every experiment maps to an idea.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:14:39):\nSo it's possible that when you have an idea, your first implementation, you start an experiment. Boom, it's egregiously bad, because you have a bug. In fact, 10% of experiments tend to be aborted on the first date. Those are usually not that the idea is bad, but that there is an implementation issue or something we haven't thought about, that forces an abort.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:15:01):\nYou may iterate and pivot again. And ultimately, if you do two, or three, or four pivots or bug fixes, you may get to a successful launch. But those numbers of 80 to 92% failure rate are of experiments.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:15:17):\nVery humbling. I know that every group that starts to run experiments, they always start off by thinking that somehow, they're different. And their success rate's going to be much, much higher, and they're all humbled.\n\nLenny (00:15:29):\nYou mentioned that you had this pattern of clicking a link and opening a new tab as a thing that just worked at a lot of different places.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:15:36):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:15:37):\nAre there other versions of this? Do you do you collect a list of, \"Here's things that often work when we want to move\" there's some you could share. I don't know if you have a list in your head.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:15:48):\nI can give you two resources. One of them is a paper that we wrote called Rules of Thumb, and what we tried to do at that time at Microsoft was to just look at thousands of experiments that run and extract some patterns. And so that's one paper that we can then put in the notes.\n\nLenny (00:16:07):\nPerfect.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:16:08):\nBut there's another more accurate, I would say, resource that's useful that I recommend to people. And it's a site called goodui.org, and goodui.org is exactly the site that tries to do what you're saying at scale.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:16:25):\nSo guy's name is Jacob [inaudible 00:16:28]. He asks people to send them results of experiments, and he puts them into patterns. There's probably 140 patterns I think at this point. And then for each pattern he says, \"Well, who has that helped? How many times and by how much?\" So you have an idea of this worked, three out of five times. And it was a huge win. In fact, you can find that open a new window in there.\n\nLenny (00:16:54):\nI feel like you feed that into ChatGPT, and you have basically a product manager creating a roadmap tool.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:17:01):\nIn general, by the way, a lot of that is institutional memory, which is can you document things well enough so that the organization remembers the successes and failures, and learns from them?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:17:17):\nI think one of the mistakes that some company makes is they launch a lot of experiments and never go back and summarize the learnings. So I've actually put a lot of effort in this idea of institutional learning, of doing the quarterly meeting of the most surprising experiments.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:17:32):\nBy the way, surprising is another question that people often are not clear about. What is a surprising experiment? To me, a surprising experiment is one where the estimated result beforehand and the actual result differ by a lot. So that absolute value of the difference is large.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:17:53):\nNow you can expect something to be great and it's flat. Well, you learn something. But if you expect something to be small and it turns out to be great, like that ad title promotion, then you've learned a lot. Or conversely, if you expect that something will be small and it's very negative, you can learn a lot by understanding why this was so negative. And that's interesting.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:18:17):\nSo we focused not just on the winners, but also surprising losers, things that people thought would be a no-brainer to run. And then for some reason, it was very negative. And sometimes, it's that negative that gives you insight. Actually, I'm just coming up with one example that of that, that I should mention.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:18:36):\nWe were running this experiment at Microsoft to improve the windows indexer, and the team was able to show on offline tests that it does much better at indexing, and they showed some relevance is higher, and all these good things. And then they ran it as an experiment. You know what happened? Surprising result. Indexing the relevance was actually high, but it killed a battery life.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:19:03):\nSo here's something that comes from left field that you didn't expect. It was consuming a lot more CPU on laptops. It was killing the laptops. And therefore, okay, we learned something. Let's document it. Let's remember this, so that we now take this other factor into account as we design the next iteration.\n\nLenny (00:19:23):\nWhat advice do you have for people to actually remember these surprises? You said that a lot of it is institutional. What do you recommend people do so that they can actually remember this when people leave, say three years later?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:19:34):\nDocument it. We had a large deck internally of these successes and failures, and we encourage people to look at them. The other thing that's very beneficial is just to have your whole history of experiments and do some ability to search by keywords.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:19:52):\nSo I have an idea. Type a few keywords and see if from the thousands of experiments that ran... And by the way, these are very reasonable numbers. At Microsoft, just to let you know, when I left in 2019, we were on a rate of about 20 to 25,000 experiments every year. So every working, day we were starting something like 100 new treatments. Big numbers. So when you're running in a group like Bing, which is running thousands and thousands of experiments, you want to be able to ask, \"Has anybody did an experiment on this or this or this?\" And so that searching capability is in the platform.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:20:32):\nBut more than that, I think just doing the quarterly meeting of the most successful... Most interesting, sorry, not just successful, most interesting experiments is very key. And that also helps the flywheel of experimentation.\n\nLenny (00:20:45):\nIt's a good segue to something I wanted to touch on, which is there's often, I guess a weariness of running too many experiments and being too data-driven, and the sense that experimentation just leads you to these micro optimizations, and you don't really innovate and do big things. What's your perspective on that? And then, can you be too experiment driven in your experience?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:21:07):\nI'm very clear that I'm a big fan of test everything, which is any code change that you make, any feature that you introduce has to be in some experiment. Because again, I've observed this surprising result that even small bug fixes, even small changes can sometimes have surprising unexpected impact.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:21:30):\nAnd so I don't think it's possible to experiment too much. I think it is possible to focus on incremental changes because some people say, \"Well, if we only tested 17 things around this,\" you have to think about, it's like in stock. You need a portfolio. You need some experiments that are incremental that move you in the direction that you know you're going to be successful over time if you just try enough. But some experiments, you have to allocate sometimes to these high risk, high reward ideas. We're going to try something that's most likely to fail, but if it does win, it's going to be a home run.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:22:14):\nAnd so you have to allocate some efforts to that, and you have to be ready to understand and agree that most will fail. And I've amazing how many times I've seen people come up with new designs, or a radical new idea, and they believe in it, and that's okay. I'm just cautioning them all the time to say, \"Hey, if you go for something big, try it out, but be ready to fail 80% of the time.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:22:42):\nAnd one true example, that again, I'm able to talk about because we put it in my book, is we were at Bing trying to change the landscape of search. And one of the ideas, the big ideas was we are going to integrate with social. So we hooked into the Twitter fire hose feed and we hooked into Facebook, and we spent 100 person years on this idea.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:23:14):\nAnd it failed. You don't see it anymore. It existed for about a year and a half, and all the experiments were just negative to flat. And it was an attempt. It was fair to try it. I think it took us a little long to fail, to decide that this is a failure. But at least we had the data. We had hundreds of experiments that we tried. None of them were a breakthrough. And I remember mailing Qi Lu with some statistics showing that it's time to abort, it's time to fail on this. And he decided to continue more. And it's a million dollar question. Do you continue, and then maybe the breakthrough will come next month, or do you abort? And a few months later, we aborted.\n\nLenny (00:24:07):\nThat reminds me of at Netflix, they tried a social component that also failed. At Airbnb, early on there was a big social attempt to make, \"Here's your friends that have stayed at these Airbnbs,\" completely had no impact. So maybe that's one of these learnings that we should document.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:24:21):\nYeah, this is hard. This is hard. But again, that's the value of experiments, which are this oracle that gives you the data. You may be excited about things. You may believe it's a good idea. But ultimately, the oracle is the controlled experiment. It tells you whether users are actually benefiting from it, whether you and the users, the company and the users.\n\nLenny (00:24:48):\nThere's obviously a bit of overhead and downside to running an experiment, setting all up, and analyzing the results. Is there anything that you ever don't think is worth A/B testing?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:24:59):\nFirst of all, there are some necessary ingredients to A/B testing. And I'll just say outright, not every domain is amenable to A/B testing. You can't A/B test mergers and acquisitions. It's something that happens once, you either acquire or you don't acquire.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:25:14):\nSo you do have to have some necessary ingredient. You need to have enough units, mostly users, in order for the statistics to work out. So if you're too small, it may be too early to A/B test. But what I find is that in software, it is so easy to run A/B testing and it is so easy to build a platform.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:25:39):\nI don't say it's easy to build a platform. But once you build a platform, the incremental cost of running an experiment should approach zero. And we got to that at Microsoft, where after a while, the cost of running experiments was so low that nobody was questioning the idea that everything should be experimented with.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:25:59):\nNow, I don't think we were there at Airbnb for example. The platform at Airbnb was much less mature, and required a lot more analysts in order to interpret the results and to find issues with it. So I do think there's this trade off. You're willing to invest in the platform. It is possible to get the marginal cost to be close to zero. But when you're not there, it's still expensive, and there may be reasons why not to run A/B tests.\n\nLenny (00:26:28):\nYou talked about how you may be too small to run A/B tests, and this is a constant question for startups is, when should we start running A/B tests? Do you have kind of a heuristic or a rule of thumb of, here's a time you should really start thinking about running an A/B test?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:26:42):\nYeah, a dollar question that everybody asks. So actually, we'll put this in the notes, but I gave a talk last year, what I called it is practical defaults. And one of the things I show there is that unless you have at least tens of thousands of users, the math, the statistics just don't work out for most of the metrics that you're interested in.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:27:05):\nIn fact, I gave an actual practical number of a retail site with some conversion rate, trying to detect changes that are at least 5% beneficial, which is something that startups should focus on. They shouldn't focus on the 1%, they should focus on the 5 and 10%. Then you need something like 200,000 users.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:27:25):\nSo start experimenting when you're in the tens of thousands of users. You'll only be able to detect large effects. And then once you get to 200,000 users, then the magic starts happening. Then you can start testing a lot more. Then you have the ability to test everything and make sure that you're not degrading and getting value out of experimentation. So you ask for rule of thumb, 200,000 users, you're magical. Below that, start building the culture, start building the platform, start integrating. So that as you scale, you start to see the value.\n\nLenny (00:28:00):\nLove it. Coming back to this kind of concern people have of experimentation, keeps you from innovating and taking big bets, I know you have this framework overall evaluation criterion, and I think that helps with this. Can you talk a bit about that?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:28:14):\nThe OEC or the overall evaluation criterion is something that I think many people that start to dabble in A/B testing miss. And the question is, what are you optimizing for? And it's a much harder question that people think because it's very easy to say we're going to optimize for money, revenue. But that's the wrong question, because you can do a lot of bad things that will improve revenue. So there has to be some countervailing metric that tells you, how do I improve revenue without hurting the user experience?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:28:53):\nSo let's take a good example with search. You can put more ads on a page and you will make more money. There's no doubt about it. You will make more money in the short term. The question is, what happens to the user experience, and how is that going to impact you in the long term?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:29:13):\nSo we've run those experiments, and we were able to map out this number of ads causes this much increase to churn, this number of ads causes this much increase to the time that users take to find a successful result. And we came up with an OEC that is based on all these metrics that allows you to say, \"Okay, I'm willing to take this additional money if I'm not hurting the user experience by more than this much.\" So there's a trade-off there.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:29:41):\nOne of the nice ways to phrase this, as a constraint optimization problem. I want you to increase revenue, but I'm going to give you a fixed amount of average real estate that you can use. So for one query, you can have zero ads. For another query, you can have three ads. For a third query, you can have wider, bigger ads. I'm just going to count the pixels that you take, the vertical pixels. And I will give you some budget. And if you can under the same budget make more money, you're good to go.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:30:16):\nSo that to me turns the problem from a badly defined, let's just make more money. Any page can start plastering more ads and make more money short term, but that's not the goal. The goal is long-term growth and revenue. Then you need to insert these other criteria, and what am I doing to the user experience? One way around it is to put this constraint. Another one is just to have these other metrics. Again, something that we did, to look at the user experience. How long does it take the user to reach a successful click? What percentage of sessions are successful? These are key metrics that were part of the overall evaluation criteria, that we've used.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:30:55):\nI can give you another example by the way, from the hotel industry or Airbnb that we both worked at. You can say, \"I want to improve conversion rate,\" but you can be smarter about it and say, \"It's not just enough to convert a user to buy or to pay for a listing. I want them to be happy with it several months down the road when they actually stay there.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:31:19):\nSo that could be part of your OEC to say, \"What is the rating that they will give to that listing when they actually stay there?\" And that causes an interesting problem, because you don't have this data now. You're going to have it three months from now when they actually stay. So you have to build the training set that allows you to make a prediction about whether this user, whether Lenny is going to be happy at this cheap place. Or whether no, I should offer him something more expensive, because Lenny likes to stay at nicer places where the water actually is hot and comes out of the faucet.\n\nLenny (00:31:52):\nThat is true. Okay, so it sounds like the core to this approach is basically have a drag metric that makes sure you're not hurting something that's really important to the business, and then being very clear on what's the long-term metric we care most about.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:32:05):\nTo me, the key word is lifetime value, which is you have to define the OEC such that it is causally predictive of the lifetime value of the user. And that's what causes you to think about things properly, which is, am I doing something that just helps me short term, or am I doing something that will help me in the long term? Once you put that model of lifetime value, people say, \"Okay, what about retention rates? We can measure that. What about the time to achieve a task? We can measure that.\" And those are these countervailing metrics that make the OEC useful.\n\nLenny (00:32:43):\nAnd to understand these longer term metrics, what I'm hearing is use models, and forecast, and predictions, or would you suggest sometimes use a long-term holdout or some other approach? What do you find is the best way to see these long term?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:32:57):\nYeah, so there's two ways that I like to think about it. One is you can run long-term experiments for the goal of learning something. So I mentioned that at Bing, we did run these experiments where we increased the ads and decreased the ads, so that we will understand what happens to key metrics.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:33:16):\nThe other thing is you can just build models that use some of our background knowledge or use some data science to look at historical... I'll give you another good example of this. When I came to Amazon, one of the teams that reported to me was the email team that it was not the transactional emails when you buy something, you get an email. But it was the team that sent these recommendations. \"Here's a book by an author that you bought. Here's a product that we recommend.\" And the question is, how do we give credit to that team?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:33:49):\nAnd the initial version was, whenever a user comes from the email and purchases something on Amazon, we're going to give that email credit. Well, it turned out this had no countervailing metric. The more emails you send, the more money you're going to credit the team. And so that led to spam. Literally a really interesting problem. The team just ramped up the number of emails that they were sending out, and claimed to make more money, and their fitness function improved.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:34:20):\nSo then we backed up and then we said, \"Okay, we can either phrase this as a constraint satisfaction problem. You're allowed to send user an email every X days or,\" which is what we ended up doing is, \"Let's model the cost of spamming the users.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:34:37):\nWhat's that cost? Well, when they unsubscribe, we can't mail them. So we did some data science study on the side and we said, \"What is the value that we're losing from an unsubscribe?\" And we came up with a number, it was a few dollars. But the point was, now we have this countervailing metric. We say, \"Here's the money that we generate from the emails. Here's the money that we're losing on long-term value. What's the trade-off?\" And then when we started to incorporate those formula, more than half the campaigns that were being sent were negative.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:35:14):\nSo it was a huge insight at Amazon about how to send the right campaigns. And this is what I like about these discoveries. This fact that we integrated the unsubscribe led us to a new feature to say, \"Well, let's not lose their future lifetime value through email. When they unsubscribe, let's offer them by default to unsubscribe from this campaign.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:35:41):\nSo when you get an email, there's a new book by the author. The default to unsubscribe would be unsubscribe me from author emails. And so now, the negative, the countervailing metric is much smaller. And so again, this was a breakthrough in our ability to send more emails, and understand based on what users were unsubscribing from, which ones are really beneficial.\n\nLenny (00:36:06):\nI love the surprising results.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:36:08):\nWe all love them. This is the humbling reality. And people talk about the fact that A/B testing sometimes leads you to incremental... I actually think that many of these small insights lead to fundamental insights about which areas to go, some strategies we should take, some things we should develop. Helps a lot.\n\nLenny (00:36:31):\nThis makes me think about how every time I've done a full redesign of a product, I don't think ever, has it ever been a positive result. And then the team always ends up having to claw back what they just hurt and try to figure out what they messed up. Is that your experience too?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:36:47):\nAbsolutely, yeah. In fact, I've published some of these in LinkedIn posts showing a large set of big launches and redesigns that dramatically failed, and it happens very often. So the right way to do this is to say, \"Yes, we want to do a redesign, but let's do it in steps and test on the way and adjust,\" so you don't need to take 17 new changes, that many of them are going to fail. Start to move incrementally in a direction that you believe is beneficial. Adjust on the way.\n\nLenny (00:37:24):\nThe worst part of those experiences I find is it took three to six months to build it. And by the time it's launched, it's just like, \"We're not going to unlaunch this. Everyone's been working in this direction. All the new features are assuming this is going to work,\" and you're basically stuck.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:37:41):\nI mean, this is a sunk cost fallacy. We invested so many years in it. Let's launch this, even though it's bad for the user. No, that's terrible. Yeah. Yeah. So this is the other advantage of recognizing this humble reality that most ideas fail. If you believe in that statistics that I published, then doing 17 changes together is more likely to be negative. Do them in smaller increments, learn from, it's called OFAT one-factor-at-a-time. Do one factor, learn from it, and adjust. Of the 17, maybe you have four good ideas. Those are the ones that will launch and be positive.\n\nLenny (00:38:22):\nI generally agree with that, and always try to avoid a big redesign, but it's hard to avoid them completely. There's often team members that are really passionate like, \"We just need to rethink this whole experience. We're not going to incrementally get there.\" Have you found anything effective in helping people either see this perspective, or just making a larger bet more successful?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:38:42):\nBy the way, I'm not opposed to large redesigns. I try to give the team the data to say, \"Look, here are lots of examples where big redesigns fail.\" Try to decompose your redesign if you can't decompose it to one factor at a time, to a small set of factors at a time. And learn from these smaller changes what works and what doesn't.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:39:08):\nNow, it's also possible to do a complete redesign. Just, as you said yourself, be ready to fail. I mean, do you really want to work on something for six months or a year, and then run the A/B test, and realize that you've hurt revenues or other key metrics by several percentage points? And a data-driven organization will not allow you to launch. What are you going to write in your annual review?\n\nLenny (00:39:33):\nBut nobody ever thinks it's going to fail. They think, \"No, we got this. We've talked to so many people.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:39:38):\nBut I think organizations that start to run experiments are humbled early on from the smaller changes. Right? You're right. I'll tell you a funny story. When I came from Amazon to Microsoft, I joined the group, and for one reason or another, that group disbanded a month after I joined.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:39:57):\nAnd so people came to me and said, \"Look, you just joined the company. You're at partner level. You figure out how you can help Microsoft.\" And I said, \"I'm going to build an experimentation platform,\" because nobody at Microsoft is running experiments. And more than 50% of ideas in Amazon that we tried failed. And the classical response was, \"We have better PMs here.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:40:26):\nRight? There was this complete denial that it's possible that 50% of ideas that Microsoft is implementing, in a three-year development cycle by the way. This is how long it took Office to release. It was a classical every three years we release.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:40:42):\nAnd the data came about showing that Bing was the first to truly implement experimentation at scale. And we shared with the rest of the companies the surprising results. And so when Office was... And this was credit to Qi Lu and Satya Nadella, they were ones that says, \"Ronny, you try to get Office to run experiments. We'll give you the air support.\" And it was hard, but we did it. It took a while, but Office started to run experiments, and they realized that many of their ideas are failing.\n\nLenny (00:41:20):\nYou said that there's a site of a failed redesigns. Is that in your book or is that a site that you can point people to, to help build this case?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:41:29):\nI teach this in my class, but I think I've posted this on LinkedIn and answered some questions. I'm happy to put that in the notes.\n\nLenny (00:41:36):\nOkay, cool. We'll put that in the show notes. Because I think that's the kind of data that often helps convince a team, \"Maybe we shouldn't rethink this entire onboarding flow from scratch. Maybe we should iterate towards and learn as we go.\"\n\nLenny (00:41:48):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments.\n\nLenny (00:42:02):\nWherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.\n\nLenny (00:42:15):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform, where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage.\n\nLenny (00:42:25):\nEppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics, and instead use your North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the back end, email marketing, even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com, and 10X your experiment velocity.\n\nLenny (00:42:55):\nIs it ever worth just going, \"Let's just rethink this whole thing and just give it a shot,\" to break out of a local minima or local maxima essentially?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:43:03):\nYeah. So I think what you said is fair. I do want to allocate some percentage of resources to big bets. As you said, we've been optimizing this thing to hell. Could we completely redesign it? It's a very valid idea. You may be able to break out of a local minima. What I'm telling you is 80% of the time, you will fail. So be ready for that. What people usually expect is, \"My redesign is going to work.\" No, you're most likely going to fail, but if you do succeed, it's a breakthrough.\n\nLenny (00:43:35):\nI like this 80% rule of thumb. Is that just a simple way of thinking about it? 80% of your-\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:43:39):\nThat's my rule of thumb. And I've heard people say it's 70% or 80%. But it's in that area where I think when you talk about how much to invest in the known versus the high risk, high reward, that's usually the right percentage that most organizations end up doing this allocation, right? You interviewed Shreyas. I think he mentioned that Google is like 70% the searching ads, and it's 20% for some of the apps and new stuff, and then it's the 10% for infrastructure.\n\nLenny (00:44:16):\nAnd I think the most important point there is if you're not running an experiment, 70% of stuff you're shipping is hurting your business.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:44:23):\nWell, it's not hurting, it's flat too negative. Some of them are flat. And by the way, flat to me, if something is not Statsig, that's a no ship, because you've just introduced more code. There is a maintenance overhead to shipping your stuff. I've heard people say, \"Look, we already spent all this time. The team will be demotivated if we don't ship it.\" And I'm, \"No, that's wrong guys. Let's make sure that we understand that shipping this project has no value, is complicating the code base. Maintenance costs will go up.\" You don't ship on flat, unless it's a legal requirement. When legal comes along and says, \"You have to do X or Y,\" you have to ship on flat or even negative. And that's understandable.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:45:08):\nBut again, I think that's something that a lot of people make the mistake of saying, \"Legal told us we have to do this, therefore we're going to take the hits.\" No, legal gave you a framework that you have to work under. Try three different things, and ship the one that hurts the least.\n\nLenny (00:45:25):\nThat reminds me when Airbnb launched the rebrand, even that they ran as an experiment with the entire homepage redesigned, the new logo, and all that. And I think there was a long-term holdout even, and I think it was positive in the end from what I remember.\n\nLenny (00:45:41):\nSpeaking of Airbnb, I want to chat about Airbnb briefly. I know you're limited in what you can share, but it's interesting that Airbnb seems to be moving in this other direction where it's becoming a lot more top-down, Brian vision oriented. And Brian's even talked about how he's less motivated to run experiments. He doesn't want to run as many experiments as they used to. Things are going well, and so it's hard to argue with the success potentially. You worked there for many years. You ran the search team essentially. I guess, what was your experience like there? And then roughly, what's your sense of how things are going, where it's going?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:46:15):\nWell as you know, I'm restricted from talking about Airbnb. I will say a few things that I am allowed to say. One is in my team in search relevance, everything was A/B tested. So while Brian can focus on some of the design aspects, the people who are actually doing the neural networks and the search, everything was A/B tested to hell. So nothing was launching without an A/B test. We had targets around improving certain metrics, and everything was done A/B test.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:46:50):\nNow other teams, some did, some did not. I will say that when you say things are going well, I think we don't know the counterfactual. I believe that had Airbnb kept people like Greg Greeley, which was pushing for a lot more data driven, and had Airbnb run more experiments, it would've been in a better state than today. But it's the counterfactual. We don't know.\n\nLenny (00:47:14):\nThat's a really interesting perspective. Airbnb's such an interesting natural experiment of a way of doing things differently. There's de-emphasizing experiments, and also, they turned off paid ads during Covid. And I don't know where it is now, but it feels like it's become a much smaller part of the growth strategy. Who knows if they've ramped it up to back to where it's today, but I think it's going to be a really interesting case study looking back five, 10 years from now.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:47:38):\nIt's a one-off experiment where it's hard to assign value to some of the things that Airbnb is doing. I personally believe it could have been a lot bigger and a lot more successful if it had run more controlled experiments. But I can't speak about some of those that I ran and that showed that some of the things that were initially untested were actually negative and could be better.\n\nLenny (00:48:04):\nAll right. Mysterious. One more question. Airbnb, you were there during Covid, which was quite a wild time for Airbnb. We had Sanchan on the podcast talking about all the craziness that went on when travel basically stopped, and there was a sense that Airbnb was done, and travel's not going to happen for years and years. What's your take on experimentation in that world where you have to really move fast, make crazy decisions, and make big decisions? What was it like during that time?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:48:34):\nSo I think actually in a state like that, it's even more important to run A/B tests, right? Because what you want to be able to see is if we're making this change, is it actually helping in the current environment? There's this idea of external generalizability. Is it going to work out now during Covid? Is it going to generalize later on? These are things that you can really answer with the controlled experiments, and sometimes it means that you might have to replicate them six months down when Covid say is not as impactful as it is.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:49:11):\nSaying that you have to make decisions quickly, to me, I'll point you to the success rate. If in peace time you're wrong two thirds to 80% of the time, why would you be subtly right in wartime, in Covid time?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:49:26):\nSo I don't believe in the idea that because bookings went down materially, the company should suddenly not be data driven and do things differently. I think if Airbnb stayed the course, did nothing, the revenue would've gone up in the same way.\n\nLenny (00:49:49):\nFascinating.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:49:49):\nIn fact, if you look at one investment, one big investment that was done at the time was online experiences, and the initial data wasn't very promising. And I think today, it's a footnote.\n\nLenny (00:50:01):\nYeah. Another case study for the history books, Airbnb experiences. I want to shift a little bit and talk about your book, which you mentioned a couple times. It's called Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments, and I think it's basically the book on A/B testing. Let me ask you, what surprised you most about writing this book, and putting it out, and the reaction to it?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:50:24):\nI was pleasantly surprised that it sold more than what we thought, more than what Cambridge predicted. So when first we were approached by Cambridge after a tutorial that we did to write a book, I was like, \"I don't know, this is too small of a niche area.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:50:47):\nAnd they were saying, \"So you'll be able to sell a few thousand copies and help the world.\" And I found my co-authors, which are great. And we wrote a book that we thought is not statistically oriented, has fewer formulas than you normally see, and focuses on the practical aspects and on trust, which is the key.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:51:10):\nThe book, as I said, was more successful. It sold over 20,000 copies in English. It was translated to Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Russian. And so it's great to see that we help the world become more data-driven with experimentation, and I'm happy because of that. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:51:31):\nBy the way, all proceeds from the book are donated to charity. So if I'm pitching the book here, there is no financial gain for me from having more copies sold. I think we made that decision, which was a good decision. All proceeds go with the charity.\n\nLenny (00:51:47):\nAmazing. I didn't know that. We'll link to the book in the show notes. Trust is in the title. You just mentioned how important trust is to experimentation. A lot of people talk about, \"How do I run experiments faster?\" You focus a lot on trust. Why is trust so important in running experiments?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:52:03):\nSo to me, the experimentation platform is the safety net, and it's an oracle. So it serves really two purposes. The safety net means that if you launch something bad, you should be able to abort quickly, right? Safe deployments, safe velocity. There's some names for this. But this is one key value that the platform can give you.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:52:25):\nThe other one, which is the more standard one, is at the end of the two-week experiment, we will tell you what happened to your key metric and to many of the other surrogate, and debugging, and guardrail metrics. Trust builds up, it's easy to lose.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:52:43):\nAnd so to me, it is very important that when you present this and say, \"This is science, this is a controlled experiment, this is the resolve,\" you better believe that this is trustworthy.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:52:57):\nAnd so I focus on that a lot. I think it allowed us to gain the organizational trust that this is really... And the nice thing is when we built all this checks to make sure that the experiment is correct, if there were something wrong with it, we would stop and say, \"Hey, something is wrong with the experiment.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:53:17):\nAnd I think that's something that some of the early implementations in other places did not do, and it was a big mistake. I've mentioned this in my book so I can mention this here.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:53:28):\nOptimizely in its early days were very statistically naive. They sort of said, \"Hey, we're real time. We can compute your P values in real time,\" and then you can stop an experiment when the P value is statistically significant. That is a big mistake. That inflates your, what's called type one error or the false positive rate materially. So if you think you've got a 5% type one error, or you aim for that P value less than 0.05, using real time P value monitoring to optimize the offer, you would probably have a 30% error rate.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:54:06):\nSo what this led is that people that started using Optimizely thought that the platform was telling them they were very successful. But when they actually started to see, \"Well it told us this is positive revenue, but I don't see this over time. By now, we should have made double the money.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:54:23):\nSo their questions started to come up around the trust in the platform. There's a very famous post that somebody wrote about how, \"Optimizely almost got me fired,\" by a person who basically said, \"Look, I came to the org. I said, 'We have all these successes.' But then I said, 'Something is wrong.'\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:54:40):\nAnd he tells of how he ran an A/A test when there is no difference between the A and the B. And Optimizely told him that it was statistically significant too many times. Optimizely learned. Optimizely, several people pointed, I pointed this out in my Amazon review of the book that the authors wrote early on. I said, \"Hey, you're not doing the statistics correctly.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:55:05):\nRamesh Johari at Stanford pointed this out, became a consultant to the company, and then they fixed it. But to me, that's a very good example of how to lose trust. They lost a lot of trust in the market. They lost all this trust because they built something that had very much inflated error rate.\n\nLenny (00:55:26):\nThat is pretty scary to think about you've been running all these experiments, and they weren't actually telling you accurate results. What are signs that what you're doing may not be valid if you're starting to run experiments? And then how do you avoid having that situation? What kind of tips can you share for people trying to run experiments?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:55:47):\nThere's a whole chapter of that in my book, but I'll say one of the things that is the most common occurrence by far, which is a sample ratio mismatch. Now, what is a sample ratio mismatch?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:56:00):\nIf you design the experiment to send 50% of users to control and 50% of users to treatment, it's supposed to be a random number, or a hash function. If you get something off from 50%, it's a red flag.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:56:15):\nSo let's take a real example. Let's say you're running an experiment, and it's large, it's got a million users, and you've got 50.2. So people say, \"Well, I don't know. It's not going to be exactly the same as 50.2. Reasonable or not?\" Well, there's a formula that you can plug in. I have a spreadsheet available for those that are interested, and you can tell, here's how many users are in control. Here's how many users have in treatment. My design was 50/50, and it tells you the probability that this could have happened by chance.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:56:45):\nNow in a case like this, you plug in the numbers, it might tell you that this should happen one in half a million experiments. Well, unless you've run half a million experiment, very unlikely that you would get a 50.2 versus 49.8 split. And therefore, something is wrong with the experiment.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:57:06):\nI remember when we implemented this check, we were surprised to see how many experiments suffered from this. Right? And there's a paper that was published, 2018, where we share that at Microsoft, even though we'd be running experiments for a while, is around 8% of experiments that suffered from the sample ratio mismatch.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:57:29):\nAnd it's a big number. I think about this. You're running 20,000 experiments a year. So many of them, 8% of them are invalid. And somebody has to go down and understand, what happened here? We know that we can't trust the results, but why?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:57:44):\nSo over time, you begin to understand there's something wrong with the data pipeline. There's something that happens with bots. Bots are a very common factor for causing sample ratio mismatch. So that paper that was published by my team talks about how to diagnose sample ratio mismatches.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:58:06):\nIn the last probably year and a half, it was amazing to see all these third party companies implement sample ratio mismatches, and all of them were reporting, \"Oh my god, 6%, 8%, 10%.\" So it's sometimes fun to go back and say, how many of your results in the past were invalid before you had this sample ratio mismatched test?\n\nLenny (00:58:32):\nYeah, that's frightening. Is the most common reason this happens is you're assigning users in the wrong place in your code?\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:58:40):\nSo when you say most common, I think the most common is bots. Somehow, they hit the controller, the treatment in different proportions. Because you change the website, the bot may fail to parse the page, and try to hit it more often. And that's a classical example. Another one is just the data pipeline.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:58:58):\nWe've had cases where we were trying to remove bad traffic under certain conditions, and it was skewed because of the control and treatment. I've seen people that start an experiment in the middle of the site on some page, but they don't realize that some campaign is pushing people from the side.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:59:13):\nSo there's multiple reasons. It is surprising how often this happens. And I'll tell you a funny story, which is when we first added this test to the platform, we just put a banner say, \"You have a sample ratio mismatch. Do not trust these results.\" And we noticed that people ignored it. They were starting to present results that had this banner.\n\nRonny Kohavi (00:59:37):\nAnd so we blanked out the scorecard. We put a big red, \"Can't see this result. You have a sample ratio mismatch. Click to expose the results.\" And why we do we need that okay? We need that okay button because you want to be able to debug the reasons, and sometimes the metrics help you understand why you have a sample ratio mismatch.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:00:00):\nSo we blanked out the scorecard, we had this button, and then we started to see that people pressed the button and still presented the results of experiments with sample ratio mismatch. And so we ended up with an amazing compromise, which is every number in the scorecard was highlighted with a red line, so that if you took a screenshot, other people could tell you how to sample ratio mismatch.\n\nLenny (01:00:24):\nFreaking product managers.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:00:26):\nThis is intuition. People just say, \"Well, my [inaudible 01:00:30] was small, therefore I can still present the results.\" People want to see success. I mean, this is a natural bias, and then we have to be very conscientious and fight that bias and say when something looks too good to be true, investigate.\n\nLenny (01:00:45):\nWhich is a great segue to something you mentioned briefly, something called Twyman's law. Yeah. Can you talk about that?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:00:51):\nYeah. So Twyman's law, the general statement is if any figure that looks interesting or different is usually wrong. It was first said by this person in the UK who worked in radio media, but I'm a big fan of it. And my main claim to people is if the result looks too good to be true, your normal movement of an experiment is under 1% and you suddenly have a 10% movement, hold the celebratory dinner. It was just your first reaction, right? Let's take everybody to a fancy dinner, because we just improved revenue by millions of dollars. Hold that dinner, investigate, see, because there's a large probability that something is wrong with the result. And I will say that nine out of 10, when we call it Twyman's law, it is the case that we find some flaw in the experiment.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:01:45):\nNow there are obviously outliers. That first experiment that I shared where we promoted that made long titles, that was successful. But that was replicated multiple times, and double and triple checked, and everything was good about it. Many other results that were so big turn out to be false. So I'm a big fan of Twyman's law. There's a deck, I could also give this in the note, where I shared some real examples of Twyman's law.\n\nLenny (01:02:14):\nAmazing. I want to talk about rolling this out of companies and things that you run into that fail. But before I get to that, I'd love for you to explain P value. I know that people kind of misunderstand it, and this might be a good time to just help people understand, what is it actually telling you, P value of say 0.05?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:02:30):\nI don't know if this is the right forum for explaining P values, because the definition of a P value is simple. What it hides is very complicated. So I'll say one thing, which is many people assign one minus P value as the probability that your treatment is better than control. So you ran an experiment, you got a P value of 0.02. They think there's a 98% probability that the treatment is better than the control. That is wrong. So rather than defining P values, I want to caution everybody that the most common interpretation is incorrect.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:03:08):\nP value assumes, it's a conditional probability or an assumed probability. It assumes that the null hypothesis is true. And we're computing the probability that the data we're seeing matches the hypothesis, this null hypothesis.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:03:27):\nIn order to get the probability that most people want, we need to apply Bayes' rules and invert the probability from the probability of the data given the hypothesis, to the probability of the hypothesis given the data. For that, we need an additional number, which is the probability, the prior probability that the hypothesis that you're testing is successful or not.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:03:49):\nThat's an unknown. What we do is we can take historical data and say, \"Look, people fail two thirds of the time or 80% of the time.\" And we can apply that number and compute that. We've done that in a paper that I will give in the notes, so that you can assess the number that you really want, what's called a false positive risk.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:04:10):\nSo I think that's something for people to internalize, that what you really want to look at is this false positive risk, which tends to be much, much higher than the 5% that people think, right? So I think the classical example in the Airbnb where the failure rate was very, very high, is that when you get a statistically significant result, let me actually pull the note so that I know the actual number. If you're at Airbnb, or Airbnb search where the success rate is only 8%, if you get a statistically significant result with a P value less than 0.05, there is a 26% chance that this is a false positive result. It's not 5%, it's 26%.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:04:54):\nSo that's the number that you should have in your mind. And that's why when I worked at Airbnb, one of the things we did is we said, \"Okay, if you're less than 0.05, but above 0.01, rerun, replicate.\" When you replicate, you can combine the two experiments, and get a combined P value using something called Fisher's method or Stouffer's method, and that gives you the joint probability. And that's usually much, much lower. So if you get two 0.5's or something like that, then the probability that you've got them is much, much lower.\n\nLenny (01:05:26):\nWow, I've never heard it described that way. It makes me think about how even data scientists in our teams are always just like, \"This isn't perfect. We're not 100% sure this experiment is positive.\" But on balance, if we're launching positive experiments, we're probably doing good things. It's okay if sometimes we're wrong.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:05:42):\nBy the way, it's true. On balance, you're probably better than 50/50, but people don't appreciate how much that 26% that I mentioned is high. And the reason that I want to be sure is that I think it leads to this idea of the learning, the institutional knowledge. What you want to be able to say is share with the org's success. And so you want to be really sure that you're successful. So by lowering the P value, by forcing teams to work with the P value maybe below 0.01 and do replication on higher, then you can be much more successful, and the false positive rate will be much, much lower.\n\nLenny (01:06:20):\nFascinating. And also shows the value of keeping track of what percentage your experiments are failing historically at the company or within that specific product. Say someone listening wants to start running experiments, say they have tens of thousands of users at this point. What would be the first couple steps you'd recommend?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:06:38):\nWell, so if they have somebody in the org that has previously been involved with a experiment, that's a good way to consult internally. I think the key decision is whether you want to build or buy. There's a whole series of eight sessions that I posted on LinkedIn where I invited guest speakers to talk about this problem. So if people are interested, they can look at what the vendors say and what agency said about build versus buy question. And it's usually not a zero one, it's usually both. You build some and you buy some, and it's a question of do you build 10% or do you build in 90%?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:07:17):\nI think for people starting, the third party products that are available today are pretty good. This wasn't the case when I started working. So when I started running experiments at Amazon, we were building the platform because nothing existed. Same at Microsoft. I think today, there's enough vendors that provide good experimentation platforms that are trustworthy, that I would say not a good way to consider using one of those.\n\nLenny (01:07:44):\nSay you're at a company where there's resistance to experimentation and A/B testing, whether it's a startup or a bigger company. What have you found works in helping shift that culture, and how long does that usually take, especially at a larger company?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:07:57):\nMy general experience is with Microsoft, where we went with this beach head of Bing. We were running a few experiments and then we were asked to focus on Bing, and we scaled experimentation and built a platform at scale at Bing.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:08:13):\nOnce Bing was successful and we were able to share all these surprising results, I think that many, many more people in the company were amenable. It was also the case that helped a lot that, there's a usual cross pollination. People from Bing move out to other groups, and that helped these other groups say, \"Hey, there's a better way to build software.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:08:34):\nSo I think if you're starting out, find a place, find a team where experimentation is easy to run. And by that, I mean they're launching often, right? Don't go with the team that launches every six months, or Office used to launch every three years. Go with the team that launches frequently. They're running on sprints, they launch every week or two. Sometimes they launch daily. I mean, Bing used to launch multiple times a day.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:08:59):\nAnd then make sure that you understand the question of the OEC. Is it clear what they're optimizing for? There are some groups where you can come up with a good OEC. Some groups are harder.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:09:11):\nI remember one funny example was the microsoft.com website, which this is not MSN, this is microsoft.com, has multiple different constituencies that are trying to determine this is a support site, and this is the ability to sell software through this site, and warn you about safety and updates. It has so many goals. I remember when the team said, \"We want to run experiments,\" and I brought the group in and some of the managers and I said, \"Do you know what you're optimizing for?\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:09:47):\nIt was very funny because they surprised me. They said, \"Hey Ronny, we read some of your papers. We know there's this term called OEC. We decided the time on site is our OEC.\" And I said, \"Wait a minute. Some of your main goals is support site. Is people spending more time on the support site a good thing or a bad thing?\" And then half the room thought that more time is better, and half the room thought that more time is worse. So an OEC is bad if directionally, you can't agree on it.\n\nLenny (01:10:18):\nThat's a great tip. Along these same lines, I know you're a big fan of platforms and building a platform to run experiments, versus just one-off experiments. Can you just talk briefly about that to give people a sense of where they probably should be going with their experimentation approach?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:10:32):\nYeah, so I think the motivation is to bring the marginal cost of experiments down to zero. So the more you self-service, go to a website, set up your experiment, define your targets, define the metrics that you want, right? People don't appreciate that the number of metrics starts to grow really fast if you're doing things right. At Bing, you could define 10,000 metrics that you wanted to be in your scorecard. Big numbers.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:11:02):\nSo it was so big, and people said it's computationally inefficient. We broke them into templates so that if you were launching a UI experiment, you would get this set of 2,000. If you were doing a revenue experiment, you would get this set of 2,000.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:11:15):\nSo the point was build a platform that can quickly allow you to set up and run an experiment, and then analyze it. I think one of the things that I will say at Airbnb is the analysis was relatively weak, and so lots of data scientists were hired to be able to compensate for the fact that the platform didn't do enough.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:11:36):\nAnd this happens in other organizations too, where there's this trade-off. If you're building a good platform, invest in it so that more and more automation will allow people to look at the analysis, without the need to involve a data scientist.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:11:53):\nWe published a paper. Again, I'll give it in the notes with this nice matrix of six axes, and how you move from crawl, to walk, to run, to fly, and what you need to build on those six axes. So one of the things that I do sometimes when I consult is I go into the org and say, \"Where do you think you are on these six axes?\" And that should be the guidance for what are the things you need to do next.\n\nLenny (01:12:21):\nThis is going to be the most epic show notes episode we've had yet. Maybe a last question. We talked about how important trust is to running experiments, and how even though people talk about speed, trust ends up being most important. Still, I want to ask you about speed. Is there anything you recommend for helping people run experiments faster and get results more quickly that they can implement?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:12:40):\nYeah, so I'll say a couple of things. One is if your platform is good, then when the experiment finishes, you should have a scorecard soon after. Maybe takes a day, but it shouldn't be that you have to wait a week for the data scientist. To me, this is the number one way to speed up things.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:13:00):\nNow, in terms of using the data efficiently, there are mechanisms out there under the title of variance reduction that help you reduce the variance of metrics so that you need less users, so that you can get results faster. Some examples that you might think about are capping metrics. So if your revenue metric is very skewed, maybe you say, \"Well, if somebody purchased over $1,000, let's make that $1,000.\" At Airbnb, one of the key metrics for example, is nights booked.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:13:30):\nWell, it turns out that some people book tens of nights. They're like an agency or something, hundreds of nights. You may say, \"Okay, let's just cap this. It's unlikely that people book more than 30 days in a given month.\" So that various reduction technique will allow you to get statistically significant results faster.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:13:53):\nAnd a third technique is called cupid, which is an article that we published. Again, I can give it in the notes, which uses the pre-experiment data to adjust the result. And we can show that you get the result as unbiased, but with lower variance, and hence, it requires fewer users.\n\nLenny (01:14:11):\nRonny, is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:14:15):\nNo, I think we've asked a lot of good questions. Hope people enjoy this.\n\nLenny (01:14:20):\nI know they will.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:14:21):\nLightning round.\n\nLenny (01:14:22):\nLightning round. Here we go. I'm just going to roll right into it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:14:29):\nThere's a fun book called Calling Bullshit, which despite the name, which is a little extreme, I think, for a title, it actually has a lot of amazing insights that I love. And it sort of embodies, in my opinion, a lot of the Twyman's law showing that things that are too extreme, your bullshit meter should go up and say, \"Hey, I don't believe that.\" So that's my number one recommendation.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:14:57):\nThere's a slightly older book that I love called Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths And Total Nonsense by the Stanford professors from the Graduate School of Business. Very interesting to see many of the things that we grew up with as well understood turn out to have no justification.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:15:21):\nSo a stranger book, which I love, sort of on the verge of psychology, it's called Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me), about all the fallacies that we fall into, and the humbling results from that.\n\nLenny (01:15:37):\nThe titles of these are hilarious, and there's a common theme across all these books. Next question, what is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:15:47):\nSo I recently saw a short series called Chernobyl, the disaster. I thought it was amazingly well done. Highly recommended it, based on true events. As usual, there's some freedom for the artistic movie. It was kind of interesting at the end, they say, \"This woman in the movie wasn't really a woman. It was a bunch of 30 data scientists.\" Not data scientists, 30 scientists that in real life, presented all the data to the leadership of what to do.\n\nLenny (01:16:22):\nI remember that. Fun fact, I was born in Odessa, Ukraine, which was not so far from Chernobyl. And I remember my dad told me he had to go to work. They called him into work that day to clean some stuff off the trees. I think ash from the explosion or something. It was far away where I don't think we were exposed, but we were in the vicinity. That's pretty scary. My wife, every time something's wrong with me, she's like, \"That must be a Chernobyl thing.\" Okay, next question. Favorite interview question you like to ask people when you're interviewing them?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:16:56):\nSo it depends on the interview, but when I do a technical interview, which I do less of, but one question that I love that it's amazing how many people it throws away for languages like C++, is tell me what the static qualifier does. And for multiple, you can do it for a variable, you can do it for function. And it is just amazing that I would say more than 50% of people that interview for engineering job cannot get this, and get it awfully wrong.\n\nLenny (01:17:31):\nDefinitely the most technical answer to this question yet.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:17:34):\nVery technical, yeah.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:17:34):\nI love it.\n\nLenny (01:17:36):\nOkay. What's a favorite recent product you've discovered that you love?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:17:39):\nBlink cameras. So a Blink camera is this small camera. You stick in two AA batteries, and it lasts for about six months. They claim up to two years. My experience is usually about six months. But it was just amazing to me how you can throw these things around in the yard and see things that you would never know otherwise. Some animals that go by. We had a skunk that we couldn't figure out how he was entering, so I threw five cameras out and I saw where he came in.\n\nLenny (01:18:18):\nWhere'd he come in?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:18:19):\nHe came in under a hole on the fence that was about this high. I have a video of this thing just squishing underneath. We never would've assumed that it came from there, from the neighbor. But yeah, these things have just changed. And when you're away on a trip, it's always nice to be able to say, \"I can see my house. Everything's okay.\" At one point, we had a false alarm, and the cops came in and had this amazing video of how they're entering the house and pulling the guns out.\n\nLenny (01:18:56):\nYou got to share that on TikTok. That's good content. Wow. Okay. Blink cameras. We'll set those up in my house asap.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:19:04):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:19:06):\nWhat is something relatively minor you've changed in the way your teams develop product, that has had a big impact on their ability to execute?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:19:14):\nI think this is something that I learned at Amazon, which is a structured narrative. So Amazon has some variance of this, which sometimes go by the name of a six pager or something. But when I was at Amazon, I still remember that email from Jeff, which is, \"No more PowerPoint. I'm going to force you to write a narrative.\"\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:19:34):\nI took that to heart. And many of the features that the team presented instead of a PowerPoint, you start off with a structured document that tells you what you need, the questions you need to answer for your idea. And then we review them as a team.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:19:51):\nAnd Amazon, these were paper-based. Now it's all based on Word or Google Docs where people comment, and I think the impact of that was amazing. I think the ability to give people honest feedback and have them appreciate, and have it stay after the meeting in these notes on the document, just amazing.\n\nLenny (01:20:13):\nFinal question, have you ever run an A/B test on your life, either your dating life, your family, your kids? And if so, what did you try?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:20:21):\nSo there aren't enough units. Remember I said you need 10,000 of something to run true A/B tests? I will say a couple of things. One is I try to emphasize to my family, and friends, and everybody, this idea called the hierarchy of evidence. When you read something, there's a hierarchy of trust levels. If something is anecdotal, don't trust it. If there was an experiment, it was observational. Give it some bit of trust. As you get more up and up to a natural experiment, and controlled experiments, and multiple controlled experiments, your trust levels should go up. So I think that that's a very important thing that a lot of people miss when they see something in the news is, where does it come from?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:21:06):\nI have a talk that I've shared of all these observational studies that people made that were published. And then somehow, a control experiment was run later on and proved that it was directionally incorrect. So I think there's a lot to learn about this idea of the hierarchy of evidence, and share it with our family, and kids, and friends. I think there's a book that's based on this. It's like How to Read a Book.\n\nLenny (01:21:34):\nWell, Ronny, the experiment of us recording a podcast I think is 100% positive P value 0.0. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:21:44):\nThank you so much for inviting me and for great questions.\n\nLenny (01:21:47):\nAmazing. I appreciate that. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and is there anything that listeners can do for you?\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:21:55):\nFinding me online is easy. It's LinkedIn. And what can people do for me? Understand the idea of control experiments as a mechanism to make the right data-driven decisions. Use science. Learn more by reading my book if you want. Again, all proceeds go to charity. And if you want to learn more, there's a class that I teach every quarter on Maven. We'll put in the notes how to find it, and some discount for people who managed to stay all the way to the end of this podcast.\n\nLenny (01:22:31):\nYeah, that's awesome. We'll include that at the top so people don't miss it, so there's going to be a code to get a discount on your course. Ronny, thank you again so much for being here. This was amazing.\n\nRonny Kohavi (01:22:39):\nThank you so much.\n\nLenny (01:22:40):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# A better way to plan, build, and ship products | Ryan Singer (creator of “Shape Up\")\n\n## Transcript\n\n[00:00:00] Ryan: I don't know how to articulate that- that feeling, but that flutter in your stomach that you wake up with in the morning of just anxiety and stress and- and worry. Um, being a CEO or founder makes it slightly harder, uh, in some ways, because you still have to put on this mask. You have to put on this space of confidence externally and- and internally as well, where people need to trust you. You also don't want to subject them to the same anxiety that you're feeling and be a 100% transparent. \n[00:00:28] Lenny: Ryan Hoover is the founder of Product Hunt, which you already know. He's also former product manager, which I did not know. Currently, he's a full-time investor with his fund, the Weekend Fund. He's also an author of a bunch of great block posts and an actual book, called Hooked. He's also really good on Twitter and in my opinion, a very special human being. Ryan Hoover, welcome to the podcast.\n[00:00:52] Ryan: Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I've been reading a lot of your blog posts over, I don't know, past two or three years now, and I'm glad to- to see you do the podcast now. It's cool.\n[00:01:01] Lenny: Thank you, man. That compliment will go straight to my heart. And I will think about it often. I appreciate that. \n[00:01:07] Ryan: Cut- cut that and put it on Twitter. There you go. Yeah. [laughs]\n[00:01:09] Lenny: [That's the clip, we're done. [laughs]\n[00:01:10] Ryan: Yeah. Done, over. [laughs]\n[00:01:14] Lenny: [laughs] This episode's brought to you by RevenueCat.

Learn more at revenuecat.com.\n[00:02:12] Hey Ashley, head of marketing and Flatfile, how many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSB files from their customers?\n[00:02:22] Ashley: At least 40%.\n[00:02:23] Lenny: And how many of them screw that up? And what happens when they do?\n[00:02:26] Ashley: Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So, if your CMC importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n[00:02:43] Lenny: I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both sign-up conversion and increasing longterm retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n[00:03:01] Ashley: Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and ZORA are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.\n[00:03:17] Lenny: If you'd like to learn more or get started, check out Flatfile at flatfile.com/lenny.\n[00:03:23] Lenny: You're such a tech celebrity; everybody knows Product Hunt. Everybody knows Ryan Hoover, at least in tech. And I'm curious, how often are you recognized walking around the street, in life, and has there ever been like a super awkward or super hilarious moment of that?\n[00:03:37] Ryan: Yeah, so t- Product Hunt started in late 2013 and quickly got a lot of traction in- in the tech- tech sphere. So, yeah, people in tech, um, might recognize me. People outside of tech, doubt- doubt they recognized me. Um, I actually do wonder subconsciously if I grew my hair out to avoid being recognized. \nUm, I'm not sure if it's true or not, but anyway, it's been a couple years or so growing my hair out and I'm like, ah, I just kinda wanna like disappear sometimes. But, you know, in San Francisco, where everybody's in tech, um, there was a lot of that. And probably the- the, the moment where I was like, \"Oh, this is- this is like a thing,\" uh, it was probably early Product Hunt, uh, I was at- do you remember... I don't know if you know this. Do you know a club, um, called DNA Lounge, and they did something-\n[00:04:19] Lenny: Mm-hmm.\n[00:04:20] Ryan: ... Called Bootie every Saturday-\n[00:04:20] Lenny: Mm-hmm.\n[00:04:21] Ryan: ... It was like a mash-up dance party.\n[00:04:22] Lenny: Yeah.\n[00:04:23] Ryan: Yeah. Super well known in the Bay Area. Really fun, fun, uh, kind of experience. Anyway, I remember being with friends and drinking, like- like one does and somebody turns around and says, “Is that the Product Hunt guy?” \n[00:04:33] Lenny: [laughs]\n[00:04:33] Ryan: And that was the first time that sort of happened in that setting where I was like, oh gosh, now I have to like, think about my actions. And I can't just like, be entirely like loose and, you know, relax with my friends. And, um, so anyway, there- there's always pros and cons to those types of things. Um, but you know, it- it definitely is makes me more aware of, I'm already a very, like sometimes anxious and like self-aware person in terms of like my surroundings.\nAnd so when you combine that with, “Oh, these strangers might be watching me,” is not the best thing in the world, but it's okay.\n[00:05:04] Lenny: I've actually gone a little bit through that same experience recently in my, like a much smaller sense where I- with this newsletter and the growth of this thing, there’s been like meetups happening all over the world. And so I've been going to the SF meetups here and there, and it feels very strange to be like, known and people get- they’re like taken pictures with me, like what the- what the hell's going on.\n‘Cause I started this thing as, uh, COVID hit and it was like- everyone's at home, I was just typing on my computer, didn’t have to go anywhere. And as the world has emerged, it's become a new- a new thing I'm dealing with, on a much smaller scale.\n[00:05:35] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. Events are events are fun. Um, we threw a bunch of them at- at Product Hunt. Uh, yeah, you- you do a lot of selfies and a lot of like, handshakes and it’s- there's, there's some energy there. I'm an introvert though. So by hour, like three or four, I'm just like, ugh… uh… I need to use the restroom cause I haven't been able to escape and I'm socially exhausted, so, but they are fun.\n[00:05:55] Lenny: I know, uh, exactly what you mean. I am also an introvert and I get so drained doing things like that. I was gonna ask you about that. So yeah. Um, along the same lines, you’re- you're a very public person. You tweet a lot, you share a lot, you do a lot of podcasts and things like that. What's something that people don't know about you?\n[00:06:12] Ryan: Yeah. Um, you're right. I- I probably sh- maybe overshare, uh, on Twitter and other things…\n[00:06:17] Lenny: No, that, that is not what-\n[00:06:18] Ryan: Um, there is a list of [laughs] no, no, I know. I know what you're saying. Um, but there's also a whole series of things that I don't talk about. Um, some of them- well, anyway, I won't, I won't talk about the things I can't talk about.\nUh, but one thing that, um, one thing that most people don't know about- I know there- there's certain juicy things, uh, like everybody has in their life. Um, I recently moved to- well, I guess it's been a year. Um, I moved to Miami about a year ago and, uh, I haven't been talking about it publicly, primarily because I just didn't want to be lumped into, oh, another person moving to Miami.\nLike, I, I don't know. I just, there's no benefit or like, reason for me to do so. Uh, I want my friends there in Miami to know I'm there, but otherwise I don't need the world to know. I guess now they will. Um, that said in Miami, you know, we’re- we're there about two thirds of the year, so I'm actually in California right now.\nUm, as you know, the summer humidity come- comes through Miami and hurricane season. We’re- we're planning to do more of, um- I wouldn't call it nomadic and I wouldn't call it bicoastal per se, but something like that. Where two thirds of the year we’re Miami and then maybe a third were in New York, or LA, or someplace else.\nUm, and I love that. Um, fortunately we have the flexibility, uh, when I say we, my girlfriend, Susie, and I, to just carry our laptops and work anywhere. So it's been- it's been a nice lifestyle kinda shift.\n[00:07:33] Lenny: I did not know that, that is very interesting. Why did you get pulled into Miami? What pulls you there?\n[00:07:39] Ryan: Yeah. You know? Um, so the way I describe ci- cities are kinda like a product. So if you're in the supermarket or- supermarket, I sound like an, old- old person. Ha, if- if you're at a store, you're looking at different products, or if you're online, you're evaluating different products, and they each have like a cost and they have some benefits, um, or values or whatever you- you want to use to describe it.\nAnd for me, each city is kind of like that. And so, you know, in terms of costs, there's cost of living in terms of housing, uh, food, taxes, a bunch of things that go into the cost of living in the city. And then the city provides a lot of benefits and- and things like that. And so in LA- so I was in bay area for ten years, LA for two Miami for one.\nNow, they each have their own pros and cons. They each cost effectively different prices. And so we visited Miami a year and a half ago and we just fell in love with lot- lots of it. Um, we also- it's just cheaper. It's cheaper than the Bay Area. It's cheaper than LA. Um, when- when you kind of count, kinda like all in costs, um, and we had a bunch of friends move there, so we enjoyed the city.\nWe're like, this is good., strong ROI. Uh, this is a good product. Let’s- let's move there. Um, but at the same time, as I mentioned, like- we are traveling and, and exploring other cities. So it’s- it's kind of the best of both worlds for us.\n[00:08:53] Lenny: Very cool. Um, curious how long you last there and how you like it over time. I love Miami. I always have a good time when I go there. And I have many friends living there. Changing topics, a little bit, something that I've noticed you do recently, which is super cool is you offer people the chance to DM you questions that they have about their startup or their journey as a founder.\nAnd you just offer to give 'em free advice. And then sometimes you, tweet the DMs to share that with more folks. I'm curious just how many people have DM’d you because this is such a cool offer, and what have you learned going through this and kind of hearing people's questions?\n[00:09:26] Ryan: I first opened up my DMs- I had 'em closed, which is like traditionally the default on Twitter for a long time. ‘Cause I was like, “Oh, if I open them up, I'll just get a bunch of spam and I don't need another inbox to- to call through.” I opened it up quietly and, um, actually didn't get a lot of spam, uh, surprisingly. Like yeah, people would shill something or promote something, but it wasn't too bad.\nSo I- I left it open and then I forget, one day I was maybe I was like- on the elliptical, bike or the recumbent bike or something. And I was just… I- I tend to get on the bike and just hold my phone up and just do emails and work. And so, um, I just said, “Hey, DM me if you have any questions, any founders, and I'll try and like answer as many as I can.”\nAnd, um, part of my motivation for that was… I don't know, I was just killing time. And the other was, I used to blog a lot. I used to write a lot, um, I don't know, I've written hundreds of blog posts, but not so much anymore. I rarely write anymore. And part of it's because it just takes so long to write.\nAnd sometimes I don't feel like inspired by any topic. It’s- it's sort of like a writer's block. And so I found this also kind of as a means to like, do micro- almost like micro blog posts in a way, uh, where the prompt is the question from somebody else. I don't have to think about the pr- prompt. And then the answer is- is in some ways, a way for me to actually think about that- that topic, almost like refine my own thinking in, in some sense.\nAnd so I started doing that and then I realized, “Well, maybe other people have similar questions, and maybe other people have other answers and other ideas too,” so I would just take a screenshot of my answer and kind of summarize their answer, of course, keeping it anonymous, not sharing anything that would be sensitive. Um, and just put it on Twitter and- you know, it's been fun.\nI do that maybe once every three or four days, I share a new question and answer and, sort of like a… It's like micro blogging in a way, I guess that’s what Twitter is, but like it's a kind of like a real micro-blogging kind of like, uh, um, activity for me.\n[00:11:15] Lenny: Is there anything that's kind of surprised you, or that you've learned from founders? What they ask you about? Like, “Wow, I didn't expect this was gonna be such a common problem or question.”\n[00:11:24] Ryan: I wouldn't say anything like super surprising. However, a lot of people… So, you could do the same thing on Twitter and say, “Hey, AMA, ask me anything in public,” the thing is people are not gonna ask certain things, um, for a lot of reasons. And maybe the biggest surprise was a lot of people are pretty vulnerable.\nThese are strangers, founders who DM me saying, “Hey, I’m- we have three months runway left. We’re running out of money. Here's a situation. What advice do you have?” Or just things that, you know, everyone has to wear this unfortunate mask is kind of the way I- what I used to describe it. This mask in life, in business, where everything is going great.\nAnd you know, you're super confident, there are no problems. You got it all under control. And so the reality is that's not the case. Like [laughs] if you peered inside of almost every single company, it probably looks chaotic in- in different ways. And so I guess- I guess maybe the biggest surprise or thing that I value the most is the authenticity of people willing to share some of these, um, vulnerable moments and questions.\n[00:12:17] Lenny: Awesome. What's interesting about your format is as you were talking, I kind of realized it's very similar to my newsletter format, which I- which I think is part of the reason it worked is it's based on people asking me a question, and then I answer the question, and then-\n[00:12:28] Ryan: It's true. \n[00:12:29] Lenny: … And that ends up forcing you to have like concrete, actionable advice.\nSo you've kind of developed even more interesting way of doing it on Twitter, where it's more focused. So, very smart.\n[00:12:39] Ryan: I've always liked your format by the way, in that you are, um- you're a curator in many sense. Like- yeah, you have a lot of experience and good ideas, but you're not trying to answer all the questions in that you are really pulling in experts in their domain expertise to like find answers or inspiration.\nAnd I've always liked that format because one; it, I think leads to a better- better results, better content, better answers, but also it's arguably easier. Um, like imagine if- if you tried to like write, well, you you're shaking your head almost like it’s-\n[00:13:10] Lenny: Like if I had the answers, I'd be like, “Oh, here you go. I'm done.” You know, the research takes a lot of work and time, but- but I do agree. It ends up being a lot more useful and, and- and valuable. And the reason I did that, just to kind of explain that briefly, is when I left Airbnb, people kept coming to me and asking me like, “Hey, how did Airbnb do this thing?\nHow'd they do that thing.” And I was just like- like, they, they don't know what they're doing. They just did this thing, and who knows if that was the thing that helped them, or if that was the right way of approaching it. So I wanted to do this, like, “What does everyone do? And what seems to be the pattern of the things that work?” And that kind of led to this approach.\nAnd it takes a lot of time. Especially this new series that we're gonna chat a bit about that I worked on where it's just like endless interviews and chats and researchers and watching interviews. But yeah, it works out.\n[00:13:54] Ryan: Yeah, yeah. You- you, how many hours actually, do you put into like a typical essay?\n[00:13:59] Lenny: Oh, a reverse question. Uh, I would say the- \n[00:14:02] Ryan: Yeah, I don’t know if I'm supposed to ask you questions, [laughs] but I'm curious.\n[00:14:04] Lenny: This is banned. [laughs] No, it's cool. I say- I'd say the, uh, median post is about 10 hours. It's like, maybe I kind of work on it through the week. So maybe, like a few days through the week, but the most epic posts take hundreds and hundreds of hours that I kind of work on behind the scenes as I work on the weekly posts.\nSo there's a wide range. Some posts take like three hours and sometimes those do very well, much better than expected.\n[00:14:30] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. I- that's exactly going back to my, my point about like- it takes a long time to write content that you're proud of. Um, I’m also just very particular about words, uh, for better or worse. And so I- the first draft actually is maybe like 20 or 30% of the time. And then the rest is refining it and getting feedback and everything else.\n[00:14:48] Lenny: That's exactly how I find it. The question I wanted to ask is, startups are so freaking hard… they almost always fail. It's always just like, “Oh my God, this is… Why am I doing this to myself?? My general advice to founders is like, don't start a company, unless you just like, can't not start a company because it's so hard.\nWhat's your take there? What do you think? What do you advise founders for when they're thinking about, should I start a company? Should I not start a company? Which- how should I approach this?\n[00:15:15] Ryan: I do- I do spend time, ironically, like. challenging founders sometimes when they're thinking about raising or thinking about an idea to- to not raise. Um, people who are in tech, uh, especially, are certain bubbles [laughs] of tech, that’s the default. It's like, “The first thing I do, I have an idea, now let's go raise money.” \nAnd we've gone through some like pretty massive bull cycles where that- that was possible for a lot of people. But it's a huge decision. So with- with Product Hunt, it was a side project in the beginning. It wasn't actually intended to be a startup at all, but in the beginning, you know, it was a newsletter, then it was a website and it was about four to five months before we even incorporated.And we got a lot of traction. \nSo, it was during that time, I was really just thoughtful around, \"Should we raise? Do I wanna work on this for many, many years? What's the opportunity? Is this even a venture backable like idea?\" Like all those questions were circulating in my mind for a while. And this is also in a time when the market was pretty, was similarly bullish. This is, uh, end of 2013, early 2014. And investors were- were using Product Hunt to reach out to me, and they were sort courting- courting me, and um, kinda doing that whole song and dance to invest, but I- I just wasn't sure if I wanted to. And so, I don't know, I think a lot of the- those decisions, they're very personal and contextual. However, I think it's super important that founders see a line of sight to work on this for ... I think my rule of thumb is a decade, just do you see yourself working on this for a decade?\nAnd maybe it's not a decade that you actually work on it. It probably won’t, it either, it'll probably fail before then as most startups do, but I think it's a good litmus test for yourself to be like, “Do I actually care about this enough? Am I, am I really stoked to work on this for many, many years?” But then, you know, the other thing is, I think a lot of people also think “I need to start a company. I need to start a startup.” \nAnd they skip to that step without just tinkering and building and, you know, Product Hunt, we called it, not even a side project, we called it an experiment. And that framing I think, is for me, has always been helpful because it's an experiment is really not about success. Of course you want it to be successful, but the goal is not success.\nI put that in quotes, it's really to learn and, you know, see if people want this thing and then kind of adapt. And so like an experimental mindset is helpful and I think a valuable way to start. It even goes back to like, why I named the fund Weekend Fund. It's like, what are you tinkering with on the weekends?\nYou know? And how can you be more curious and experimental and kind of your exploration of new startup ideas?\n[00:17:43] Lenny: I didn't know that's why it was called the Weekend Fund. I thought it's because you worked on it on the weekends, or is it both?\n[00:17:48] Ryan: [laughs] It had like multiple meetings. Yeah, it was- three meanings: One was- was that I started Weekend Fund when I was building Product Hunt. So it took a lot of pitch- pitches and calls with founders on the weekends. Two, I think a lot of great ideas start by like metaphorically speaking, nights and weekends, um, kind of side projects or ideation.\nAnd then the third reason was it was like more friendly. I don't know, I didn't wanna name it. Hoover capital or something like sterile, wanted it to be -\n[00:18:14] Lenny: Wait, that's an awesome name. Hoover capital. Wow. \n[00:18:18] Ryan: …Capital. Uh I don't know. I, I feel well.\n[00:18:23] Lenny: Yeah, it's not on brand,\n[00:18:24] Ryan: Yeah. \n[00:18:25] Lenny: But it’s powerful- \n[00:18:25] Ryan: Um, yeah. [laughs] \n[00:18:28] Lenny: As you know, I asked people on Twitter what questions they would want to ask you. And so I'm gonna inter splice these questions as we go through this. And, you just touched on Product Hunt and fundraising, and I'm curious if you were to go back and- and do it again.\nWould you raise money for Product Hunt, or would you not?\n[00:18:44] Ryan: Great question. So at the time, this is also the thing I ask [laughs] founders is why do you need to raise money? Like, what is it for? Surprisingly, some people like- I don't know, like they don't have a clear answer. For me, It was pretty obvious. Like we needed- we needed to hire, we needed people. Like, I- I didn't have personal capital to- to pay people.\nThere was an alternative, uh, reality where we actually built an open source. I was thinking like, “Is that possible?” Like we're building something for the tech community. I'm sure a lot of people would love to work on this. Could we build it in an open source way, but that like- that's really hard to do.\nAnd when you're building a company, you probably don't want to innovate on too many things, um, including like essentially how to build a product and build a team. Anyway, to answer your question, if I- I don't, I don't know what the right at the time raising money was the right decision because I- I wanted to hire and I didn't have personal capital.\nThere really weren't any other realistic options. I don't think. Today I could get further with my own- I'm not super wealthy and I'm super illiquid, but I have at least enough money where I could have funded, you know, maybe a year of development with this very small team. So today it might be a little bit different in which I might not raise venture capital because Product Hunt isn't the type of company that needs to raise a ton of money.\nIt's also one which is not, um, doesn't have like direct competitors in the sense of like an Uber and Lyft situation where raising is actually like kind of mandatory and you sort of have to build a massive war chest to compete. So there- there is a scenario where if I had more money, then maybe I wouldn't have raised venture capital. But yeah… there- there's a lot of other like decisions and other things that probably, uh, bigger mistakes I think I made. Um, not that raising money was a mistake by any means. It was, I think the right decision then, but yeah- there's a lot of learnings in hindsight's 2020.\n[00:20:31] Lenny: The point you made about like, you just needed money to like run the thing. I think that's so, so overlooked when people bash the idea of fundraising for a startup that maybe didn't need it. Like you just need money. Like you don't have just money to burn and go into debt. That makes sense to raise some money and see where this thing goes without really knowing where it's gonna go.\n[00:20:49] Ryan: Mm-hmm .Yeah, especially if it’s… I mean, I think it's very important to raise- raise from people who are aligned with you too. Meaning like, “Why does this person want to, whether it's an angel or a fund, invest in your fund?” Um, sorry, not fund… your company. When you go down a certain path, when you raise a series A, B, C, like you have different expectations and when you raise your proceed or seed round. So I think also understanding like, you know, what you're signing up for is super important.\n[00:21:16] Lenny: What kind of treadmill you’re- you're getting on.\n[00:21:18] Ryan: Yes. Yeah. ‘Cause you can't get off. I mean you can, but it's not like a company… I always say like when you're at a company, you can put in two weeks, notice one month notice. You can move on. As- as a founder or CEO, you can’t. Like, you really can't. Um, now you technically can… But you can’t, it- it's really, hard, um, to, to exit. \n[00:21:38] Lenny: Yeah. I look at the Airbnb founders. Who've been doing this for 15 years. Like, you know, they're doing well in life, but they also… it's very hard to leave.\n[00:21:46] Ryan: Mm-hmm.\n[00:21:38] Lenny: Yeah. Coming back to Product Hunt, people launch their product on Product Hunt, that's the thing, and I'm curious; founders are always so obsessed with launching and the power of a launch, and \"We gotta launch.” Do you think launches are worth it for a company? Is that something founders should be spending time on or is it often better just to not even spend time on that and just build slowly?\n[00:22:07] Ryan: Yeah, I- I always kinda ... Whenever I share like my perspective on stuff, I- I always enforce it always like it kinda depends, which is kinda like it sounds like a cop-out answer. So, it's- it's more ... My answers are usually more nuanced, and the thing about launching is- is going back to why are you raising money. What's the goal? Same thing. Why are you launching? And the the- a lot of people default to things like customer acquisition, \"Oh, I wanna acquire customers.\" But sometimes that's actually not- it's not useful. Launch sometimes doesn't help with that, but there are many other reasons why you might wanna launch.\nSo, customer acquisition one, to get the word out. Another can be recruiting. So, by, you know, sharing your story, getting people excited, it might make it easier to recruit and get people excited about, you know, what you're building. Another is fundraising. Sometimes it can create momentum, you know, as- as other investors, they do read the news and they know that, you know, when this company is more public, they're might be more heat around it- a particular deal. Feedback is one. Um, the feedback from users, feedback just serendipitously and- and sort of another one is partnership. So, as you launch, you might also encounter more partnerships, more opportunities. I think there's a serendipitous effect of launching. So, I think understanding like what are the priorities of the business. Like if you- it might not be customer acquisition at all, it might be, \"We need to recruit and hire. Let's launch, so we can get the word out. Hopefully that will help land, you know, our next, you know, engineers, designers, or whoever.\" \nAnd then I also see there's like these little ti- side benefits too of launching that we see a lot through Product Hunt. One of them is team morale. And this- this might- I think this is overlooked. And I- I would also encourage [laughs] founders not to get their team too, um, I would say- you- you shouldn't be motivated to launch a product just to get like the likes on Twitter and the upvotes on Product Hunt, but there is a gr- like a powerful team morale and kinda building moment there where you can all celebrate what you've accomplished and what you built and put it out to the world. And, you know, somebody on the team can share, you know, the- the- the Product Hunt launch or, you know, some Tech Crunch article with their- their mom. And, you know, like that seems like a trivial kind of meaningless thing, but it actually matters for a lot of people. And then the other thing is SEO. So, if SEO's like a part of your strategy, having articles, positive articles, having a- a positive Product Hunt launch, things like that can also be helpful.\n[00:24:21] Lenny: That's awesome. I love that last point about morale. I- I hadn't thought about that. You've seen probably more launches than other person out there. How many launches of startups would you estimate you've kind of like seen or been [laughs], I don't know, an observer of? If that makes any sense. \n[00:24:38] Ryan: Um, I should look at our database on Product Hunt and see how many launches we've had 'cause it's gonna be a subset of that. I mean by seen, I- I- some of it's very high-level, but tens of thousands over the years.\n[00:24:48] Lenny: Okay, so when you think about that, do you have any sense of what correlates with a great launch versus just like an okay launch? What- what do founders miss with how they launch?\n[00:25:01] Ryan: Yeah, I mean the- this goes back to college and- and the a- you know, I won't go on my own rant about education, but in, uh, you know, English class and writing class, a lot of teachers teach people to write with big words and fill pages of content and basically not speak like a human. And so, one- one thing I've noticed among founders and just people in general is they tend to write like a- a PR person and not like a human and not like, you know, the- the way that I kind of describe kind of a frame of- of writing, maybe your tagline for Product Hunt, um, or for your launch in general is like how- how do your customers or your users describe your product to other people? Or another frame is how do you describe it to your friends? Like when you're just, you know, hanging out, like how do you describe what you do, what you built, what it's for? And that language, I think, resonates with people because it feels way more authentic.\nAnd the people that use buzzwords and- and vague language, it just doesn't click. People see right- people are sick of the PR [laughs] speech. And so, I think the language and the microcopy, copyrighting matters so much. And then there's a lot of other things around like we should go more to the product and less about the launch. Like do you really understand who you're building for? And do you understand how to communicate the value prop- like what is it in the mind of user? There's sort of a lot of, I guess, more strategic kinda like decisions that go into that- that, uh, before the launch.\n[00:26:22] Lenny: Imagine each of those, uh, points can be its own podcast and block post. [laughs] One of the questions that people asked me on Twitter was the classic, \"How do I get to number one on Product Hunt?\" So, my question to you is I know that's like ... There's not gonna be a silver bullet. Is there like a guide that you point people to that's like, \"Here, just follow this advice,\" and/or, I don't know, two or three key things that you just gotta get right.\n[00:26:44] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, so in the posts below, there's actually a link- links to a bunch of guides and FAQs and things like that. So, it's really easy to find like sort of the best practices there. The team also has like this checklist. So, once you launch, there's like a checklist of things, recommendations or tips. And I'm actually forgetting like what each of them are specifically right now, but some of the things that I've noticed that make a big difference is we've already talked about the tagline copy, that goes to, not only the post, but also the maker. Usually people tend to add like some introduction, some context. Uh, generally a lot of people will, they- they manufacture PR speak there too, and so speaking like a human, I think, is important. Also keeping it a little brief. Some people write essays, which might be interesting, but the reality is most consumers, especially people on Product Hunt, you know, they're- they're flipping through a bunch of ideas. They're looking for things that spark their curiosity and interest.\nAnd they probably not particularly interested in reading like an [laughs] essay, you know, from- from the makers. So, keeping that short, I think, is helpful. And then another big one is the gallery is- is often the first thing that someone is gonna see once they land on the page. And so, just naturally our eyes gravitate towards visuals. And some of the most interesting presentations I've seen is people use the gallery almost like a slideshow, um, like telling a story, where each slide is- is communicating like a different- well, a story of some sort. It could be like, \"Here's the before and after with our product,\" or \"Here's the evolution of what this product can do.\" There's many different ways to approach it, but like a really clean, you know, visually interesting story, um, can also be a great way to like capture people's interest in what you built.\n[00:28:21] Lenny: Awesome. That was very tactical and helpful. If you were to launch something on Product Hunt yourself, and it wasn't like hunted by Ryan Hoover, do you think you would get to the top?\n[00:28:30] Ryan: [laughs] I- I mean I don't know. It's- it's funny because if you ... We should do some like historical analysis on Product Hunt 'cause I'd be curious to know the actual numbers, but it varies all over the board. So, some people, they ask me, \"Hey, like I don't know, is Product Hunt like ... Do B2B companies do well there?\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, like a lo- m- probably more B2B companies than B2C companies actually,\" and so you see, you know, seemingly boring companies that tap into something that- that- that people find useful or resonate- resonates with them, um, can go to the top. And then you also see the weird, wacky stuff, you know, the- the silly apps also hit the top. So, I don't know, it really varies.\nAnd sometimes it's also driven by like the almost like the zeitgeist, like what do people find interesting right now? Like what's sparking people's interest? Because Product Hunt, on one side, you are potentially attracting people who might be future users and customers, partners, and so on, but it's also just a general kind of like zeitgeist of the early adopter tech community. Like what are they interested in? What do they find compelling in general?\n[00:29:34] Lenny: Got it. Okay, so I have a bunch of questions from Twitter that people [laughs] wanted to ask you. And so, let me ask you a few of those, and they're kind of a little bit all over the place, but we'll see- we'll see where this goes. Jessica Toye, who's a- she's a PM at Angel List, she's actually a friend. We were together at Airbnb. She asked a great question.\n[00:29:53] Ryan: Yeah. Jess- Jess is awesome. She- shout-out to Jess, she's like been super helpful on the Angel List side, so she's awesome.\n[00:29:59] Lenny: Amazing. Okay, she's the best. She asked what you learned as a PM that has helped you in your venture career.\n[00:30:06] Ryan: Yeah, um, yeah, so my- my background is, uh, marketing and then product management. Pretty quickly, uh, used to work in the gaming industry, which is like, I think, an- an awesome industry. Really hard to make it in that industry, but like amazing place to learn, and no, no, uh, I have so many biases, so I have to like be cautious of that, but I- I- having a product background, I think, is one of the most important aspects of early stage startup investing, meaning oftentimes, when you're building a new company, there are a lot of risks and there's a lot of important things to- to nail, but it all ultimately comes down to the product that you're building. And so, I think having a product management or a product background is helpful. And one, having more, I guess, perspective in evaluating different ideas and- and arguably more important, uh, how the founder thinks about things. So, it might be less about me evaluating the- the- the market need for this particular idea, but it's what's the thought process and how did this founder come to these product ideas and these insights. And so, I think having a product management background is helpful for that, and I don't know, I also just find it really fun to jam on product with founders. And when it's early, early days, there- there's more opportunity to create some sort of impact or, you know, help shape the product in- in a slight way.[00:31:20] \nLenny: Awesome. Basically if you're a PM, you've got a lot of the skills that you need to be a founder.\n[00:31:24] Ryan: Founder and- and arguably, investor, um, as well.\n[00:31:27] Lenny: Oh, and that's right. Okay. So, uh, Leo of Sousa Ventures, who's also an awesome dude, uh, he asked if you could go back and-\n[00:31:35] Ryan: I saw Leo in, uh, Miami, uh, not long ago.\n[00:31:39] Lenny: Oh yeah. He moved to Miami too. Oh my God. Everyone's over there. Okay, so [laughs], uh, he asked if you could go back and build Product Hunt again, what would you do differently? We talked a bit about this, but anything else?\n[00:31:50] Ryan: Yeah. Um, I've been thinking a lot about this actually lately. And, um, yeah, I mean there's a few things. Uh, one, Product Hunt, in the very beginning, and still today, is very much focused on tech, and there was, at one point, ambition to expand beyond tech into all different types of, you know, categories of products. So, you know, we experimented with podcasts actually, podcast discovery.\nWe experimented in video game discovery, we experimented with book discovery, and the thesis there was, \"Okay, this could be actually discovery platform for all of these communities to discover all these different products,\" and I think there was a lot of good ideas in that. However, I severely underestimated how difficult it would be to do two things: one, the product experience on Product Hunt is very different than how you would wanna discover video games or maybe, in the future, fashion and a bunch of other types of products out there.\nAnd two, it's really difficult to translate a community and expand into other communities. Like some- some have done it. Like Reddit is maybe a great example, where Reddit has this massive [laughs] long tail of, you know, every kinda community you can imagine, but very few companies and platforms can actually do that. So, that's one- one regret is we should not have tried to expand horizontally. We should've just focused entirely vertically and- and served the tech community, you know, better and- and with more things, which is effectively what we're doing now. Another regret, another thing I would've changed is I would've- I would've actually tried to monetize and generated revenue sooner. We- we raised a seed in a series A and we had capital to grow, and we didn't actually try to make money until after we required Angel List.\nAnd my thinking at the time was, and to some extent, there's some truth to this, is like everything you prioritize is at the cost of something else. You know, you- you're essentially taking focus from one thing and directing it to something else. And what mattered most was growth and to grow the community, but what I really should've done is dedicated maybe 10% of our focus on revenue generation because, you know, it was- once we started generating revenue, we- we did so very quickly, and we go to cashflow, break even, I wanna say a year, maybe 12 months after we started generating revenue. So, if we would've started in 2014 to make some money, we coulda been cashflow, break even, you know, maybe 2015, 2016, which would've just given us a lot of flexibility in kind of owning your own destiny and proving out some of the business model itself. \nAnd then like the last thing, uh, I've been thinking about this lately is- is delegation is- is a classic founder challenge. You know, I- I'm just generally a controlling person. That's something I'm working on. And it's really hard sometimes when I have such strong opinions, and I'm very particular about certain things, uh, fully delegate and fully trust everybody. Not necessarily- we have an amazing team. Like I worked with some amazing people, still people that are Product Hunt today like six, seven years later. It wasn't anything about the skills of the team. It was just my own trust and my own delegation, and what I should've done is, you know, up until shortly before I left, I was editing the newsletter every morning, for example, like every morning. I was waking up, you know, 5 a.m., 5:30 a.m., editing the newsletter. I mean that's just kinda silly, you know, to be doing that so many years later after starting.\n[00:35:02] Lenny: I totally get that drive to just make sure everything you're putting out and that your company's putting out is topnotch. I- I have the same feeling, and it is hard to [laughs] let go and just like, \"That's not perfect, but I'm gonna- I'm gonna be okay with that, a few other things.\"\n[00:35:16] Ryan: Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's- it's really hard, and I think it's a tendency that is, uh, in some ways, it's- it's good in that you care so much about the product as a founder. You care so much about what you're building. You care so much about the details, uh, and you need that kind of like almost OCD-like, uh, behavior, however, you also just can't scale yourself nor are you the best person at everything. So, I- I don't know. With hindsight I'm like, \"All right, I should've delegated more. I should've trusted people more.\" And yeah, they'll- there will be more mistakes. I make mistakes all the time, but at the end, it's gonna be way net positive because you kind of have to [inaudible 00:31:30] your company anyway.\n[00:35:54] Lenny: It’s a good segue to a question Harry Stubbings asked that he finds interesting always. What's the most painful lesson that you've learned and, but that you're also happy about to have gone through?\n[00:36:05] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, there's ... I actually- I recently in the past couple weeks, wrote a blog post, that I'm not really able to publish 'cause it's- it's basically when you- there's certain things I wanna share that it- it- it can make things challenging and complicated for others. So, I didn't wanna put anyone else in- in a pickle. So, someday maybe I'll publish this post, but to speak more vaguely about it, like there's some hard- really hard times in Product Hunt, like we- we have all faced in- in different ways as founders, not even just as founders [laughs], just as people. Oh, yeah, there's some times where I felt physically ill, many different moments in- in Product Hunt. And um, it was just really tough, and you know, you- I don't know if- I don't know how to articulate that- that feeling but that flutter in your stomach that you wake up with in the morning of just anxiety and stress and- and worry.\nBeing a CEO or a founder makes it slightly harder in some ways because you still have to put on this mask. You have to put on this face of confidence externally and- and internally as well, where people need to trust you. You- you also don't wanna subject them to the same anxiety that you're feeling and be 100% transparent. So, it's- it's a struggle because, I think, I h- I don't know, I value authenticity so much, and I- I kinda like thrive around people who are authentic, however, there's this like tension with- with being a founder or CEO where you can necessarily share everything. So, anyway, everyone's gone through hardship building a company. You know, the positive aspect of that is like if- I- I think, hopefully growing some empathy for founders who are going through hard situations. I think it's made me a little bit stronger, maybe thicker-skinned for certain things. It just provided more- more perspective, you know, into the company kind of like building journey.\n[00:37:41] Lenny: Okay, listen to this.

Yeah. It's kind of y- y- like a lot of things, you know, uh, what doesn't break you makes you stronger to some extent. So, it didn't break me, uh, it just scarred me a little bit but didn't break me. [laughs]\n[00:38:52] Lenny: And turned you into the Ryan Hoover that we- that we have today.\n[00:38:55] Ryan: Yeah. For better or worse.\n[00:38:57] Lenny: [laughs] Maybe one last question from- from Twitter, Twitteratis. From Sandeep. He just wanted to know what- what have you found matters most to you or mattered most to you in life and in business versus what you thought would matter most?\n[00:39:09] Ryan: Yeah, um, still figuring it out. I'm- I'm- I'm still asking the- the old stereotypical questions like, \"What- what the heck is the meaning of life? Like what am I here for?\" [laughs] All those things.\n[00:39:19] Lenny: Let me know when you figured it out. \n[00:39:20] Ryan: Yeah. And maybe, maybe there is no answer. Maybe the question is, is actually, um, doesn't matter. So I mean, if I'm honest, I'm still figuring all those things out.\nYeah. And maybe- maybe there is no answer. Um, maybe the question is- is actually it doesn't matter. Um, so I mean if I'm honest, I'm still figuring all those things out. I mean I think in- in life, some of the things that I've reflected on is, uh, so damn cliché, but sometimes when cliches are true is like friends and authentic relationships have been, I don't know, they just matter so much, I think. And the older I get too, it's less about, I don't know, I care less about having a lot of friends and more about a few deep, close relationships. And I don't know, I feel like that's very different than like middle school Ryan or like, you know, when you're in- on the playground metaphorically speaking, like where everyone's tryin' to be popular and, you know, meet a lot of people. And even- even joining and- and being, you know, uh, in San Francisco in the tech community, you wanna meet a lot of people and network and all- do all those things, that- that's less interesting to me and less important.\nAnd then, more on the business side, the thing I've been thinking about is like, and I think this is obvious to a lot of people, but I think there's some nuances to it, which is momentum matters so much. And momentum is reflexive in that, you know, high momentum leads to more high momentum. Low momentum leads to more low momentum because there's this energy that- that kinda goes through companies where, when there is momentum, when people are shipping, when things are going well, other people feel that energy, and they wanna do the same, but in the reverse, someone who might be slowing things down, not shipping, not really performing very well, that actually does the reverse too. It- it might lead other people to- to feel less motivated or care less. And so, I don't know, momentum is- is this weird thing that, you know, you- arguably, it's one of the most important things in early-stage startups. And of course, it's an- an input to a lot of things, uh, but it's just so important to nail.\n[00:41:00] Lenny: Mark Andreessen talks about that- that last point that ... There's like a word for it that I forget, that a company is either becoming a gravity and pulling in all resources and funding and attention or losing it. And it's really important as a company to know which one of those are you, and as an investor, you often wanna bet on the company that's just like they're just becoming the center of gravity here, and there's not a lot you can do to change that once they reach a certain point.\n[00:41:24] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, that's a really good point. I mean the- it also mirrors with like the power law of investing where it's- it's, in most people's situation, it's one company is returning ... You can invest in 100 companies, and one of those companies is probably gonna return three to five X in the returns of all the others, maybe combined in some cases. So, it's- it's wild.\n[00:41:45] Lenny: On the first point that you made earlier about cliches and platitudes, it reminds me, Michael Pollan has this point that he makes that like cliches and platitudes are cliches and platitudes because we've heard 'em so many times but that- because they're true. People just say 'em because they're so true. And as much as we don't wanna hear them, like there's a reason that we hear them again and again. Uh, I had a similar recognition when I was on a little psychedelic journey where I'm just like, \"Man, love is all you need. Love is all you need, man.”\n[00:42:15] Ryan: [laughs] Yeah.\n[00:42:16] Lenny: Okay, people have figured that out. But I was like, I feel that, I feel that right now. But it's true. That's why people- that's why f- [laughs] we're like, \"Okay, shut up. I heard that. That's in a song.\"\n[00:42:25] Ryan: [laughs] Yeah, it's- I was listening to- to a podcast, uh, about someone who was basically describing like psychedelics as a gateway into like meditation and- and everything and how it can be one of those things that makes people ... It- it- a lot of people who take psychedelics come across as another hippie cliché like person who like repeats the same things we've all heard many, many times, but there's a reason why there's a pattern there. And, you know, he describes like psychedelics as- as one way to feel that and learn that- that feeling that you can't achieve with- with meditation, you know, with experience.\n[00:42:56] Lenny: Yeah, I think Sam Harris talks about this where you could either meditate for five, 10 years to work your way up the mountain towards, you know, enlightenment, or you could just take some psychedelics, visit it for a little moment, see what it's like, and then [laughs]- and then-\n[00:43:09] Ryan: Mm-hmm.\n[00:43:09] Lenny: be motivated to, to work on getting there more naturally\n[00:43:12] Ryan: Yeah.\n[00:43:13] Lenny: This is a good time to play a little game that I invented just for you. Okay, so you're the founder of Product Hunt. Okay. And, on Product Hunt, people up vote ideas that they like best. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you two options and you tell me which you'd rather— which you'd up vote and it'll make sense once we get going. [laughs]\nThat sound good.\n[00:43:33] Ryan: Okay, cool. Let's do it.\n[00:43:35] Lenny: Okay. TikTok or Instagram Reels?\n[00:43:38] Ryan: And, and is context setting, are these within the context of products? I, I like and know, or\n[00:43:43] Lenny: Products you would choose to use that you like better... yeah. Not like which will do business— better business. Yeah. \n[00:43:50] Ryan: Okay. Okay. Got it. TikTok's for me. It's funny, reels, I kind of joke with, with Susie, my girlfriend, I joke that it's like, reels is like, TikTok, but like two weeks late.\nUh, it's not entirely true, but I feel like I see a lot of TikTok videos on Instagram reels. Like after, you know, weeks after they've been published.\n[00:44:08] Lenny: We'll see, I have some friends that work on reels and I'm excited to see where they go. Okay, next- LaCroix or Topo Chico.\n[00:44:15] Ryan: Ooh, this is a tough because I- I- I'm generally a La Croix kinda person, but Topo Chico, I like the bottle. So, when Topo Chico's available, I'll go Topo Chico. I'm sorry, La Croix.\n[00:44:26] Lenny: [laughs] I- I totally get that. My wife's a huge Topo Chico fan. We have many, many [laughs] bottles. They're beautiful. They've- kind of changed a bit. They're like super clear now, they used to have a little, a little tint.\n[00:44:36] Ryan: Hmm. \n[00:44:37] Lenny: Very important topics. Yeah. Okay. Next, next up, Bay Area or Los Angeles?\n[00:44:43] Ryan: Uh, Los Angeles. Although, it depends on the- the, so here's my goals, if- if I was, you know, a new college grad or someone young and- and new in kind of the tech industry, definitely San Francisco. You'll create a lot of serendipity. You'll- you'll meet a lot of people, but from a lifestyle perspective, LA. Um, LA, I just find more enjoyable, weather's better, there's hiking, housing is cheaper. So, LA today, San Francisco, 10 years ago.\n[00:45:09] Lenny: Very nuanced dancer. I knew you were gonna say LA, and so, next is East Side LA or West Side LA?\n[00:45:16] Ryan: I don't know. We- we lived in Hollywood up in the hills for a while. So, I don't know if that's East or West, but wherever that is, big fan.\n[00:45:24] Lenny: I guess that's West, right? It's not near the water. That's a really good question. Hollywood Hills, all right, that'll be a third [laughs] option. Okay, electric bike or regular bike.\n[00:45:34] Ryan: Nothing against electric bikes, but I feel like if- if your goal is to get exercise, then just get a regular bike, but I don't have either. I have a- a, um, recumbent bike at home that I use for exercise. The reason why it's recumbent and not like a Peloton where you sit up is 'cause I can do emails and work [laughs] because while I'm exercising.\n[00:45:53] Lenny: Wow. Very productive. Okay. Next, dark mode or light mode?\n[00:45:58] Ryan: Light mode, I've never used dark mode like ever. Actually I take that back. Tweet Deck is the only dark mode kind of app that I use. But- \n[00:46:06] Lenny: Wow. \n[00:46:07] Ryan: I don't know. If- if a founder is prioritizing dark mode before they have product market fit too, it's like a big red flag for me. That's a little bit of a hot take. Some people are gonna hate me for that, but I don't know. I don't think dark mode matters for like 99% of people.\n[00:46:22] Lenny: Wow. Big, big, hot take. What if they just go dark [laughs] and there's no light mode. Does that count against them?\n[00:46:28] Ryan: Uh, Yeah, that's fine. As long as it's just one mode, um, it's the teams that prioritize all these, like small things that don't matter before the product is actually like useful for people or, or that that's, that is where I like my product manager hat comes in and I'm like, is this like the highest on your priority list?\nI don't know. Now big asterisks, it's all contextual. Sometimes. Like the audience you're building for really cares about dark mode. Like if you're building for developers, maybe you need dark mode, or, or some version of it, but, but yeah, I'm, I'm light mode.\n[00:46:57] Lenny: Awesome. Okay. [laughs] Did not expect that, love it. Okay, two more. Wash the dish right away or let it soak in the sink?\n[00:47:04] Ryan: [laughs] Um, I'm looking at the sink over here. There might be dishes in there, so that'll be my answer. I got a bad habit.\n[00:47:11] Lenny: No, I think there's- there's power in letting it soak. I get it. I respect that.\n[00:47:15] Ryan: [laughs] That’s what I'll tell Susie next time. There's power. Lenny said there's power in soaked dishes.\n[00:47:20] Lenny: There's physics. It's soaking. Okay. Last one, Web3 or Web5?\n[00:47:25] Ryan: Mm, uh, I don't know what happened to Web4, so I don't know, maybe- maybe we'll split the difference, so I'm gonna go Web4.\n[00:47:31] Lenny: Okay. We did it. [laughs] That was the inaugural addition of which would you rather up vote? Amazing. You killed it.\n[00:47:38] Ryan: There you go go. I like this. All right. It's kind of a fun, this could, this could be a fun little segment, I think for a lot of things.\n[00:47:45] Lenny: Yeah. It'll plug Product Hunt. It'll be great. We'll see [laughs] where this goes. This replaced my lightning round, which I experiment with. Okay. But actually I have other questions I want to get through before we, before I let you go. If that's cool.\nThere's kinda two topics. One is around consumer startups and just a few things that I've been learning there and then angel investing and then- and then we wrap.\nSo around consumer. By the time this post comes out, I'll have released some portions of the series that I'm working on, on kickstarting and scaling consumer business. And there's a few things I've learned there that I just wanted to get your take on. One is that, and we talked a bit about this just like 99% of consumer apps seem to just like, not work, especially if they're venture scale, if they raise money, just like just a reminder of how hard consumer is like, when is the last consumer app that really took off.\nAnd so I just wanted to get your thoughts— is what's your take there? What should founders do that are starting a consumer company?\n[00:48:40] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, it's tough. I mean there's- there's obviously consumer is pretty broad, so there's like different levels of difficulty, I think. Um, the consumer social or gaming, like games, building games, is probably like the- the- the hardest and the one filled with the most failures. And I think a lot of that is because, I think a few things, I think one monetization is generally harder than like a B2B company. Historically, a lot of it's been like advertising driven, and to do that, you have to first get to massive scale for advertisers to really care. And then you have to, you know, double it and double it and double it [laughs] again. So, monetization is super tough, versus a B2B company, it's like people have a problem, they have a need, they are willing to give you money, you know, on day- day one.\nThe other thing about consumer that's tough is you're- you're always fighting different, essentially you're fighting for attention. And so, you might be some consumer social company, but you're- you're kind of like competing with Netflix too, which isn't in your direct domain, but like people could be watching Netflix, or they could be using your product or- or your social app, let's say. So, now you're competing with so many different things. Many of those are incumbents where the consumer also has like built-in habits, routines. Like this is a big- big part about consumers too is eventually you wanna be like an internal trigger in someone's mind where they- they just, without even thinking, they go and use your product or services for some reason. Usually, you don't start that way. You need like external triggers to like pull people in, but eventually you have to get to that point. So, how do you overcome those internal triggers they have for other services, other products? It's really, really hard. \nAnd- and then I think a lot of it is, um, like B2B companies, usually you- you have a clear like problem that you're solving. And you could talk to customers, you could understand what are their current behaviors, what- what solutions are they using now, what do they like about them, what do they not like about them whereas, consumer, there's a little bit of that, but it's- it's fuzzier. You know, if you take, um, like Twitter and you kind of even ask someone like, \"Why do you use Twitter and like w-\" people will have different answers that are all kind of like fuzzy. And they ultimately tend to come down to some sort of like innate human desire. Like it could be, uh, for Twitter, it could be about like, \"I wanna be informed with what's happening in the world,\" or it could be, \"I want to feel less lonely or connected to more people,\" or something like that whereas, if you go to, let's say DocuSign, I think is a great example, of a B2B company, it's like super simple. [laughs] \nIt's like a- a way to get legal docs signed online. That's- that's what it does. It's a thing that people have to do. It's very clear like what it solves. And so, B2B's just like easier to navigate that idea maze. And so, with consumer, you- your- your first blog post on this topic touches a lot on the idea side. And I- I, a lot of it resonated with me, especially the- the insight piece. Like what is- what is the insight that you, as a founder, have to build this thing? Because I think it's really hard to build a consumer company without some sort of unique insight, maybe impossible. And you can get that in many different ways. It could be through your own experiences. I used to write like a problem journal. Like just when things annoyed me or when things were like less efficient, I would write it down as like a note. And I didn't try to solve it. I didn't- didn't say, \"Oh, here's the solution.\" I was just like, \"This is annoying.\" \nLike, in San Francisco, one example is a lot of people don't have laundry like in their unit. So, I'm like, \"That's kind of annoying. Like that's a problem. Maybe there's a solution out there.\" So, things like that. And I know, there's- there's- there's a bunch of different ways, like, uh, y- your- your blog post does a better summary, I think, of like the different ways different companies like ideated and came up with their ideas, but yeah, many different ways to navigate it but needs an insight of some sort.\n[00:52:09] Lenny: Awesome. I hadn't heard that, u- u- uh, that pr- problem journal idea. I was gonna ask you if you have any suggestions for how to come up with a startup idea, and that's a really interesting one. Is there- yeah, so I guess it'd be cool to hear where that came from and what that led to? Or if there's anything else you found to be useful around that?\n[00:52:23] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, the problem journal is one. And again, like I think it's helpful, not to try to come up with the solution, but just write- just simply write down the problem you- you observed or experienced. Another one I think's interesting is just to like immerse yourself in different communities. Ideally, like maybe like seemingly niche or weird long tail communities. It doesn't have to be that necessarily, but that might be where you'll see more unique insights or- or gather more insights, and you could do that through, I don't know, I'm just thinking subreddits, meeting a lot of people who are like really excited some other thing. It could be like some weird robotics like niche, hobbyist community, for example. And a lot of that, I think, will- will hone or just like create serendipity for ideas. You might see patterns, or you might see, you know, if problem statements emerge from many people in that community that are facing similar things.\nAnd then there's like the other- other component too, which is really about like observing trends and- and changes, whether it's like a consumer behavior shift. Let's take an obvious one. Today is like distributed working. So, five- five years ago when the Weekend Fund started, that was one of our themes. It was like I- I- I think distributed working will be on the rise for a number of reasons. One, you know, i- it's harder and harder to recruit. Two, there's a subset of people who really valuable that flexibility and autonomy. And then fast forward, we had COVID, so like we had remote working, and- and now, that's a huge consumer behavior shift. Not just in how people work but also, like going to your Airbnb like world, like Airbnb has shifted their entire product to support more of this remote working kind of lifestyle, just the way that the- the homepage is now more of a catalog of places that you could explore at different times of the year versus Airbnb before was more like, \"I have a very specific vacation trip that I wanna take during these days in these areas.\"\nIt's like a very different like browsing kind of experience. So, that's just one example. Consumer behavior shifts is one thing to observe. The other is technology shifts. So, what- what new thing can you build today that couldn't be built yesterday? And so, there's- there's a bunch of categories around there, like Web3, AI, you know. The biggest shift that we've seen is- is mobile in like early 2010s, um, 'ish, that unlocked a whole- whole bunch of things. So, so, yeah, I think it's observing those shifts and those changes. Last thing I'll say on that is like I think startups, since there are more and more people building companies and technology, there's essentially more efficiency. It's certainly not a- an efficient, super efficient market, but there is more efficiency in problem discovery and- and- and solution exploration. And so, for that reason, you need even more reasons for things to- sort of answers to the, \"Why now?\"\nLike what's changed? What insight do you have? Why doesn't this exist already? 'Cause a bunch of people are trying to build something in the space most likely. Just a lot of what we think about, especially on the investing side, when we talk to founders.\n[00:55:14] Lenny: Wow. There's s- way too much good advice there. Have you written this down anywhere? Is there a Tweet thread people can find like your kind of approach to coming up with an idea?\n[00:55:22] Ryan: I have not, I don't think so. \n[00:55:24] Lenny: Cool. All right. Now we have to-\n[00:55:26] Ryan: Blog post for the future.\n[00:55:27] Lenny: Yeah. Or this is the, uh, this is the- the- the content for people to save and use. Thanks for sharing all that. That was really helpful. One other question I wanted to ask you along these lines is around the target audience and, uh, something ... A- an insight that we both share is that it's really important to get really narrow, whatever you focus on initially, as a start up, and it's, for founders, it's often so counterintuitive, they're like, you know, it's like, \"Oh my god, why should I focus on the 1000 people? Or 10000 type people-\n... Versus the millions that might wanna use this thing?\" What's your sense, and where have you kind of seen that become important? Just the idea of getting very narrow of how you're going after.\n[00:56:05] Ryan: Yeah, it's, effectively, the more narrow you're- you're generally, and this is where I throw in the big asterisks, like not for everything, there's always contextual differences, but generally, the easier it is to build a great solution for those people, because now you can actually hone in the product experience, the messaging, and everything to serve exactly those people. And it can help with the product side, it can help with the marketing and go-to market where you- you're messaging ... When people land on your homepage, you don't need to create kind of a broader kind of like value prop to everybody, but really, you can focus on like what is the- the problem this particular audience or community is- is facing. And so, generally, it's just easier.\nNow there is always that challenge of like, \"Well, is this too small? Is it too- too much of a niche if- if my goal is to build like a massive company?\" My bias is not to worry too much about that because what you probably find is, over time, opportunities to expand beyond that. You'll see parallels, maybe to other communities or to other problems. And a lot of companies, you know, eventually expand well beyond that. Like I'll go back to Airbnb, you know the story way better than I do, but you know, initially, it was just like, you know, basically couches and extra rooms in houses. And like a lot of people, most people in the US would not do that. Like my parents, not- not in a million years. Even me, like I don't wanna like stay in some stranger's like room. I want my own space, my own house. So, that- that probably at the time seemed really niche and like small, but obviously, they extended- extended well beyond that.\nNow- now I view Airbnb as like housing in generally speaking. Like their- their TM is housing in- in my mind, which they haven't yet exp- expanded into like real estate sales or like longterm rentals, per se, but like that- that's a possibility.\n[00:57:51] Lenny: This is a good segue to the last topic I wanted to touch on, investing, which I believe you do full-time. Would you say that it's- your full-time gig now?\n[00:57:59] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, it is. Yeah, I'm spending all my time there, and yeah.\n[00:58:02] Lenny: Cool. So, from what I can tell, the Weekend Fund is killin' it. I'm not an LP, but it feels like it's kind of this underrated juggernaut that's just doing very well. And so, I wanted to ask you a couple questions along these lines. One is what have you learned about investing, angel investing? Especially what's most surprised you?\n[00:58:20] Ryan: I mean I feel like there's a lot ... A lot we've learned. So, there's- there's things on the operational side. Like running a fund, there's a bunch of things that go into it, from LP communications, LP fundraising. There's also like ... Vedika who works with me on the fund side, she, um, she describes it as like hygiene. There's also good hygiene when it comes to running a fund. For example, you know, when you meet a founder, you- you- you should get back to them. [laughs] Like if it's a pass, you should let them know. And then there's a lot of different ways that you can do that. Some people, you know, might just say like \"pass,\" and that's not very encouraging to a founder if they gave you no context, no details. There's also an element of hygiene, which is you always follow up with the person that introduced us to that company. And we just feel it's kinda like that's what we appreciate.\n\nLike we like to kinda know what happened, like s- have them close the loop. And so, there's like good hygiene, operational things that we've learned and kinda honed over- over the years. I mean the biggest surprise, the biggest surprise has probably been ... I gotta be careful of how this is interpreted in some ways, but it's ... There are cases when I didn't think the company would make it. I- uh, either the product wasn't working, and you know, many months had passed, and it was very clear that they're- they- well, to me, I thought it was clear that, okay, that this probably isn't gonna work out. In my head I kinda wrote it off. And then that company either pivoted or- or some m- like massive partnership or MMA event came through out of nowhere, and so I- I guess the learning is like never count a portfolio company out until it's over.\nAnd, you know, uh, that relies on, of course, backing founders that are very resilient and creative and- and, you know, driven to- to create momentum, you know, out of nothing, but- but that's been surprising to me. And it makes me kind of excited because, you know, we invested in over 110 companies now and it's- it's fun to be able to kinda see behind-the-scenes a little bit how all these things kind of play out, both the good and the bad.\n[01:00:13] Lenny: That's such an inspiring takeaway. Does that change how you invest? Like to me, that's like, \"All right, I guess I should just take more bets on founders that are awesome.\" Although, I find just founder bets, it's like a very expensive hobby/approach because there's so there's so many great founders. How is that informed how you invest seeing that happen?\n[01:00:33] Ryan: I would say we don't, we don't have like, um, it's again, my cop out it's contextual kind of answer. Like, you know, some people are like, \"We are a team first only.\" Some are, \"We're market first.\" Some are, \"We're product first.\" And we- we look at everything kind of holistically, and I think the evaluation of the product is- is sort of a reflection on the team. So, our- our assessment of the thinking behind the product that they built today and maybe some of the traction is a reflection on like the team's abilities and like the thought processes.\nSo, we try to look at it holistically in, um, I mean, yeah, I mean every investor would say like, \"Yeah, we wanna back, you know, resilient founders that are very driven, insightful, and all those things,\" of course. But it's also sometimes hard to like fully evaluate that, unless you really know that person. So, so, we try to- to- to take as much data around like how the product is working and how they made those decisions leading up to this to- to evaluate the team sort of indirectly.\n[01:01:26] Lenny: That's kinda what I've started to do is I- I try not to invest as a founder bet unless I just know them because it's just so hard otherwise.\n[01:01:35] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, there- there's a few founder bets that- that we've made. One, going back to the consumer social kind of thing, he's somebody I've known for many, many years. One of the most talented like designers, engineers, product builders. And I've just been waiting for him to start a company and- and so, that was- that was one of those, \"I'm gonna bet on you because I believe in you. I'm not sure about this first idea, uh, you know, who am I to judge? But I don't know if that's gonna be it,\" but [laughs] he's probably gonna launch 10 apps, and the 11th is gonna be a massive success. And so, that's sort of the- the way I think about those consumer social founder first bets.\n[01:02:10] Lenny: I love that. Last question along these lines, for someone that's hoping to get into investing or angel investing in the near future, do you have any advice for folks around that?\n[01:02:20] Ryan: Yeah, actually, I wrote a tweet storm and like converted it to a blog post on this 'cause we've get- gotten a lot of ... You probably as well, get a lot of emails or people saying, \"Hey, I'm thinking about raising a fund. Like how should I do that?\" or \"I wanna get into- to venture. I wanna start investing. Like what advice do you have?\" So, yeah, I wrote a blog post on this, and there's many different ways to invest. There's, you know, angel investing is one. So, great thing about that is if you have the capital to angel invest, you can do it today, tomorrow. Like you- there- there's no- no sign-offs required. You have maximum flexibility, but of course, you need to have disposable income. You need to be able to- [laughs] be willing to lose all of it and then hopefully you, you know, you'll ma- you'll be on the other side of that and make some money in 10 years. \n It takes a long time. There's scouting; that's another option. And there are more and more scout funds probably than ever before right now, in different flavors. Some of them are like dedicated kind of scout programs where you have capital to deploy on your own, some are more like you still need approval, but you send the deals, and you get carry on those deals in many cases. Those have pros and cons too. Like they're easier to start and get into than raising a fund typically for most people, but you also are sort of reliant on that- that program or that fund. Um, you might have less autonomy in what you can invest in and what you can't. And then there's a few others; there's SPVs is- is one angle, which works really well for a lot of people. So, um, for those that maybe don't know and- and listening to this right now, SPVs are essentially like a single vehicle, um, investment into one company.\nSo, you raise money from LPs, from other investors, to invest in this specific company. And there are a few great things about that. Like one, you get deal-by-deal carry, meaning like the- the outcome of that company is- is you get paid when they exit essentially, assuming there's a positive outcome versus a fund, like you have to return the entire fund first. Two, it allows you to also bring in maybe very strategic, helpful people into that particular round for that company, which can actually be a- a strong value add for that founder. The biggest trade-off is it's a lot of work sometimes. You- you have to basically do a fundraiser [laughs] every couple you invest in, and that's super time-consuming for a lot of people. And then the last thing is like r- rai- raising a fund.\nSo, that's the decision that I decided back in 2017 is I wanted to raise a fund. It's a lot more work to raise the capital and- and- and there's a lot more responsibility in managing funds and so on and so forth, but it provided me with the most flexibility and- and a way to deploy many checks into many companies, especially when I didn't and still don't have like a ton of money to angel invest. So, yeah, those are like different options. Like I think my blog post goes into more like pros and cons for each of those things, but the last thing I'll say actually is, let's say, none of those are really an option. You- you- you don't wanna start a fund. You don't have enough relationships to do SPVs. You- for whatever reason, you can't do a scout. You don't have any money to angel invest. One thing you can also do is just like pretend angel invest. [laughs] And that doesn't mean that you're meeting the founder and like writing a check, but you can write memos, or you can like almost create a fantasy portfolio.\nAnd this is what Vedika, before she joined- joined me, was doing to some extent. She was writing memos about companies she was excited about. And in some ways, she was like doing the job before getting the job, and anyone can do that today. And that can be helpful too if you're applying or trying to prove your- your- your abilities. You could say, \"Hey, here are the memos. Here are the companies that I would have invested in, you know, if I had the opportunity, and, you know, here's my thought process behind that.\"\n[01:05:49] Lenny: I love that. I'm curious about the logistics of knowing the prices of all these startups, but anyway, we don't have to get into all of [laughs] that. That's an awesome idea. I've seen people on Twitter do that too. What's- where do you think this all goes for you? Are you thinking of increasing the fund? That's basically the last question. Just, yeah, what's- what’s- the future of Ryan- Ryan Hoover at this point, as far as [laughs] you know?\n\n[01:06:08] Ryan: Yeah, still- still figuring out the meaning of life, as we established earlier.\n[01:06:12] Lenny: I thought we cracked that one. \n[01:06:13] Ryan: Yeah, yeah. I'll let you know when I figure it out.\n[01:06:15] Lenny: Okay.\n[01:06:16] Ryan: Um, uh, [laughs], um, yeah, we're on our third fund right now. We're actually about 30, 35% deployed, so we have plenty of- of capital, and we're not gonna be raising any time soon. Yeah, we're just investing in early stage companies right now, but yeah, when I fast forward like longer term, I don't know. I will always be investing. I'm also more of a fan of maintaining a smaller fund. Our latest fund is 21 million, and that might ... I might change my mind on this, but that might be the biggest fund we ever raise. I might keep it around that same size for the next one because it really allows us to be f- really collaborative. We can write smaller checks. We can fit into competitive deals. I think it's a better product for founders. Like we're not tryin' to take the entire round. We can, you know, try to bring on the Lennys of the world as co-investors, things like that. \nAnd so, investing will always be a part of my future, but I also love building. Building is- is the most fun, so creating something is- whether it's a company ... I don't know- I don't know what it is. I'm not even gonna call it a company, but building something is hopefully in my future. I just gotta figure out the right idea. And maybe, maybe reflect on your blog post too on the idea generation stuff that you shared 'cause that- that is helpful.\n[01:07:22] Lenny: As long as you let me invest all is good. \n[01:07:27] Ryan: [laughs] I don't know- I don't know if I'll- part of me is like, \"Do I ever wanna raise from venture?\" Now it depends on the idea. If- if I need it, if it's required strategically, then yes, but to be quite honest, maybe I shouldn't say this, like I'm kind of really interested in just owning something 100% and you can always raise venture later. Like it- it's a one-way door, so I kinda wanna delay that door, you know, for whatever I build next, if I can.\n[01:07:53] Lenny: I 100% get that. That's how life is with this newsletter operation and I highly recommend it.\n[01:07:59] Ryan: Yeah. \n[01:07:59] Lenny: If you can pull it off. Okay. Um, that's it. Just a couple- just where can people find you online? It's kind of a dumb question 'cause you're very easy to find, but where do people go to learn more if they wanna reach out? And then- and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n[01:08:14] Ryan: Yeah, I'm just, uh, easy to find. R- Rhoover on Twitter, Ryanhoover.me, simple website. I have a bunch of old blog posts on there, probably with a bunch of broken links and broken images, but it's there. The content's there. I don't know. We're- we're investing- we're investing in the early stage companies, B2B, B2C. If you're building something weird, I don't know, DM me, email me, I'm around.\n[01:08:35] Lenny: Amazing. Ryan, thank you so much for being here. It's kind of a surreal experience interviewing you. And I'm really honored that you came, and I can't wait for people to hear this. I'm really happy about all the nuggets that [laughs] I was able to extract out of your head, and thank you for sharing them. Thanks for being here.\n[01:08:52] Ryan: Yeah, thanks, Lenny. Yeah, these- these conversations are- are helpful and like reflecting on what do I actually believe anyway. So, it's- it's just like writing, it's helpful.\n[01:09:00] Lenny: Yeah, and it is just as helpful to everybody else. So thank you again.\n[01:09:04] Ryan: Cool.

  "transcript": "# The role of AI in new product development | Ryan J. Salva (VP of Product at GitHub)\n\n## Transcript\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:00:00):\nWe had actually created a snapshot of GitHub's public code for what we call the Arctic Code Vault, right? Essentially, this is up in like way in the Northlands of Finland, there's a seed vault. We were like, you know what? Seed vaults are really there to preserve the diversity of the world's flora in seeds in case of some crazy either natural or manmade disaster. But another really important asset to the world is our code, our open source. This represents actually a lot of the collective, well, certainly software, if not intelligence of kind of the modern world, right?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:00:44):\nWe had put this snapshot of public repositories on this silver film that would be preserved for thousands of years in this Arctic Code Vault. Well, we took that same data snapshot and we brought it to our friends over at OpenAI to see like, okay, what can we do with these large language models built on public code? Well, it turns out we can do some pretty cool things.\n\nLenny (00:01:13):\nRyan Salva is VP of product at GitHub, where, amongst other projects, he incubated and launched GitHub Copilot, which in my opinion is one of the most magical products that you'll come across. If you haven't heard of it, it uses OpenAI's machine learning engine to autocomplete code for engineers in real time as they're coding. I think it's one of the biggest advances in product development and productivity that we've seen in a while. I'm always really curious how a big product like this starts, gets buy in, build momentum, and then launches, especially at a big company like Microsoft and especially a product like Copilot that has surprising ethics challenges, scaling challenges, business model questions.\n\nLenny (00:01:55):\nAlso, this came out of a small R&D team that GitHub has, and it's so interesting to hear what Ryan has learned about incubating big bets within a large company, and then taking them from prototype to Microsoft scale. Ryan is also just super interesting as a human. He's got a very non-traditional background. I am excited for you to hear this conversation. With that, I bring you Ryan Salva. If you're setting up your analytics stack, but you're not using Amplitude, what are you doing? Amplitude is the number one most popular analytics solution in the world used by both big companies like Shopify, Instacart, and Atlassian, and also most tech startups.\n\nLenny (00:02:38):\nAmplitude has everything you need, including a powerful and fully self-service analytics product, an experimentation platform, and even an integrated customer data platform to help you understand your users like never before.

I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listen to, like Tim Ferriss and Lex Fridman.\n\nLenny (00:03:20):\nI finally gave it a shot earlier this year, and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One, with a small scoop that dissolves in water, you are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as little safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies, and internal testing that they do.\n\nLenny (00:03:59):\nAnd three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day. And that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. Make it easy. Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs for your first purchase. All you have to do is visit AthleticGreens.com/lenny. Again, that's AthleticGreens.com/lenny to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance. Ryan, welcome to the podcast.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:04:42):\nThank you, my friend. I am genuinely very excited to be here. Lovely to geek out with you for a little while.\n\nLenny (00:04:48):\nI'm excited as well. We were chatting briefly before we started recording and you mentioned a little bit about your background, which is really unique for someone that is leading product at GitHub. Could you just share what you studied in school, and then briefly just how that led to your career in product management?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:05:07):\nOh wow! You're going to make me remember all the way back to school. Okay. Back in school, I was not a classic software engineering, CS major. The kind of esoteric answer is philosophy of aesthetics and 20th century critical theory. The easier access answer is philosophy and English. But primarily it was really about how do we, as people, communicate with each other, how do we express ourselves through creativity. As humans since the dawn of time have been painting on cave walls and dancing around the fire and writing stories and novels and singing to each other. I was just really interested in how we convey our experience of the world to others.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:05:58):\nI got started in software development and product management because I wanted to be in the business of creativity. We're at a really, really unique time in human history where we actually get to witness the advent of a brand new medium. Software development and the worlds that it creates wasn't possible, I don't know, maybe 50, 60 years ago now. If I'd been born in the 1700s, I probably would've been the guy making, I don't know, new colors of paint and paint brushes, but I wasn't. I was born kind of at the turn of the 21st century, and so I work in engineering.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:06:39):\nThat's what I've been doing for the last about a little bit more than 20 years now, working sometimes in startups, some of them other people, some of them my own, about 10 years at Microsoft and now three years at GitHub.\n\nLenny (00:06:51):\nAmazing. I didn't know that was a job to make new paint colors for paint brushes. Is there a color you would come up with?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:06:59):\nOh man! It so happens that yellow... I think I would do a really vibrant gold sunshine yellow if I was in that business.\n\nLenny (00:07:13):\nVery positive, happy. I love it. That could be a new GitHub brand color. Today, you're VP of product at GitHub. Before that, you were a super senior product leader at Microsoft, and I'm always curious how that transition happens when you move from just a longtime senior product leader at a larger company to taking on something like this that was an acquisition. I'm curious what made you decide to take this leap, and then just was there anything interesting about the machination that went into just making that transition and figuring that out?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:07:45):\nYeah, it's a good question. Like I said, I was working on development tools and developer services when I was there at Microsoft. Specifically, I was leading product for what they call One Engineering System. It's essentially the shared developer infrastructure for all Microsoft products like Windows and Office and Azure and things like that, as well as Microsoft's DevOps solution called Azure DevOps. When the acquisition happened, it was clear that so much of the energy, so much of the focus and the innovation that was going to be happening around developer tools and services was going to be happening around GitHub. I mean, that's where the community is creating.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:08:34):\nThat's where people are learning, that's where so much of the mind share of just the development community is focused. Like I said, I'm motivated. What I care about is helping people create. It was very clear to me that there was no place that I could have a larger impact than working at GitHub. I really took that opportunity to make the transition out of a little bit more enterprise focused internal role at Microsoft to going where I could work on everything from, I don't know, AI technology like Copilot to a cloud hosted development environments like Codespaces, repos, which literally every single developer on the planet is participating in some way GitHub repos in a typical year.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:09:28):\nThat was what I wanted to accomplish, is just like, how do I get more connected to the community, especially the community outside of what Microsoft could reach on its own. The decision to move as well, I think, was really focused not just on what GitHub was and maybe is at the time, but what GitHub also can be. I mean, GitHub has more than a decade, nearly a decade and a half of history of bringing developers together to collaborate on code through repositories. But in the last few years, we've really expanded that portfolio to include so many different parts of the developer life cycle.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:10:13):\nAgain, I talked there about Codespaces and Copilot, but it's also actions for CI/CD and advanced security. As developers, we are so much more than just where we put our code. There's a whole part of the tool chain there. And to get to an opportunity to work on so many V1 products, like that is creation itself, to be able to build an entirely new product, get it out to market, test it, iterate on it, and really feed on the energy that's coming back from the community.\n\nLenny (00:10:46):\nAwesome. There's definitely a lot of energy coming out of GitHub. What I want to spend most of our time chatting about is a product that your team helped launch and incubate, which is GitHub Copilot, which just from my outsider perspective feels like one of the biggest advances in software development in, I don't know, a decade, maybe more. It's definitely one of the most magical products out there and your team and you kind of led the incubation and launch of the Copilot.\n\nLenny (00:11:15):\nI'd love to spend most of our time chatting through that. The first question... Okay, cool. My first question just for folks that don't know a lot about Copilot is just like, what is it? Can you just kind of briefly describe what Copilot is?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:11:26):\nYeah, sure. Developers for the last 20 years or more have had essentially simple, intelligent autocomplete. You hit the period and you get the next variable that might come up. It's helpful for moving a little bit faster through your code, helpful sometimes for remembering what the particular syntax might look like for a method or a function. Copilot is essentially that magnified by many lines of code. It is multi-line autocomplete that is fundamentally powered by an AI model called CodeX, which is a derivative of another one that you might be familiar with, GPT-3.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:12:15):\nWhen you are in the editor, it could be VS Code, it could be IntelliJ, it could be them, essentially, as you are typing, Copilot will provide suggestions usually in kind of this italicized gray text that is really, to your point, kind of magical what it's able to infer. Based upon the variables around it, the class names, the method names around it, your comments, Copilot infers what you intend to create, and then hopefully does a pretty good job at nailing it by providing scaffolding code template that you can then riff on. Now, what we tend to find is that developers love it. They really enjoy it. They kind of find themselves getting a little addicted to it because it helps them stay in the flow.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:13:08):\nAs developers, we love to be in that place. I love to be in that place where I'm creating things, where I'm focusing on some product, some piece of software that I'm going to give to my customers, my users. The labor of remembering what's the order of parameters that need to come into a particular API, or hey, what's the particular syntax of this thing I'm supposed to do, or oh, I've got to create a bunch of dummy data that is days of the week or months in the year. That's just labor. It's not creating. It's just typing.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:13:47):\nCopilot helps developers stay in the flow by bringing all of that information into the editor, preventing them from having to go check out documentation or watch tutorial or go to Stack Overflow and either find an answer or worse, have to ask a question and wait for an answer. It just brings all of that into the editor and gives the developer often multiple suggestions that they can choose from and just pick and choose what is the right solution to solve the problem for the thing they're trying to create.\n\nLenny (00:14:21):\nAwesome. What I'm most curious about, and we're going to spend time on this, is just how a product like this comes to be at a larger company. But before we get into that, what's the craziest story of someone using Copilot to write code? And I'll share one real quick. I was watching some YouTube videos to prepare for this chat and one guy, maybe this is the Turing Test of AI writing code, is he used Copilot to center divs. He's like, \"Wow! This did it right.\" And then another guy, he's an instructor of code.\n\nLenny (00:14:51):\nHe makes YouTube videos teaching people how to code and he's like, \"Copilot just gives you the answer immediately, and so I can't make these videos as easily. I have to turn it off so that doesn't just give it away.\" I'm curious, what have you seen?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:15:03):\nThere are so many of those. I'll just kind of give a couple of recent ones that I've heard. I was talking to one developer who was... He's actually an educator and he's teaching kids how to code, usually like kind of high school age, so 16, 15, that kind of thing. His experience matches my own, which is that many of us, we learn to code best not by arbitrary exercises, but by actually building something that's going to be useful solving problems.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:15:41):\nWhat he does is he matches small businesses and medium size businesses who need to build internal tools with essentially classes of students, like a group of maybe six or eight students, and then gives those students Copilot and says, \"Here, small business, medium size business. Group of students, go build this internal tool for this business.\"\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:16:08):\nCopilot is essentially kind of whispering in the student's ear, metaphorically speaking, \"Hey, here's how you solve this problem. Here's how you do this,\" and students build not only the tool, the software that the business needs and then get to put that on their resume and their application for college and university, but they also get to learn by using the tools that likely are going to be part of the core DNA of the developer tool chain two, three, four years from now, as AI starts to permeate our entire stack. That was a pretty cool recent one that I talked to.\n\nLenny (00:16:48):\nThat is very cool. I didn't think about just the education lever here of just making it so much easier to learn to code, not even just building code.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:16:56):\nAnd that's the thing, Copilot is particularly good not just at taking away some of the effort, but often... There's learning a new language, and then there's also just waiting into a code base that you're not necessarily familiar with, right? I mean, heck, sometimes I don't recognize some of the code that I wrote six months ago or a year ago. It feels like I'm wading into new territory. But maybe you need to fix a bug in an app that you don't often touch, wading into that code base is kind of learning and creating a mental map for that code base.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:17:30):\nOne of the really magical pieces of Copilot here is that, that AI is collecting context of the application that you're going into. It can help you build that mental map and learn the code base, even if it's a language that you're already familiar with.\n\nLenny (00:17:47):\nAwesome. Going back to the beginning of Copilot and how it started, I'm always curious how a project that ends up being a huge deal to a larger company begins and especially how it builds momentum, how it gets buy in, and then just gets out the door. Can you talk about just the original seed of this idea like, who did it come from, who had the original vision, how did this idea emerge and build momentum where you put resources into it?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:18:13):\nOh wow, what a long, and I don't know, depending upon your point of view, sorted or exciting story that is. Microsoft and OpenAI have been collaborating for quite a while now on large language models, making its way into all different experiments and different parts of both Microsoft's software portfolio, as well as just helping OpenAI by providing the compute necessary. It takes massive amounts of compute to train these models. They were mostly large language models. Couple years ago now, it kind of dawned on us that, well, language models aren't just English and Spanish and German and Korean and Japanese, but Python and JavaScript and Java and C# and Closure.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:19:07):\nAll of these are languages too. In fact, they're kind of nice from an AI perspective because they're relatively constrained in terms of their semantics, right? The number of words, I put that the in scare quotes as it were, that can be expressed in Python, for example, is much smaller than the English language, which has all sorts of different grammar rules and nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs. We started to see what it would be like to actually bring code to these large language models. The way that I actually got introduced to it is kind of funny. Microsoft and OpenAI had this idea.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:19:53):\nAt the time, one of the teams that I was responsible for was GitHub's infrastructure team, the team responsible for our data centers, our reliability, our rep time. We noticed one day that we were getting hammered, I mean absolutely hammered with a tremendous amount of clone requests. We're like, \"Oh my gosh! Is this like a denial of service attack? How are we going to respond to this? What's going to happen?\" We figured out pretty quickly that it was actually OpenAI. They were cloning all of our repositories to harvest the data out of GItHub.I mean, it's totally legit practice, but it does have a real consequence.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:20:33):\nWe were able to step in and mitigate it very quickly. There was not a reliability kind of an uptime incident there, but we're like, \"Hey, you all, cool. Love this thing. Let's see if we can get that data to you in a more responsible way, in a way that's packaged a little bit more to meet your needs.\" What we did is just the year before that, We had actually created a snapshot of GitHub's public code for what we call the Arctic Code Vault, right? Essentially, this is up in like way in the Northlands of Finland, there's a seed vault. We were like, you know what? Seed vaults are really there to preserve the diversity of the world's flora in seeds in case of some crazy either natural or manmade disaster.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:21:25):\nBut another really important asset to the world is our code, our open source. This represents actually a lot of the collective, well, certainly software, if not intelligence of kind of the modern world, right? This represents actually a lot of the collective, well, certainly software, if not intelligence of kind of the modern world. We had put this snapshot of public repositories on this silver film that would be preserved for thousands of years in this Arctic Code Vault. Well, we took that same data snapshot and we brought it to our friends over at OpenAI to see like, okay, what can we do with these large language models built on public code?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:22:03):\nWell, it turns out we can do some pretty cool things. Just like a translation tool that goes from English to Spanish, Spanish to German, you can also go from English to Python or Python to C#. We're like, okay, this is cool. We can start to get not only translation, but a little bit of predicted text here as well. We're all I think fairly already familiar with predictive text already in our code editors as IntelliSense. But in, I don't know, you go to your favorite word processor and chances are that you've got some kind of predictive text happening there as well.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:22:43):\nWe started experimenting with different user experiences, right? Do we want it so that you, I don't know, right click and get a little side panel that comes up with a bunch of different options for things that you might want here. That was nice because it would give you hold functions, but it's out of the cursor, right? You had to really... Even if you weren't switching over to a different window, you still had to switch over to a different panel, which itself was a little bit distracting. We eventually came to this idea of inline autocomplete.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:23:20):\nWe were able to with the kind of partnership of some of our friends over on the Microsoft side of things, partner with our friends in Visual Studio Code, they're like, hey, there's not really an extensibility yet in your editor for this multi-line autocomplete, but we've got an idea for how this might work. Played around with the actual presentation of it. What should the key strokes be? What should the presentation layer be? The gray italicized tech seemed to be a good way of indicating that it was ephemeral, as it were. Pretty early on, we landed on this user experience that is Copilot as most developers experience it today. I want to say that was at least 16 months ago, 14, 16 months ago. Since then, we brought it to developers.\n\nLenny (00:24:15):\nJust to double click on that, you're saying just less than a year and a half ago, this kind of really started as a project and now it's out to the world. Is that right?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:24:26):\nThat is exactly right. That's exactly right. It's about a year and a half ago.\n\nLenny (00:24:30):\nThat's insane. What was that period between OpenAI almost taking down GitHub to I guess that point?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:24:38):\nThe period in between kind of OpenAI almost taking down GitHub and then us really arriving at the user experience, part of that was, frankly, a lot of really smart researchers at OpenAI experimenting and doing what only world class AI researchers can do. It was a lot of them experimenting, occasionally asking for updates to the data set, tossing back to us a model that we might play with and tinker around with. These models have literally thousands of parameters that you can pass to them. When you're really thinking about GPT-3 and CodeX and then the transition from that to something like Copilot, it was not just like the model...\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:25:27):\nCreating the model is one thing, but then figuring out how to use the model in terms of what parameters do you want to adjust for, what do you want to optimize for in terms of... A great example of this is performance, right? When you're in a code editor, you don't necessarily want to type, type, type and then have to wait one second, two seconds, three seconds to get a suggestion back when your entire goal is to stay in the flow. We would run experiments to see how many milliseconds are the right amount such that a developer doesn't feel like they're being interrupted by Copilot and a suggestion.\n\nLenny (00:26:06):\nWhat's the answer to that?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:26:09):\nIt seems like right now it's around 200 milliseconds. Depending upon where you're in the world, your latency can go up or down a little bit from there. But it seems like the sweet spot is somewhere around 200 milliseconds.\n\nLenny (00:26:20):\nGood to know.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:26:22):\nWe also experimented quite a bit. It's not just about the model, but it's also about what you feed the model. How do you prompt the model to return back a useful response? This kind of began a journey of experimentation for what we call prompt crafting.\n\nLenny (00:26:40):\nGoing back to the way this started, it sounds like basically it was kind of this fortunate accident where OpenAI just did something that you didn't expect. And then somebody within this PhD group that you described is like, \"Oh wow. Maybe we could do something really good with this.\" Is that kind of how it began?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:26:57):\nThat's fairly accurate. Yeah. I mean, we had a model that really was amazingly good, like a step level change in actual intelligence, right? And then marrying that up against a really good use case that actually changes developers' fundamental experience of the creation process, the creative process.\n\nLenny (00:27:25):\nWas there kind of a point at which it was clear to you or leadership in general like, we should double down on this thing and go big? Or this smaller team was working on this idea and then you're like, \"Oh wow, this is going to work?\" Or is it always like, \"We will bet on this thing, this is such a big and great idea. We're going to invest resources for sure from the beginning?\"\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:27:48):\nThe original team that was working on Copilot at GitHub was the team that we call GitHub Next. Essentially their job is to work on second and third horizon projects. What some folks might call moonshots, right? Things that we never really expect work in the next one or two years, but might three, five years down the line actually turn into something meaningful.\n\nLenny (00:28:17):\nIs there a concrete definition of horizon two and three? Is it like number of years out like Amazon style?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:28:23):\nNot necessarily a concrete definition. For me, I usually ballpark it as first horizon is the next year, second horizon, the next three years, third horizon, the next five years. But we generally think of it more as a measure of ambiguity and confidence level more than calendar dates.\n\nLenny (00:28:47):\nThis episode is brought to you by Modern Treasury. Modern Treasury is a next generation operating system for moving and tracking money. They're modernizing the developer tools and financial processes for companies managing complex payment flows. Think digital wallets via crypto on-ramps, right sharing marketplaces, instant lending, and more. They work with high growth companies like Gusto, Pipe, ClassPass, and Marqeta. Modern Treasury's robust APIs allow engineering to build payment flows right into your product, while finance can monitor and approve everything through a sleek and modern web dashboard.\n\nLenny (00:29:22):\nEnabling realtime payments, automatic reconciliation, continuous accounting and compliance solutions, Modern Treasury's platform is used to reconcile over $3 billion per month. They're one of the hottest young FinTech startups on the market today, having raised funding from top firms like Benchmark, Altimeter, SVB Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and Y Combinator. Check them out at ModernTreasury.com. I'd love to spend a little bit more time on this. It's so interesting. Is this a Microsoft thing, just having these three horizons in a certain percentage of resources or bet on different horizons?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:29:58):\nI would say it is not necessarily Microsoft thing, but is definitely at GitHub, how we have really contextualized it. Not to say that there aren't teams at Microsoft who might also use that methodology, but where we've been really maybe explicit or intentional about it is at GitHub where we've actually ring-fenced a team to think about that horizon two and horizon three work and kept them separate from EPD. EPD here being engineering, product, and design, the folks who are working on building productized operational products that we bring to market and we either give away or monetize in some way.\n\nLenny (00:30:39):\nThis is so interesting. There's a lot of companies that have these sorts of R&D groups, new product experience team at Facebook and Google has one. I'm not sure how many successes have come out of these teams. From what I've seen, and I'm curious, what have you... And clearly you had a huge success as far as I can tell so far. Is there anything you've learned about how to do this, where you invest in these big moonshots within a larger company?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:31:05):\nI mean, I think the first step is to invest in it. The first step is really hire really smart people, attract smart people, and give them the opportunity to be creative. Don't expect anything out of them that is going to turn into a money maker or something that is going to be beholden to fundamentals around security, privacy, uptime, accessibility, all that groovy kind of stuff upfront. They need space to create and experiment.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:31:37):\nAnd also, when you do get to a place where that team has an idea that is clearly connected to a representative set of customers who have a genuine problem and there is signal with at least medium confidence that this solution, whatever it is, solves it in a novel way, that's the time to start thinking about, okay, let's actually put a little bit of... I'm going to call this market testing. It's nothing so formal as market testing. It's really just like, let's start to actually bring prototypes of this in front of more and more customers to kind of test it out and see, hey, is this actually solving a problem for you? Is this something that you would use? This is where the transition between Next and EPD at GitHub really started.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:32:35):\nThis is actually where my role in the product cycle kind of really started to increase. I had kind of been in tight connection and been monitoring the work and kind of consulting a little bit with the Next team prior to that. But it was that moment when we identified that, okay, this is actually something real. Customers are saying, developers are saying, \"This is magical. This does something extraordinary that I could not do on my own,\" that we started to think about, okay, how do we transition this over? From there, we're really just like, okay, we think we've got a hit here. We think we've got something that we can actually bring to developers.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:33:21):\nWe made an intentional decision to take some of the researchers who were in the Next team and for a finite period of time, move them over to create a new EPD squad. We want them to be researchers, but we need to do knowledge transfer and we needed to actually provide the seed for a team that could eventually operationalize and productize. And that kind of began the technical preview where we started to invite tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands to the technical preview. In that technical preview, we started to see crazy mind-blown emoji tweets and threads on Hacker News about people getting really, really excited about it.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:34:09):\nThat's how we knew it was time to start scaling and it was time to really start thinking about how do we do hiring so that we can build in some insulation around these researchers so that they can eventually go back to GitHub Next to do what they do best, which is be innovative and creative and think about the next moonshot. That process, that took... Well, we're actually still kind of at the tail end of it now. Here we are, like I said, roughly a year and a half after the initial creation of the product, having gone through technical preview, have achieved general availability. We've now hired in a team around them.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:34:53):\nThe researchers actually as early as last month have started to gradually move back over to GitHub Next. An EPD squad, multiple EPD squads actually are now taking the product forward and starting to respond to customer feedback to think about, okay, how do we now as a product team, carry this roadmap forward from an idea that originated in GitHub Next?\n\nLenny (00:35:22):\nI love that insight of bringing the people along and not just kind of like, cool, we'll take it from here. If you were to build a team like this again somewhere to this kind of R&D horizon three or two teams, is there anything else you would do differently, any lessons you take away from this experience for maybe founders or PMs working at larger companies that are like, \"Hey, we should have something like this?\" Is there anything else that you find is important for making something like this successful?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:35:49):\nThe criteria for moving researchers back into their R&D team, whatever that happens to be for your organization, that can't be based on a calendar. It needs to be based on a replacement in seat, who's actually doing the job and has picked up all of the skills necessary, and only then can the researcher move back. Make sure that you've got continuity of expertise and sets and domain familiarity before you move over. I feel like we've managed that pretty well today. As well, it's critical that the team who is taking over from the R&D shop feels like they have control over their own future. You can't really delegate roadmap to an R&D team.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:36:44):\nThe team who's responsible for maintaining the product, for building the product, who has the closest feedback loop with the end customer, they're the ones who really need to own and feel like they control the roadmap. Making sure that you're not outsourcing innovation exclusively to an R&D team, but that is happening within the product team as they take ownership over the idea and over the use case in the customer. Last I would say here is really that engineering fundamentals in a lot of ways are the contracts that differentiate an R&D team from an operational product team.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:37:30):\nBringing that fundamentals process into it is going to feel candidly a little bit unnatural to the researchers. That takes therefore a little bit of cultural change management for everyone to just adapt their way of working and understand that we're graduating from an experiment and a research project to an operational product, and often because those researchers are... They're the first wave that come over. They're the seed of the project. It's going to feel a little bit unnatural to them and they probably won't have all the right skillsets in order to make that transition.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:38:08):\nMaking sure that you've got a good mix of engineers who are comfortable maintaining a service, as well as engineers and researchers who are really thinking about, what is the idea that we've created, what is the new thing that we've brought to market, and can bring that vision to it.\n\nLenny (00:38:27):\nYeah, I can totally see the challenge that comes from... This was my thing. I've been working on this. What are you guys doing to this project? Where is this going? I'm not sure I'm feeling... And then there's all these new asks that are coming at you like, oh my God, this was so much fun and now I have to scale this freaking thing.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:38:46):\nI mean, this is the best problem in the world to have. Talk about kind of customer ask, for Copilot in particular, the amount of chatter, the amount of customer feedback that was coming in especially for us with AI, I mean, the world is still figuring out AI, candidly. I mean, we're getting a lot better at it, especially in the last couple of years with things like Dolly and Copilot. But it brings with it not only engineering challenges, but also, frankly, ethical challenges and legal challenges, like making sense of what our expectations are of AI. If AI produces something that is offensive, who's at fault?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:39:37):\nOur stance on it, what we ended up coming to is actually the framing of Copilot as an AI pair programmer I think is a useful one. Pair programmer, I suspect most of your listeners will know, but pair programmer is usually two developers sitting side by side working on a problem together. One's at the keyboard and the other one's kind of helping them talk through it, talk through the ideas and make corrections, that kind of thing. Well, if Copilot is your AI pair programmer and they're whispering crazy stuff into your ear and they're bringing politics into it or gender identity into it or, I don't know, whatever other...\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:40:19):\nThey're spouting off slang and slander and all that kind of stuff. You're probably not going to be able to focus on your work, right? It's going to be really distracting. Really coming down to some principles about what is the use case we're trying to solve, what is appropriate, I put this in scare quotes, behavior of the AI bot sitting side by side with you, helped us create some principles or some guidelines for the developer experience that we wanted to create.\n\nLenny (00:40:52):\nOh, I love that. Just kind of creating a persona of the thing to help you inform how the behavior of the thing should work. How do you work through these challenges? Is it discussions with you and the legal team? I don't know, these ethical things are really tricky, I imagine. How do you approach them like that as a product team?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:41:09):\nIt is conversations with a very, very wide cast of characters. This product in particular, I probably spent more time with legal than any other products that I've ever kind of been responsible for. All wonderful creative people. But it's not just legal. It is also privacy and security champions. It is, frankly, developers, like the people who are using it, listening to them. Hey, what works here? What doesn't work for you here? Why is this offensive? Why is it not offensive? We'll continue on the example of the crazy pair programmer whispering crazy things into our year. When we first started out, we didn't really have any filter on Copilot whatsoever the very, very, very early days.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:41:58):\nAnd then eventually we're like, okay, it needs to be slightly more controlled experience. We need to edit out some of the most egregious stuff. We introduced a simple block list of words, and these block lists are always fraught with peril, like which words are okay, which words are not okay. All of a sudden, we become editors of language and that's kind of a scary place to be. I'm not comfortable with it at least. But at a certain level, it has to be done, because otherwise you're going to create a bad developer experience.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:42:35):\nOften we would get feedback from developers of like, \"Hey, this particular word was blocked. That it was blocked either was offensive to me or prevented me from being able to get good value out of the product.\"\n\nLenny (00:42:51):\nOh man.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:42:52):\nAlways kind of dancing the dance of editorial content. We're actually at a place now where we're able to partner with the Azure Department of a Responsible AI, and they've created some really extraordinary models that help detect I'll call it sentiment for lack of a better word, but basically when there is something that is patently offensive. Because there are some words that in some contexts may be offensive and in some context may be totally reasonable, especially when you get into software for medical kind of scenarios, right?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:43:35):\nBeing able to start to shift a little bit to focus or to rely on AI models that can also do a better job than we could with crude or simple block lists is maybe another proof point both of how AI as a solution for common development problems is getting way better at solving more parts of our stack or filling in for more parts of our stack. At least in our case, we were pretty fortunate to be able to deliver on or depend on a parent company's contributions to solve a real acute problem that GitHub probably could not have solved on our own.\n\nLenny (00:44:16):\nI never thought that Copilot would be... That you would have to worry about it saying things that are crazy. That is wild that you guys have to deal with that. Wasn't it Microsoft that had that bot that turned really negative and eventually shut down?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:44:31):\nIt was.\n\nLenny (00:44:31):\nThere's experience there.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:44:32):\nWhat was its name? Talia or something like that?\n\nLenny (00:44:35):\nSomething like that.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:44:36):\nYeah, something like that. We don't want another one of those incidences.\n\nLenny (00:44:40):\nWow. What this makes me think about is your team is at the forefront of AI in this applied way. I'm curious what your thinking is on just where this goes for developers especially. I saw a stat that maybe 40% of people's code is now written by Copilot. I don't know if that's right. But is the vision in the future becomes something like 90? Where do you see this all going?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:45:02):\nJust to put a fine point on that stat, it is 40% is specifically for Python developers. Candidly, it varies depending upon the language. Because as you might imagine, some languages have better representation in the public domain than others. And usually both the volume and the diversity of training data correlates with the quality of suggestions, which is then represented by either the number of lines written or the acceptance rate or any one of a number of other metrics.\n\nLenny (00:45:35):\nAwesome. Thanks for clarifying.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:45:36):\nYeah, totally. We see it range anywhere from the upper twenties to the forties across all the different languages.\n\nLenny (00:45:43):\nJust to throw this out there, as a not great engineer, I used to be an engineer for about 10 years, I welcome our AI Overlords writing all my code. I'm excited for this to do more and more. And yes, I'm curious where you think this goes.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:45:58):\nIt does. It enables even mediocre developers like myself to be able to do some pretty amazing things. But where's it going? First, I think, I hope it's obvious to most developers that AI is going to infuse pretty much our entire development stack in the not so distant future. Copilot is really just the very tip of the sphere for a lot of innovations and better managing maybe our build queues or helping to... Here's a great one. I don't know about you, but often the comments that I get with commit messages and PRs aren't super great. It puts a lot of effort onto the code reviewer to go figure out what the developer was actually trying to do.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:46:55):\nWhat if AI could summarize all of your changes with your full request and you just have to, as the contributing developer, just review it to make sure it's accurate, send it on its way, and you don't have to put in extra effort for that. There are lots and lots of different opportunities for AI to essentially be able to take some of the drudgery out of our work so that we can focus on creative acts. What I hear from developers and what I experience myself is that Copilot kind of forces me to think a little bit more about what are the design patterns I'm trying to create?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:47:33):\nWhat is the end user experience or the outcomes that I'm trying to drive with my code, and that I can rely on Copilot to scaffold out a lot of that so that I can focus on more creative work? That is really what I hope for our industry five, 10 years from now, is that not only will we be inviting more developers or more people to become developers by essentially providing a layer of abstraction a little bit, or at least a little bit of a hand in development, but that also the really experienced developers are focusing on much larger problems and focusing on outcomes and creativity rather than really low level difficult rote memorization of things like syntax or ordering of parameters and the like.\n\nLenny (00:48:32):\nGreat. If nothing else, that'll keep people from just having a tab of Stack Overflow, copy and pasting every function that they're trying to figure out.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:48:42):\nI want Stack Overflow to stay in business, but I would mind a little bit less contact switching myself.\n\nLenny (00:48:48):\nIn the experience of scaling this thing, what would you say has been the biggest challenge either technologically or even operationally just kind of scaling it to a real product that people are paying for?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:49:01):\nThere's a few dimensions of that. One is a problem that's very much of our time in the world, namely that supply chains have been disrupted dramatically over the course of the last few years. It turns out that Copilot for both training and operating the models requires some very rare and unique GPUs that there's not a lot of global supply of. Part of it is just like, can we get enough hardware in order to run these things? We've actually earmarked quite a bit of capacity, and we are greedy, greedy, greedy for more capacity globally. As soon as we can produce those chips and get them in data centers, we do it.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:49:50):\nThat's been one kind of unique challenge. I would also say here that operationally, another challenge has been, how do we create a model that the community really feels like ownership over, right? The dialogue that's had to happen as we brought an AI tool to market, especially one that is trained on public code, has required a lot of dialogue between us and our community. Every good product manager should be spending as much of their time as possible with their customers, with their potential customers.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:50:34):\nCopilot, in particular, has been a more complicated kind of rollout because we as an industry, as a society are still figuring out how to make sense of it. The amount of give and take between developers and us as a product team has really required us to scale up more of the product team than it has the engineering team.\n\nLenny (00:51:02):\nInteresting. And why is that?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:51:04):\nIt's a couple of different reasons. I mean, one, like I said, we are trained on public code. Not all of the community is really sure like, when is it okay to train a model on public code? When is it not okay to train a model on public code? Is Copilot producing secure suggestions? Is Copilot producing bug buggy suggestions? There's a lot of doubt. There's a lot of very healthy skepticism. Actually I mean that genuinely. I want people to be skeptical of Copilot. We owe it to ourselves as a community to be skeptical of any AI.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:51:40):\nBecause just like there's great potential for benefit, there's also great potential for harm. People keeping us accountable like, how are you preventing things like model poisoning? Is there going to be a new attack vector that we just haven't really thought of yet around AI that might produce negative consequences? We think that we've done a really good and responsible job of that by making sure that first, we are very clear that Copilot is not a replacement for a developer. It will never be.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:52:17):\nWe do not want Copilot auto generating code where a thinking, reasoning, breathing human being is not on the other side of that keyboard making recent decisions. We do not want Copilot to replace any other part of the stack, whether it is static analysis tools or your unit tests or whatever kind of measures you're putting in today to make sure that your humans produce good quality code. We want you to keep all of those same systems in place to make sure that humans who are leveraging tools like Copilot continue to produce that good quality code.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:52:56):\nBut there's a lot of at the same time anxiety of like, where is AI stack? Is AI eventually going to be... This is back to your question about where will we be five, 10 years from now. Will it be writing 90% of the code? We don't want Copilot to be that... We don't want it to replace anything. We want it to augment. The idea here is really that AI is an enabler for developers to focus on the creative work, to stay in the flow, to be able to move faster. Working through those anxieties, working through that healthy skepticism takes conversation. It takes dialogue. And that takes us on the product side having that guided conversation with the community.\n\nLenny (00:53:50):\nIt feels like it connects back to your education back in the day, philosophy and literature. How convenient is that?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:53:57):\nIt often feels very connect... I mean, certainly the education side of things taught me that the importance of dialogue, the importance of skepticism is valuable in so much more than esoteric armchair ponderings. It's actually applicable to the real world.\n\nLenny (00:54:17):\nMaybe a final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:54:21):\nWoo!\n\nLenny (00:54:23):\nJust looking back at this whole experience of, one, just building, incubating, launching this big bold bet within a big company, you can go in either direction, either just any lessons on just taking a bold bet versus incremental wins and how you think about investing in these two kind of categories, or just within a large company, a lesson of just how to build something like this, like a massive new product from just a seed of an idea to a large new business line potentially.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:54:51):\nAs both a product manager and a portfolio manager of multiple products, I'm responsible for multiple product lines at GitHub, the allocation of time, of focus, energy, and resources becomes a really challenging question. The answer to which isn't always the same, depending upon the time, world circumstances, organizational circumstances, technology circumstances. As a general rule, as a general principle, I certainly try to make sure that we're always reserving some capacity for bold, audacious experimental research projects. You can think of those really uncertain bets as being five to 10% of the team's capacity. About 25, maybe 30% of the team's capacity should generally be on just operations.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:55:54):\nHow do we keep our in-market products meeting customer expectations? And then the remainder of it, what is that, about 60% or so, is really on incremental progress for our end market products. How do we make iterative improvements and continue to actually realize payoff for the larger bets that we made one, two, three, four years back? And from a rough distribution, that's generally how I run my larger teams. That works when you have larger teams though. At startups, where we were pretty much only a big bet, obviously your percentages get very different and it becomes a matter of you're all in for that one proverbial lottery ticket.\n\nLenny (00:56:50):\nAwesome. Thanks for sharing that. I was going to ask you the percentages that you recommend. Thank you for getting to that. With that, we've gotten to our very exciting lightning round. I'm just going to ask you five questions briefly and just whatever comes to mind, whatever answer you have. Let's do it. Sound good? Okay. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:57:13):\nOh, good question. One of them is a book on user experience called Make It So. It's a reference back to Star Trek, and the idea here is essentially that user experiences that are presented to us in sci-fi often make their way into our everyday products and tools 20, 30 years down the line. It is a great eye-opening, illuminating and just really fun book. That's one. And then completely different take, I'll go outside of tech and I'll just do entertainment value. There's a David Foster Wallace book called Brief Interviews with Hideous Men that I love. It's a collection of short stories.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:58:04):\nAnd essentially what it is, is it is if you're watching a movie and the villain gets their opportunity to have their big speech, which kind of explains why they are who they are, it makes them maybe a little bit vulnerable in that moment, it's that speech 10 times over for different hideous people, terrible, terrible people. Interesting read. I recommend it.\n\nLenny (00:58:31):\nI love that. It reminds me of this book that is the interior design of dictators and they show you their homes of Saddam Hussein, Hitler, and all these guys.\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:58:43):\nDude! Oh my gosh, that's awesome. I got to find that one. You'll have to send it to me.\n\nLenny (00:58:47):\nI found one at an old bookstore, like used bookstore. I don't know if they're around anymore, but I'll find it. Second question. What's a favorite other podcast that you like to listen to or recommend if there's any?\n\nRyan J. Salva (00:59:02):\nOh god, there's so many. I consume hundreds of hours of podcasts every month. It is crazy. I can choose many. I'll give you just one. The Memory Palace with Nate DiMeo is an excellent storytelling podcast. He does about 20 minute vignettes, usually selected from kind of American history. He also was the artist in residence at one of the museums in Washington, DC. And if you're ever at I think it's the American History Museum or something like that, if you're ever there, you can go to different rooms in the museum and he'll tell you stories about the objects or the rooms that you see there. It's a magical experience recommended to anyone.\n\nLenny (00:59:56):\nWow! I love those. What's a recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nRyan J. Salva (01:00:00):\nI don't know if this counts as recent, but it's one that I watched recently, which was Arrival. Yeah, that counts. Arrival. Movie ostensibly about aliens, but is really about language and memory. I found that really, really compelling.\n\nLenny (01:00:20):\nHave you read Ted Chiang books and short stories?\n\nRyan J. Salva (01:00:23):\nI have not. I have not.\n\nLenny (01:00:24):\nOh wow! Oh, you would love it. Arrival is from one of his story, I believe, is one of his stories and there's a whole book of many more short stories by the same guy. They're amazing.\n\nRyan J. Salva (01:00:34):\nBrilliant. I've got my weekend cut out for me then.\n\nLenny (01:00:39):\nThere you go. Just leave work and get to reading. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask in interviews?\n\nRyan J. Salva (01:00:46):\nLet's see here. I'll give you a fun one more than it is a challenging one. This is kind of my icebreaker interview question, particularly for more early to mid career product managers. I ask them to teach me something new in one minute. Usually I'll pull up my phone and I'll start the timer. I'll give them a second to think about it and start the timer. They're graded on three different criteria. One is completeness. Did they actually finish the lesson inside of one minute? Two is complexity. It's one thing if you teach me how to, I don't know, pat my head and rub my stomach at the same time.\n\nRyan J. Salva (01:01:28):\nIt's another thing if you teach me something about 18th century ardent connection to religious trends at the time. And then last is really clarity. Oh yeah, clarity is the last one. Clarity is like, do I actually understand? Did I learn something by the end of the lesson? Did they convey the idea fully and wholly?\n\nLenny (01:01:52):\nI have to ask, what's the most interesting thing somebody has taught in this question?\n\nRyan J. Salva (01:01:57):\nMy go-to kind of throwaway answer there about did they teach me something about 18th century art and its connection to religious trends at the time, someone taught me that. It was astounding. It was actually a university candidate, so someone who was still in university, and she was from Vanderbilt University.\n\nLenny (01:02:18):\nAnd was that a strong yes hire?\n\nRyan J. Salva (01:02:20):\nIt was an extremely strong yes hire. She was freaking amazing. Such a smart person.\n\nLenny (01:02:28):\nAmazing. Final question, who else in the industry would you say you most respect as a thought leader or just influence person?\n\nRyan J. Salva (01:02:36):\nThere are many, but I think for today I'd probably beat myself up if I didn't say Uga Damore. Uga is the primary researcher who really kind of is the true innovator for Copilot. He deserves credit for the initial work and is a brilliant technologist and futurists. I really, really respect him a lot.\n\nLenny (01:03:05):\nAmazing. Cool call out. Ryan, this has been so fascinating. You guys are at the forefront of so much interesting work. I honestly can't wait for Copilot for my newsletter so that I can do less work. Maybe that'll come someday. But in any case, I'm excited to see where this whole thing goes. Thank you for being here. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they're curious to learn more, reach out? And then is there a way that listeners can be useful to you?\n\nRyan J. Salva (01:03:33):\nEasy one. How can folks find me? I am Ryan J. Salva everywhere, Twitter, GitHub. Pick your choice. LinkedIn, Ryan J. Salva. And then how can folks be useful to me? Please, there is a 60 day free trial of Copilot that is there for everyone to pick up and use. Go try it out. When you do, post either on Twitter or Hacker News or on discussions, GitHub Discussions, your experience.\n\nRyan J. Salva (01:04:07):\nGive us the good feedback. Give us the bad feedback. I am so hungry to see how people are using it in novel ways and where they're running up against the rough edges too. Like I said, there's lots of room for us to grow and improve from here, but I'm pretty confident that developers will be pretty freaking amazed at what it's already capable of.\n\nLenny (01:04:30):\nAwesome. Thanks for being here, Ryan.\n\nRyan J. Salva (01:04:31):\nYeah, dude, thank you so much. It's been a lot, a lot of fun.\n\nLenny (01:04:35):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# A better way to plan, build, and ship products | Ryan Singer (creator of “Shape Up\")\n\n## Transcript\n\nRyan Singer (00:00:00):\nI often use this analogy of if you're doing a home renovation, you can have the most beautiful rendering of the new bedroom and we're going to have these lamps on the side of the bed that are coming out from the wall. But if you haven't checked if there's electricity in that wall there or not, it's going to drastically change the cost and the time and everything.\n\n(00:00:16):\nWhat we need to do in a shaping session is we come out with some kind of diagram where engineers, product and design, they're saying, \"We understand that.\" So the first thing is we are not going to start something unless we can see the end from the beginning. We're not going to take a big concept and then say, \"What's the estimate for this thing?\"\n\n(00:00:37):\nWe're going to go the other way around and we're going to say, what is the maximum amount of time we're willing to go before we actually finish something? How do we come up with a idea that's going to work in the amount of time that the business is interested in spending?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):\nToday my guest is Ryan Singer. Ryan was one of the first few hires at 37signals, and through his experience of building Basecamp and 17 years of building product at 37signals, he wrote a book called Shape Up, which shares a very different approach to building software.\n\n(00:01:10):\nAppetites instead of deadlines. A big focus on bringing design engine product together into a room to shape the plan versus writing long PRDs or trying to finalize designs before you start building.\n\n(00:01:22):\nI've noticed more and more teams adopting the Shape Up method, and especially with AI starting to change how we work and build product, there's this shift coming in how product teams will operate. And so I thought this was the perfect time to do a deep dive into the Shape Up method.\n\n(00:01:37):\nThis episode is basically going to give you everything you need to give Shape Up a shot on your team or at your company to see if it fixes the problems that you're having shipping great products.\n\n(00:01:46):\nA big thank you to Des Trainer, Bob Moesta and Chris Speck for suggesting questions and topics for this conversation. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.\n\n(00:01:57):\nAlso, if you become a paid subscriber of my newsletter, you get an entire year free of Perplexity Pro, Notion, Superhuman, Linear and Granola. Check it out at lenny'snewsletter.com. With that, I bring you Ryan Singer.\n\n(00:02:14):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app.\n\n(00:02:31):\nTheir APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Versel, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant. The fine-grain authorization service.\n\n(00:02:51):\nWarrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases.\n\n(00:03:09):\nIf you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos. com.\n\n(00:03:33):\nThis episode is brought to you by Merge. Product leaders, yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration. They're not fun for you to scope, build, launch or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place?\n\n(00:03:48):\nLucky for you the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS.\n\n(00:04:02):\nOrganizations like RAMP, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customer's accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases and their product or HRAS data to auto-provision and deprovision access for the customer's employees.\n\n(00:04:18):\nAnd yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So, want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all? Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny and receive a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny.\n\n(00:04:42):\nRyan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nRyan Singer (00:04:46):\nI am really happy to be here. Thanks a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):\nI think this is going to be a legendary episode. There's a lot of interest these days in different ways of working, especially ways that are Agile and SAFe and Scrum and all these ways that people hear about working. Especially in this world of AI where everything's just changing. It feels like there's just an increased interest in exploring different ways of working and specifically it feels like there's been a rise in interest in Shape Up the stuff that you talk about.\n\n(00:05:14):\nSo, I am really excited to basically help people understand what is this way of working, is it right for them? What are ways to start implementing it? What are maybe some pitfalls you may run into? And as much as possible get into a lot of real talk about how things are actually going on product teams that people often don't like to hear.\n\n(00:05:31):\nSo, first of all, have you also seen this increased interest in Shape Up?\n\nRyan Singer (00:05:38):\nYeah, I think it's interesting that we're talking now. I mean, the book came out in 2019 and it's, I've been hearing more and more like, \"Oh, we know somebody who's trying it or we're hearing it when we go talk to other companies.\" So, I think, it's a wave that's slowly building.\n\n(00:05:57):\nAnd it's funny, when it came out, I even tried to have an online forum to get everyone who's interested to talk together and what I started to learn pretty early on is that people don't like to talk about their struggles shipping.\n\n(00:06:13):\nEspecially CPOs and CTOs don't like to go on a public forum and say, \"Our company isn't shipping or our engineering team is stuck, or our team is always lost in the weeds.\" That's not an easy community topic on an online forum.\n\n(00:06:28):\nSo, I think, there's also some reasons why it's been word of mouth slowly gathering steam.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):\nThat's something I struggle with on this podcast. As you said, it's a product and product teams don't want to be sharing when things aren't going great. That's why I introduced Failure Corner on the podcast where it's like, \"Okay, but tell me a time things didn't go well.\"\n\nRyan Singer (00:06:46):\nOh yeah, that's great. Yeah, because it's so hard to get to that, right? And it's not all just this golden path, rosy, where we're all shipping beautiful, meaningful things all day.\n\n(00:06:55):\nIt's a hard business and there's no perfect school either that produces expert product managers and CPOs and CTOs and stuff like that. So we're all trying to figure this out and we don't have a lot of sources, so there is a lot of struggle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:12):\nAnd there aren't many options for how to build product. All people really read about is Scrum/Agile/SAFe as they scale and then there's Waterfall, which, \"No, I never do Waterfall.\" Then there's the start up way of just ship and maybe one or two week cycles and then there's Shape Up, so it feels like it's one of the rare other options that exists. And so-\n\nRyan Singer (00:07:33):\nThat's one of the things I've been hearing. It's, I hear like, \"Oh, we thought there was only Scrum or Kanban, and then we heard there was this Shape Up thing. What's that?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:42):\nAnd I think it's always been connected to Basecamp. We're going to talk about that. Just, it works for companies that are nothing like Basecamp. Maybe just touch on that briefly.\n\nRyan Singer (00:07:53):\nWell, I mean, that came as a surprise to me. I mean, when I wrote the book, I had been in Basecamp at that time, I think 15 years, and I actually didn't even know the outside world. I mean, it was Jason's idea to even write the book. Because he said, \"Look, a lot of people are going to want to know about this. A lot of people are struggling.\" And I'm like, \"Well, okay.\"\n\n(00:08:16):\nI knew our inside story of we had some growing pains and we had to be able to formalize the way that we were working and shipping so that as we brought new people in that they could participate in that and we could stay fast. So, I knew our internal struggles, but I honestly didn't know anything about the outside world.\n\n(00:08:33):\nAnd it was only after the book came out that it gave me this excuse to start talking to people from all kinds of different companies, and it's been really interesting. There are some really amazing cases of companies of very different characteristics from Basecamp, like VC funded, significantly bigger, very different pressures, different team structure, different skills who are doing it.\n\n(00:08:58):\nAt the same time, there is also a lot of questions that are coming in my way because honestly, there are so few teams that are structured just like Basecamp, that there are a lot of gaps in the book of like, \"Well, what about this, and what about that, and how do we do that in our situation?\"\n\n(00:09:11):\nSo, a lot of my focus today is actually closing those gaps and helping people figure out how can I make this work for me or for our team?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:19):\nAnd you specifically told me, you just now call it instead of Shape Up it's Shape Up In Real Life or Shape Up For Real Life.\n\nRyan Singer (00:09:24):\nYeah. Well, my wife heard me saying the same thing over and over again on every phone call. And she's overhearing me and she's like, \"You have to make a course, you have to do something. You always are saying the same thing.\"\n\n(00:09:37):\nSo then this led to this course that we made, which is called Shaping and Real Life. And well, yeah, the idea is the real life part, right? How do I make this work if my designers don't code? It's very contentious to get engineering time. You know what I mean? When there's all these different pressures that Basecamp didn't have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:56):\nWe're going to get into the nitty gritty of how this actually works and the key elements, but can you just give a very short overarching summary of how Shape Up is different from how other product approaches are?\n\nRyan Singer (00:10:07):\nI think the way it's different starts with how the way we were working was a little bit different. So, I started working with Jason and David on the first version of Basecamp, which was the flagship product of 37signals back in 2003. We were a team of three.\n\n(00:10:25):\nAnd, I mean, I think, it's for any really small team, when you're just starting out, you don't need a process. You don't need a way of working. It just happens organically because you're together. You don't have to explain it to other people, it just happens on its own, right?\n\n(00:10:40):\nBut there was always this really intense urgency from both Jason and David, \"We've got to get to something we can ship. We have to finish this and move on. We have to get to something that's done.\" There was just no tolerance for big things that got fuzzy and started to drag. There was always this sharpening to get to what is this thing really and when are we going to get to the end soon?\n\n(00:11:03):\nAnd on top of that, even when we were building V1, David wasn't actually full-time as our only technical person. He was programming 10 hours a week. So, we had this really intense pressure of how can we really use David's time well?\n\n(00:11:20):\nWe don't want to ever give something that this is the thing we want to build, and then it turns out not to be what we want and we have to throw it away and then come back again or you know what I mean? Those bad cycles of waste.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:32):\nLet me actually ask about this because this is really interesting. So this is DHH. He was working part-time when he started 37signal.\n\nRyan Singer (00:11:40):\n10 hours a week. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:41):\nWas he working on Ruby basically and that whole thing?\n\nRyan Singer (00:11:45):\nWell, Rails came out of the first... So, he told Jason, \"I want to try building this in Ruby,\" because before they had done some collaboration and David had done things in PHP before that and he had this new idea, he wanted to try Ruby, this language he fell in love with.\n\n(00:12:04):\nAnd then the framework, Ruby on Rails, he ended up releasing that after Basecamp was standing. Because it was extracted from the things that were necessary to give V1 of Basecamp to stand up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):\nSo that's what he was doing the rest of his time instead of-\n\nRyan Singer (00:12:19):\nI don't know. I don't know what he was doing the rest of his time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:19):\nProbably something great. Something-\n\nRyan Singer (00:12:23):\nBut he's always been like that. He's always doing something interesting. He's either racing or who knows what, you know what I mean? But all I knew was that we got 10 hours of that time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:33):\nYeah, I love that that was a constraint to design a way of working that uses engineering time most efficiently.\n\nRyan Singer (00:12:39):\nYeah, I mean, put that together. So, David's constraint of 10 hours a week and then Jason has this, I mean, I think, many really successful founders and especially CEOs have this thing, it's like all they want to see is movement. You know what I mean? Forward, forward, forward.\n\n(00:12:55):\nSo when do we get to see it? When do we get to try it? When do I get to put it into somebody's hands? So that combination, there was just so much urgency even though there was no outside pressure. You know what I mean? It was completely just let's say cultural energy of how do we keep getting somewhere and getting to something that we can celebrate and get excited about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:17):\nI love that. That's an attribute, I think, of a lot of successful founders. So that makes sense to hear that.\n\nRyan Singer (00:13:22):\nTotally, totally. And that's why where I come back to you, this is the part of the story where, I think, so many companies would say, \"Yeah, I know that experience,\" right? Because, I think, that's probably the seedling of, as you said, of successful companies.\n\n(00:13:34):\nIs that combination of urgency and also that those guys were so talented and that they had a clear vision of what they wanted to do and all of that. It's this amazing time actually, these early days.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:44):\nIs there anything more to the backstory that's important to share or super interesting?\n\nRyan Singer (00:13:47):\nYeah, I mean, the other big piece of it was, so Jason and I were this product, what do you call it? The two thirds. So, I was doing UX at the time and I was doing hands-on coding as well. So we're very, very integrated. Everybody does a little bit of everything. All of us were coding.\n\n(00:14:09):\nJason was in the actual app templates as well doing HTML and CSS to do the views. He's doing hands-on design. We're all very much connected with why are we building this? What is this? David's doing the bulk of the programming, and Jason and I were having these little sessions.\n\n(00:14:28):\nThese little sessions where we would really figure out what the idea was and there would be this moment where you would have a few strokes of this Sharpie pen on a big pad of paper and all of a sudden you'd be like, \"Oh yeah, that's the idea. That's the thing we want to go try to build.\"\n\n(00:14:46):\nAnd for me, those sessions with Jason, they were these short, very, very intense sessions where you're trying to crack the nut together. Where's the idea? What's the concept? How can we go... What's this thing that we're going to go and 10 hours later, right, David's going to come back and we're going to be like, \"This is awesome. This thing works and it does something we're excited about,\" right?\n\n(00:15:10):\nThat was really the seedling. I mean, actually that continued over years and years and years, those sessions. And that's the seedling of this word in the book shaping. What does it mean to do shaping? It wasn't sitting alone writing a document, it wasn't making a bunch of requirements.\n\n(00:15:31):\nIt wasn't making a beautiful Figma file to represent a concept that could maybe be a feature. It was this super intense, really exciting collaborative, \"What about this? What about that? Oh, maybe this.\" So that was a really big part of how we worked also.\n\n(00:15:51):\nVery intensely collaborative sessions to figure out what the idea is and getting it sharp enough and crispy enough that we could very confidently get a yes from David. That he would know exactly what it is and what it means and come back.\n\n(00:16:06):\nIt would be what we pictured and it would work the way that we hoped so that we would keep going and we wouldn't have to reverse or go back to the drawing board.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:15):\nWhat it sounds like is essentially you're trying to maintain the startup way of working as the company grows. Everything you're describing is how it feels to be at a startup, and this is a method to keep that. Does that sound right?\n\nRyan Singer (00:16:28):\nThat's exactly what became Shape Up, was how do we hold onto that as much as possible? I mean, one big ingredient, we had an advantage also, which was that Jason and David hired so deliberately slowly, and this is a fortunate side effect of the fact that they didn't take investment money.\n\n(00:16:51):\nSo there was never that moment of now's the moment when we grow. It was always one person. And then the organism adapts. One more person. And so, this natural way of working, it was organically spreading. There were, I think, maybe 10 years before we had the first, \"Wait a minute, what just happened?\" That project didn't go well, that's not how things normally run.\n\n(00:17:26):\nOf course there were always ups and downs, but it was about 10 years later when we had the first project. I mean, I remember the project. I remember being at the end of... It was at that time already, it had been maybe six weeks or seven weeks. We hadn't yet completely locked the six-week thing that went into Shape Up.\n\n(00:17:47):\nAnd I remember we had a review session and there was a fairly new person who's doing half of the work on that team, and we had the review session and it was like instead of, \"Oh, look, this is about ready to ship.\" It was like, \"There are a lot of open questions here.\"\n\n(00:18:06):\n\"And not only are there a lot of open questions here, we're not getting quick answers as we're asking.\" And what we're starting to realize is like, \"Oh, not only is this not going to ship, but we can't even see the end of this.\"\n\n(00:18:26):\nThat was one of those moments where you're like, \"Oh, this isn't going to automatically, organically just keep it spreading as we hire forever.\" You know what I mean? We did reach a point where it's like, \"Oh, we're going to have to figure out when this goes well, why does it go well and what do we do differently and how do we formalize that so it's reproducible as we keep onboarding more people?\"\n\n(00:18:52):\nThat's actually when Shape Up as a framework started. That's when I really started to lean in and I took over that responsibility of, \"Okay, how do I systematize this?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):\nThat's a great segue to let's actually talk about how the Shape Up method works. Maybe just at a high level, what are the core ingredients to the Shape Up method?\n\nRyan Singer (00:19:10):\nThere's basically three maybe big things. So, the first thing is this notion of we are not going to start something unless we can see the end from the beginning. So, we're not going to take a big concept and then say, \"What's the estimate for this thing?\" We're not going to say, \"Oh, we need to build a calendar and then do a whole bunch of Figma files or write a whole bunch of requirements and then ask for an estimate.\"\n\n(00:19:39):\nWe're going to go the other way around and we're going to say, \"What is our appetite for this? What is the maximum amount of time we're willing to go before we actually finish something?\" And we have that startup moment that we talked about. That moment of like, \"Ah, you know what I mean? It works. We got somewhere.\" At least this, if not the whole project, this meaningful piece, we can literally walk away from.\n\n(00:20:03):\nSo then what we found was that there was a lot of experimentation. We found that six weeks is the maximum that we can see into the future where we could actually say, \"How do we work backward and figure out something we could build in that six weeks and really land it?\"\n\n(00:20:21):\nThat's the first piece. Is working backward from the amount of time we actually want to spend on something and say, \"What can we do? What could we shape so that after that amount of time we've gotten to somewhere we want to be?\"\n\n(00:20:36):\nIt's like if you're going to buy a car or you're going to buy a house or you're going to rent a new flat or whatever, you have to have a budget in mind, right? And the budget then is how you choose between all kinds of alternatives and make a lot of hard choices and trade-offs to figure out like, \"Well, I want the faster engine, but I have to give this up, or I want it to be fun to drive, but we also need space for longer road trips.\" You're making all these trade-offs, right?\n\n(00:21:07):\nSo, this second piece is this work that we call shaping and the shaping work is, how do we actually take this fixed amount of time that we've given for ourselves and vary the scope? How do we come up with a idea, some version of this that's going to work in the amount of time that the business is interested in spending?\n\n(00:21:34):\nSo, this is those creative sessions that I was talking about where we're jumping all over the room in front of the whiteboard and getting to an idea. And there, the really key thing is that we're getting to an idea where we can see the idea. We understand why we're doing this.\n\n(00:21:52):\nWe're wrestling with the problem and we're wrestling with the solution until we have an idea that we can actually say, \"This is what we want to go build.\" So it's not just calendar or dashboard or newsletter builder, but it's this idea of how we're going to tackle this problem about the calendar request, right? So that's the shaping.\n\n(00:22:15):\nAnd then the third piece is when we've actually carved out a fixed amount of time, when we've shaped a solution that is from a experience standpoint, from a functionality standpoint, from a technical standpoint, doable and desirable, something that we can make happen in that amount of time, then we can give it to a team.\n\n(00:22:41):\nWe don't have to do the sometimes called scrum, the paper shredder. That's where you take an idea and then you split it into 100 tickets, right, and you hope that it all glues together still after you've done that step. We don't want to do that.\n\n(00:22:57):\nInstead, we want to have a whole idea, give it to a team so they see the whole, they really understand it, right? And then they can come up with their tasks and they can figure out how to track that and break it into pieces so they can actually take more responsibility.\n\n(00:23:13):\nAnd so what we see is way more engagement, especially from the technical team, right? Because instead of, \"Here's your ticket,\" or \"Here's your user story,\" it's like, \"Here's the thing you understand, that makes sense, and now you're going to have freedom to figure out how to actually make this a reality.\"\n\n(00:23:32):\nThere's going to be a million things to solve in the implementation detail, and now you have a bunch of fun problems and you don't have to keep asking questions to other people to understand what this is or how do I make a trade off or that thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:44):\nOne of the core elements of this, and I want to confirm is that you can pick and choose these things into your team. You don't need to do this wholesale, correct?\n\nRyan Singer (00:23:54):\nYou don't need to do any of it. So, this is where it helps to look at what's going wrong and what are we trying to fix? And then what do I want to bring into this, right?\n\n(00:24:08):\nAnd usually, what I notice is that people, they like to start sometimes with, \"Oh, I want to give the team, let's say six weeks and I want to give the team more latitude or let's say more creative freedom, that they're going to be responsible in this six weeks to figure out how to make it happen.\"\n\n(00:24:24):\nAnd usually a lot of the drive for that is, \"I'm getting tired of having so many meetings and rituals and things that are not actually working on the problem and doing the work.\" I mean, especially scrum teams, they often complain about that.\n\n(00:24:40):\nSo, what they sometimes see in this is like, \"Oh, I love this idea that the team is just going to be cooking for six weeks and they're not going to, we're going to meet as needed and we're going to workshop things, but we're not going to be busy with all these rituals all the time,\" right?\n\n(00:24:54):\nNow, the thing that's tricky is that if you want that reality of the team happily buzzing and humming like some happy bee colony for this six weeks, they need to have a lot more clarity around what's the thing that we're solving, right?\n\n(00:25:12):\nAnd so when we start working backward from that, then what we see is that, \"Oh, well, if we don't shape better, then the team isn't going to have the clarity that they need to take over that responsibility, so they can make choices and make decisions and make trade offs so that they can get to the end of this thing.\" And the worst is that sometimes see cases where people are like, \"Okay, we're doing Shape Up. So, you guys are going to build the newsletter builder, okay? But you only get six weeks to do it. So use your fixed time, vary your scope and enjoy your responsibility.\" You know what I mean? Which is just cruel, right?\n\n(00:25:50):\nBecause I think I'll quote Bob Moesta, who's been on your show a couple times, \"You can't put 10 pounds of crap in a five pound bag.\" So, it's a high academic statement and we can't just take any project, no matter how giant it is, and then throw it at a team and say, \"Figure it out and ship something meaningful in six weeks by cutting away scope,\" right?\n\n(00:26:13):\nSo, it starts to raise questions about how do we actually decide together what this project is? Do we actually have clarity around what the idea is and what we're going to build?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:30):\nLet me follow up on a couple of the elements. So appetites, I think for any product manager, engineer, designer, anyone that has experienced, \"Okay, we estimate this landing page is going to take a couple of weeks. Great, let's work on it,\" and then it ends up being six weeks can understand why this makes sense.\n\n(00:26:47):\nIt's just like, \"This landing page is not that important to us. Let us just say we will commit two weeks to it. We'll do as much as we can in two weeks and then we move on. And scope is not allowed to go beyond that.\" Makes total sense. This just makes so much sense as you listen to this, especially for people that have...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:00):\nSo much sense as you listen to this, especially for people that have just fallen into the problems of estimates not being accurate. Then there's a six-week element and the key there is your, and this is counter to maybe two-week sprints like Scrum, is that kind of the where this comes?\n\nRyan Singer (00:27:18):\nSo, actually, it turns out that the six-week is only a maximum and that's really where this number does some work for us. If we think of six weeks as a maximum, that's going to force us to ask some really good questions to ourselves about what piece of this do we really think we can land? Because if you try to say, in six months, we're going to ship this thing, you can't get your arms around all of the problems that have to get solved for an entire six-month chunk of work to actually happen. There are so many unknowns, there are so many ticking time bombs of things that we didn't understand or couldn't foresee, but if we set a ceiling at six weeks, we have a much better chance of, I think that's the size of something where we can actually shape it and surface enough unknowns and reveal that complexity before we're in the middle of it.\n\n(00:28:15):\nIt doesn't mean that we can't use this technique to do a two-week project, especially if you're on a growth team, you don't want to wait six weeks or, you know what I mean? You're going to have to artificially bundle things together to do six weeks. It's like, look, I've got something I want to ship in the next week and then I've got a thing that might take two weeks after that and then a week after that. So, it's more a question of what we're trying to take on. It's really that upper limit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:39):\nOkay. So, it could be a two-week cycle and the appetite is-\n\nRyan Singer (00:28:41):\nIt could be a two-week thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:43):\nCool. So, it's like we're going to build this new landing page, we're going to give it two weeks and then do a shaping session on that.\n\nRyan Singer (00:28:48):\nNow, the other side of that is when it comes to feature development or building something that's going to be needy enough to sell, then there's very few things that are going to be a substantial value add to a product that you can do in two weeks. So, then you get into a point where, well now, we're just sprinting and we're just taking one bite after the other. And then that's where we can land in that situation where we feel like, \"Ah, I can never see the end of this. I just keep going back and saying, one more sprint, one more sprint, one more sprint.\" But six weeks is this long enough chunk or sometimes, four weeks that the question is kind of, what's big enough that we can actually get somewhere with this amount of time?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:32):\nAnd there's an implied element to this that I think is worth highlighting. The whole idea is you commit to the appetite and if you are not on track to hit that instead of extending the date you cut in order to still hit it.\n\nRyan Singer (00:29:48):\nThis is a tricky one.\n\n(00:29:51):\nSo, you're right that it's implied, but the thing is, in real life, if you make a commitment and you get alignment that we are going to spend six weeks of engineering time building this thing, if you get to that end of that six weeks and something is going wrong, it wasn't shaped, we can't see the end of it. It's more complicated than we thought. All these different things. And by the way, we can also talk about why those things happen, but when we get in that situation, if we're at the end of the six weeks and it's not looking good, we can't just cut off what we agreed to that made this thing valuable. We can't just cut the scope and say, \"Oh, well now, we managed to ship inside of six weeks.\" That's going to kill everybody's morale. Everyone's going to feel disappointed. We're going to feel like this wasn't really worthwhile.\n\n(00:30:43):\nAnd now, we go into the next cycle with this debt feeling that we didn't actually finish the thing we were supposed to finish, so now, we're like overtime. None of that is good. And if we also go the other extreme and just say, well, should we say in the book, we had this principle at base camp which was this notion of the circuit breaker. If a project is not on track to actually finish after the six weeks, we're just going to cancel it and rethink. Almost no teams have the stomach for that, but the version of that that's more stomachable is look, we can't just cancel the project and then say, \"Let's see what comes next.\" But what we can do is say, \"We're not going to keep reinvesting in something that we don't understand.\"\n\n(00:31:34):\nSo, let's take this out of build mode and bring this back into shaping mode, which might mean different people, a different conversation asking different questions, doing a different kind of work to suss out what is it that's fuzzy here? What is it that we couldn't see? What do we not understand? How do we get to the clarity that we need, so that we can actually say this thing is going to happen if we give it another whack.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):\nI love just how real this approach is not this theoretical. Okay, cool. After six weeks, use just the scope and it's all that's cool.\n\nRyan Singer (00:32:10):\nYeah, you just cut the scope.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:11):\nYeah.\n\nRyan Singer (00:32:11):\nNo problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:12):\nShape your gut, put your gut.\n\nRyan Singer (00:32:13):\nI've seen some Shape Up adoptions that looked like that by the way, and that's not the way. The shaping step is crucial. And what you mentioned with your landing page example, by the way, it's so seductive because we can imagine, oh, Parkinson's law, right? If you give me six weeks to do the landing page, I'll find a way to use it, but if you give me two weeks, then I'll stop after two weeks. But when it comes to real product work, where there's some functionality that we have to figure out how to make it exist, we can't just cut the scope if we run out of time. So, what it means is that the shaping work is really working hard together to figure out what are the main moving pieces of this thing. How do we narrow down our understanding of the problem and how do we identify what the moving parts are of the solution and what actually connects together for this feature to work?\n\n(00:33:19):\nAnd when we really get to the level where we can say, \"Oh, we need to do this, this, and then the engine is going to turn,\" that's the place where we can say, \"Oh, this is well-shaped.\" And it's a different kind of work. In shaping in real life, we call it, we actually teach it as doing live shaping sessions, and this was how I did it for years with Jason. We'd get into the room and I had both the technical and the UX side, so both sides were represented there in one person in that case, but for a lot of teams today, we actually teach them how to bring the senior engineering person who isn't just senior in title, the one who actually knows where the bodies are buried, how the old stuff works and what's truly possible and what's hard and what's easy in our infrastructure, like the person that really knows.\n\n(00:34:12):\nYou bring that person together with the product person who deeply understands the backstory of why this is an opportunity and what we're trying to solve with this. And then a designer in the room and they're whiteboarding and wrestling with each other to get to what's a version of this thing that we believe in that's real that we can actually finish in that time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:30):\nThis is great. Let's go one level deeper on this shaping session. So, a few tactical questions. How long are these sessions? It sounds like the people that join are a designer and an engineer and an NPM. So, add anything else there. And when do they happen is at the end of a... Do you call it a cycle by the way or sprint, the six-ish week period?\n\nRyan Singer (00:34:51):\nWhat I actually like is time box actually, because the thing is that some teams need regular cycles because they have parallel teams and they need that cadence in order to reduce management overhead. But if you're small and you only have one or two teams, you might not need to be on a fixed cadence or a cycle plan. You might be able to just set one time box after another. So, the key thing is actually that that time is pushing back at you and that you're being intentional about, what's my time budget that I need to shape into?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:24):\nLet me take a quick tangent because if you're, that's so interesting that the time boxes can be very different lengths. Imagine at a larger company, this gets complicated when other teams are trying, there's dependencies and timelines launch and go to market dates and all these things. What's the largest company this approach has worked at? What's the ideal company stage for Shape Up?\n\nRyan Singer (00:35:47):\nIt can function in very large companies. We have, for example, I have some friends at a, what is it called? They're doing clinical trials. So, they're in the pharmaceutical industry and the companies, thousands of people, and it's not that every team is doing this, but they have a few teams that are working in important areas and they're doing this and it's completely possible in that context, if you have someone who's at a senior level on the engineering side who is able to make the right architectural choices and also do some negotiating and be the backstop to make sure that someone isn't going to get pulled away onto something else, if you can carve out, oh, this system can be worked on independently of that system. This was actually what David at Basecamp has always been amazing at is this dependency, how...\n\n(00:36:47):\nIt's actually not. It's not. So many people are used to it and they think that it's just how it is, but it's actually not. It is possible for engineering leadership, good engineering leadership untangles things, so we can work on this system without having to be thinking about this other system somewhere else. So, when you have some untangling with your infrastructure and with your architecture from an engineering standpoint, then you have some freedom. And then if you can also figure out the capacity management side of I'm going to protect this team from that other work for this number of weeks, you can really get a lot done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:23):\nThis insight that you can operate this way at a larger company and the whole company doesn't have to operate this way, I think is really freeing to a lot of people. What's the adapter? And I want to come back to the actual shaping process, but I can't help but ask this. Say the company's operating a quarterly cadence or six month cadence and then there's a team operating in a two week, sometimes six weeks, sometimes four week cadence advice on how to, what's the adapter that connects those two cadences?\n\nRyan Singer (00:37:50):\nSo, there's two different things. So, I've seen cases where they've decided on a four-week plus two-week or so they'll do five-week and then one week of cool down in between and then they time it so that it adds up to a quarter. I've seen that. The other thing I've seen is when the team is just continuously delivering meaningful things, it doesn't have to line up because from the executive level, if you are CP or CTO or in these bigger cases, it's more like a VP in some area, but you're coming to the table where you're supposed to be reporting of what your group is doing. And when you are consistently saying, \"We said we were going to do this and nothing finished and now, we're doing this and it's going to finish,\" and the next time you say, \"We said we were going to do that and it's finished, without excuses and without, well, maybe another few more months or we're working at it,\" that's what everyone wants to see is that movement.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:52):\nYeah, if you're doing great, people will leave you alone. That makes sense.\n\nRyan Singer (00:38:54):\nFor sure. For sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:56):\nI love that. I love that point. Okay, coming back to shaping, maybe one way that would make it real easy for people to understand, what's the output of the shaping session?\n\nRyan Singer (00:39:05):\nThe output of the shaping session is, and by the way, about shaping session, maybe we can talk a little bit about what shaping is not because we need the contrast sometimes. So, very often, when people try Shape Up, what I see is a product team creating either a lot of Figma files or maybe a lot of documentation, like a PRD with a bunch of requirements and a bunch of backstory and good reasons why we're doing this and stuff like that. And what you see is that when you give that to a team as this is what we shaped, what happens is it blows out. So, you probably know about what happens when the Figma file makes first contact with the engineering team. There's a reality check that happens there and very often, there's a back to the drawing board. So, when there's a lot of solutioning all the way down to detail without engineering involved, usually, that's a painful recipe and then it's like, \"No, we can't do that,\" or, \"Actually, it doesn't work like that.\"\n\n(00:40:16):\nAnd then on top of it, the other big challenge is that there's so much that you can't see on the surface of a UI. How do we flow from here to there? What are the different cases of logic? In which case do we move from here to here to here in the flow? What is happening behind the scenes? It's like the engineering team, they have to put on their x-ray goggles and study this thing to try and understand what's happening underneath. I often use this analogy of if you're doing a home renovation, you can have the most beautiful rendering of here's the new bedroom, and we're going to have these lamps on the side of the bed that are coming out from the wall, and you can have the perfect rendering and the perfect lamp and the perfect color, but if you haven't checked if there's electricity in that wall there or not, it's going to drastically change the cost and the time and everything if you're going to have to rip open those walls to feed some lines up to those lamps.\n\n(00:41:15):\nSo, what we need to do in a shaping session when it's going well is we come out with some kind of drawing or diagram where engineers, product, and design are all looking at that and they're saying, \"We understand that. I know exactly what to go build.\" I'll use the example of the calendar from the book. So, what is a calendar? So, first of all, there was this work that we had to do before we could even shape it, which is like, can we actually narrow down this problem? In shaping in real life, we call this framing. And in the book, there's a chapter called Setting the Boundaries where we get into this and it's like, look, we are not going to just build calendar, which is Google Calendar. Who knows where it ends? We narrowed it down to we understand that for our specific customers who are requesting this again and again, it's more about I need to see empty spaces and in the existing agenda view, I can only see things that are already scheduled and I can't see free spaces where I could book something.\n\n(00:42:21):\nSo, we got to that point of what we're trying to solve here is the empty spaces. So, that's a good frame. Then what are we actually going to build? We came to, here's a good rule of thumb. If it's shaped well, you can usually describe it in less than 10 moving pieces. If I can say, \"It's going to have this, this, this, this, this, and this,\" and that's how we're going to let people see the empty spaces, that's a good indicator that it's clear enough that it's shaped well. So, in this case, when you go to an airline and you want to book something, you see this two-month grid. So, it's like there's going to be two months side by side, but they're just going to have dots in them to indicate if there's a free day or not, if there's something in that day or not, like the iPhone calendar, I think still has this where it's just dots on the month view.\n\n(00:43:17):\nAnd then if you tap a day with a dot in it or without a dot in it, there's going to be an agenda view that slides underneath, which is going to show you what's scheduled in that day. And then there's going to be navigation to go forward and back in the months, there's going to be a create button to create an event, and that's more or less it. So, what you can see here is it's not like, what is a calendar? It's not a calendar. It's a two-month dot grid with scrolling agenda view underneath and the ability to hit new when you're looking at an empty space to create something in what you're viewing. So, that's the kind of thing where that's shaped and we can talk about what that means and what it entails, and we can have a really practical, realistic conversation about, is that a thing we can do in six weeks?\n\n(00:44:12):\nThat's going to be a real conversation and not looking at a whole bunch of mock-ups and trying to x-ray to figure out what's actually the intent here and what's really real and what's not and what's possible and what's not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:23):\nThat was a great example. This is really helpful. So, if I were to try to describe this, essentially what you're coming out of it with a shaping session with is like the user experience with just wire frames/sketches of the screens and the key buttons and flows. So, it's like the architecture with key components, not like a dock of spec and not final design, and also not just a user story. As a user, I need to be able to see empty spaces.\n\nRyan Singer (00:44:56):\nExactly. So, because the thing where it goes wrong. If we're going to commit engineering time and it's like we believe there's some way to see empty spaces, but the way is a question mark, it's a really risky way to spend that time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:11):\nBecause you're committing, right? It's like-\n\nRyan Singer (00:45:12):\nYeah, we're committing and that time is really valuable. That's six weeks of engineer's time, and that time wasn't easy to get in the first place because, of course, there's all these other forces in the company that want to be doing something with the engineers. So, if we want that team to be really using that time well where they are moving, they understand what they're solving and they're creatively engaged because they know what it's supposed to be doing, they need to have that clarity both on the problem side of this is about the empty spaces and on the solution side of it's a dot grid with two months and a scrolling agenda view and a button. There's still a million interesting creative tasks there in the actual high fidelity design in the code. There's so many things to solve there, but that is something that they can all hold in their heads and understand and work on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:06):\nThis episode is brought to you by Airtable ProductCentral, the unified system that brings your entire product org together in one place. No more scattered tools, no more misaligned teams. If you're like most product leaders, you're tired of constant context switching between tools. That's why Airtable built ProductCentral after decades of working with world-class product companies. Think of it as mission control for your entire product organization. Unlike rigid point solutions, ProductCentral powers, everything from resourcing to voice of customer to road mapping to launch execution. And because it's built on Airtable's no-code platform, you can customize every workflow to match exactly how your team works. No limitations, no compromises. Ready to see it in action? Head to airtable.com/lenny to book a demo. That's airtable.com/lenny.\n\n(00:46:58):\nYou mentioned, and I think a lot of people listening to this are going to be like, \"Oh, I'm scared of doing this,\" is if you get too detailed, the engineers and designers on the team are just like, \"What the hell? You're just telling me what to build. That sucks. I don't want that kind of work.\" So, is the solution to that the engineering lead was super involved and detailed, and the design lead was super involved, and so you can trust that you're not just the code monkey building the thing they told you to build?\n\nRyan Singer (00:47:26):\nThat's really interesting. I got to tell you, the dominant failure case that I see in the real world is always, again and again, not enough detail. And it's also the most common failure mode where the engineers run back to the product folks and say, \"I'm not getting enough from you.\" It is really like that, but I can understand why the hair stands up on the back of the neck a little bit thinking about it because, of course, if you give a senior engineer like, \"Here's how I want you to go implement the schema for this database change for this model,\" they're going to be like, \"What do you think? Who are you? Who are you?\" You know what I mean? But what's really interesting is it's not a universal thing. The amount of detail that the team is going to feel helps them is a dial that we can turn that depends on who's on the team.\n\n(00:48:28):\nSo, if you have a more junior person who's on the build team and then you have a more senior engineer who's involved in the shaping, they can make that junior engineer much more successful with additional detail. So, we're going to do this and I would suggest approaching it like this, this, this, and this. That junior person is, when they don't know how to do it, they're not going to ask because they don't want to show that they don't know, and they're going to hide the fact that they're lost and it's going to blow up later in the project. And on the other hand, if they are given more guidance, they're going to be able to be successful. They're going to learn about this is how this person who knows well, kind of approached it and then in the next round or a few projects later, you can dial it back and say, \"Well, let's give less detail and see how they handle it.\"\n\n(00:49:19):\nSo, you can really give people bigger shoes to grow into and help them to be successful. And then, of course, you can also do it the other way around where if you've got some really stellar talent on the team and you have a long history and you have a lot of trust that they are going to be able to understand and solve it, then of course, you can leave things out.\n\n(00:49:40):\nBut the thing that I often see is if there's someone on the build team who really feels that they should be involved in the fundamental decisions about the approach, then a better solution would be to actually bring them into the shaping and have them play that technical role in the shaping session. If they have the right skills and the right perspective and the right knowledge to play that role well, then just bring them into the shaping. So, it's all about how do we bring people into a moment where we are using their strengths and then we're giving them an input, so that whatever their work step is that they're able to apply the maximum creativity, but also have the maximum clarity, so that they can really use that time well and also feel good about what they're doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:29):\nIt feels like the core of this is de-risk the biggest risks and address the biggest unknowns as much as possible. There's probably this 80% of here are the risks. Let's just understand them deeply before we commit to this appetite.\n\nRyan Singer (00:50:42):\nThat is exactly right. There are these, we can call them rabbit holes, we can call them time bombs. There are these things where we say, \"Oh, it'll be fine.\" One example, simple example, I worked with a team and they had a step of onboarding in a FinTech product and there was this step of onboarding and they would lose a lot of people in the funnel at that step because you had to fill out a whole bunch of information, and they figured out that they could actually pipe that data in from one of the partners that they had. They were partnered with banks and they're like, \"Oh, we don't even need to be asking people this. So, we're going to fix conversion. We're going to eliminate a step from our user experience. It's going to be great.\"\n\n(00:51:26):\nThe thing that they didn't look at was if you go into the code on that step of the onboarding, it's not actually one step. There's like three different branches of that step depending on which bank the customer is integrated on. And so, that's the kind of thing where it all sounds so great and simple, and then you get into the weeds and you realize like, \"Oh, wait a minute.\" You know what I mean? So, now, we have decisions to make. Now, if you're in the middle of a project and it's already been resourced and people are already on the hook that we're supposed to be doing this, and you already got the alignment that the engineering time is happening for this, and you're finding that out in week four. You know what I mean? You did all these beautiful drawings, by the way, and now, you're finding this out in week four, that's a bad place to be.\n\n(00:52:14):\nBut if we're in the shaping room and we didn't kick this thing off yet, we didn't even green light the project yet, and we have an engineer there, not just the product people, not just the designer, but we have that engineer who really insists on sometimes, I like to think of it like the grumpy old plumber who's seen everything and he insists on opening up the walls and looking at the pipes before he'll give you a quote. So, it's like when you've got that person in the room, they're saying, \"Yeah, that all sounds great. Let's take a quick look at the code and figure out what screen you're actually talking about. Just let's just take a quick look.\" And it only takes a moment to open up the code, find this thing that we're talking about, and really look at it and say, \"Oh, it's more complicated than we thought.\"\n\n(00:52:59):\nAnd now, it's not like, \"Okay, now, we're screwed and the project is going to be bigger.\" Now, we can have a really cool conversation about trade-offs. So, let's say we've got three different integrations here, three different segments integrated into different banks. How big are they relative to each other in terms of the deals we made or the percentage of customers who flow through those three different conditions? If we just did this on one of those branches, would it be a win? And if we did it on all three, how much more time would we have to negotiate for and would it feel worth it? You see, we're getting into this horse-trading of what is important, what's worth it, what do we need to get out of it? And that's really productive. And when you're doing that before the project starts off, that feels like, \"Oh, we're talking about the important things. We're not failing right now. We are engaged in the hard questions that are going to enable us to really ship something that's successful later.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:54):\nWell, let's go one level deeper on this shaping session, because clearly, that is so core to this working, and I know you have a whole book about how to actually do this. So, we're not going to-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):\n... to this working, and I know you have a whole book about how to actually do this, so we're not going to answer all the questions, and there's a lot of detail and nuance. But a few questions, how long do these usually take? It sounds like a whole day experience, and then it sounds like you invite as few people as possible, but not too few people. What's your guidance on who should join?\n\nRyan Singer (00:54:21):\nIn this shaping and real life course, we've been doing workshops where we try to help people to learn what it's like in a shaping session. One of the things that's always interesting to me is how... So Kathy and I will be running the session and we have to... People aren't used to working so fast. What are we actually doing right now? What's the decision? What's an idea right now? We're not going to go away and draw something, and then I'll comment on a document and then come back and get together tomorrow. What ideas do we actually have right now starting from zero? So imagine, we've narrowed down the calendar problem too. It's about empty spaces. We are willing, from a business standpoint, to spend six weeks on a whack at this where it's solved. We believe there's a way that's possible, so what can we come up with?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:23):\nAnd that's the input to the framing session or sorry, the shaping session.\n\nRyan Singer (00:55:27):\nExactly. Having a narrowed down problem from the framing work, and this is a whole other topic of very often the PMs are sometimes just taking something at face value and not negotiating down to really narrow down what is this really, and where is the value in this? But let's suppose that that's happened, that we've narrowed down the problem, so now we've got a narrow problem. So now what we need to do is try out different ideas, and this is the real thing. We have to try to break them. So I want to draw an idea, and then I want the technical person to find, oh, this isn't going to... You know what I mean? This isn't going to work because of this reason. Or the product person is going to be looking in and saying, \"I get that that's really an easy way to do it technically, but I don't think that we're actually delivering the value if I play through the customer scenario here.\" You know what I mean?\n\n(00:56:24):\nSo there's these different angles where the idea can fail, and one of the things that we also coach people to do in a session is not just to go down one path and then be stuck in one idea and now you're going in circles around little details of one idea for three hours, but to really step back and say, \"Here's an approach. What if we had the scrolling agenda view, okay? And that's idea A. Then what's a very different way of doing this?\" Do you know what I mean? If we didn't want to have the agenda view there, is there a way to do this where it's just a month view? Let's see if we can draw that. So that's the thing that's happening. You asked about the time, and I started with people aren't used to just going all the way in to actually trying ideas.\n\n(00:57:16):\nSo there is a little bit of learning how to just face that blank page and start trying things together. What we find is that a three-hour session can be very, very productive to help you figure out what do we already have that are possible approaches to this? What are some major missing things? Like, okay, I've got the calendar dot grid, I've got the agenda idea, but what about multi-day events? Do you know what I mean? So there can be these things, these what abouts. So then maybe we break and we think for a little bit, and somebody sketches some ideas on that and does a spike or two on something, and we come back again for another three hours or we come back the next day. And what I would say is if the project that you're trying to do is doable with, let's say, your existing technology, you're not inventing a new algorithm, you're not inventing some new database or... You know what I mean?\n\n(00:58:25):\nYou're not doing a new AI model. It's more about how do I use the APIs and the frameworks and the tech stack that we have? How do I put that together to build something? Then if the problem is clear and the time is now, you will be able to come to a conclusion about what's possible to build in three sessions, something like that. The key thing is leaning into those sessions and really wrestling with each other. If you have just the product and the designer there and then it's like, well, we'll show this to the technical person later, then it can all blow up. And then you find out it's more complicated than you thought and you have to go back to the drawing board. We need to have all the necessary information in the same room for these sessions to go fast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:17):\nThere's so much genius built into this approach, and it sits on top of human nature. One is just, you need to actually spend... go into the deep edge cases and nuances and not just-\n\nRyan Singer (00:59:31):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:32):\nYeah, that's fine. Let's go with [inaudible 00:59:34].\n\nRyan Singer (00:59:33):\nMore concreteness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:34):\nVery concrete, very in depth, and then the appetites are... There's just so many elements of this that just connect with the way humans work versus the theory of just like, \"Yeah. Well, let's see how long this will take. It'll be a great... and we'll figure it out as we're building. We don't need to really figure this out. Yeah. We don't have time for that.\"\n\nRyan Singer (00:59:52):\nAnd we're solving a puzzle together, if it needs to be doable in this amount of time. But it also has to hit these points in terms of the problem we're solving. You know what I mean? It has to do these things, but in this time. One other thing that I would mention is that we can't be drawing Figma files. By the way, I'm being very mean to Figma so far in this conversation. There is a time when it's the right time for the Figma file. What we want to do is have that clarity around the... Let's say, we already know where the sink is going in the kitchen and now we can make final calls about the tile and the exact fixture-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:38):\nGrout color.\n\nRyan Singer (01:00:38):\n... and stuff like that. Right, grout color. We don't want to have to throw it all away every time something changes. So there's a time and a place where Figma is amazing and feels good and it's like, oh, now it's beautiful. Now, it's amazing. But in a shaping session, you can't collaborate on something so high fidelity. So we need also some ways to collaborate, and this is where you see these techniques in the book, like breadboarding and fat marker sketching. These are tools to help us express an idea very, very clearly in detail. We're going to hit this button and from this button, go to here. This calculation runs, then we get this answer, and then we have this choice to go here or here. That's the thing that we need to be seeing and that's the level of detail where we can move fast together but still see something real as more this breadboarding level.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:33):\nFat marker session is very evocative of what this whole session is about, is very high level sketches. That's a great term.\n\nRyan Singer (01:01:41):\nThe danger there that I often see is that what we don't want is to say, \"Oh, Figma isn't the right thing at this level. So instead, we're going to do fat marker sketches,\" and what you get is the equivalent of a blurry Figma. Do you know what I mean? Just less detailed. What we need from a fat marker sketch for it to be valuable to us as builders is it has to really communicate the idea. When I look at that, I'm like, \"Oh, now I get it?\" And if it's more this general wire frame of dashboard goes here and there's going to be four reports, and it's like I still don't know what to build, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):\nMm-hmm.\n\nRyan Singer (01:02:23):\nSo if it's not telling me what to build, so maybe this is a way to come back to your question about what's the output of the shaping session, it's like it's shaped if we can give this to a technical person and they say, \"Yeah, I know what to go build now.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:37):\nI'm very happy with our overview of the process. I think we've done a really good job giving people the gist. And obviously, if they want to actually implement it, they can get the book and dive in or work with you, which we'll point people to. Say someone's like, \"This is awesome. I want to do this.\" What would you say is a good first step for a team that's currently... let's say, they're in startup land, and they're just shipping every two weeks, maybe every week? So maybe for that bucket of folks and then also for a larger company, I don't know, Agile Scrum SAFe, and they're just like, \"Oh, let's try something different.\"\n\nRyan Singer (01:03:07):\nSometimes dev teams, they like the idea of not having the Scrum ritual, so they want to take in the six weeks, but unless the engineering and product come together to figure out how to collaboratively shape, like we talked about before, that time box isn't going to go well. So I-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:28):\nThey think they're going to not have to do standups, but now it's a day of hard thinking.\n\nRyan Singer (01:03:33):\nWell, it turns into even more meetings, because we don't know what to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:39):\nAnd the more meetings is just that shaping session specifically. Right?\n\nRyan Singer (01:03:44):\nNo, what I mean is that if we didn't-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:45):\nOh, right. I [inaudible 01:03:46] right.\n\nRyan Singer (01:03:46):\nIf we only adopted the six-week cycle and said we're going to figure it out and we didn't adopt the shaping, then we just don't know what to do. And then we reached the end, and we're basically scrambling to shape it as we go. And then we run out of time, and then we feel like this wasn't... It was nice to get a break from the Scrum rituals, but we can't say that we are knocking the champagne bottle on the boat because we're celebrating the launch or whatever, again and again. Right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):\nThat's a good, actually, time to maybe talk about there's obviously the spring kickoff in Scrum. What's main difference for people, because they may be thinking, \"Oh, this is just like a spring kickoff.\" That's-\n\nRyan Singer (01:04:22):\nOh, that's a good one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:23):\n... big deal.\n\nRyan Singer (01:04:24):\nThat's a good one. So what you often see in a Scrum team is that there's somebody who creates these tickets of these are the things that are going to happen inside of the sprint. Really, in my opinion, too many cases, it's not the person who's doing the building who's creating those tickets.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:45):\nSo your product owner.\n\nRyan Singer (01:04:46):\nSo there's a big, big gap there. We could talk a lot about that, but there's gaps in context. The person who's writing the ticket doesn't actually understand the work that's involved. You know what I mean? So there are so many unknowns and time bombs waiting in those tickets that sound reasonable, but they weren't really created by the person who understands the work that needs to happen. So the key difference is two things. So in Scrum, you have a person who's not the builders making tickets, and this is what in the cruel picture is the paper shredder. In the shape-up world, you have a single idea that was shaped. This is the thing we shaped with the two months in the agenda view and da da. Go make your own tasks, because you're the professionals. Do you know what I mean? So the contractors, if you're building a house, they have to know the plans, but you don't have to tell them, \"Now take the hammer and go over here.\"\n\n(01:05:52):\nThat's their, right? So in a shape-up world, a kickoff is, here's the well-shaped idea, and now this time box starts. At Basecamp, it was really, really loose because they are just stocked with senior people. They have so many very senior engineers and all the designers are coding. They're very technical, really, really skilled people. What I found is helpful when the team is a little bit more mixed, if they're not all super senior, is a simple exercise of at kickoff, take whatever was shaped and just draw a grid with nine boxes, and give me nine boxes of the nine major chunks that you think have to get implemented from an implementation standpoint. So translate this into nine major scopes of implementation that need to somehow happen over the time box. So really, really useful exercise to kick things off, and we have a lot of teams doing that now.\n\n(01:06:52):\nIf you take six weeks, that's 30 business days. You divide that by nine, it's four days per box. So you're going to get a lot of clarity from a quick exercise. And again, this is done by the builders. This is a really also good exercise for them to notice like, \"Oh, wait a minute, we think there's too much scope here. Even though it seemed reasonable, when we put it into nine boxes, it's like, I don't think we can do this all.\" Or it's also a good moment where somebody who's more junior might describe their implementation approach, and then someone who's senior can review that and say, \"Actually, we've done that before, and we'll run into this trouble if we don't use this other thing.\" So those really nice coaching moments can happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:39):\nIf you were to try this approach and have a shaping session, this is a sign you're heading in a good direction, is if the output, the team that's building it can come up with nine... Does it have to be nine? Is six cool, 10 cool?\n\nRyan Singer (01:07:55):\nWhat I found is if it's more than 10, then you just get into ticket land of, here's a million things I have to do. You know what I mean? If you have 100 things, that doesn't tell me anything. But if it has to be nine or less.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:10):\nNine or less. Okay. Okay, cool.\n\nRyan Singer (01:08:13):\nI actually think... I'm speculating here, but the UX designers in your audience will know about this rule of seven, plus or minus two. It's this cognitive science principle that was found about how many things someone can hold in their head at once. So this nine is the upper limit of seven plus or minus two, and it basically... It's like, do we actually have a picture of what it means to build this that we can also hold in our heads? Can we see the whole castle?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:41):\nSo what I'm hearing is if you're on a, say, Agile Scrum team today, if you want to start trying this out, it's schedule a shaping session, assume it's six weeks to start, try to come into it with a framing of here's the problem we're trying to solve. Is that a good way of thinking about it, like the problem we're trying to solve?\n\nRyan Singer (01:08:59):\nYeah, for sure. The question is what problem are we trying to solve, because the shaping work is more what are our options for the solution? And if the problem is too fuzzy and big, if the problem is just calendar, then the shaping is going to be this ever-expanding, never-ending thing, and we're not going to be able to get anywhere.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:16):\nYeah. Okay. So you spend three hours, maybe six hours in the first session. Would you recommend try to keep it to this many hours when you're first trying it up?\n\nRyan Singer (01:09:26):\nNo, I wouldn't do that. I think the key thing is actually if you get to the point where you're trying to hold a shaping session and you manage to get product and engineering into the same room to do it, you are far along. You're doing great if you're at that point. Oh, so much of the challenge is getting to the point of aligning between product and engineering that we cannot have projects that are dragging and dragging and dragging. We can't keep ending in a place where this is the end of a sprint or the end of a cycle and we still can't see the end of it, or we have to make so many cuts and compromises at the last minute that it's not the quality of... or it's not really matching what it was supposed to be in the first place. When those problems are happening or... Also by the way, this is surfacing at the exact level.\n\n(01:10:22):\nImagine, you're the CPO, you're the CTO, and you are supposed to be answering to, \"How's that work going?\"\n\n(01:10:30):\nAnd it's like, \"Well, actually, we're working on it. I can just think of a couple of times when I needed to go to Jason, and he expected me to be making progress on something and I had gotten nowhere on it. And that feeling when you are with top leadership in the room and you don't have a good answer for where you are on something is like... Oh, it's brutal, right? And then from the CEO's perspective, it's like, \"Where's the movement? We're running a business here. Really, nothing is shipping still?\"\n\n(01:11:03):\nThis can't just keep happening. So there's some recognition somewhere either at the higher levels or within the team of, we don't want to keep dragging, we don't want to keep being lost in the weeds, and then this can be the activation energy. You gather the power to be like, \"Okay, we actually want to try something different.\"\n\n(01:11:26):\nAnd in that case, what I would say is what usually works best is, okay, we're going to try a pilot project, and what we want to do is, as you said, choose a problem that's important enough to all of us that we think it's meaningful, it's going to be worth trying to do well. And it doesn't have to be six weeks. It could be something that is a little bit smaller, maybe you feel comfortable taking on three week thing for the first time. What's important is just matching these things together.\n\n(01:11:55):\nHere's a problem that we actually care about. It's timely, something that we would like to be shipped soon. It's not so small that we're not going to actually learn this new muscle, and it's big enough that it's going to feel like we really achieved something. So maybe that's going to be four weeks, maybe it's going to be six, maybe it's three, I don't know. And then getting to a place where we wrestle a bit with the problem to get the problem narrowed down. We get into our shaping session, and then we do our best. Do you know what I mean? And usually, what happens too is if we have an engineering team that's going to become free to do this work for those X number of weeks, that's the upper limit on how long we can spend to shape, and that's another real life thing, is sometimes we talk about if...\n\n(01:12:51):\nOn the one hand there's this universe of never ending documents back and forth to get feedback and comments, and then on the other hand there's like the team is going to be available. We're trying to actually do this, so actually, we've got a week to shape because engineering needs to kick off next week. Do you know what I mean? That's a little bit more the real scenario when you're actually in this aligned world of we want to ship something now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:16):\nYeah, real life constraints. That's a really helpful way of telling you how much time you have to do this. For people that are just like, \"I don't know, any friends that are using this. It's like weird, this way of working. It's not a thing I hear about all the time.\" What can you say to them to help them be like, \"Okay, I should actually give this a try. Here's how many people are using it. Here's impact that you've seen.\" Anything you can share that would help them get over that hump?\n\nRyan Singer (01:13:40):\nI would say wait until it hurts more. If the unfamiliarity is the big problem with it, then maybe the things are fine. Because it's not like this is the only way. It's more like, changing is really hard, and if there's a good reason to do it and it's like, look, we've done it the old way. We've tried different experiments. We've even already churned through a new head of product, or we've got a different CTO in and we're still having the same problems, then there comes a point where it's like, I know that this is uncomfortable, and I don't know somebody who's done it, but I think we need to try something different because we can't continue this way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:30):\nThat is a great answer. Following that same thread, just what are signs that it's time to try something? What sort of pain do you often see that's like, okay, you shouldn't look into this seriously?\n\nRyan Singer (01:14:44):\nThere are pains all along the journey. So I think the place where it's most obvious is at the end of the line when we thought we were going to be done and this thing is just dragging and dragging and dragging. The teams, we're not shipping things. We're running in place. We keep going in circles on this like we don't see the end. Of course, that's the culmination, but there's also a lot of pain points along the way.\n\n(01:15:11):\nSo if we go all the way upstream, if we go to the source of a project, sales talk to a customer... You know what I mean? Or sales talk to a lead, and they have this idea of this thing we need to build, or the CEO had this idea in the shower the other day, or the product team did a whole bunch of research and they have a big case for why this is the thing that's important to build next. Whatever it is, there's a source from the business perspective of this is the thing we should do next.\n\n(01:15:44):\nIf we just say dashboard and we don't negotiate what that means, if we just say calendar and we don't negotiate what that actually is, then what do we experience? This fuzzy thing where it's really hard to get to a conclusive answer about, yeah, that's what we need to go do. It's like the ever expanding blob. So if you've felt that before, that's already a first pain. And then of course, where does it go from there? So we say calendar, so we don't know what it means, but we say calendar, so now we give it to product and we've either got a whole bunch of Figma files or we have the PRD with a million requirements about what a great calendar is. Of course, I don't want to be cruel to the people who are putting their hearts into that work, because the Figma file is beautiful. It's just coming a little early. And the PRD is full of a lot of true things that are probably really important for decision-making in the project, but the way that it's packaged at that moment isn't something that gets absorbed. You write this document and I'm sorry, who actually reads it? You know what I mean? I know it's painful, but it's like that. And then even when we try to read it, because it wasn't shaped and we didn't get down to it's this, it's that, it's that, and that's how it works, it's hard to walk away from reading that and have anything that's in your head as, this is what we're going to go build. It's like a million puzzle pieces that you're going to have to solve. So what we see is either there's the Figma file and then there's the pushback from engineers. There's the PRD, but then it's like, okay, but we still don't actually know what to build.\n\n(01:17:40):\nThere's all those things where, instead of moving forward, there's more and more questions, more and more pushback, more and more going back to the drawing board. So that's another big indicator that something is going wrong. And then when we're in the building and we thought we knew what we agreed to, we thought we all said, \"Yeah, this is what we want to go make,\" and it's just more and more questions coming out. More and more unexpected complexity, things that we didn't anticipate, and it just doesn't feel like we're getting warmer and coming closer. It just feels like it's getting harder and harder. Those are all the signs that whatever process you use, that there's a lack of clear shaping and there's a lack of clear framing because there's a lack of clarity around what it is that we're doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:26):\nBefore we started recording, you made this interesting point that there's always talk of feature factories and that rarely are they actually efficient factories. They don't actually work. Talk about that.\n\nRyan Singer (01:18:38):\nYeah. Well, I understand what the feature factory critique is supposed to be. It's actually to the framing point of we're not negotiating the value and the outcome we're trying to get from something. We're just taking it and building it. And then of course, in the end, according to the feature factory critique, we just built it because somebody said we should build it, and then people didn't use it and didn't value it, and the product is just getting bloated. The thing is that, I would say if you have a feature factory, meaning you're continually cranking out features, you're probably quite healthy. All you need to do is feed a different input to the beginning of the factory.\n\n(01:19:18):\nWhat most teams are struggling with is that they don't have predictable repeatable shipping of things. At least from my experience, the bigger really widespread struggle is, stuff isn't moving, it's dragging. I can't see the end. I'm losing my... I'm feeling burned out. You know what I mean? It's not exciting to work on this anymore, all that a thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):\nMaybe last question here is what's the sweet spot stage for a company to start using Shape Up? You basically worked in this way from the very beginning when it was just three people. What do you find... Should startups that are just starting out start working in this way, or do you find it's more useful later on?\n\nRyan Singer (01:19:58):\nWe didn't formalize it until we had to, and there was a long time where there wasn't a fixed length for projects. There was just an understanding of the urgency and a feeling of what too long felt like. And it didn't actually click into, oh, this is a cycle length and this is six weeks, and then we pause, and this is who comes together to make the decision of what's the next project, and here's who is mainly doing the shape. You know what I mean? All that stuff didn't get solved until we had reached a certain size. Usually, the main tipping point if we start from smaller to big is there's a phase when the founders are still involved in everything, and so it doesn't matter what your process is, it's going to be fine.\n\n(01:20:40):\nBut then you start to hire the first other people and then for the first time you try to delegate some of those things and the founders try to be less involved, and that's often where a lot of these problems start to appear. And the founders start to ask themselves like, \"We used to be fast, and now we hired people because we needed to scale, but now we're slow. So how do we be fast again? Because we know what-\n\nRyan Singer (01:21:00):\n... well. So like, \"How will we be fast again?\" Because we know what it's like. If we just got back in there as founders and got our hands dirty, like we could make this go. But how do I get the people that we've brought in to make these trade-offs and make these decisions and how do I get the work to flow again? So that's something that we definitely see there. So that's a really good moment. I'm onboarding new people. I don't know what to tell them how to work. I don't want to introduce a bunch of scrum rituals. Just winging it on Kanban isn't working, because they don't have enough clarity around what to go after. So I have to babysit them all the time. You know what I mean? Like these kinds of things.\n\n(01:21:40):\nThere is another extreme, which is I... We've already gone past that. We've been scrum or whatever for years. The company has been growing, like revenue is coming in, like sales is doing their job, like things are running. But man, nothing is getting out the door. And we're years in and we have an entrenched development. We have like an entrenched engineering team, which is a wall away from an entrenched product team and everybody's apart. And this thing is like, we're like stuck.\n\n(01:22:19):\nAnd that is more where there's going to be some tensions that are starting to appear at the executive level. There's going to be some finger pointing. There's going to be some like, \"Why isn't this moving? Why isn't this happening? How can we be spending so much money in all these engineers and we don't have anything to show for it?\" And that's a point where there can be kind of a... Some hard conversations need to start happening about, \"How do we actually start to negotiate around how we spend time?\" And we can't just have endless refactorings and infrastructure projects, but we need to be actually building things that we can sell again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:54):\nWhat an idea.\n\nRyan Singer (01:22:56):\nYeah. You know? But it can... There are a lot of engineering orgs that have been standing around for a while and it's all refactoring all day and tech debt and stuff like that. And there's reasons why all those things got there, but there comes a point where we have to figure out how to cut through it and make some hard choices so that we can carve out time to build the stuff that's actually going to be needle moving again and not just sustaining us where we are to run in place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:24):\nI imagine this latter bucket is who you mostly work with, the kind of companies that bring you in.\n\nRyan Singer (01:23:33):\nIt's been a lot of the folks who still remember what it was like to be fast and they're kind of newly too big and they don't like being slow. I've had a lot of that. I think that your intuition is right. That the market for the last category is the biggest, but it's hard to reach them. It's not easy to talk about these things. These are sensitive topics. Do you know what I mean? Like, \"Our engineering team isn't shipping,\" and it's happening at leadership level. There's a ton of complaints happening deeper in the org, but nobody down in the org can change anything. At the end of the day, it's actually the interface at the executive level of being able to say, \"How are we using our time? We have to change something.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:19):\nTo make it even more concrete in that first bucket, what's the size of org that you find is most in need of this? It's like, \"How many engineers?\" Or is it like when they hire the first PM? Like what's kind of the-\n\nRyan Singer (01:24:29):\nI sometimes have the like, \"How the heck do I hire the first PM and what do they do?\" conversation. But usually, it's later than that. It's after they hired the first PM, after they hired the second PM, and maybe even the third. And they're getting to the... Product and engineering together are like 30, 50 people and it's like, \"We thought we put everybody in the right roles. We kind of did what we were supposed to do and everything is just grinding. And why are we so slow?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:57):\nPerfect. So 30 to 50-ish people seems like a good time to... Basically, you're finding that's when things start to really break down.\n\nRyan Singer (01:25:05):\nThat's when they show themselves and I think... I mean, if someone hears this and it all starts to make sense and they're earlier in that wave, then of course the earlier that you can anticipate it, the better, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:16):\nYeah. That's a good point.\n\nRyan Singer (01:25:16):\nSo if you're-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:17):\nWhen it's too late is when they come out so-\n\nRyan Singer (01:25:19):\nI mainly hear about it when it's too late. That's why they're reaching out-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:22):\nGot it. So maybe closer to 30. Okay.\n\nRyan Singer (01:25:26):\nHonestly, I think it starts the first project where, for example, the founding engineer is hands off and then the new hire is taking over responsibility. Or the person who was like sort of founder/CEO is first giving it to a PM to kind of thinking they're going to carry it through. And then, it's not exactly meeting their expectations of what they thought was going to happen. I think that's when those disconnects actually start. It's the first step away from the work where the seeds of all of these problems actually start.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:00):\nI want to talk about Basecamp and how maybe not every company can operate like Basecamp. Before we get there, is there anything else along the lines of Shape Up that you want to add or share?\n\nRyan Singer (01:26:10):\nYeah. There's one key thing, which is the role of the PM. I think what we see today, out of necessity in a lot of teams, is that the PMs spend a lot of time chasing around inside of the build phase, inside the time box, to try and make sure that people aren't stuck and getting lost in the weeds and try and keep things moving. And it can sometimes be too close to project management rather than product management.\n\n(01:26:43):\nAnd what we see in Shape Up teams when they hit their stride is that the PM moves upstream. So the PM is less busy with, \"How do I get this project to not be in a bad state when it's getting built?\" And they're way more in, \"How do I understand the business context? How do I narrow down the problem? How do I negotiate back and forth with maybe the CPO who brought this to me to understand where the core of it is?\" That really getting the deeper understanding of the business and the problem and the customer domain and like what problem is worth solving and what's even slice of that problem is the valuable slice to argue that we should spend a few weeks on. That's the place where the PMs can really contribute a lot in the Shape Up world. That's kind of what they do, rather than shepherding the process or being a ritual master or something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:42):\nThat sounds pretty wonderful. I've been doing some thinking about what an AI-oriented world does to the role of PM and it feels like very similar to that actually, where the building now is going to happen for you with AI tooling. And that means the bigger question now is like, \"What the hell should I build? And is the thing I've built right and correct and likely to work?\" And it feels like this is similar, it's like the PM spending a lot more time upfront thinking through what to build. And then, the building is a lot more hands off. So hands off it gets done in like five minutes when you're just like, \"Well, build this thing for me.\" \"There it is.\"\n\nRyan Singer (01:28:19):\nYeah. Let's see. Let's see. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:21):\nLet's see.\n\nRyan Singer (01:28:22):\nI'm also very curious. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:25):\nOh, man. What a wild time. Okay. Let's talk about Basecamp. I think we talked about this ahead of the podcast that... You want people to know that Basecamp is very unique and not everyone can work the way Basecamp works. Just talk about your insight there and your advice there when people see all this advice coming out of Basecamp.\n\nRyan Singer (01:28:45):\nI got to tell you, I had no idea how unique we were until I was outside and there are so many things. For example, it's a lot of the things that people ask me about that are not in the book that started to reveal those things to me. That's so many things that I was just taking for granted. I mean, every designer codes.\n\n(01:29:05):\nImagine, if every designer codes and I don't just mean HTML. I mean, like running the app locally, going in to the place where that view is rendered to make that thing look the way that they want it to look or whatever, right? I mean, like really codes, every designer. So every designer codes, where's the wall between design and engineering? Where is the moment where you arrive with the Figma file and then the disappointment and all of your hopes get destroyed because the engineer is telling you no, right? Like those moments don't even exist in that world.\n\n(01:29:42):\nAnd then, also, I think also there was this lack of distance between sort of the business objective, the thing that we're trying to... The reason we want to maybe do this project and the blessing of the founders and the... Like, there wasn't this kind of executives far away with some big targets and then some layer of PM and then some building. I mean, the founders were always there, right there in the problem definition still.\n\n(01:30:14):\nI mean, I can't say today, but I mean up until 2021 when I was still there. So it meant that there was so much clarity all the time around what we're solving and why and why we're making time for it. And then, of course, on the engineering side as well. I mean, imagine, you have no sales org, you have no marketing. That all of selling and marketing is happening by the unicorn founders. So it means that there isn't contention for engineering time, that there isn't like all these different sources of requests that you have to wrestle with,\n\n(01:30:50):\nAnd David did such an extraordinary job of... I mean, the more I see the real world, the more I'm amazed at how every six weeks, there was clear runway in engineering of like, \"We have time for whatever the... Whatever we'd agreed together is the most important thing.\" Just blank check like six weeks at a time. Not a blank check, but you know what I mean? Like a blank six weeks, yeah?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:15):\nYeah.\n\nRyan Singer (01:31:16):\nAgain and again and again, years without end. Keeping that engineering capacity focused on readiness for product and totally leaning into what's exciting to do to build for the product. And not getting lost in all this refactoring and new infrastructure and technical debt and stuff like that. I mean, those are amazing. So those are some really big differences. And it doesn't mean that you have to be Basecamp to do Shape Up. But what it does mean is that when we say, \"Oh, just have a shaping session and if you have the pressure of the time box, then you can make trade-offs together.\" It's like, \"Well, if we are used to having a big wall between, for example, engineering and design, then we're going to have to learn...\" Somebody who wants to start shaping is going to have to learn like, \"Well, oh, I need to figure out who to bring together and how to have that session and how do we interact with each other. So that we are combining all of that knowledge that maybe at Basecamp was all in the same head in a lot of cases.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:18):\nThis is such an important point for people to hear, because there's so many people that come on podcasts like this and share, \"Here's how to do it,\" based on their experience. And there's so many just assumptions about their resources, the people they hire, the way the founders operate. Like no sales team, I think that's like... I don't even think about that.\n\nRyan Singer (01:32:36):\nYeah. Imagine, no such thing as a request from sales, yeah? No such thing as pressure of like, \"We need this thing in order to upsell or to close this deal.\" Never.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:47):\nIt sounds like you're in this Basecamp... By the way, was it called 37signals? Like it's interesting you call it Basecamp not 37signal.\n\nRyan Singer (01:32:54):\nYeah. I mean, so it's just like the timing of when I left. We were originally 37signals and then Basecamp became so big that we renamed ourselves to Basecamp.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:03):\nI didn't know that.\n\nRyan Singer (01:33:04):\nYeah. And then, so for example, on the book, it says Shape Up and there's a Basecamp logo on the bottom, not a 37signals logo. But then, since I went back, so it's 37signals again. So I sometimes struggle with I don't know what to call it but it's both. Whatever people can recognize, it's the same powerhouse.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:24):\nOkay. Cool. I'm glad I'm not the only one that's confused. But 37signal is the current name. Great.\n\nRyan Singer (01:33:29):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:30):\nSo you said that it felt like you left and it was like this bubble you got out of. Was there like a moment where you're like, \"You wrote this book. Everyone...\" You're like, \"Hey, this is how you should work,\" and then you're like, \"Oh, wait. This doesn't actually work in real life for a lot of people.\"? Is there a moment there?\n\nRyan Singer (01:33:44):\nIt wasn't that this doesn't work, I was just in a foreign country. It was like we tried it and it didn't work. One of the common things I would hear is the projects kept running over. \"We weren't finishing them at the end of the cycle. They kept running over and running over.\" And then, I would be like, \"Huh. So can you show me your shaping work?\" And then, they would show me a PRD and I'd be like, \"That doesn't look like what's in the book.\" And again like, \"Can you show me your shaping work?\" And they'd show me like a bunch of Figma files.\n\n(01:34:21):\nAnd then, what I started to understand was like we have some people in a role who were used to making a certain artifact at a certain step and they just kept doing that. And I didn't appreciate... It took me a while to realize like, \"There's no engineer in the picture here.\" And it was when we started to actually do the course, I said... Well, I did actually a couple projects where I helped teams hands-on and I learned that they...\n\n(01:34:50):\nIt was the first actually consulting project that I did where I helped a team who was stuck. And what we did was we chose the engineer who was best suited to come over to product and be there in the shaping. And that was the moment when it was like, \"Ah. Now, I'm in the world I know again,\" when we had all of that mixed in the same room again. And so, that was kind of like... That was really something... I mean, it was a total learning curve for me and there's a lot of things like that. But that was, for example, a really big one. It's like, \"Oh, we have to get engineering in there.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:24):\nYou're the type of guest I most love having on this podcast, because you basically work with many, many companies, study what's working, what's not. You're not in the clouds pontificating about something. You're working with teams to make things better. And then, you take all of that learning, put it into a book, and share with us all. And so, the ROI is just incredible for us all because you've spent so much time doing this and you've actually done the work. You're not just in theory about it. So this is amazing. But we're not done yet. One question I wanted to ask is, Jason was tweeting that there's... He's working on a follow-up Shape Up book. What's happening there? Are you involved in that? What's the story?\n\nRyan Singer (01:36:06):\nSo I also saw the tweet. And I have to admit, I was a little surprised when I saw this tweet, but I had had a conversation with Jason a year earlier. And he reached out and he said, \"Hey, we're thinking about doing a second edition of the book.\" And my first reaction... Imagine, I was actually really in the middle of learning all these things that teams need to learn in order to catch up to what was natural for Basecamp to do. And so, for me, it was like, \"Interesting. I have a lot of new things. I have a lot of new ideas. Maybe collaborating on the second edition could make sense.\"\n\n(01:36:46):\nBut what I understood was that what he wanted to do was to make an updated version of how they work, because that's always been a big thing of how... I should use the right name, 37signals, of how they market and also how they lead is they like to really show a clear example. Not like, \"This is how you could do it. This is how some people do it,\" but like, \"This is how we do it.\"\n\n(01:37:09):\nAnd I think it's their strength that they are very, very clear like, \"This is how we do it and take it or leave it.\" What I understood was that if I did another version of the book that was just how Basecamp does it, I think it would leave so much opportunity on the table. Like there's so many people where what they need to learn is more like, \"How can it come closer to where I am? If I have the wall today between product and engineering, how do I bring the right people together into a shaping session? How do we actually do that? How do I overcome all of these little challenges because this is so far from our current way of working?\"\n\n(01:37:44):\nSo the work that I'm doing with, for example, with shaping in real life is all about those gaps. And then, I don't know what's going to be in the second edition because they are... I guess someone there is going to be working on that. But what I'm guessing is it's going to be an update on kind of, \"Up on top of the mountain over here, this is what Basecamp is doing.\" So hopefully, it'll be a cool thing to look at as like, \"Here's a model of what they're doing.\" And then the question is, \"What can I take from that and what do I need in order to actually be able to make it work in the real situation I'm in?\" And that's kind of where... Well, that's my focus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:20):\nThis is so interesting. Thank you for sharing. It sounds like a fork. You forked it and these are going potentially in different directions but inspired by each other.\n\nRyan Singer (01:38:29):\nMm-hmm. Totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:30):\nSo interesting. Ryan, is there anything else that you want to share before we wrap up?\n\nRyan Singer (01:38:37):\nOne thing I could throw out there is sometimes people reach out to me because their projects aren't shipping, there's a lot of struggle, there's a lot of lack of clarity. But the root cause is actually that the input at the very beginning of the process is too unclear or... Like we don't actually know what's important to customers or we're not actually sure where the value is or this kind of a thing. So there is this link, this framing step that we talked about of, \"What is really the problem?\", before we go into shaping.\n\n(01:39:11):\nThis is the link to product strategy also. And this is the place where it can be really useful to reach for a lot of, for example, Bob Moesta stuff with the Jobs-to-be-Done and the demand-side work, trying to get clear about big... So that's the tool that I reach for at that phase. And you can think of kind of this... Before the problem definition, there's this question of like, \"What's the demand? Where are people struggling? Where is really the place, the itch they're trying to scratch?\n\n(01:39:42):\nAnd then, a lot of the Shape Up stuff is kind of when I have something where I think there's an opportunity or I think there's something meaningful there because of what we learned from customers or the job to be done, research, or whatever it was. Now, how do I turn that into something that we can actually go do and ship in a reasonable amount of time? That's the supply side. That's where the Shape Up part fits in. So maybe it just might be cool for people to see a link there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:06):\nThat's a great plug for a Bob Moesta episode. We talked in-depth about the Jobs-to-be-Done framework and how to actually apply it. What's the book you'd recommend there? It sounds like basically it's like Shape Up plus this book gives you a lot.\n\nRyan Singer (01:40:19):\nActually, the one that I recommend the most is Demand-Side Sales 101 and it's funny because it's like sales. Especially for a product person, you're like, \"I'm the product person, not the sales person.\" But it's such a good dive into, \"What are people really trying to solve?\" And getting into that mindset of, \"What's the struggle? What's the problem?\" I think that's a really good entry point for that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:43):\nYeah. I don't love that title. I feel like you could have done better there with that book's title because-\n\nRyan Singer (01:40:48):\nIt's-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:49):\nYeah.\n\nRyan Singer (01:40:50):\nWhat's interesting about it is that it's very, very pointy for like if you are trying to make progress on sales, then it's this other kind of sales, this demand side sales. So I think maybe it's more for us who are kind of using it for different purposes. Like we're the product people trying to pull something out of it. That it's a little bit less aligned, but it's still useful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:11):\nYeah. But basically it's like the Jobs-to-be-Done book is what-\n\nRyan Singer (01:41:15):\nYeah. It's kind of like the Jobs-to-be-Done book that's a bit more tactical. If you're really curious about the general spirit of Jobs-to-be-Done, then Competing Against Luck is a really good intro. That's the one that Clay Christensen wrote with a lot of... I think there's a lot of stuff that Bob worked on that's in there. But for a little bit more tactical like, \"What's it look like to do the interview? And how to think about the struggling moment?\" and stuff like that, this Demand-Side Sales is good for this strategy stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:44):\nAwesome. And we'll also link to this episode where you could get the gist of it in one hour's time.\n\nRyan Singer (01:41:48):\nOh, that's right. You did... That episode was great by the way. That's... Yeah-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:52):\nThanks, Ryan. Thanks, Ryan. Okay. We did it. This was amazing. I think this is going to help so many people-\n\nRyan Singer (01:41:58):\nWe got through it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:58):\nWe're not done yet. Two final questions for you. Where can folks find the book, find you if they want to work with you? Anything else that you want to share? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nRyan Singer (01:42:08):\nWell, they can find me at my website. That's ryansinger.co. I'm also on X on RJS. I'm on LinkedIn. So just reach me there. And how can people be useful to me? I love hearing from people who are having these problems. If you're having these problems where it's like, \"Things are dragging,\" or, \"We can't see the end and we're not getting the quality we need,\" and all this stuff like man. I mean, this is how I learned all this stuff is by talking to people who are in it. So even if it's not clear what's the next step yet. If that problem is real, it would be cool to hear about it. I'd love to chat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:46):\nBe careful what you wish for about Moesta. He was just on the podcast and he told me he's got over a hundred LinkedIn DMs with people sharing their struggles with their job search. So here you go.\n\nRyan Singer (01:42:57):\nOh, yeah. Job moves, that's a big one. I think that's a broad appeal. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:01):\nYeah. That's true. I'm going to ask you to explain that when you do consulting work, just like how does that work? Who's that for? Just because I know that's something else you do.\n\nRyan Singer (01:43:10):\nSo it basically starts with uh, either often first CPO or CTO often reaches out first. And when it works well is when we actually get them together and then they understand that they need to change something or we have like a head of product and a head of engineering, that kind of a thing. If those two are both seeing eye to eye that there's a problem, then we can start a conversation around, \"Okay. So who would be the right people for a pilot team? What are the things that are going on business-wise that could be a good pilot project?\"\n\n(01:43:41):\nAnd then, I can help to figure out like, \"How do we actually...\" So almost like guiding through, like narrowing down that pilot project framing so that they have the support that it's going to be successful in shaping. And then, coaching the team so that they actually learn those shaping skills so that they can get through a session and come out with much more clarity. Like how do they actually run those sessions.\n\n(01:44:03):\nSo it's kind of first working with leadership, \"Who do we need to get to do this work? Who are the right people? How do we bring them into a pilot project?\" Narrowing down, doing some framing work on the pilot, so it's going to be clearer in the shaping. And then, giving some guidance on how to get through that shaping with some feedback rounds. This is usually a good approach.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:22):\nAmazing. And they can find this on your website if they want to explore this?\n\nRyan Singer (01:44:24):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:26):\nAmazing. Ryan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nRyan Singer (01:44:29):\nYeah. Thanks a lot. You had amazing questions. It's a subject that can go in so many directions and you kept bringing us onto some kind of a main track, so I'm really pleased. It was really nice. Thanks a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:39):\nI do my best.\n\nRyan Singer (01:44:39):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:40):\nThanks, Ryan, and bye, everyone.\n\n(01:44:45):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "title": "Building Substack | Sachin Monga (Substack, Facebook)",
  "transcript": "# Building Substack | Sachin Monga (Substack, Facebook)\n\n## Transcript\n\nSachin Monga (00:00:00):\nI really think that we're just starting into this golden era of what it might mean to be a writer on the internet. The economic model for supporting great writing on the internet has been generally pretty terrible for the entirety of the internet's history. In the early days of Substack, there's a couple of these glimmers of hope where you'd have people like Matt Taibbi or Bill Bishop, some of the early writers on Substack that were really well established writers who were clearly just being undervalued and now could come to Substack and see their true value.\n\nSachin Monga (00:00:33):\nAnd that was awesome. That was really cool to see. But in the last year or so, even in the last few months, I think there's been so many really interesting success stories now from writers who might not even consider themselves writers. People who are able to make a living, maybe even make a fortune just doing great work and not needing to have millions and millions of viewers or play the attention games of other networks, but just do really high quality work and have a relatively small number of people value it highly enough to pay for it.\n\nLenny (00:01:07):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Sachin Monga, who is currently the head of product at Substack. Before Substack, he had a startup called Cocoon that he sold to Substack. And before that, he spent over seven years at Facebook working on the video and camera products, building out the developer platform, and leading the ads growth team. In our conversation, we dig into all things Substack, what it's like to build product at Substack, how different it is to work at a startup versus a big company like Facebook, the future of the Substack product.\n\nLenny (00:01:42):\nWe also spent a lot of time on what I venture to say will go down in history as one of the most legendary growth features ever created, the Substack recommendations feature. Substack as a product and a company has changed my life and allowed me to do the work that I do now, and it was such a treat to be able to chat with Sachin. I hope that you find this conversation as interesting as I did. With that, I bring you Sachin Monga. Who has an opinion on internal tools? Internal tools are something you probably don't think about until you have to, or it probably didn't even occur to you to think about them.\n\nLenny (00:02:18):\nBut if you work at a big company, you probably have a bunch of one-off custom apps or dashboards that are laser focused on just one job to be done for one specific team or just one role, and they're always such a huge pain to build and maintain. And that's why I'm such a big fan of Retool and why I think Retool is so popular. Retool allows teams as small as just one person to build a suite of custom internal apps in a fraction of the time that you think it takes. The productivity gains of custom apps is now within reach, not just for large enterprises but for small teams as well. And as you scale, your company Retool scales with you.\n\nLenny (00:02:54):\nSnowflake saves about 26 hours a week of manual spreadsheet work with custom internal apps built on Retool. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. Thousands of teams at companies like Coinbase, DoorDash, and NBC collaborate around custom-built Retool apps to operate with greater efficiency. Maybe you've thought about using Retool before, but just haven't and I'm here to tell you that now teams of up to five can build unlimited Retool apps for free. Get started today at Retool.com/lenny. Do you want to reduce friction in your onboarding flow? Then let me tell you about Stytch, and that's Stytch with a Y.\n\nLenny (00:03:34):\nStytch is on a mission to eliminate friction from the internet. There's starting by making user authentication and onboarding more seamless and more secure. They offer super flexible out-of-the-box authentication solutions for companies of all sizes. From email magic links to SMS passcodes, one tap social logins to even biometrics, Stytch is your all-in-one platform for authentication. Stytch customers have been able to increase conversion by over 60% after spending just one day integrating. And with their API and SDKs, you can improve user conversion and retention and security all while saving valuable engineering time.\n\nLenny (00:04:13):\nYour engineers will come and thank you for using Stytch, because Stytch keeps you from having to build authentication in house and the integration process is super fast and super smooth. To get $1,000 in free credits, just go to Stytch.com/lenny to sign up, and that's Stytch with a Y. Sachin, welcome to the podcast.\n\nSachin Monga (00:04:36):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:37):\nI'm actually really excited to have you on. I've told you this before, I've told the founders before, Substack has changed my life in so many ways. There's no way that I would be doing what I'm doing now if not for Substack and just like the magical combination of features that you all built. I'm also just really curious about how you all build the platform, where it's going, how it all works behind the scenes. Again, thank you for being here.\n\nSachin Monga (00:05:01):\nI'm so happy to be here, and that's so great to hear.\n\nLenny (00:05:03):\nJust to set a little context for folks, can you just talk about how you got to Substack? You're currently head of product at Substack. What was that journey to Substack?\n\nSachin Monga (00:05:12):\nI joined Substack around a year ago now exactly through an acquisition. I'd started a company called Cocoon about three years prior to that with my good friend Alex Cornell. Cocoon is not like Substack. It was essentially a little photo sharing app for close friends and family, but there is a common thread which led us to Substack, which was prior to starting Cocoon, Alex and I had both worked at Facebook for a number of years and had worked on effectively the same problem of helping people share more with their friends and family and had all these ideas for what an idealized experience might look like.We just kept running into the wall that you run into when ultimately advertising is the business model that is powering this whole thing, and what that means is you need to accumulate a lot of time spent and attention and convert that into basically sellable eyeballs. But it's not that hard to imagine what a better solution would be. It's just that ads as the business model made it really hard to pull that off. Cocoon was in a lot of ways like a journey to explore what that might look like for this one particular use case of just helping you feel close to a handful of people.\n\nSachin Monga (00:06:14):\nWe always looked up to Substack as a really good example of basically that same principle, which is if you imagine rewiring the internet around paid subscriptions, direct subscriptions between, in Substack's case, readers and writers, what could that unlock and could it unlock a clearly better user experience? We looked at Substack as a real inspiration and an example of that really working out and got to know the founders pretty well and had a few conversations and realized that even though the blogging software and the photo sharing app are pretty different, our underlying motivations were really consistent.\n\nSachin Monga (00:06:46):\nIt was a bit of a match made in heaven and the whole team joined Substack a year ago. I've been privileged enough to get to lead the product and design teams, and it's been a blast so far.\n\nLenny (00:06:57):\nBefore your startup, you're at Facebook for a number of years, is that right?\n\nSachin Monga (00:07:00):\nYes. I started in 2011 there on the growth team and had the chance to work on a bunch of different teams there, growth, platform, ads, and then eventually the team we called Sharing, which was helping people share more in the main Facebook app.\n\nLenny (00:07:12):\nSweet. I want to spend a little time on that, but coming back to Substack, I'm curious just how the product team runs. How many PMs do y'all have? How is it structured? How are you thinking it'll evolve as you scale? What can you share there?\n\nSachin Monga (00:07:25):\nSure. Maybe to start from when I started at Substack, we had zero PMs. We had a handful of designers. We had maybe 15 or so engineers. I think we're coming to the close of this kind of one-time inflection point of becoming a product driven company and having a product process and structure and PMs and full stack product teams. When I started at Substack, there was really not much of this. We're still pretty early, but we have something going now.\n\nSachin Monga (00:07:51):\nWe have four product managers in addition to myself, and we have three essentially kind of full stack product teams now that have a PM and an engineering manager, a data person or a designer, engineers and things are starting to roll. We're finally emerging from this transition phase and it's been super fun.\n\nLenny (00:08:10):\nWhat are these three teams?\n\nSachin Monga (00:08:11):\nThe three teams are: we have a writer team that serves writers, we have a reader team that serves readers, and we have a growth team that does growthy things. I should mention, we have a fourth engineering team that's like the systems team that doesn't have a product manager on it, but is keeping the lights on and helping us scale.\n\nLenny (00:08:28):\nAwesome. That makes sense. You currently align it around the type of user plus the platform stuff. Do you have a sense of where this might evolve over the next few years just structure wise? Do you think it'll stick to that? Do you have a plan of how this might radically shift as you grow?\n\nSachin Monga (00:08:43):\nYeah. I'm actually kind of shocked that it's lasted this long and stayed consistent. I remember at Facebook, we would change our team structure what felt like every three months or six months and just have a reorg every once in a while. Part of why I think it's remained pretty consistent is exactly what you mentioned, which is the teams aren't oriented around product surfaces. We don't have a team that's like the app team or a team that's like the dashboard team or the podcasting team. We have teams that are oriented around customers and solving bit of a timeless customer problem. We'll never be done serving writers.\n\nSachin Monga (00:09:16):\nWe just started honestly having a concerted focus on serving readers. Growth is never a problem that you check the box off on. I hope that we are able to maintain this general structure. I think as Substack grows and expands, I'm sure we'll have more than three teams. This is where we're at right now, but I really like the focus on a customer and a timeless mission really rather than orienting around what might be a bit more of an ephemeral surface area or product de jour.\n\nLenny (00:09:46):\nAwesome. Shout out to the writer team. Thanks for building all the awesome stuff that I get to use. It makes sense why you are more recently investing in the reader team because Substack has this magical advantage platforms have where your supply drives all your demand. I go out and promote my newsletter, people sign up for Substack. It makes sense why there's not initially a huge focus on the demand growth, but makes sense to get there. It sounds like your app is awesome.\n\nLenny (00:10:11):\nOne thing I wanted to touch on is you're kind of in this interesting position as a head of product at a small-ish company with a founder who's very product sense strong, and that's a classic challenge for a product leader to be in, where it's a smallish company, either a first PM or even a head of product, where the founder's very opinionated about the product. I'm curious what you've learned about how to work in that environment as a PM.\n\nSachin Monga (00:10:36):\nThat's a great question. I don't know if I have the recipe for this, but I can just maybe share a few of the things that come to mind. I think the first thing was really treating my role in the beginning more as a facilitator than a decision maker when it comes to product. I think the team was also small enough that everyone in theory could have a good sense of what everyone else was up to. A specific problem we had I think when I joined was that we were just getting to the point where we wouldn't have one weekly meeting where Chris could be in the room, Chris is the CEO of Substack and the person you're mentioning, and decide what we're doing in the next two weeks.\n\nSachin Monga (00:11:13):\nWe were just emerging from that phase. We had this problem which was all of a sudden, Chris didn't really know what all the teams were doing and the teams didn't really know what Chris had in mind for what they should do and what the vision was. We were hiring really quickly and hiring people who might not have all of the context of being in the room with him for years and being in all of the all-hands meetings. When I first joined, I felt like my main role was actually just solving that. And if nothing else, if Chris could have a really good sense of what all the teams are doing and if the teams knew where he was coming from and could start to get better at modeling him and his vision, that would be a win.\n\nSachin Monga (00:11:43):\nFor the first couple months I'd say, that was all I tried to do. I think now Chris and I have some reps under our belt and the teams have some reps under their belts too, and that trust just starts to form. We start the week, Chris and I, we sit down for an hour. We go through what do we feel like are the big problems to focus on this week, what are the things we're worried about. We sit down at the end of the week and we check in again. There's just a lot of open communication. I think that helps a lot.\n\nLenny (00:12:07):\nGot it. It sounds like the core of this is building trust, which makes sense. The way that you've been building trust, one is just do it again and again and then Chris starts to trust, \"Okay, Sachin's going to do the things that I think are probably the right things.\" And then you said you have this weekly meeting. Is there anything else that either tactically you find as a really important component of this relationship or any other lessons you've learned about just how to keep this relationship healthy and constructive?\n\nSachin Monga (00:12:34):\nOne thing that I think about a little bit because like any startup, there's going to be times that are really difficult, times that are really fun. Substack is certainly going through this really transformative time, but we're really evolving in a lot of ways from a tool into a network. We're in the thick of seeing this vision through in a lot of ways Chris has had in his mind for five years. We did a thing at an all-hands a little while ago where Substack went through Y Combinator I think it was maybe now six years ago and we watched the 60 second demo they pitched from 2017.\n\nSachin Monga (00:13:04):\nWhat was so cool about that was we're actually doing all those things now that Chris got up on stage and talked about like, \"One day in the future, Substack is going to get into podcasting, and we're going to have this network effect that helps writers grow by virtue of there being other writers in the platform.\" There's all these things that we kind of couldn't do until we earned our place at the table and the right to be able to do those things that we're doing now. To go back to your question, I think a thing that I really try to be mindful of right now is, how do I catch up?\n\nSachin Monga (00:13:35):\nChris has been thinking about this problem for five times as long as I have. If I can get a good sense of where his vision starts from and catch up those few years and help the teams do the same, that'll go a long way. Because at the same time, everyone now is coming at it from a different perspective. We've a lot more data and evidence. It's really good to have people on the team that have come from other companies and comply that perspective. It's a lot of, again, facilitation and I view that as a big part of my role.\n\nLenny (00:14:01):\nAwesome. I'm curious, what are the biggest challenges with being in the position you're in? Are there any examples of a man that sucked? Or if you want to go in a different direction, is there a certain type of person that just isn't a good fit for this kind of role, had a product at a smallish company with a very product minded founder?\n\nSachin Monga (00:14:19):\nOh, let's start with the first one. I think the biggest challenge with this role/company phase, like I mentioned, we're going through this one-time transition from not really having a product function or a product process to having one, is almost by definition any time you figure out how to do a thing, you'll now reach this next phase of growth and it'll be obsolete. Something that I've repeated a bunch of the teams is I'm never too worried if we have the perfect planning process or the perfect execution cadence or the perfect communication process, whatever our process is, we're never going to have a perfect one.\n\nSachin Monga (00:14:52):\nAnd even if we did, it would soon be obsolete because we did a really good job and now we've grown 2X or something and we have more people and the process needs to change. The main thing I care about is are we just getting better every week, every month, certainly every year. I think that's easier said than done. It sounds good in theory, but then when you're in the thick of it. you're constantly basically feeling like you don't know how to do the thing. Because as soon as you figure it out, it's obsolete. It's just really hard. I think that's true of basically just startups in general, high growth companies. Doing the thing well means that you're not going to know what you're doing.\n\nSachin Monga (00:15:24):\nMaybe that leads into my answer to the second question, which is that's not really for everyone. I think there's almost like a personality type that has to be okay with being humbled all the time and feeling like you don't know what you're doing. I think you could be an amazing product manager at a company that is a bit more stable and consistent and get really good at what you're doing and someone who's going to be really good at a company that is on a bit of this trajectory, for folks who aren't watching the video, making a motion with my hand, that's not growing too fast, it's kind of a different job. The rate of change is a huge factor.\n\nLenny (00:16:03):\nThe point you made about how things are going to keep changing as you grow is such an important point that I don't feel like comes up as much as I thought would come up on this podcast. People are always asking me for advice. How do I structure my product team? How do I prioritize? How do I do planning? The main thing I've learned is no matter what you end up with, it's going to change in three to six months anyway because you'll learn more. The advice is just do the best thing you can think of right now. Don't assume this will last anyway, and that's good enough. There's never the perfect way to do it. It's always the best way you could do it at this moment, and then you learn how to evolve it.\n\nSachin Monga (00:16:35):\n100% agree.\n\nLenny (00:16:37):\nYou worked at Facebook for I think it was seven years. I'm curious what were you able to take from that experience about how Facebook, in a massive company like that, builds product to a smaller company like Substack. What translates well and then what just doesn't?\n\nSachin Monga (00:16:51):\nOver time, I'm finding that less translates than I thought. I don't know how much of that has to do with Facebook specifically though. I'll maybe mention one thing. Working on the core Facebook app, which was what I was working on for the bulk of my time there, Facebook may be the most extreme example of trying to solve so many different problems for so many different people in one tiny rectangle basically, that a big part of the product manager's job in a situation like that is going to be managing trade-offs. It's a super fascinating intellectual problem.\n\nSachin Monga (00:17:22):\nI think going back to the previous point, a lot of people really thrive in that kind of environment, where if we do this thing really well, it is going to directly trade-off against doing this other thing. It's not even a sequencing thing. When you think about prioritization, sometimes you think, we will do this, and then we'll do this, and then we'll do this. In Facebook's case, sometimes it's, \"Oh, if we do this, we just can't do this. It's going to be bad for this other thing. If we put a watch tab at the bottom, will that mean that people don't get a marketplace tab? What does that mean for this whole org and what the product is?\" I think when it comes to something like prioritization, it's a very different ballgame.\n\nSachin Monga (00:17:56):\nThere's certainly some things that are consistent. You generally want to prioritize things that are going to be high impact, low effort. These types of product management frameworks, I think a lot of it can hold constant. But when you really get into the object level like what does your day look like, I think being a PM at a high growth... I can't generalize this, but the job at Substack right now, it looks quite different than what I recognized as my job from Facebook circa 2018. I think it's maybe even gotten more the case that the PM's job in a situation like that will be navigating these types of internal trade-offs. I think on something like prioritization, very different.\n\nLenny (00:18:31):\nJust to double click on that a little bit, the main difference you're saying is that at a Facebook, it's not like whether we do a thing, it's just like what comes first, second, third. At a Substack, it's like we probably won't get to this for a year if we don't prioritize it now. Is that how you think about it, just like the time scale on your trade-offs?\n\nSachin Monga (00:18:46):\nNo. I think actually at Facebook, it's not necessarily whether we do a thing. It's not like we do this now or we do this later. It's doing this thing might mean we can't do this other thing at all, or it'll mean that instead of that chart being steady until we make the number go up, it might go down. By doing A, it might mean B is harder to do forever. Whereas at a startup, a lot of it is time. Time is the main variable. We can do this now and that means that we can't do this other thing until later. There's also an element of sequencing that matters I think a lot at a company like Substack that is in this formative stage of becoming an entirely new thing in a lot of ways.\n\nSachin Monga (00:19:21):\nSubstack started off like a single player tool for writers. It was like software for writers. If you describe Substack now as simply a newsletter tool, that would be reductive. It's really now much more of this ecosystem that's evolving in all sorts of interesting ways. There is a bit of an order of operations at play here where doing something right now might unlock our ability to do something later. That matters a lot in a situation like we're in at Substack.\n\nLenny (00:19:49):\nGot it. Essentially there's a lot more one-way doors at a larger company. Here, you can make decisions more quickly partly, but also you can go back and there's not all these second order effects of decision you're making.\n\nSachin Monga (00:20:00):\nI think that's right, or at least there are different types of second order effects.\n\nLenny (00:20:03):\nGot it. I know at Substack writers are like the beacon and the vision of making writers successful, helping people make a living writing. I imagine writers are the North Star or helping writers be successful, but is there anything where you can share about how you prioritize things that you work on within Substack? How do you think about the North Star?\n\nSachin Monga (00:20:20):\nGoing back to your question about Chris too, I think Chris and Hamish and Jay, the founders I think really start from a place of principle in a lot of ways. Why are we even doing this thing? It's not just to help writers make money. It's not just to unlock these cool things. It starts with an opinion for how the internet should work, where people should be in control over their destiny to a much greater extent than has ever really been the case over at least the last 10, 15 years, where all of a sudden, everyone just started spending all of their time in a handful of these public squares that were powered by ads.\n\nSachin Monga (00:20:57):\nWhen you think about what that means for Substack right now, that that means writers are in control over being able to deliver their best work on their terms to their audience, make money directly from their subscribers, and also that readers should be in control over their experience. When you show up to Substack.com, that experience should be something that you have a much greater degree of agency over or if you download the app than if you maybe opened up TikTok or something.\n\nSachin Monga (00:21:20):\nI think where that leads you down from a prioritization standpoint is often starting from, okay, if we could do something in a bunch of different ways, is there a way that provides more control to the writer or more control over the experience that the reader has to them? Is there a way that provides much less control? All things equal, do the one that holds constant this principle of control. We could talk about a few other examples like this, but I think from a prioritization standpoint and from a strategic standpoint, Substack is a pretty principled company, and I think it's been really fun and interesting to get to work in an environment like this and also see how it actually can work.\n\nSachin Monga (00:21:57):\nYou are excited about recommendations, the recommendations feature, and we can talk about that in more detail. I think that's a good example where there's certainly a way to do that where writers have the max amount of control. We picked that way even if it might seem harder to pull off. And then that feedback loop of, \"Oh, that actually worked,\" is really awesome to get to experience.\n\nLenny (00:22:17):\nYes, I definitely wanted to talk about this recommendation feature. I feel like it's maybe the most underappreciated radical shift in Substack and just platforms in general. I think this is going to go down as one of the most legendary impactful features of any platform or marketplace. I'm just putting this out there. It's such a huge deal and I don't think people appreciate this. Just to quickly summarize what this is, essentially you allowed writers like me to recommend other newsletters that I specifically pick. I pick 10 newsletters that I think are awesome. Once someone subscribes to my newsletter, they see these 10 as, \"Hey, you should check these out. I think these are awesome.\"\n\nLenny (00:22:55):\nIt's very curated. There's no algorithm involved, which to your point is Substack's I think vision and mission is just avoid algorithms as much as possible. The reason I think this is crazy and amazing is at this point, 70% of my growth is coming from this one feature. There's something like 500 other newsletters recommending me. As soon as the feature launched and you look at my growth chart, it's just a hockey stick starting that day. I don't think people appreciate this enough, and I'm really excited to just chat about how this feature came to be.\n\nLenny (00:23:26):\nComing back to a point we talked about earlier of Chris having a very strong opinion about how to build product, something I heard through a birdie is that Chris was not excited about this feature when it was proposed and it took a bit of pushing to get it out. Maybe we start there. How did this come to be?\n\nSachin Monga (00:23:39):\nSure. The way it came to be was that we noticed this organic behavior emerging, which was that a lot of readers of Substacks were starting to discover Substacks, but the way that was happening was typically through the lens of that original writer. This could happen in a bunch of different ways, right? I think you've used the guest post feature to have guests write post on your newsletter. Obviously that is a really good way for your readers to go and discover some of these other writers in a way that you're curating. There's some less obvious ways that this happens too.\n\nSachin Monga (00:24:10):\nIf you have comments on, which I think you do, if I scroll down and click on the profile of someone who's commenting on your post, it'll show me the other Substack that person reads too. Again, this is a very personalized and very writer centric way of doing discovery. At the same time, we talked about the supply and demand side of the marketplace. The supply side of Substack has just grown over time consistently to the point where now there's a huge amount of amazing writers on the platform and a huge number of collective readers on the platform too that we knew that this sort of like cross-pollination, this discovery loop could be a really powerful thing.\n\nSachin Monga (00:24:47):\nIf you'd start from the first principles, you're like, \"All right, how do we help readers discover more things?' The most obvious way to do this would be something like, \"Here are some Substacks you might. Based on what we know about your reading habits, here's like a few that Substack is just going to recommend you.\" This is the thing that worked really well. At Facebook in particular, I think when I joined in 2011, it was definitely still during the era... I think Facebook maybe had just over 500 million users and was on this path to a billion and beyond.\n\nSachin Monga (00:25:13):\nThis thing that we called PYMK, which was People You May Know, this little unit that would show up in the newsfeed and it would just tell you that eight other people that you obviously know because you have million mutual friends. That kind of thing drove a very non-trivial amount of Facebook growth in the early days. Of course, lots of other products have done things like this. We could have done something like that.\n\nSachin Monga (00:25:32):\nBut then going back to that principle of like, okay, well, if we were to do that, let's say we were to insert it at the bottom of our post or in an email or something, it's clearly a thing now where the writer who owns that space is not really in control over what the experiences that they're offering their readers. The reader who signed up for Lenny is now seeing these other things that have nothing to do with Lenny. Does that break this control principle, like putting writers in charge, putting readers in charge? Okay, so then back to the drawing board, what would be the most obvious maximal way to just put writers in control? What is the simplest version of this?\n\nSachin Monga (00:26:05):\nWhat if we just ask writers, who do you recommend? What if we just put that in the subscribe flow and just made it as simple as possible? I think Chris' reaction to that originally when that idea came up was that's probably just going to be really hard to pull off. There's a lot more things that have to be true. You need writers to opt in. You need to pick good people. You need to find a way to surface those recommendations to the readers in a way that's going to generate a good amount of surface area. I think it was a bit of skepticism that something like that could work, but we tried it and it took off really quickly.\n\nSachin Monga (00:26:39):\nThere was this virality at play now where when you recommend a bunch of people, those people will get an email that say, \"Hey, Lenny's recommending you and here's all the readers that he's sending you.\" It created this goodwill viral loop, which was really interesting to see play out. I think there was a bunch of interesting lessons in there. We could stick into anything that seems interesting, but I think Chris' skepticism was not, should we do cross-pollination discovery? Clearly this is something that's working, but is this kind of thing going to work given how many steps are required for it to be true that this becomes really impactful? It turned out that it took off way faster than I think we had imagined.\n\nLenny (00:27:13):\nIs there any stats you can share about just the impact it's having, what it's done to Substack?\n\nSachin Monga (00:27:17):\nYeah, sure. Recommendations specifically now have driven in the millions of new subscriptions for writers across the board, across I think like tens of thousands of unique writers that have received subscriptions from the recommendations feature. Of course, recommendations in particular are still just one component in this broader basket of network driven discovery.\n\nSachin Monga (00:27:39):\nI think we recently shared the stat, more than one in three new subscriptions across Substack are coming from the Substack network and around one in 10 paid subscriptions now too. But these numbers are just, as you can imagine, growing up and to the right, getting stronger every day, and I think we'll have some more interesting stats to share on that soon.\n\nLenny (00:27:58):\nAwesome. One thing I wanted to acknowledge, I think some people worry about this feature that it drives lower intent users. I find that not to be true. They're definitely lower intent, but it's not meaningfully and significantly. The fact that 70% of my user growth comes from this feature and my open rates have only come down a little bit, it says a lot about it. It's like useful really in tenfold people as much as it can be from someone that hasn't actually been planning to subscribe and just recently found out about it. It's really impressive how high intent they are all things considered.\n\nSachin Monga (00:28:31):\nYou bring up a point too that leads into some of the next things we're thinking about here, which is that right now most of the subscriptions that come from recommendations are coming from one particular flow in the product, which is when someone subscribes to someone else on Substack, they will then see a recommendation for Lenny. It's being serviced to people at a moment where not only are they just hearing about you for the first time, but they might just be hearing about the recommending writer for the first time too. They are new subscribers. They don't have this long standing trusted relationship built up yet.\n\nSachin Monga (00:29:04):\nOf course, you have people now who've been subscribing to you for years and who trust you greatly and would probably take your recommendation very seriously, but the people that you're recommending are only getting these subscribers at the first moment that someone finds out about Lenny in many cases. A big part of the next step of this product now is thinking about recommendations less as a step of the flow and more like a really interesting social graph that is being built of goodwill and of influence. You now recommend a bunch of other writers. There's much more that could be done in the network than just show some of those writers in the subscribe flow of lennysnewsletter.com.\n\nSachin Monga (00:29:43):\nThere's a lot more we could do there. I'm curious if you have any ideas, but we've got a bunch of ideas that we're cooking up that I think will not only drive more subscriptions, but also probably higher intent ones as well, because these are going to be people that might already have been reading you for years who never right now would know who you're recommending.\n\nLenny (00:29:58):\nNo great ideas to share. I do find since it's only free subscribers, I have to do more work to upsell them to try paid. On the other hand, having a huge pool of interested people that aren't ready to convert yet is only beneficial. When I send a free post and mention, \"Hey, I have a paid subscription. You can get more,\" it works really well.\n\nLenny (00:30:17):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.\n\nLenny (00:30:56):\nBeginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Get started today.\n\nLenny (00:31:34):\nSomething else I'll mention that I've learned to do is I feel so fortunate being early on Substack and having this thing grow so much, especially from this recommendation feature that I'm actually getting pings from people regularly now of, \"Hey, can you recommend my newsletter?\" It's like a really good growth hack on Substack right now to try to get a lot of subscribers to recommend you. My system right now is I want to share the wealth as much as I can, so I rotate through different newsletters.\n\nLenny (00:31:59):\nI help get them say a thousand subscribers, and then move on to the next one, assuming I like them. It's not just any random user. So I can share the wealth with a lot of different newsletters and give people a platform, because I have this platform now and that's been working really well.\n\nSachin Monga (00:32:12):\nThe Robin Hood of Substack.\n\nLenny (00:32:14):\nYeah, now I'm going to get all these DMs to recommend people. If I'm unable to, I'm sorry. You talked about how Chris was worried that this would not work. That's interesting. His point of there's so many steps that have to happen for this to be adopted is such a good one. In my experience, getting users to do anything is so hard. To get them to click some buttons and fill things out, that rarely works. It's cool that it really did work.\n\nLenny (00:32:38):\nI think it was part of the early beta, and I found that it was a really thoughtful approach to how it was all rolled out where there was a small group of users and writers that tried it out, see how went, see what the impact was, see if there was any negative impact. Is there anything you could share by just the way this was rolled out that you've learned about how to do this sort of thing?\n\nSachin Monga (00:32:56):\nI mentioned that we're going through this one-time transition of figuring out how to become a product driven company and how to ship products faster, better, et cetera. One of the principles I guess in this playbook that we're trying to write is we call it build with writers, build with readers. In some ways now that I think about it, it's almost like a sub principle of the put readers in charge, put writers in charge. How do you build product responsibly if you care deeply about that? One way to do it would be to almost as a strong default, anytime we're going to make a fundamental change to how Substack works, do it in a way where we bring writers along.\n\nSachin Monga (00:33:32):\nThis is still an optional thing. This isn't changing how Substack works for everyone, but this is we think a potentially profound enough thing that the way we did this was not just roll it out for everyone, put a little dialogue in the dashboard that says, \"Hey, everyone, now go do this thing,\" it was like, okay, why don't we call up 10 writers who we think might be interested in this.\" It's not that hard to just mock up what this could look like, get some feedback. This is the kind of thing that I think a lot of product teams would do. But then maybe a lot of product teams would be like, \"Okay, we got good feedback. Let's just build the thing, ship the thing.\"\n\nSachin Monga (00:33:59):\nInstead, we just ran a little pilot. You and a few other writers were gracious enough to lend your time and talk us through how you would see this working and what you would want. We actually have now we've set up something called the Product Lab, which I'm really excited about. I think you're a part of it. I hope we asked you.\n\nLenny (00:34:16):\nI'm curious to see where this all goes.\n\nSachin Monga (00:34:19):\nThis is just an invite only little group of a hundred or so writers that we know are interested in being on the bleeding edge of what Substack is becoming. We're investing a lot in just tools to help writers grow. Now we've got this little lab where we can take a feature recommendations to writers and get quick feedback and ensure that we're never just rolling something out to everyone without going through this step first. It's just been super helpful to have a bit of this infrastructure in place. Often the thing that we end up shipping on day one tends to be pretty different from what we had in mind before we went through this process.\n\nLenny (00:34:54):\nI've been through a bunch of those experiences and it always goes super well. I've been through a few features that just didn't go anywhere and then they, \"Nope, we're going to move on and not try this thing.\" Something else that always comes to mind with Substack is it's often in the news. Substack is a very popular topic amongst reporters.\n\nSachin Monga (00:35:10):\nWriters like to talk about writers.\n\nLenny (00:35:11):\nThat's right, especially a platform that might disrupt them someday or friends have gone on and they're maybe jealous about. I'm curious, as a product leader, how you deal with bad press, angry attention, things like that, just keeping people focused, keeping people motivated. Do you discuss stuff? How do you approach stuff that comes out of like, \"Oh man,\" and keep people excited?\n\nSachin Monga (00:35:33):\nThe whole thing here is just parsing out the signal from the noise. There's very little chatter in the blogosphere media sphere that would actually impact our day-to-day when I think about it. It's not zero, right? Sometimes there'll be something that ends up blowing up or that people are talking about that we should really take seriously and see how that might impact our strategy. But I'd say 90% of the chatter about Substack is going to probably ultimately just be a distraction to our product team at the end of the day that should just be focused on executing on the vision.\n\nSachin Monga (00:36:02):\nMaybe my skin got thickened from working at Facebook during a bunch of years that... Actually when I started at Facebook, generally things were quite rosy in the press, but we certainly went through a bunch of different phases and a lot of the stuff. I worked on myself that Facebook ended up getting talked about a ton in the press negatively most of the time. You just learn to just keep your heads down and keep shipping. Ultimately, that's all that matters. I feel proud of the way that I think our culture is internally being formed right now. We tend to not get distracted.\n\nLenny (00:36:37):\nIt seems to be the case. I'm curious where you see Substack going as a product long-term. What are you excited about? Where are things heading?\n\nSachin Monga (00:36:45):\nMaybe I'll answer that in two parts, one from a writer centric lens and one from a reader centric lens, which I mentioned is a bit of a newer thing for us. From a writer centric lens, I really think that we're just starting into this golden era of what it might mean to be a writer on the internet. Like I mentioned before, the economic model for supporting great writing on the internet has been generally pretty terrible for the entirety of the internet's history.\n\nSachin Monga (00:37:13):\nIn the early days of Substack, there's a couple of these glimmers of hope where you'd have people like Matt Taibbi or Bill Bishop, some of the early writers on Substack that were really well established writers who were clearly just being undervalued and now could come to Substack and see their true value. That was awesome. That was really cool to see. But in the last year or so, even in the last few months, I think there's been so many really interesting success stories now from writers who might not even consider themselves writers, let alone well established writers like Matt Taibbi or someone like that.\n\nSachin Monga (00:37:46):\nPeople who are able to make a living, maybe even make a fortune just doing great work and not needing to have millions and millions of viewers or play the attention games of other networks, but just do really high quality work and have a relatively small number of people value it highly enough to pay for it. That's like a new thing. When I see the next one to two years play out for the writer side of the equation, a lot of what we're going to try to do is just make it much simpler to get started, to have your Substack.\n\nSachin Monga (00:38:15):\nIf you have an audience anywhere, Substack's never going to be the place where have the biggest audience probably, but it certainly should be the place where your most valuable audience comes home to, where they get your best work. We're seeing a lot of really interesting success stories now of people that might have a big Instagram following or YouTube following and certainly Twitter following were able to use Substack now as this home base, this place to try to accumulate their most valuable audience that they own in the sense that they get their email address, they can export them at any time, and just build really simple tools to just help them deliver their best work.\n\nSachin Monga (00:38:47):\nIt could be writing, could be a podcast, could be video. We're investing a lot in some really interesting community features as well. You're a great example of this. To call Lenny's Newsletter simply a newsletter would be hilariously wrong at this point, right? I think you mentioned to me you had 30 meetups around the world last month or something like that.\n\nLenny (00:39:03):\nThat's right.\n\nSachin Monga (00:39:04):\nIt's an impressive of run rate of meetups. I think seeing that unfold and seeing how the platform can support that type of community behavior as well is a big thing that I'm excited about. Just more. On the reader's side, I think maybe to segue into that, I think we're again entering this little potential golden age of the internet for how you experience it as a consumer. Where instead of just having a handful of feeds that are basically the same, that you could just scroll through and consume videos of random people doing random things. Not to say that's bad and that should go away.\n\nSachin Monga (00:39:37):\nI do my fair share of just scrolling through my phone and watching random videos too, but it'd be kind of nice to have another place you could go to as well where the best culture is being made and you have an extreme degree of control over what you see and who you choose to lead into that space. You might not spend two hours a day in there, and that's fine, but it might be the first place you go because it's where all the best stuff is and it's where your best communities are going to live too. We kind of see Substack evolving not as some new type of social media, but true alternative to how you might spend that most valuable slice of your time.\n\nSachin Monga (00:40:13):\nWe just launched an iPhone app, I guess now it's been six months ago, and it's going really well. We're going to launch an Android app very shortly. We're pushing really hard on this reader experience as well. I think it'll be radically different and much better one or two years from now too.\n\nLenny (00:40:28):\nIt's been interesting to see a growing percentage of the great content that I come across be on Substack, and so I think that's a cool trend for y'all. For writers that are thinking about starting a newsletter, thinking about joining Substack, what sorts of advice, tips, guidance do you have for folks that are thinking about getting into the Substack world?\n\nSachin Monga (00:40:50):\nMy first piece of advice would be to just start it and see what happens. Start it. Have a way to start gathering subscribers. Put a link to it somewhere. Write one or two things. If you're not much of a writer, try posting a video, recording some audio, turn into a little podcast. Just start basically and see what happens and see what kind of interest there might be out there for what you have to say, especially if you already have a following on other platforms as well.\n\nSachin Monga (00:41:17):\nI think that there's a real risk that if your entire following is locked into one platform where you don't have a ton of control over, your ability to reach those people deterministically and certainly to monetize that in some way, it seems like it's a tenuous place to be in the current age of the internet. I'd say just start. It should be really easy. Go to Substack.com, press the start your Substack button, and see what happens.\n\nLenny (00:41:41):\nThat advice may sound to people like, \"Oh yeah, that's not actual advice.\" But I will say that is exactly what I did and that's exactly how I got to what I do now. I had zero intention of ever doing this. Charging for writing that I'm writing, that's crazy. Just the fact that Substack existed and let me try stuff out for free. You sign up. You start it. My newsletter, it's called Lenny's Newsletter because that was like the default recommendation when I signed up, because I told them my name's Lenny and it's like Lenny's Newsletter, because I had no plan to do this. It was just like, let me just sign up and try blogging here for a little bit and that little path.\n\nLenny (00:42:21):\nI think about Chris and Hamish and the founders mapping out a user journey of a vision of how somebody onboards to Substack, to go from never writing to doing it full-time. I feel like I went through that exactly, if they even had that, where I sign up just to try it out. I start writing consistently. It starts going well, then I think about charging, and then I launch the paid plan, and then that goes well. It keeps growing, and then I do it full-time. That's exactly what I went down and there's no world where I would've done this if not for those magical combination of features of just a really simple blog a d newsletter and collecting emails and maybe monetizing down the road.\n\nSachin Monga (00:43:01):\nYeah, that's amazing to hear.\n\nLenny (00:43:03):\nI think that just start advice is really spot on. Just try it out, see if it's something you want to do. I will say, it's easy to start a newsletter, it's hard to continue a newsletter. The continuing is the most important part, as Seinfeld would say in that clip, who rings the bell.\n\nSachin Monga (00:43:17):\nI will say though to that point too that I'm really excited for what Substack can do in the product to make that easier in a way that doesn't cheapen the experience. There's a bunch of things we could do to. We could automatically post stuff to your readers. We could do a lot of things. Going back to the how do we do discovery, there's a bunch of things that would probably just work, but they would eventually kill what Substack is or have all these nasty second order effects and ruin this promise of putting writers in charge, putting readers in charge.\n\nSachin Monga (00:43:45):\nI'm really excited and I actually view your Substack as a vanguard, as a very leading edge example of this, of you have turned your Substack into not just this thriving community of readers, but also of contributors and creators. You've got these amazing people coming and doing guest posts. You've got the podcast going. You've got these meetups. You've I think in a lot of ways alleviated the burden of how hard it would be to just be writing a long form thing every day and doing that for the rest of your life. That would be really hard. That would make it certainly much harder to keep going.\n\nSachin Monga (00:44:19):\nNot to say that it's easy now, I know how hard it is to do what you do. But I think Substack can do more to turn this ecosystem to funnel this energy into ways for people like you to feel more like a leader of a space and a curator in a lot of ways and still deliver this really valuable service to your audience without having to do all the work yourself. I think we can do a lot more to support that kind of thing.\n\nLenny (00:44:45):\nIs there anything you could share about what sorts of things you're thinking there and what might be possible?\n\nSachin Monga (00:44:49):\nLet's see. Guest posts are working really well, and I'll say that we have a bunch of ideas for how to make guest posts a much bigger thing. Right now, the way guest posts work, kind of like an op-ed or something, like you invite someone to come and just write a post on your Substack. I think there's much more we can do without getting into some of the specifics and scooping the product team that we're working on that I think could make it feel more like you've got a bunch of people who are somewhat more fluidly able to contribute to your Substack and deliver value to your audience.\n\nSachin Monga (00:45:18):\nI've teased this community stuff that we're working on a little bit, but we're piloting a feature right now that's been working really well where writers can get a little bit of like a... We view it as the pub at the back of your Substack where people can hang out and chat and the writer is still in control and sets the tone and sets the rules and norms for the space, but can create space for their subscribers to participate and hang out themselves too. Those are two areas that we're investing in a fair bit right now.\n\nLenny (00:45:45):\nSomething that I imagine somebody suggested that I'd suggest you all look into a little bit is open AI assisted writing. I was playing with this product that is called Jasper and there's also Copy.ai. I put in the title of the post I was about to write and it just generated a pretty good paragraph summary of what it could have been. They have this whole feature where you just start typing and it autocompletes things smartly.\n\nSachin Monga (00:46:11):\nThat's crazy.\n\nLenny (00:46:11):\nThat would be cool. I don't know if you want to go there, but it's pretty good.\n\nSachin Monga (00:46:15):\nThat seems like an interesting can of worms.\n\nLenny (00:46:17):\nRight, an interesting can of worms.\n\nSachin Monga (00:46:18):\nWe did talk about whether we should change our default publication. You know how your default name was just like Lenny's Newsletter and we probably gave you a little red square or something as your default publication logo originally. A DALL-E generated publication logo service would be pretty cool.\n\nLenny (00:46:33):\nThat would be cool. If nothing else, it's just for ideas, but I would love that. Coming back to the idea of someone starting a Substack, we talked about advice, which is the core advice is just start and see how you like it. A big part of this is like, do you want to keep doing this? Because again, it's easy to start, hard to keep going, and also you may realize, \"I've created this job for myself I don't like.\" That's something they should be thoughtful about. But on the flip side, do you see any common mistakes people make when they're starting on Substack that you suggest they try to avoid?\n\nSachin Monga (00:47:02):\nOne thing that's interesting here that I think we have a big opportunity to improve in the product is that there's going to be obviously varying levels of intent that people have when they hit that start your Substack button. Some people might come in being like, \"This is going to be my full-time job. I want to make this work. I want to not just be a full-time writer, I want to build a media empire on Substack.\" There's certainly examples of that happening now. You can imagine a version of our onboarding and set up flow that's like the media empire version of it.\n\nSachin Monga (00:47:28):\nYou could also imagine the version that's just, \"Let me just write one thing. Don't make me make all these decisions. I just want to get in the game.\" I think that in general, a mistake that people might make is... I'll maybe flip it back to an anecdote related to what I heard from Chris when I was chatting with him the other day, that he had to convince you pretty hard to turn on payments at all. Correct me if I'm spreading misinformation, but is that right?\n\nLenny (00:47:51):\nYeah. And Hamish too. Especially on how often I can take a break, he's always given me advice of, \"You can take a break more often than you think,\" because I feel like I can never not do a week. Both those pieces of advice. It took me a while to get over, maybe I could charge for this and then maybe I could take some weeks off.\n\nSachin Monga (00:48:10):\nRight, right. I think there's a generalizable piece of advice here that might be my answer to the question of what's a common pitfall, which is people are really worried about how their audience will perceive them and really ultimately their own worth, right? Should I send a newsletter three times a week into people's inbox? Is that too much? Should I ask anyone to pay me ever? Is that crazy? Am I allowed to take a vacation ever given that I've got people paying on an ongoing basis? And is that a bad service to provide if I'm taking a two week summer vacation?\n\nSachin Monga (00:48:42):\nI think almost in all of those cases, and then you could imagine five more things like that, readers, especially the people that are subscribed to you who are paying you, are pretty forgiving and are really there to support you and want you to take that vacation. There's probably more people who would want to pay for you that just don't even know about you that would totally pay if they could. Go back to that spectrum of, am I just trying to write a blog post? Am I trying to start a media empire? It's kind of like many people won't know yet. Just open up optionality for yourself and see what happens. Maybe don't be too worried about what your audience might think.\n\nSachin Monga (00:49:20):\nI think that maybe is one difference between Substack than something like Twitter or Instagram or something. Subscribe as an action is pretty heavyweight. It's like a costly signal, right? It's not as easy as just matching the follow button on a bunch of accounts on Twitter or something like that. If someone is subscribed to you, they're granting you write access to their brain is maybe the way I view it in a nerdy sense. What that means is not just like, \"I'll let you write your one long form thing once a week,\" but, \"hey, you've got this other person that you think might have something interesting to say? Cool, let me know. I'm here for it.\" I think writers underestimate that.\n\nLenny (00:49:57):\nMaybe three things I'll add to this just for folks that are thinking about, should I try this out? Should I not? One, when I joined Substack, I already felt like it was too late, and this was three years ago. I was like, \"Nah, it's too late. Everyone's already got their big newsletters. There's no way I'm going to make any dent.\" I think people feel that now, and I think it's also not true. I think there's so much opportunity.\n\nSachin Monga (00:50:18):\n100%.\n\nLenny (00:50:19):\nTwo, when I got to a thousand paid subscribers, which feels very doable, I was making around a 100K, which is exactly... I think it was Kevin Kelly's 1000 True Fans. It was exactly like, \"Oh wow! I could make a living with a thousand true fans for real.\" It's shocking how much you could make with so few people that really care about what you're doing. Think about is there a niche or something you're excited about that you can find a thousand people to pay you 10 bucks a month.\n\nSachin Monga (00:50:52):\nWhat's cool about that I think now with Substack and with the network effect is if there's a thousand people who are going to pay you 10 bucks a month, there's probably 2,000 and 5,000 and 10,000.\n\nLenny (00:50:58):\nThat's exactly what happened to me. I'm like, \"If I hit a 100K, holy moly, I am good,\" and then it just kept growing. That's exactly right. You think there's an out, but the markets for these things are huge. The last point maybe is it took me nine months of doing it every week for free to get to a point where I felt like I can keep doing this. I enjoy doing this. People continue to value it, where I decided to turn on paid. It's a very slow and steady thing initially.\n\nLenny (00:51:24):\nDon't expect it to just blow up. Just do it every week. See how it goes. See if you like it. See people like it. And if they do, keep going. If not, you can stop. When I launched my newsletter, I tweeted. I'm just going to experiment this thing. No idea where it's going to go. Just try it out, so you don't have to set the stakes high when you're starting out.\n\nSachin Monga (00:51:41):\nI think that's exactly right. You mentioned Kevin Kelly's 1000 True Fans, which has become this canonical piece of writing on the internet now. My favorite Kevin Kelly blog post, that's my second favorite, my first favorite is a post that he wrote called You Are Not Late, which is exactly what you... You can probably picture what he says, but it's such a compelling, persuasive argument for the thing you mentioned, which is like... Obviously he wasn't talking about Substack in his post, but he was talking about the internet and how in the grand scheme of things, how lucky we are to...\n\nSachin Monga (00:52:13):\nI don't even know when he wrote it, maybe it was probably 10 years ago at this point, but certainly at a time where a lot of people were feeling, \"Oh, Facebook and Google and the internet's done. The battles have been won. I wish I was coming of age. I wish I had graduated from Harvard in 2004 or something.\" It's just so wrong. We are so early when it comes to how the internet will play out that I think getting to work on that in any capacity right now, getting to shape how the internet is going to play out over the next 10, 20 years is so fun because we are not late.\n\nLenny (00:52:40):\nHere, here. I know Marc Andreessen mentioned those too when he moved to Silicon Valley in the '80s, \"It's all over. It's too late. I missed the gold rush of tech,\" and it was just the beginning. Well, we've reached our very exciting lightning round where I'm just going to ask you a bunch of questions real quick, share whatever comes up. Sound good?\n\nSachin Monga (00:52:59):\nSure, let's do it.\n\nLenny (00:53:00):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nSachin Monga (00:53:04):\nI will plug some books that have nothing to do with the internet or software or tech, but have been the most informative or instructive books for me I think in my career as a product person working on software, which are books about architecture and urban planning. The reason why I find this field so fascinating is because for thousands of years, people have been figuring out how to build spaces that help people interact with each other and build good spaces to occupy. We've only been doing this for, going back to the Kevin Kelly thing, for basically the blink of an eye on the internet and in the digital realm.\n\nSachin Monga (00:53:35):\nThere's one book in particular by an architect named Christopher Alexander who sadly just passed away earlier this year. He wrote this book in the '70s. It's called The Timeless Way of Building. This is the book that I recommend to the most people I have. I buy it in bulk and I just give it away to people. The basic premise of the book is that in the '70s, we had just gone through a couple of decades of just mass produced cookie cutter suburban house development in the US. His premise was like we've basically just lost the plot on this. No one likes living in these houses.\n\nSachin Monga (00:54:06):\nIf you think about why these houses all feel bad to live in, it's because the people building the houses now for the first time ever are different than the people living in the house. It's these developers, these real estate developers, these big companies, mass producing these houses. But for thousands of years, we've figured out what makes a good house. The people building the house are the people living in it and they get that, but now the incentive structure got changed and they messed everything up.\n\nSachin Monga (00:54:27):\nI think there's a really interesting parallel there with the internet, specifically how the last decade or so has played out, where the people building the spaces that we occupy are operating under a very complicated incentive structure and it's leading to these suboptimal user experiences. This is what we work on at Substack. This is what I think is fun to work on right now. If you're working on something like this, I would highly recommend The Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander.\n\nLenny (00:54:51):\nAwesome. We're going to include that in the show notes for sure. What are two or three Substacks that you recommend most speaking of recommendation features?\n\nSachin Monga (00:54:59):\nI was just thinking about this as I don't write on stack certainly frequently, and so I don't use the recommendations feature, but who would I recommend if I did besides Lenny, of course? I'll share a couple of random examples maybe, again, outside of maybe the tech product world. There's this guy named Darryl Cooper who has a podcast on Substack called The Martyr Made Podcast that I've gone super deep into lately. It's hard to describe. He basically takes a topic and he will produce the single best explanation of that topic you will ever find, because you'll spend an insane amount, probably 10,000 hours per topic, figuring out getting to the bottom of this story.\n\nSachin Monga (00:55:38):\nHe's doing a series right now in the labor movement in America. It sounds like a boring topic maybe, but he's just such an amazing storyteller. He's I think a good example too of this could only really work if he finds his thousand true fans as people who are just like, \"Yeah, I'll just pay for this.\" It would be a very bad advertising business for sure. He publishes pretty infrequently, inconsistently, but it's just the highest quality stuff. That's The Martyr Made Podcast. Since I know this is supposed to be a lightning round and I spent too much time on that, the two others that I'll just quickly throw out there, Colin Meloy is one of my favorite musicians.\n\nSachin Monga (00:56:10):\nHe's the lead singer of The Decemberists. He's doing a really cool thing on his Substack right now of just a lot of interesting behind the scenes stuff on tour, publishing, audio and video. It's been really good. If you're a fan of The Decemberists, I highly recommend. One more, let's see, I have been really excited about Ethan Strauss lately. He writes a Substack called the House of Strauss. He's a basketball writer, but I think it's a cool example of like he just has subscribers now. He can write whatever he wants. He writes about a wide range of topics and they're all just really fascinating. I love to see that kind of thing happen on Substack and in general.\n\nLenny (00:56:41):\nThat's just reminding me, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar just recommended my newsletter in his Substack.\n\nSachin Monga (00:56:45):\nOh man, congrats! That must be a life achievement right there.\n\nLenny (00:56:50):\nYeah. I'm like, what the hell?\n\nSachin Monga (00:56:52):\nCongrats!\n\nLenny (00:56:53):\nThank you.\n\nSachin Monga (00:56:54):\nHe's a great writer. .\n\nLenny (00:56:54):\nI don't know if he reads it. I don't know. I don't know what's going on. I love it. He has got a great Substack, by the way. I think if you just Google Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Substack, you'll find it. On the recommendation feature, I was just thinking, do you want to shout out the folks that built it, the team?\n\nSachin Monga (00:57:07):\nI would love to.\n\nLenny (00:57:08):\nLet's do it.\n\nSachin Monga (00:57:09):\nIt's too many. It ended up being a company wide effort, but the product manager on my team, Dayne Rathbone, was specifically I think the spearhead behind the way that we built it, like you mentioned, that we went into. He was a really big proponent for that. Gabriel on our design team designed it and many engineers worked on it. It'll be hard to shout them all out, but I'd shout out Dayne on my team because he ensured that we built it in the way that we ultimately needed to build it for it to work.\n\nLenny (00:57:36):\nThank you, Dayne and Gabriel. Two final questions. Do you have any favorite recent movies or TV shows that you watched that you love?\n\nSachin Monga (00:57:44):\nYeah. I just finished the latest season of For All Mankind and loved it.\n\nLenny (00:57:49):\nSo good.\n\nSachin Monga (00:57:50):\nDid you watch it all?\n\nLenny (00:57:52):\nYes. Oh my God! The last couple episodes, you're sitting on the edge of your seat.\n\nSachin Monga (00:57:55):\nI feel like in this season, every episode was like its own standalone movie or something. It started slow the whole show. I think the first season was a bit slow. When I recommend it to people, I'm like, \"Just power through it,\" but they really found their groove. I don't know. I'm stoked for the next season.\n\nLenny (00:58:10):\nSame. Final question, what's a favorite interview question you like to ask folks when you're interviewing them?\n\nSachin Monga (00:58:16):\nI have a tough time answering this question because I have found that there's not one question that will get me the signal I actually want given how diverse the candidate's experiences might be in their context. If you're coming from a Facebook type place or coming from a startup, I might need to ask different questions in order to get the signal I want. Maybe I'll answer it in that way, which is like these days, especially for Substack, what is the signal that I'm trying to get?\n\nSachin Monga (00:58:43):\nI think really for early stage, fast growing startup, we talked so much about how different that is, we just need people who can run through walls to accomplish big goals. Maybe grit and endurance in some ways and drive are the words I would throw out there. I find it's really hard to have one question that will get that signal. We need to tailor it to that person's background.\n\nLenny (00:59:07):\nAll right, I'll accept that meta answer. Sachin, thank you so much for being here. As you I've shared, Substack is very near and dear to my heart, and I'm really thankful that you spent the time to dig into a lot of these things that have been on my mind. I imagine it will be helpful to a lot of other people. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more? Are y'all hiring? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nSachin Monga (00:59:31):\nFirst of all, thank you, Lenny, for being such an amazing Substack example setter. We talk about you all the time, as you can imagine internally, and you've been so helpful to the company and to our product team. It's been a real honor to get to come onto the pod and keep doing what you're doing. You can find me on all the various social media platforms. I'm not super active on them, I must admit, but maybe Twitter would be the one where I spend the most time, which is just Sachin Monga, my first name and last name, is my handle.\n\nSachin Monga (00:59:58):\nI'll make one plug for a role that we're hiring for right at Substack, which is a senior data role with a product and growth analytics bent would be the specific archetype we're looking for in this role. If you are listening to the pod and feel like that might be you, I would love to chat. I think my email address too, I don't know if it would get shared, but it's just Sachin, my first name, @substackinc.com. Feel free to send me a note anytime.\n\nLenny (01:00:24):\nAwesome. We'll include that in the show notes. Sounds like y'all are building some cool analytics features maybe based on that role. I'm excited for that. Awesome, man. Thank you for being here.\n\nSachin Monga (01:00:33):\nMy pleasure. Thank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny (01:00:37):\nThank you so much for listening.
