In our chat, we get deep into two topics: the opportunity solution tree framework, which is a really simple but incredibly powerful framework once it, and, two, we go deep into how to create a system within your team where you're talking to customers regularly.\n\n(00:34):\nWe talk about ways to make a case for spending more time talking to customers and doing news research, the most common mistakes people make with interviewing and generally how to interview customers better, how to automate this process so that you don't spend a bunch of time, and so many other ways to bring you and your organization closer to your customers. Teresa's amazing, and I can't wait for you to learn from her.\n\n(00:55):\nThis episode is brought to you by Persona. Persona helps founders, product managers, and engineers easily solve any identity-related problem, including handling KYC, AML, and basically all manner of identity fraud. You can integrate Persona in an afternoon and personalize your flows using their SDK to meet your users on any device.\n\n(01:16):\nPersona's identity building blocks allow you to manage your entire end-to-end onboarding flow, verifying that each new user and their data are legitimate.

I don't know if this, but your book is consistently the number one most recommended book in my Slack community. Also, I've personally learned so much from you from your writing and just your tweets and all the ways that you share your lessons. And so, I'm really excited to delve into continuous discovery and all the things that you teach. And so, again, thank you for being here and welcome.\n\nTeresa Torres (03:36):\nThanks, Lenny. I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (03:38):\nHow many PMs would you say that you've worked with through your consulting and through your courses? Just to give us a ballpark.\n\nTeresa Torres (03:45):\nThat's a good question. I know through Product Talk Academy, we're just at about 11,000 students. I'm not very good at updating the number on our homepage. I think it still says something like 8,500. But officially I think we're just about to cross the 11,000 mark, which is a little bit mind-blowing to me and a ton of fun. Then on the coaching side, it's in the hundreds, not in the thousands, obviously because coaching is a little bit of a different beast. So, yeah, I'd probably say maybe 12,000.\n\nLenny (04:13):\nThat's incredible. Would you say that that maybe puts you in the top five PM teacher/influencer types that have worked with maybe the most PMs, just roughly? Just to give people a little context.\n\nTeresa Torres (04:24):\nI don't even know how to evaluate that. I still think about some of the really early people that had an influence on me and to see that some of them now recommend my book, it's just mind-boggling. It's pretty cool.\n\nLenny (04:37):\nYeah, I feel the same way sometimes with my newsletter. I'm like, oh, hey, this person that I always looked up to as a legend is now sharing my stuff. It's crazy.\n\nTeresa Torres (04:44):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (04:44):\nBefore we get into the meat of the chat, just real quick, to plug your site and where to discover all the things that you do, what's the site people can check out while we chat?\n\nTeresa Torres (04:52):\nYeah. So my site is producttalk.org. Then there's a few things like my blog at producttalk.org/blog. We put out two articles a month. Then we have a whole bunch of courses related to discovery at learn.producttalk.org.\n\nLenny (05:05):\nAwesome. We'll chat a bit more about that at the end. So in our chat, I was hoping we'd cover two main topics, things that I've maybe learned most from you over the years. One is the opportunity solution tree framework. Then two is just the general idea of continuous discovery and all the ways to approach that. Does that sound good?\n\nTeresa Torres (05:24):\nYeah, that sounds great.\n\nLenny (05:25):\nOkay. So starting with the opportunity solution tree framework, it's such a simple but such a powerful way to visualize your strategy, your levers, how to prioritize, get buy-in from people, get everyone on the same page. It's probably the thing I share most of what you've put out with people. So I'd love to maybe start with just like what is this framework, what problem does it solve for people, and how can people apply it to their product problems?\n\nTeresa Torres (05:51):\nYeah, really good question. So first of all, it's just a really simple visual. It's funny how simple it looks, because using it in practice is really complex. I definitely have a new appreciation for that, trying to teach it over and over again and seeing where people struggle.\n\n(06:06):\nSo it's a tree visual. So it's just like a decision tree. It starts with an outcome at the root of the tree, and then it branches into the opportunity space and then it branches into solutions, and maybe even assumption tests from there.\n\n(06:19):\nThe purpose of it is I recognize that while as an industry, some companies are moving from this output focus to an outcome focus, most product teams don't really know how to manage this really complex problem of how do I start from an outcome and figure out what to build? It's a really unstructured, wide open, hard problem.\n\n(06:41):\nA lot of teams, they learn how to do their jobs building products by being told, \"Build these features.\" That's a really structured, okay, I just turn out some work problem. And so, we're asking teams to fundamentally do a really different type of job and I think teams needed some scaffolding for how do you make that shift. And so, that was the purpose of the opportunity solution tree is how do I add some structure to this wide open, messy problem.\n\n(07:08):\nNow the reason why it looks simple but it's really hard in practice is like, well, what's an opportunity and how do I structure the opportunity space? I can tell you that opportunity is an unmet need pain point or desire, and that's great. But I can tell you that 98% of people that write opportunities write them as solutions.\n\n(07:26):\nSo we tend to just really struggle with this distinction between the problem space and the solution space. I think that the heart of good product is really getting comfortable in the problem space or the opportunity space, really taking the time to frame a problem well, and to really get into what's needed before we jump to solutions.\n\n(07:48):\nBut it's the opposite of how our brains are wired. And so, teaching people to be comfortable with that discomfort of staying there is hard. I mean I see blog posts written about how they're using the opportunity solution tree, and I cry a little bit because their opportunity space is all solutions. I don't want to knock down somebody's blog post, but I also don't want this bad example out there in the world when I'm trying to teach how do we do this well. So I haven't found the right line there yet other than I'm going to blog about good examples.\n\nLenny (08:20):\nIs there an example of a tree that, just to make it even more concrete, like for a company or product that you've worked with or that you think about?\n\nTeresa Torres (08:26):\nYeah. So I like to use streaming entertainment as my examples, because literally everybody in the world is familiar with Netflix. If I think about their opportunity space, I recommend teams structure the opportunity space using an experience map, like if you take your outcome.\n\n(08:41):\nSo if we start with Netflix, if you think about the experience of you're trying to get me to engage with Netflix more, I want to understand what's the experience of somebody using streaming entertainment to entertain themselves. Maybe even broader than Netflix. If you watch YouTube TV, that's probably still relevant for me to learn about and understand.\n\n(09:02):\nAnd so, the way that I'm going to structure my opportunity space is I'm going to look at what's the overall experience of trying to entertain yourself a streaming entertainment. That might look like, well, first there's this trigger of I need to decide to watch something. Then there's this experience of how am I deciding what to watch? Usually wrapped up in that is what platform am I watching it on? Those are sometimes inner mixed, because maybe you're deciding, \"I want to watch Game of Thrones ,\" and that's right away sending you to HBO Max, or maybe you're like, \"Well, I want to watch a movie,\" and I could be on any platform.\n\n(09:34):\nThen there's the evaluation process of is this movie good or not? Does it look like something I want to watch? Then I want to get into, okay, I'm ready to watch. Is it a good viewing experience? Then for a lot of these platforms, there's also this post-viewing experience of like am I going to encourage you to keep watching, things like that?\n\n(09:52):\nSo that's how I would structure that opportunity space is just there's these distinct moments in time. Then what I'm capturing is, below each of those, what are the needs and pain points and desires that arise? So if we just focus on that one around how do I decide what to watch, there's all sorts of needs that come up. Some are really tactical, like I have a movie title in mind and I just don't know how to find it. That's a pain point. Or, hey, I was watching a show. How do I get back to it? It's also a pain point. But then there's also these big media opportunities, like I can't tell if this show is good or not.\n\n(10:27):\nAnd so, everything that I just said, there was no solutions in there. In fact, whether I work at Netflix or I work at Hulu, our opportunity spaces probably look pretty similar. Now the ones we choose to go after and how we solve them might look really different. But the core human needs of what's your experience as we go about our lives entertaining ourselves is pretty similar.\n\n(10:51):\nI think the companies that build really good products, they either intuitively or explicitly take the time to really understand what does that journey look like and what are those needs and pain points and how do we create a really seamless experience?\n\nLenny (11:04):\nWe're going to link to the blog post and a few examples in the show notes so people can look at this visually, because I know we're trying to describe it through words. A quick follow-up question. So you have this tree with the outcome, say, get people to watch more Netflix. I imagine you recommend, max, three to five levers below that. Is that right? Then the rest just sits somewhere else?\n\nTeresa Torres (11:25):\nYeah, that's a really good question. So at the top level, I tend to map those opportunities to steps in that experience map. So in that Netflix example, it'd be the trigger of I want to watch something, deciding what to watch, the viewing experience. I do find that, oh, is it Miller's magic number? The plus or minus seven rule is pretty good. I would say nine is probably a lot. So I would say maybe in that three to seven range. That's just because you could cognitively process your tree.\n\n(11:57):\nSo the other thing that I get into is as you move vertically down the tree, your opportunities are getting smaller and smaller, which is really key to helping us unlock a continuous cadence. So if I start with that example of I can't decide what to watch, it's a really big hard evergreen problem. As long as Netflix is in business, they're probably going to have people focused on that problem.\n\n(12:16):\nBut we can deconstruct it. Maybe I can't find something to watch because I don't know if this show's any good. Then we can learn about how do people evaluate shows. Maybe there's a small opportunity in there of who's the cast? It's one of the ways I evaluate a show. Now we're getting into an opportunity that we can actually solve.\n\n(12:33):\nSo that's one of the other benefits. As we work our way down the tree, we get to smaller and smaller opportunities. We get to things that we can actually address. We're still contributing to that bigger, harder problem. And so, what it's allowing us to do is get this big picture view of where we could play, and then we can make more strategic decisions about where do we actually want to play. Then it's very customer-focused because it's really all about what's your need in this moment? How can I help satisfy that?\n\nLenny (12:59):\nIf you want to reduce friction in your onboarding flow, then let me tell you about Stytch. That's Stytch with a Y. Stytch is on a mission to eliminate friction from the internet. They're starting by making user authentication and onboarding more seamless and more secure. They offer super flexible, out-of-the-box authentication solutions for companies of all size.

Just mention that I sent you.\n\n(14:03):\nFor PMs and just maybe founders that are listening and they're like, \"This sounds really useful. I want to create my own little opportunity solution tree,\" I know this a big question, but how do you go about figuring out what goes into each of these steps, however briefly, you can give people some guidance?\n\nTeresa Torres (14:17):\nYeah. So the reason why this is so hard is that ... I mean it sounds really simple, but here's why it's hard. Opportunities emerge from our customers' stories. I don't think most people, when they're interviewing, they collect stories. So if, Lenny, I was going to interview you about your Netflix experience, the vast majority of product teams are saying things like, \"Hey, Lenny, what do you like to watch on Netflix? How do you decide what to watch?\" We're asking these direct questions out of context.\n\n(14:43):\nThe challenge with that is we know from human psychology and cognitive psychology that we're not very good at answering those questions out of context. Actually, that sounds weird. We're very good at answering them. Your brain will come up with a fast answer, but that answer doesn't necessarily reflect your behavior, and it misses context and nuance.\n\n(15:01):\nYou can tell me, \"I just like action movies. I always look for action movies.\" I can't visualize your experience. I don't know what your experience is watching action movies. I just collected a fact about you. But if I ask you, like, \"Tell me about the last time you watched a movie,\" now I can collect things like where were you and who were you with and set the scene for me, and what happened first and how did you choose that? I'm going to get answers to all those direct questions, but it's grounded in this specific instance. It's going to be a lot more reliable. And I'm going to start to hear unmet needs, pain points, and desires.\n\n(15:36):\nThe really powerful thing is I might hear needs that you're not even aware of. We're so used to everything being mediocre, we're not even aware of a lot of these needs that we have. But when we tell our stories, especially if you start to train your ear for this, you start to hear those needs.\n\n(15:54):\nSo the first thing that makes this hard is you have to interview well. I think interviewing is a grossly underestimated skill. Grossly underestimated skill. So that's the first thing is that if you're not collecting rich stories in your interviews, it's going to be really hard to identify opportunities.\n\n(16:12):\nThen the second thing is that you have to be able to hear those opportunities. If you're still stuck with what's an opportunity versus what's a solution, it's tough. Then the third thing is this opportunity framing. I believe opportunity should be really specific.\n\n(16:27):\nA really great opportunity in the streaming space is it's hard to enter my password, select specific letters on the screen with the Apple TV remote. If anybody has had an Apple TV, especially the old remote, it's not a very precision device. Selecting those letters on the stupid onscreen keyboard is a horrible pain point. It comes up when we're entering our passwords, it comes up when we're searching for movie titles. That's a really specific opportunity.\n\n(16:53):\nThe value of that is we can solve it. Whereas teams tend to want to frame opportunities as like, \"I wish this was easier to use.\" Okay, well, we can spend our lives making this product easier to use. What are you solving for who? And so, we're skill stacking. Then we've got to interview well. We've got to be able to hear opportunities. We've got to be able to frame them well. Then in order to structure the opportunity space, we have to be able to come pull out this common experience map, structure across seemingly unique stories.\n\n(17:21):\nSo there's a lot of skill involved. I wish I could just say, \"Hey, Lenny. It's super easy. Everybody should do it. I think it's really powerful, and I've seen it be a game-changer for teams. It's hard.\n\n(17:32):\nI tell my teams when I teach it in class, I say, \"Look, we're going to focus on structuring an opportunity space, and I'm probably going to make you think harder than you've ever had to think in your job,\" because we don't think that much at work. We go from meeting to meeting, we stay surface level a lot, and here I am coming in with this really hard critical thinking exercise.\n\n(17:53):\nBut I've just seen from teams that are willing to put in that work, it really is a game-changer. You have a deeper understanding of what your customers need and you build better products.\n\nLenny (18:02):\nMan, thinking deeply.\n\nTeresa Torres (18:03):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (18:03):\nNo fun, but it's so important. I want to chat about interviewing and all the advice you have about just how to interview. But before we get to that, one last question around the opportunity solution work. So the whole idea is to think outcome-oriented. To your point, a lot of companies have product teams that are just like, \"Build these things for us. Don't worry about why we're doing these.\"\n\n(18:24):\nIf your company is of that ladder sort, more of a feature factory, can you use this framework to push the team and the company in a direction of thinking outcome-oriented, or is there a more direct approach to address that problem?\n\nTeresa Torres (18:37):\nYeah. Okay. Let's talk about this based on the role. If you're an individual contributor and you're not at a 10-person company, I would say don't try to force the organizational change. Organizational change is such a hard and messy problem. I feel like what I would do in that situation is I would just change the way that I individually worked.\n\n(18:56):\nThis is what I always did in every job. I mean I made a lot of mistakes trying to change the organization, but I also just carved out a way for me to work this way. I think we underestimate how much ability we have to do that. So even if you're being prescribed a fixed roadmap, you still can find customers to talk to.\n\n(19:14):\nI hear from people all the time say, \"I'm not allowed to talk to customers.\" I go, \"Okay, well, your company doesn't own you when you're not at work. I bet you know people like your customers. Why don't you just start there?\"\n\n(19:24):\nSo we overthink it. We think we have to go through these proper channels and we have to get permission from sales. A lot of us, especially if we work on a consumer product, just go find somebody that's like your user. But I've also seen instances in B2B environments, where like I worked with that team that worked on badges for healthcare, the badges that nurses and doctors use to unlock a workstation that they chart in. This team, for weeks, ran into problems finding a customer to talk to.\n\n(19:52):\nI just said, \"Hey, do any of you know doctors or nurses in your personal network?\" The product manager was like, \"Yeah, I have two uncles that are doctors.\" \"Huh. Maybe we could just start there.\" Go talk to somebody.\n\n(20:05):\nI think that even if you aren't being tasked with an outcome, if you do the work to understand these are the outcomes that matter to your business for your product, it's probably going to start with your business model, and then work to understand how the work that you're doing contributes to that. All those little teeny tiny decisions we make every day, even if you're being prescribed solutions, you'll make better decisions, because you have a fuller context of what your business needs. You have a fuller context of what your customer needs.\n\n(20:36):\nSo I think for most of us, if you're in an individual contributor role, just focus on developing the habits yourself. I'm always amazed, I was always amazed at how much I could do by just ignoring everybody around me and how they were working and finding a way to do it.\n\nLenny (20:51):\nI love that because it lets you empower yourself and not wait for permission for excuses. This is always such a recipe for success for any role, especially PMs that are annoyed by how maybe their company works.\n\n(21:02):\nThis is a really good segue to our second topic around continuous discovery. We've been touching on a lot of the elements of it, interviewing and understanding pain points and all that. And so, maybe just to set a little bit of foundation, what is continuous discovery? Your book is named after it. You, of course, is on this, which the general idea of continuous discovery.\n\nTeresa Torres (21:22):\nYeah, let's just start at the beginning. So we often talk about discovery and contrast with delivery. Discovery is just used to describe the work we're doing to decide what to build. So everybody, every company is doing discovery. Everybody is making decisions about what to build.\n\n(21:37):\nWe have a few trends that have been evolving very slowly over the last 20 years. One of which is we're recognizing that if we want to make good decisions about what to build, we probably should include the customer somewhere in that process.\n\n(21:49):\nSo I teach a customer-centric view of discovery. Let's build in some feedback loops of are we making the right decisions, or are we making good decisions? Because there probably aren't right decisions here.\n\n(22:00):\nSo then there's a second trend that we're seeing across the board, which is we're recognizing that digital products are never done. It's not like the Netflix team is going to show up to work one day and be like, \"Hey, our product's good enough.\" We're always iterating, we're always improving. Customer needs are always evolving. There's always more we could do.\n\n(22:18):\nAnd so, we're seeing a shift from this project mindset that worked in a world where we were just trying to get products on a store shelf. We designed them, we built them, we manufactured them, we put them on the store shelf, we were done. We moved on to the next thing.\n\n(22:32):\nBut with digital products, there's no done. So we're seeing this shift to more of a continuous mindset. We're continuously evolving our products, which means we're continuously making decisions about what to build and, therefore, I think we need to continuously include the customer in that process. So for me, I define continuous discovery as building in those continuous feedback loops.\n\nLenny (22:55):\nAwesome. That's such a simple, clear way of thinking about this because, yeah, broadly it's like a new term people have to get used to. I think you saw I made a call on Twitter for people to ask me to ask you questions about continuous discovery. And so, I'm going to try to get as many of those in there in this chat as I can. One actually was around what do you do when your leaders tell you there's no time for discovery?\n\nTeresa Torres (23:18):\nYeah, this is a tough one. I think this comes from old project-based research methods. So we don't most of the time have time to stop what we're doing and go do some research. I'm not pooh-poohing research. I mean I've worked as a user researcher. Research is critical. If we had the luxury of doing long longitudinal studies, we would probably build better products.\n\n(23:40):\nThat's not our business environment. Our businesses are expecting us to deliver continuous value, so we need to look at how do we match that cadence. What I think is really nice about continuous discovery, you can do it in as little as an interview a week, on the interviewing side, on the discovering opportunity side.\n\n(23:58):\nAssumption testing. People always ask me, \"How much time should I be spending on an assumption testing?\" I don't know how to answer that question because for me, assumption testing and delivery are the same work. Assumption testing is the start of your delivery. I don't know where one starts and one ends, which is a little bit hard to conceptually work through, but maybe we can talk through an example.\n\n(24:20):\nSo when somebody says, \"I don't have time for discovery,\" I think what they're really saying is, \"I don't have time for project-based research,\" and I agree with that. We don't have time for project-based research. So if I'm getting that pushback, I want to look for, okay, I definitely don't ...\n\n(24:33):\nLike people make this mistake of we shouldn't put something in our backlog that hasn't been properly discovered. It's not true. Everything in our backlog is a bet, everything. Whether we do discovery or not, everything is a bet. Discovery is helping us make a better bet.\n\n(24:52):\nNow sometimes in our organizations, we need to do a lot of discovery and make as good of a bet as we can. But there's other times we can make a risky bet. There's times in business where it makes sense to make a risky bet. If you work somewhere where all of your bets have been risky because you're doing zero discovery, the best way to kill any appetite for discovery is to say, \"Let's stop making bets until we discover.\" No, don't do that. Keep making bets. In parallel, start doing some discovery so that eventually those bets get better.\n\n(25:29):\nI think the reason why people make this mistake is they think about it as phases. First I discover and then I deliver. No, you're always delivering and you're always discovering. The more you build this discovery habit, the better those bets are going to get with time.\n\n(25:44):\nSo it's not that you do one first and then the other. It's you're always doing both. The benefit of always doing both is with time you make better bets.\n\nLenny (25:51):\nYou said that you could do this with one meeting like an hour a week. I know you have a system that you recommend for people to make this automated so you're not just constantly pinging your customers, \"Hey, can I chat with you this week?\" Can you just share that?\n\nTeresa Torres (26:04):\nYeah. So my book, Continuous Discovery Habits, I do share some of the most common ways to automate the recruiting process. So this idea came from ... I had just read Nudge by Thaler and Sunstein, when it came out a few years ago. They had this idea of when you're designing a choice architecture, how do you make it easier to adopt the behavior you want to see than to not adopt the behavior?\n\n(26:26):\nSo I started thinking about this in the context of interviewing. I want to see product teams interview every week. So how do I make it easier for them to do that than to not do that?\n\n(26:35):\nOkay, well a lot of us have recurring meetings that we go to every week because they're on our calendar. So I just started to think about how do I make an interview a recurring meeting? Can I make it so that when you wake up on Monday morning, there's an interview on your calendar and you literally did nothing to get it there?\n\n(26:50):\nAnd so, there's a few ways to think about this. The most common strategy is to allow your customers to opt in while they're using your product or service. So just almost everybody's seen an NPS survey embedded in a product. That's pretty prevalent now. Same idea, but instead of saying, \"Would you recommend our product or service to a friend or colleague?\" it says, \"Do you have 20 minutes to talk to us?\" If they say yes, you send them some scheduling software, they pick a time on your calendar, and voila. You've got an interview scheduled.\n\n(27:18):\nYou obviously can get more advanced. Where do you show it? Who do you show it to? How much do you tailor it? How do you position it? But the core idea is to let people opt in while you already have their attention. That works really well for consumers and B2B end users.\n\n(27:34):\nIf you're trying to get in touch with buyers and decision-makers, same idea but use your internal teams that are already on the phone with those folks. So that salespeople, account managers, maybe support folks, they're literally on the phone with those people all day every day. So instead of using your product to recruit, you can use those teams to recruit.\n\n(27:54):\nWhat I do is I just have teams define a trigger every week, like, \"Hey, this week we're looking to talk to somebody who's experiencing this need or pain point. If you happen to be on the phone with someone who's experiencing that, again, just go ahead and use scheduling software, put it on our calendar.\" The goal is for the product team to not be involved at all. They literally just have to show up and connect the interview.\n\nLenny (28:15):\nThat's amazing. Are there tools that you recommend that are just plug and play that make this easy? I know Calendly is probably a part of this.\n\nTeresa Torres (28:21):\nThere are so many. So even on the scheduling side, I think Calendly innovated in that space, but there's so many fast followers. I think Outlook does this now. I think Google has a tool that does this now. I think even Salesforce has a tool that does this now. So if you're sales team is scheduling through Salesforce. Then on the intercept side, like how are you asking those? We have survey tools.\n\n(28:45):\nQualaroo, I think, innovated in this space. Then I think Ethnio is a fast follower. But Intercom does this, Usabilla does this, Chameleon does this. Hotjar might even do this. We have so many user research tools that they're all now enabling this type of thing.\n\nLenny (29:03):\nAwesome. For when you're actually doing the interviewing, we had a couple of questions from some Teresa fans. One is when you know what the solution should be, how do you stay disciplined and keep an open mind and keep searching for maybe something even better?\n\nTeresa Torres (29:17):\nYeah. First of all, you don't always have to do that. Not all solutions need a lot of discovery. That's a common misunderstanding, I think. I think we need to do really robust, good discovery on the things that are part of our core product experience or going to be differentiators. We don't really have to do really amazing core discovery on the forgot password flow if it's working fine and you're not hearing about it as a pain point.\n\n(29:42):\nNow to be fair, Slack with their magic link, did a cool thing with the forgot password flow. That was a nice innovative thing that I think moved the industry forward. So if you want to do discovery on that, great, but you probably don't have to. So I think the first thing to assess is we're making a bet. How much risk is involved in this bet and how much of that risk do we need to mitigate?\n\n(30:06):\nNow most companies think there's no risk in any bets and they do zero discovery. If you're not instrumenting your product and actually measuring the impact of those solutions, you may not be catching that there actually was a lot of risk. So I think you do need to instrument your product. You do need to measure the impact of everything that you release so you can start honing your judgment on where is there risk in ideas.\n\n(30:29):\nWhen you're new to discovery, I recommend you overindex on doing a little too much discovery so that you start honing your judgment of that risk. But if you're working on an opportunity that's really core to your product functionality, it is a differentiator, it's where you want to make sure you have a really robust, good solution, I think the best way to guard against what you think is the obvious solution is to work with multiple solutions for the same opportunity.\n\n(30:53):\nCompare and contrast. We already know this intuitively. When you're looking for a place to live, you don't look at one apartment or house. You look at multiple, you compare and contrast. When you're looking for a job, you don't talk to one company. We know if we want to make good decisions, we need options and we need to evaluate the pros and cons of each. The same is true in the product world.\n\n(31:13):\nSo if you're feeling like this needs to be a really good solution and we're having some challenges, we're overcommitting to one, that's when you need to increase your options.\n\nLenny (31:23):\nI'd love your insight on, as a PM, how much ... In theory, you should be a little bit unbiased and giving people a chance to change your mind and come up with ideas that maybe you disagree with. On the other hand, as a PM, you always have opinions about what the right answer is. Just like in the PM function, do you have a perspective on how much more, say, a PM should have maybe over what ends up being decided?\n\nTeresa Torres (31:47):\nYeah, this is a tough question. I mean there's such strong opinions about this. I mean I see analogies of the product manager is the decider and they're the CEO of the product. I think this is coming from toxic business culture personally. Business has taught us we all play a role. We have our functional silos. I have territory, you have territory, and we're going to play the internal office politics game. I need to defend my territory and you need to defend your territory.\n\n(32:13):\nThe outcome is that we don't really collaborate. When we don't collaborate, I don't think we build very good products. So if we just go back to real life and when you're hanging out with friends and you're trying to accomplish something, the example I gave is when you're a little kid and you're playing, you don't like to first stop and say, \"What's my role? What's your role?\" I guess it's just not how humans interact. We all collaborate and we all do it intuitively. Business has taught us otherwise.\n\n(32:40):\nI'm going to forget the researcher, but there's a really cool ... The marshmallow test experiment. Are you familiar with this? Where teams are given spaghetti sticks and some tape and some string and a marshmallow. They're told to build a structure to get the marshmallow as high as possible.\n\n(32:56):\nA study's been done so many times. It's been replicated a million times with lots of different groups. It's a really cool story because kindergartners outperform almost every adult group, including MBA students. It's really telling. Why is this?\n\n(33:10):\nKindergartners just start doing. They don't worry about their rules. They don't worry about who's in charge. They just brute force trial and error. What do MBA students do? There's posturing, like who has power and who's the decision-maker and who's right? We need a plan and we need to have a strategy. They spend the whole time negotiating this political social space instead of just doing. I really think we've got to learn how to get back to just doing.\n\n(33:37):\nAnd so, people think that I'm like Pollyanna naive about this, but I've worked on teams that work this way and I've coached teams that work this way where the trio really does decide. So the trio is the product manager, the designer, and the software engineer. If you've never worked in a well-functioning trio, this breaks people's brains, because they say, \"Well, what are we going to do when we disagree?\" You're going to find an option where you don't disagree.\n\n(34:00):\nThe thing is if you only worked on a siloed dysfunctional team, that sounds like a nightmare. But if you've worked on a well-functioning team that's doing discovery well together, you're working from a shared understanding. So your disagreements right away are going to go way down because you're working from a shared understanding, and when you disagree, you recognize, okay, we don't agree, we don't have the best option yet. You keep looking for that better option.\n\n(34:26):\nWhat's hard about talking about this is I fully understand probably 98% of the industry has never worked on a well-functioning product trio, and this idea sounds crazy. But I've also seen it in practice over and over again on really good teams, and there's something magical about it. So I'm going to keep promoting it and I'm going to hope that eventually we get from 2% to 3%. That'll be my little debt I put in the universe.\n\nLenny (34:49):\nYeah. I was just going to say that you're helping make that change and I'm excited for that to be the way that people operate. And so, maybe one takeaway is if that's something that you're spending a lot of time on and it's causing you a lot of stress, it probably means you're working at a company or on a team that maybe isn't optimal.\n\nTeresa Torres (35:05):\nI don't mean that to say there's something wrong with you or your teammates. This is a symptom of business culture. It's how we've been taught to work. So we have to unlearn that. We have to learn new ways of working. We do this in our courses. We force people to work in teams in our courses, and some people really hate it. But I think learning to work well in a team, especially when there's different perspectives and you disagree and how do you reconcile that, is a really important part of product work.\n\nLenny (35:32):\nAwesome. Going back to discovery and interviewing, I definitely wanted to ask you what are, I don't know, two or three tips and best practices for interviewing/what are two or three things people usually do wrong that they should try to avoid?\n\nTeresa Torres (35:47):\nYeah. The first one is the questions they're asking. So many people write these who why, how, 50-question long interview protocols. It leads to a cadence of the interview that is not a natural conversation. So I think the first thing to remember is that you're just talking to a human.\n\n(36:06):\nI actually tell people if your interview feels like you're having a beer with a buddy, that's a good sign. It should be that casual and that conversational. But we're not going to get there if I pepper you with 50 questions. We're going to get there by I'm going to collect your story. I'm going to be really curious. I might still have to pepper you with 50 questions to get your story, because there's this conversational norm of I say something, you say something. So I've got to teach you that I want your whole story and help you open up.\n\n(36:36):\nSo that's one piece of it. It's just the cadence of the conversation really should feel like a natural conversation. Then the second piece of it is how do we do that? What's the skill? How do we elicit that story?\n\n(36:46):\nI teach in our interviewing class, you really don't have to think about what to ask. You could run an entire interview by asking them one question. In fact, let's role play this a little bit. Lenny, tell me about the last time you watched something on a streaming entertainment service.\n\nLenny (37:00):\nJust last night I was watching Obi-Wan Kenobi on Disney+.\n\nTeresa Torres (37:04):\nOkay. Yeah. Great. Okay, so it was last night. Set the scene for me. Where were you?\n\nLenny (37:09):\nI was at home on my couch, just lounging.\n\nTeresa Torres (37:11):\nOkay. Tell me about the moment where you decided you wanted to watch something.\n\nLenny (37:15):\nIt was 8:00 and I'm like, \"It's time to watch something.\"\n\nTeresa Torres (37:18):\nOkay. Is that part of your normal routine?\n\nLenny (37:21):\nYeah, in the evenings. It's a good way to unwind and let my brain relax a little bit. Okay,\n\nTeresa Torres (37:25):\nOkay. So you're sitting on the couch, you decided it's time to watch something. What did you do next?\n\nLenny (37:30):\nTurned on the TV, went to Netflix, didn't find anything. Went to Prime, didn't find anything. I'm like, \"Oh yeah, Obi-Wan. Let's check that out.\"\n\nTeresa Torres (37:39):\nOkay. So I literally could continue this entire interview by just saying, \"Oh, you opened Netflix. What happened next? Oh, you didn't find anything. How come?\" All I have to do is just be curious about your experience. What I'm doing with my questions is just helping you tell the timeline.\n\n(37:59):\nSet the scene. I'm situating you back in that moment. Let's remember what you actually did. It was after dinner. You were sitting on the couch. What happened next? I can do that over and over again.\n\n(38:09):\nAnd so, one of the reasons why we get bad at interviewing, we're so worried about asking the next question, we stop listening to the interviewee. We just missed everything we were told. We missed those moments of like, \"Oh, there is some friction. You couldn't find something to watch. Tell me about that. What did you consider on Netflix? Let's dig into that.\"\n\n(38:27):\nIf I work on a team that's trying to help you find something to watch, that's a gold mine. You just told me you went on Netflix, you went on Prime. What were you looking at and what didn't resonate? Is it because you'd watched everything? Is it because it just didn't match your profile? There's so much to explore there.\n\n(38:44):\nBut what I see most teams do is they stay really shallow. \"Oh, okay. So you watched Obi-Wan on Prime. Great. Tell me another story.\" We just lost all the value.\n\n(38:57):\nAnd so, some of it is just slowing down and almost being a five-year-old. You really, instead of saying, \"Why? Why? Why?\" you can say, \"What happened next? What happened next?\"\n\n(39:08):\nNow there's this technique of summarize what you heard, show that you're listening to them, bring them back to the moment where you want a little more detail. But, yeah, it's a game-changer. What happens when you collect stories is you hear about things you would've never thought to ask about.\n\nLenny (39:23):\nIt's also really fun to share because I'm like, \"Oh, this is fun,\" just talking about what I do.\n\nTeresa Torres (39:27):\nI love that you just said that, because people worry. How many times have you heard somebody say, like ... You asked the sales rep, \"Hey, can I talk to your customer?\" and they're like, \"I don't want to ask them a favor.\" It turns out if you collect stories in your interviews, customers love it. Most of the time, in fact the sign that you ran a good interview, is your customer is going to say, \"Wow. When can we do this again?\"\n\nLenny (39:49):\nWow. I love that. The other piece of this that you haven't mentioned is there's a lot of focus on what you've done, not on what you would do or you could do. I imagine that's an important part of this.\n\nTeresa Torres (39:57):\nProduct people are in the business of changing behavior, understanding and changing behavior. I think that's a really big mistake that teams make is, both in their prototype tests and in their interviews, they focus on what people would do, on what people think, on why they think they do something. It's all really unreliable. It's a garbage in, garbage out situation. The real measure is tell me about your behavior. What did you actually do? We have to help people do that.\n\nLenny (40:25):\nSomething else someone asked that I really wanted to cover is how does this process change as your company grows from early stage to later stage?\n\nTeresa Torres (40:33):\nYeah. In an ideal world, it doesn't change because here's why. If I have a trio and they have an outcome and they're empowered to reach that outcome, and they're interviewing every week and their assumption testing to evaluate solutions, and they're finding things to build and they're driving their outcome, that's a really successful team. They could do that in a three-person company or they could do that in a hundred thousand-person company.\n\n(40:58):\nThe primary difference is in a three-person company, there's no adjacent teams. In a hundred thousand-person company, there's a lot of adjacent teams. And so, you probably have some dependencies to manage. But you still should start with an outcome, be empowered to go after it, be empowered to come up with your own solutions.\n\n(41:17):\nWhat's going to be different in that a hundred thousand-person company is you probably have design patterns and libraries you got to rely on for a coherent user experience. You probably have another team that's working adjacent to you that you need to share your discovery work and be aware of what they're working on, because you do need to build a coherent product.\n\n(41:34):\nAnd so, as our companies get bigger, we have a lot of that lateral collaboration we have to do to make sure we're still building a coherent product. But I think the fundamental base unit stays the same.\n\nLenny (41:47):\nSomething that I've seen happen with larger companies, especially as companies grow, is a little bit of cynicism of user research, specifically how few people you talk to and how that leads to you making a decision. How do you respond to those kinds of concerns?\n\nTeresa Torres (42:02):\nI love this. I don't know why product teams suddenly are held to a standard that nobody else is held to. When somebody says something like, \"Why is it reliable to make a decision based on one interview?\" I just flip the question around. Tell me about the decisions you made last week. How many customers did you talk to? What data did you use?\n\n(42:20):\nEvery human in business is making decisions with zero data. So I'm going to go with one is better than zero. That's a little bit of a flippant answer, but it's true.\n\n(42:32):\nHere's what's happening when that question comes up. I have an opinion that's different than yours. I don't like your conclusion so I'm going to nitpick it. In the product world, unfortunately, everybody in business has an opinion about what we should be building. And so, that's how we face that and we get held to this standard.\n\n(42:52):\nI have a real reason why we can make decisions based on small data. We're in the business of changing behavior, not seeking new knowledge. We have really good feedback loops. And so, we can make decisions based on small experiments because we're going to continue to get bigger feedback loops and more reliable data over time. Especially as we deliver and we do live production prototyping, we actually can get large-scale data. I don't want to start there because we're never going to ship anything.\n\n(43:17):\nSo there is legitimately a valid reason why we can work on small data, but it's an unfair question, because we're not holding anybody else in business to that standard.\n\nLenny (43:26):\nAlong those lines, when does it make sense to run an experiment versus rely on user research? Do you have a mental model for how you think about that?\n\nTeresa Torres (43:34):\nOur language around this is terrible. It's so ambiguous. What's an experiment? What's user research? I would say experiments are user research. I'm trying to just dramatically simplify this.\n\n(43:43):\nI think from a discovery standpoint, we have two core activities: qualitative interviewing and assumption testing. And so, with qualitative interviewing, we're trying to learn about the opportunity space. Where do we see unmet needs, pain points, and desires? Interviewing is not the only way to identify opportunities. Observations are actually a better way. I focus on interviewing because it's something we can do sustainably week over week. Most teams don't have the ability to observe their customers every week.\n\n(44:11):\nOn the assumption testing side, for me, anything that helps us evaluate a solution where we're starting with a very specific assumption is an assumption test. So we have experiments that I actually don't even think we should be running, because they're testing the whole idea before we have any idea if that idea has a strong foundation. They're taking too long. They cost too much money. They're taking too much time. So how do I break this down?\n\n(44:37):\nThe first thing is we have to learn how to take an idea and break it into its underlying assumptions. We have to learn how to prioritize those assumptions. Then we have to learn how to run tests that are small enough that they're just testing that assumption.\n\n(44:51):\nThis is all critical because it's what makes continuous discovery sustainable. I tell people to work with three ideas at once, and teams are struggling to test even a single idea. So how's that sustainable? Well, that team that's struggling to test a single idea is still stuck in project-based research world. They're running experiments that take weeks to get results.\n\n(45:13):\nWhereas when I talk about assumption testing, I'm working with a team that's running half a dozen to a dozen assumption tests in one week, and those assumptions span three ideas. At the end of the week, they can start to compare and contrast those solutions. So we've got to shift our methods. Continuous discovery is sustainable if we change our behavior, if we change our habits.\n\nLenny (45:36):\nFor folks that want to learn more about assumption testing, continuous discovery, all the things that you've been chatting about, where can they find you online and find these courses online?\n\nTeresa Torres (45:44):\nYeah. So first I'll mention the book, Continuous Discovery Habits. It's available at bookstores around the world. It's in EPUB, paperback, and Audible. Then I do blog about all of this at producttalk.org and our courses are at learn.producttalk.org.\n\nLenny (45:57):\nAwesome. I also love to ask guests, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nTeresa Torres (46:01):\nSince the book has come out, the reaction has been unbelievably amazing and a lot of fun. And I'm a little bit overwhelmed by people in the industry who have never been exposed to this way of working having a lot of skepticism that it's possible.\n\n(46:17):\nSo here's how listeners can be helpful. I didn't make up this way of working. This way of working evolved from teams figuring this out. I see it as I'm looking at how do I collect sustainable practices, making it as easy as possible for other teams to work this way?\n\n(46:34):\nSo I think the way listeners can help me is if you've never been exposed to this and you have healthy skepticism, that's awesome. And just ask yourself, imagine if this worked, imagine if this was possible, because I get really tired having to explain to people there really are teams that work this way. I'm sorry that you've never been exposed to it, but there really are teams that have worked this way. If you've never been exposed to that, go look for it. There's lots of evidence of it on the internet.\n\nLenny (47:03):\nAmazing. I'm hoping our chat helps fight the fight for that changing of minds. Teresa, thank you so much for being here. I had a blast. I learned a lot. Thank you.\n\nTeresa Torres (47:11):\nLenny, thanks so much for having me. This has been fun.\n\nLenny (47:15):\nThat was awesome. Thank you for listening.

  "transcript": "# Inside Etsy’s product, growth, and marketplace evolution | Tim Holley (VP of Product)\n\n## Transcript\n\nTim Holley (00:00:00):\nWhen the CDC mandated face masks in early April 2020, that's when essentially we went to sleep one day with our typical April traffic, typical April sales, and then it was Black Friday overnight. And in part, because nobody knew where to find face masks. Our sellers are incredibly astute business people. And if you had been making wedding dresses, and you know how to sew, and you've got material, and you've got a bit of time, making a mask is quite a simple task. And so we just saw this huge surge of demand, and then supply rising to meet it. \n(00:00:37):\nAnd we did something that as far as I know, we've never done in Etsy's past, which is we put out a call to our sellers to say, \"Now's the time. Now's the time to make face masks if you can.\" And so it felt like this is our time to shine, to really help sellers continue to make sales, to help buyers find this critical item that they were looking for. \n(00:00:57):\nAnd then from there, things kept going, and we really worked hard to make sure that the story was not just about face masks for our buyers, that they understood that Etsy's a place for so many different categories and so many different items.\nLenny (00:01:12):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard win experiences, building and growing today's most successful products. \n(00:01:20):\nToday my guest is Tim Holley. Tim is VP of product at Etsy, where he's been for over 10 years, and has helped grow Etsy from around 500 million in GMV to over 13 billion in GMV. This episode is for anyone working on marketplace, or looking for ideas to increase growth, or looking for advice on how to change your internal culture. We get into the big cultural transition that Etsy went through that took them to the next level. Lots of examples of product changes that helped them with conversion, acquisition, and retention. Plus how Etsy organizes their teams, thinks about supply versus demand dynamics, how Etsy got started with growing their initial supply, and also their initial demand. Plus a bunch of frameworks and hiring advice, and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Tim Holley after a short word from our sponsors.\n(00:02:07):\nThis episode is brought to you by productroadmap.ai and Ignition. Productroadmap.ai is the first AI roadmapping suite. It helps ensure roadmaps drive revenue, by instantly aligning product with your sales and marketing teams to capture upsell opportunities.\n(00:02:23):\nBuilt by early leaders from [inaudible 00:02:26] and Craft, it automatically identifies feature gaps from your CRM data and your customer conversations, adds them to shareable roadmaps, easily prioritized by revenue impact, and then seamlessly closes the loop with sales reps via targeted notifications when feature gaps are closed.\n(00:02:41):\nAs part of Ignition's broader go-to-market operating system, productroadmap.ai can also help create better handoffs and collaboration with product marketing teams, by giving both teams the tools to research, plan, orchestrate, and measure the process of building products and going to market. Packed with integrations, AI automation, and communication tools, it's truly a one-stop shop for product and marketing to bring things from concept to launch. To sign up, go to productroadmap.ai, and use promo code Lenny to get 75% off your first year.\n(00:03:14):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments.\n(00:03:28):\nWherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools, or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.\n(00:03:41):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform, where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics, and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription, and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com, and 10X your experiment velocity.\n(00:04:24):\nTim, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\nTim Holley (00:04:28):\nThank you for having me on, Lenny, really appreciate it. Looking forward to it.\nLenny (00:04:30):\nI'm looking forward to it even more. So you've been at Etsy for I think over 10 years, although I did notice that you left for a year and ended up leading product at SoulCycle. So first of all, what is that about? What happened there?\nTim Holley (00:04:43):\nYeah, at the time, I'd been at Etsy for over six years, and I just had the itch. I wanted to go work on a different product, build different things, experience different industry. Along, had a theory that working on the proactive side of healthcare, meaning fitness and wellness, is how you achieve better outcomes. And it felt like SoulCycle was a really interesting way to do that. Pretty well-known brand, high street presence in many cities. Could you affect change through that? \n(00:05:12):\nUltimately realized it wasn't a place that I wanted to spend a ton of time and energy. And so through a lot of soul-searching, grown, I know I found my way back to Etsy, really anchoring on three things. One, working on a product that you care about that adds value to other people's lives. And so what we do every day at Etsy is we help our sellers make sales, and that's really meaningful for the vast majority of them. It's reaching an audience that they wouldn't be able to reach. And so that feels like a really great thing to get up every morning and work on. \n(00:05:46):\nAnd so that's maybe the business and the product side, and the other side is people. It might sound a little twee, but just working with people who you can learn from and who you respect, and ultimately can have fun working with, it matters a ton. We spend a lot of time of our days and our lives at work, and so doing it with people who you really value, it's awesome. \n(00:06:05):\nI have one memory that we used to have an engineer who used to be a standup comedian, and so that really pushed the boundaries of what a standup meant every day. And it was always a little fun, a little exciting. You never quite knew what you were going to get. And so just little things like that, they make the work life really, really great.\nLenny (00:06:25):\nThat's hilarious. I never thought it that way. I feel like every standup needs a standup comedian in their standup. Sounds like that should be part of agile. We should need to change the manifesto. \n(00:06:35):\nSo I've always seen the Etsy journey from the outside, and so there's a few things that I've always wanted to dig into. One is I just remember this New York Times story back in the day when your current CEO Josh Silverman joined, and it felt like a huge moment in the history of Etsy, where it feels like it just kind of transitioned from this touchy feely, everyone loves each other moment to just like, \"Hey guys, we got to build a real business here that's sustainable.\" And it feels like many startups have to go through that transition where it's like, \"Nothing's ever going to change. It's going to be so we're all family here,\" to just, \"Things have to change. This isn't working.\" I'm curious what that was like living through that. \nTim Holley (00:07:15):\nYeah, I mean the first thing I'll say is it was a hard transition, and I was personally fortunate in the sense that the transition you're speaking of in 2017 also happened to coincide with rounds of layoffs. And I was super fortunate that I didn't lose my job, so I don't want to presuppose that my version of hard is the same as another person's version of hard.\n(00:07:38):\nBut I think a lot of us, and myself included, we had a lot of our identity tied up in Etsy and what we're doing, a really deep passion for the mission of the business and what we're trying to achieve. I just mentioned helping small independent sellers. And just to be clear, that hasn't gone away. I think that that's something we've been really successful at pulling through as a line that was true 10 years ago and is still true today. But it was a time when we were really forced to rethink a lot of how we worked and what we worked on. \n(00:08:12):\nJust to use a small example, we had had a pretty entrenched consensus-based culture, where we would really debate a lot of decisions and a lot of features. And on the one hand, I think that that does lead to good outcomes, right? Thoughtful products that have a lot of viewpoints really baked into the core of the thinking. \n(00:08:33):\nOn the other hand, not fast. When you have your identity tied up in the company and what you do, and then you're kind of being asked or you realize that you need to change how you're working, it can feel pretty existential. It's really cutting to the core of who you are and things that you hold really true. \n(00:08:53):\nThe reality is it's a business, and we needed to get faster at launching features, improving the experience, and ultimately, having a predictable way to drive GMS, gross merchandise sales, which is our north star KPI. And so it definitely took some time to work through that, but we got to a good place, and the results over the last few years to some degree speak for themselves. But it was a testing and trying time for sure.\nLenny (00:09:20):\nI'm always curious how these changes play out and what works in making change. Is there something that you remember that Josh did well or that leaders did well to help that transition? \nTim Holley (00:09:29):\nOne thing that is just such a standout is having... And I mentioned GMS as our north star KPI, just having that, being absolutely front and center, being the drumbeat that we talk about in every meeting, the measuring stick that we measure the success of launches against. And maybe it's a bit surprising, but we didn't have that type of clarity in the past.\n(00:09:51):\nAnd so rallying everyone around that. And you might not pay into it directly. You might pay into it through one or two levels of abstraction, but you're still clearly aligned with what the company's trying to achieve. And that was something that was a really stark difference, and I think that helped.\n(00:10:09):\nIt helped the prioritization discussion a lot. If you can't really articulate why this thing matters to driving GMS and the type of timeframe that we're talking about, be it a quarter or 12 months out, and different projects will contribute in different ways. But that was just one huge standout, and that's been a drumbeat over the years that let's continue to stay focused on that as a metric. \n(00:10:32):\nThe other thing to me is bringing an outside in perspective, really benchmarking against your competitors and your competitive set. Don't get me wrong, I think Etsy is a unique marketplace. Our sellers are independent sellers. They sell unique items. The reality though is that our buyers are shopping all over the internet. They're shopping on High Street, they're shopping in different places. And so we have to be aware of the broader context of where they're spending their dollars helps us make better decisions over time.\n(00:11:04):\nAnd so on the one hand, there is no one-to-one direct competitor to Etsy. But there are other businesses and other brands that are competing for eyeballs or wallets that we need to be aware of. And bringing that into the discussion was a really helpful one that helped ground us in the overall dynamics of what buyers are doing,, where they're spending their money, and how they think about us.\nLenny (00:11:28):\nIs there anything else you took away as a leader from watching that shift, that you bring to making change, transitioning people to working in a different way?\nTim Holley (00:11:36):\nDefinitely focus on a clear KPI that the teams can rally around. That's one. The other is... And I respect Josh immensely on his ability to tell a really clear narrative and use that consistently over time. The old adage of you need to say something three times before people understand it. I would wager you need to say it another three times before they internalize it.\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And having that be part of the day-to-day conversation, it seems like such a small thing, but it adds up to having clarity on goal, the KPI point, and then clarity on why, the narrative point. If you can marry those two things, I think that's an incredibly powerful combination.\nLenny (00:12:15):\nWhile we're on this topic, I'm curious what Etsy's values are. I imagine you've codified a few, we call them core values at are Airbnbs or something like that at Etsy. And if so, I'm curious what they are.\nTim Holley (00:12:26):\nWe call them guiding principles at Etsy. We have a few of them, and I won't go through all of them, but just to give you a flavor, one of them is around digging deeper, and that really speaks to aiming to really understand the why behind a change, to really push on the insights that we're learning through qual or quant research, or other inputs that we might be looking at in order to make the best decision possible with the information we have at the time. \n(00:12:52):\nAnother example of a principle is minimizing waste. It aligns with how we think about product development, which is, we want to know, is the work we're doing adding value to the customer and the business? And so something that isn't working out a lot of times in product development we're wrong. And so being able to say, \"No, this is no longer valuable, we need to move on to the next thing,\" has been something that's served us really well.\n(00:13:17):\nUltimately, we are quite a small team. There's just over 2,000 people in the business, and if you then scale back to engineering and product, we're not big. And so we have to be really diligent about how we're investing our time and our resources in order to be successful.\nLenny (00:13:31):\nAwesome. Okay, so another big moment as an outsider that it feels like Etsy went through is during Covid. There's this huge transition to e-commerce, and I think Etsy was a big beneficiary of that. People wanting to buy more stuff online, go to stores less. And it feels like it was a huge accelerant for the business. I'm curious just what that experience was like leading the product team through that.\nTim Holley (00:13:51):\nIt was quite wild, I'll say that. And to be more specific, as many or all of us did in probably the world of tech at least, we went home not knowing what the next weeks or weeks as we thought would bring, turns out years. But when the CDC mandated face masks in, I think it was early April 2020, that's when essentially we went to sleep one day with our typical April traffic, typical April sales, and then it was Black Friday overnight.\n(00:14:26):\nAnd in part because nobody knew where to find face masks. Our sellers are incredibly astute business people. And if you had been making wedding dresses, and you know how to sew, and you've got material, and you've got a bit of time, making a mask is quite a simple task. And so we just saw this huge surge of demand, and then supply rising to meet it.\n(00:14:47):\nAnd we did something that far as I know we've never done an Etsy's past, which is we put out a call to our sellers to say, \"Now's the time. Now's the time to make face masks if you can.\" And so it felt like this is our time to shine, to really help sellers continue to make sales, to help buyers find this critical item that they were looking for.\n(00:15:08):\nSo it was a very, very exciting couple of weeks while we were kind of adapting to that change. And we were just really... Every day there would be standups. \"What's happening? What do we need to change?\"\n(00:15:20):\nI remember distinctly, we were worried about certain sellers not being able to meet the demand that they were seeing. And so we did the old-fashioned thing, of not personally, but we called them and we said, \"How are you guys doing? What can we do to help?\" And some people said, \"We've got this, don't worry. This is squarely in our wheelhouse. We can absolutely meet the supply.\" And others said, \"Actually, we need a little bit of help. We need to take a pause for a moment while we catch up with all these orders, and then we can come back to taking more.\"\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And so just getting back to good old-fashioned know your customer, what do they need from you at that moment was just a really kind of powerful thing that took away from that time. \n(00:16:03):\nAnd then from there, things kept going, and we really worked hard to make sure that the story was not just about face masks for our buyers, that they understood that Etsy's a place for so many different categories and so many different items. And that was then the next phase of the challenge. We got a huge influx of new or reactivated buyers. How do we keep them around? How do we make sure that the product does a little bit more work to retain them, and can really have hooks that bring them back time and again? And so that was kind of the journey that we then went on mid-2020, to probably the subsequent 18 months or so.\nLenny (00:16:39):\nIs there anything you learned as a leader working in leading teams through that time? It must've been a pretty surreal experience, a lot of stress, people worrying about their own health.\nTim Holley (00:16:46):\nI was one of the fortunate ones back then. No kids, worked in an industry that was clearly critical at the time. So I am in awe of how parents worked through that time. So stressful yes, but not to the extent that other people experienced the stress of Covid. \n(00:17:05):\nWe just tried a lot of stuff. I remember early on, I think we had maybe even daily, but at least three times a week coffee chats with the team, just like, \"How are you guys doing? What's going on?\" And at a certain point we realized all we're talking about is exactly the same things. Nobody wants to be on more calls and more video video chats. And so we just continued to evolve, and really try to keep a pulse on what the team needs.\n(00:17:29):\nAnd that, like I said, given context of being parents or whatever, differed pretty dramatically person to person. So definitely wasn't a one size fits all solution. That's more on the people side.\n(00:17:40):\nI think on the product side, as I mentioned, we were really starting to get focused on driving retention, or maybe said slightly differently, driving frequency. And that was a newer topic for us. We've long at Etsy been a really, and maybe rose-tinted glasses speaking a little bit, but a really great experiment, A/B testing driven culture. And so when you think about things like retention, you can absolutely test, course I'm not saying you can't, but you're looking at a different time horizon. Instead of someone making a purchase in that visit or in a week, you're looking at do they come back in 30 days, in 60 days, in 90 days?\n(00:18:19):\nAnd so that forced us out of our comfort zone to some degree in terms of how we understand, how we measure change, how long we're willing to wait to see it show up. Back to the incrementality point on minimizing waste, is this actually adding value to the business? And so those were great challenges to tackle, of course on a pretty heightened degree of intensity and focus from the business. But that was an exciting time.\nLenny (00:18:46):\nOkay. So speaking of that, I want to chat about the marketplace and the marketplace you've built and things you've learned from building. I think it's one of the, I don't know, maybe top 10 marketplace businesses in the world, somewhere in there. And first of all, I'm curious just broadly, what have you learned is really important to just building a really successful thriving marketplace? And then I'll dig into more details. But just broadly, is there anything that comes to mind?\nTim Holley (00:19:09):\nThis narrative is still there, but I think we really focused heavily on the seller side, so the supply side of the business early on. And we really immersed ourselves in who sellers are, what they need, and how what they need maybe differs from what the solutions that they can find elsewhere.\n(00:19:30):\nBack in the day, we were doing studio visits with sellers. We were going to their workshops, we were going to their homes. We were seeing how they make items, we were seeing how they package and ship them out. We were bringing them into the office when we were running hack weeks to say, \"Hey, we've got this crazy idea. Is this interesting?\" So trying to involve them in the product development process to the extent that it was reasonable or feasible. \n(00:19:57):\nAnd so I think that served us really well. We have a very deep and rich understanding of our sellers. And then the next phase and the more recent phase has been, how do we create a world-class buyer experience that ultimately drives sales for our sellers? Because when you have over 100 million items, all of which are unique, you've got a different challenge than when you have 10,000 SKUs that you could kind of find anywhere or on many retailers.\n(00:20:22):\nAnd so topics like structured data, topics like how do we help you gain confidence? Buyer this thing will meet your needs from a seller who you may never have heard of. They don't have a brand that you you've ever encountered before. And so we have some kind of somewhat unique challenges on that front where we need to lean into themes that other marketplaces absolutely touch on. \n(00:20:45):\nFor example, customer reviews play a big role in our experience, but they play a heightened role given the things I mentioned, right? Unique inventory from a seller that is maybe an independent person who is a single entrepreneur, it's one person. \nLenny (00:21:04):\nSo you mentioned that initially, the focus was on sellers, which is really interesting because a lot of marketplaces, first of all need to figure out which side do we focus on? Who do we cater to most? And the way you described it is initially it was how do we make sure the sellers that are joining at Etsy are most well-served? And then later on it became more of a focus on the buyer side?\nTim Holley (00:21:22):\nYeah, I guess I'm painting it as a linear approach. It certainly was not. Because if you've got supply without demand, then you don't really have a marketplace. If you've got demand and no supply to meet it, then you also don't have a marketplace. So there's this flip-flop between, do you have enough supply to satiate the demand you have? And playing that out is certainly, I feel like art, not necessarily strictly science.\nLenny (00:21:48):\nYeah. So I'm curious how you all think about that actually. So at Airbnb, there's always this thinking of, who do we prioritize if we have to make a decision? is it host or guest? And it's shifted over the years at Airbnb. How do you all think about that as a, \"Here's who we're going to prioritize if we really have to make a decision\"?\nTim Holley (00:22:06):\nAnd maybe to your point, that's also evolved at Etsy. And the place we're in at the moment is the job of a marketplace, even pre the technology definition of a marketplace is a seller will go there to make sales. And if they're not making sales, they probably won't go to that marketplace. And so we really see it as paramount that we have a qualified set of buyers who are looking for the items, the type of items our sellers are selling, and that we can help them make a purchase decision, and therefore a seller maker sale. \n(00:22:41):\nThat doesn't mean that every single team is working on building features for buyers because it doesn't work. Not least because you have a limited piece of real estate marketplace. And if you have too many teams working on it at one time, you'll end up getting in each other's way, and you won't be that productive. And so of course, we have a team that's laser focused on improving the seller experience. How do they list their inventory? How do they manage their sales? How do they fulfill their items? As one example.\n(00:23:08):\nBut really back to the GMS is the north star, GMS represents a buyer buying from a seller. So it doesn't necessarily say build only for one of your audiences or one of your customers, but it says that that's really the job to be done here is helping facilitate that transaction.\nLenny (00:23:24):\nThat's exactly the same transition Airbnb went through. Initially it was focus on hosts, make sure hosts are the happiest people, and do everything we need to make them happy. And then eventually the business is the customers buying the product, and you have to make sure that they're the happy people. And sometimes you have to push hosts to do things they're not as excited to do for the good of the guest side.\nTim Holley (00:23:47):\nAnd I think it's also the fact that we as the marketplace, and I'm curious if this was true at Airbnb as well, but we have the insight into information, into data, that an individual seller won't. And so we can help them make hopefully better decisions that lead to sales, leveraging the insights that we have. \n(00:24:06):\nIf you put an item on sale during this time period, chances are it's going to resonate with buyers, and you might get an incremental sale. And so trying to be really data-driven in how we help and guide sellers to take actions that we really believe will be valuable for them and their business, because simply, they're either a small business owner and so they don't have time to do that level of digging. Or it's simply not accessible to them because they have the worldview of their business, and we're looking at the entirety of the marketplace.\nLenny (00:24:37):\nMaybe on this thread going a little nerdier, how do you think about supply constraint versus demand constraint? Is that something that comes up? I imagine maybe it's per category.\nTim Holley (00:24:45):\nAt the high level, we have 100 million items. So if you take that number at face value, you would think we do not have a supply constraint. We want to drive buyers to that supply. When you dig in maybe a more category, subcategory, sub subcategory level, that's where we do start to see pockets where, maybe we want to increase the type and the amount of inventory we have in wall decor. Seeing something behind you, that might not be the right example. But that's where we then start to focus and say, are there areas where we want to lean in?\n(00:25:21):\nUltimately, really thinking about, how do we help buyers choose? Because that's when you have 100 million items and even in a sub subcategory or for a specific search query, you still generally have a lot of results to choose from. How do you distinguish one item or one seller from another, based on the needs that you have? When is it going to arrive? How much does it cost? Is it this size or that size? So really trying to lean into those types of things. And again, to some degree that's econ 101. But given the scale we're at, it is a pretty unique challenge.\nLenny (00:25:55):\nWhat are ways you encourage your sellers to offer the things that you think you're lacking?\nTim Holley (00:26:01):\nBack to that data-driven point, right? If we can clearly articulate that if you show more photos, you will help buyers understand your item in new ways, in deeper ways, then you're more likely to make a sale. That's maybe a somewhat reductive example, but those are the types of things where we generally know either through the data that we observe based on activity on the marketplace, and/or through the research we're doing, that this will be valuable. The challenge is often, we have so many things that we want our sellers to do. What's the most important thing for them to do right now? \n(00:26:37):\nAnd that maybe changes somewhat seasonally. We're slowly starting to get towards the holiday season. And that just has a heightened purchase. It's a heightened time of purchasing. And contrast that with when it's around Mother's Day, maybe different type of inventory works really well. And so we need different inputs from our sellers. Because ultimately, they're business people. They have limited time in the day, and they want to spend time making. So how can we make sure that the time they spend on Etsy, managing their inventory, offering customer support is as valuable as possible?\nLenny (00:27:09):\nSo essentially in product messaging and recommendations that you're showing to the sellers is the way you communicate to them?\nTim Holley (00:27:16):\nYeah. And to some degree, we use the buyer experience to kind of signal what matters, right? When we're clearly highlighting photos, then that's obviously a very overly simple example.\nLenny (00:27:29):\nSellers [inaudible 00:27:30] here's what the search experience is highlighting.\nTim Holley (00:27:33):\nAs an example, yeah. And then really thinking about some of the signals or the snippets of information that we highlight. What goes into that? We know that great customer service a seller, they'll be responding to... We call them convos, but messages on our platform. They'll be responding really quickly. And that's something that we then highlight in the experience, and that if you're meeting that criteria, then we can start to signal to a buyer that, yes, this person offers really excellent customer service, and we can set your expectations accordingly.\nLenny (00:28:06):\nAwesome. Yeah, we saw the same thing at Airbnb. One of the things that I worked on, that was one of the bigger shifts in the marketplace was shifting Airbnb to an instant buying experience. And many hosts didn't want that, because they really wanted to vet the guest and make sure they are happy with them. But it ended up being so important to conversion that we just encouraged them to turn it on. \n(00:28:25):\nAnd one of the ways that worked best is exactly what you shared, where in the search experience, when someone came and searched, we just defaulted the search results to only show you instantly bookable listings. And hosts started to realize, \"Oh shit, this is where things are going. I think I got to really take this seriously.\" And that worked really well.\nTim Holley (00:28:42):\nYeah, interesting. \nLenny (00:28:43):\nPulling that thread a little bit more, I'm curious what you've seen as some of the bigger conversion wins on the buyer's side in terms of experiments you've run that have had some of the bigger impact.\nTim Holley (00:28:53):\nI won't say we're consistently, because that suggests that we don't know what we're doing we do. We're often surprised by what works in an outsized way and what we think is going to be a knock it out of the park success, ends up being of minimal value. But coming back to maybe some of the themes alluded to earlier, reviews have long been really important. \n(00:29:13):\nAnd when you're reviewing an item like I said, that's unique, that's from an independent seller, the type of information that another buyer is looking for is maybe a little different than other marketplaces, or even platforms that they might be shopping on.\n(00:29:27):\nAnd so really trying to lean into, well, what does it look like in a buyer's hand, in a buyer's home? Maybe that gives the next purchaser a bit more confidence that it's the right size, it's the right color, whatever it might be. And so that's long been a track that has been very fruitful for us, and continues to be something that we iterate on, that we focus on.\nLenny (00:29:47):\nJust I understand, that essentially it's recommending to sellers, \"Here's the photos you should have on your list.\"\nTim Holley (00:29:52):\nRather, collecting from buyers. So a seller will give us the photos that they're going to take, and then we can augment those with the, we call them buyer review photos. But ultimately, the experience the purchaser is having either through photo or video is super, super valuable.\nLenny (00:30:12):\nGreat. Okay, cool. So adding specific photos that you find help buyers convert. Keep going.\nTim Holley (00:30:18):\nAnd then the other side is really leaning into maybe more the behavioral economic tactics of just helping buyers make decisions. Signals and nudges is how you'll see it referred to in literature. And we've seen great success in elevating little snippets of information that really help a buyer understand, \"There is actually only one of these. Well, that's good information to know.\" It's something that then fits into their decision-making process that might've otherwise been buried.\n(00:30:48):\nAnd so really leaning into the quick summaries, the easy glanceable information that enables a buyer to gain enough confidence to say, \"Yep, out of these 100 million items or the results for this search query, this is the one that I feel best about buying.\" We've seen lots of success on that track as well. \nLenny (00:31:10):\nThat was a track at Airbnb as well. One of the ways they did this is they called it a rare gem, which is something that's available right now, that's very popular, and they created this kind of iconography for it. And engineers on the team ended up for Halloween dressing up as a rare gem. It became a whole thing at the company. And what's funny about Airbnb is every home is a one of a kind. There's only one left always, and there's always jokes about, \"We should always be one left, you better book now.\"\nTim Holley (00:31:36):\nI believe it was introduced... I don't believe. I know it was introduced as issue or a bug. But we ended up showing four stars and the fifth star when it was a half star, got rendered as a horse emoji. And so for a second there on Etsy, we had four stars and a horse showing up for some of our review ratings. And that spawned a huge amount of internal fun. And then back to your point around Halloween, we had a few teams being four stars and a horse. It was pretty interesting. \nLenny (00:32:15):\nWas it like five people were four people were a star and there's a horse person?\nTim Holley (00:32:18):\nYeah, exactly.\nLenny (00:32:21):\nToday's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file, and building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sync for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, the customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug. \n(00:32:43):\nMost tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. \n(00:33:01):\nSpreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53, and never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.\n(00:33:27):\nSo going down this track a little bit more, one of the biggest wins for Airbnb's search experience was this very small idea of just, what if you open each listing in the search results in a new tab, and ended up converting 1%, like increasing conversion by 1%? Is there anything like that that you remember that you've done of just like, \"Holy moly, that was so simple, but such a big win\"?\nTim Holley (00:33:47):\nYeah, we have similar learnings around that exact example. Oftentimes I think about effort and reward. So it might be a smallish GMS win or conversion rate win, but it was a one line text change. And we've seen those where we add a small snippet of, maybe we feel like it's almost marketing copy, and it ends up having an outsized impact. \n(00:34:13):\nWe had one example where we added some text to the cart experience, and we just saw huge uplift that we really, really didn't expect. It was more us communicating our values as a business, and it was something that really seemed to resonate with our buyers. And so that drove conversion. We've got examples where it's a one line copy change, and it's quite shocking the impact that that can have.\nLenny (00:34:37):\nI'm curious what that change actually was, the text change that had that much impact, if you can recall.\nTim Holley (00:34:42):\nWe've long and continued to invest in sustainability, and the text change was in our cart where we call out Etsy offsets carbon emissions from every delivery. And just adding that simple line of text was something that, like I said, really resonated with our buyers and the type of customer that comes to Etsy, and really drove conversion.\nLenny (00:35:03):\nI had Ronny Kohavi on the podcast who's one of the lead experts on experimentation, and he had the stat that 80% of experiments fail at each company on average. Does that sound about right in terms of how you guys find experiments working out? \nTim Holley (00:35:18):\nYeah.\nLenny (00:35:18):\nAwesome. Okay. What is your just general philosophy and experimentation? Does everything run as an experiment? Do things sometimes not run an experiment? How do you think about that at Etsy?\nTim Holley (00:35:28):\nRight now, the vast majority of our changes do. And to be perfectly candid, I think that's one of our growth edges as a product org, and maybe even as a company, is bringing in different ways to validate changes. Because to some degree, or maybe the way I think about experimentation, that's the highest bar. That proves with near absolute certainty that there's a causal relationship between the change you made and the KPI that you want to move.\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]But I think that it maybe misses the point in some changes or some areas where you are working towards a bigger net new thing or this specific change won't really be indicative of the greater whole you're building towards.\n(00:36:14):\nSo like I said, I mentioned earlier, we've long been a very A/B testing driven organization, not least because Etsy's background and history has deep, deep roots in an incredible engineering culture. And so that's really tried and true. So the vast majority of things are tested in that way. \n(00:36:33):\nWe're expanding how we think about looking at cohorts over time. I mentioned retention earlier, that to some degree, it necessitates a different type of test. When we look at our SEO work, you can't think about it in exactly the same ways.\n(00:36:46):\nBut the through line is, is the change that we're making adding value? And that's what we want to try to understand. A/B testing is a great way to do that. There are others, some of which we're starting to employ, others that we we'll continue to investigate and think about how we can leverage.\nLenny (00:37:02):\nIs there an example of anything? And if there's not, that's totally cool, of something that you shipped that was maybe negative on an experiment results, or you just didn't want to write as an experiment.\nTim Holley (00:37:12):\nWhen we're collecting inputs from sellers, we just simply don't feel it's appropriate to not either show or honor. We talk about a tried and true practice of sales and discounting. If a seller offers something on sale, then we need to show that. We are really curious about how that actually drives buyer behavior. And there's ways that we can kind of construct pre-post analysis and things like that to try to understand the impact. But ultimately, those are the kind of areas where we err on the side looking at our data in different ways. And so we have maybe a slightly different degree of confidence in the value, but we're still confident that it does help the marketplace as a whole.\nLenny (00:37:55):\nThat's a great example. Yeah, I'm not sure what I do there. That is tricky. So we've been talking about conversion. I'm curious in terms of acquisition, what you've seen work. And just generally, how do people find Etsy? How do you drive top of funnel for Etsy?\nTim Holley (00:38:06):\nYes. There's two sides to Etsy, right? There's the seller and the buyer. Getting in the Wayback Machine, on the seller side, we would be at craft fairs like Renegade and other places where our sellers were selling in person and really letting them know that Etsy exists. And so that was very boots on the ground, let's get out and try to acquire sellers into the marketplace. Some of that predates me to some degree. We were probably doing it on the tail end when I joined.\n(00:38:37):\nAnd then we have a lot of great word of mouth through our sellers. A seller probably knows other people who are similarly inclined to be incredible craftspeople, who want to sell their items. And so we've seen some success with our... We have a Teams platform where sellers can come together, ask each other questions, and the word of mouth type of growth through that.\n(00:38:56):\nOn the buyer side, we really leveraged the fact that we have a ton of inventory. And to some degree, it ends up being quite a long tail of inventory where we can meet really niche and specific needs. And so that lends itself really well to thinking about SEO, lends itself really well to thinking about Google Shopping, where someone is not on Etsy, but is often looking for something either somewhat or very specific. And we can really meet their needs in a really meaningful way by showing them not only just a single item, but maybe that and then other options that they might find that are of a similar vein, in a similar, sub categories in some cases. And so those have been long tried and true areas that we've invested in, and we've seen really great success in driving new buyers to Etsy.\nLenny (00:39:44):\nI've researched and written about that story of how Etsy started with sellers and craft fairs. And so that's a really classic story. And I think there's also an element of the early sellers drove the early buyers, because they're just advertising their listing page, \"Here's where you could go buying,\" which is a really unfair rare, opportunity to grow the marketplace by just focusing on sellers.\nTim Holley (00:40:04):\nI mean, yes, and a seller is a buyer. And so if they're making something that they've poured their heart into, chances are they will value that exact same behavior in someone else. And so if they're selling an item, they're looking for other things in maybe not their exact category, but in adjacent categories, and they become buyers. So it is a nice dynamic when that starts to work.\nLenny (00:40:29):\nYeah. So many natural advantages to getting this marketplace off the ground. How cool is that? You mentioned word of mouth as a big part of how Etsy started spreading. I imagine even today there's a lot of just, \"Hey, you should check out Etsy.\" Is there anything you've done that accelerates word of mouth or build on word of mouth, referrals comes to mind? Is there anything along those lines?\nTim Holley (00:40:46):\nYeah, we dabbled with referral programs a while ago, probably eight some years ago. What we saw, it was a different time. And so I think we maybe didn't value a new buyer, for example, in the way we do today. Because to some degree, you're unlocking future value. They make a single purchase, and then the bet is over time they'll go on to make subsequent purchases. We didn't necessarily have that as deep an understanding then as we do now. So our buyer referral program ultimately wasn't a huge success.\n(00:41:15):\nBut on the seller side, this was back in the days of Dropbox referral program being a huge, huge driver of their growth, and the whole get concept that was really prevalent back then. And on the seller side, one of the things that we really leaned into was, on Etsy, for those who aren't familiar, it costs 20 cents to list an item.\n(00:41:36):\nAnd that may seem like a very small financial outlay to get started, but it's a little bit of a barrier. And the more we can do to remove those, the higher chance that someone will either become a seller or list more items.\n(00:41:51):\nSo we really leaned into that as the currency for the seller referral program. And coming back to what I said around Teams, that was a really great way to supercharge some of that activity that was either happening, but more of it could happen, or really helping a seller understand, \"Oh yeah, there is a hook here. If I offer this person, I refer them, they'll get some listing credits. It'll be easier for them to open their shop. And then when I need to list more items, I also have credits that I can apply.\" So that was one small area. I wouldn't say it was a huge driver of growth. But in certain markets, in certain pockets, we saw it work pretty well.\nLenny (00:42:27):\nAwesome. That also helps with fraud, which is a huge problem with referral programs where the credit is just, you can list on Etsy. It's not like you can steal a lot of money away from the business. So that's clever.\nTim Holley (00:42:39):\nYeah.\nLenny (00:42:40):\nOkay. I want to talk about one other part of the funnel, retention. Is there anything you've learned that has been really effective to help with the retention?\nTim Holley (00:42:46):\nWe have long had features that are retentive in their nature. Things like, on Etsy, we call them favorites. That might be liking or a similar action on other places. But how do we think about the habit loop of if you take an action, what's the trigger and then what's the reward? \n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And so using a favorite as an example, you favorite an item. That's a pretty strong ish... Of course, adding it to your cart or maybe purchasing it, that's the strongest of signals, but you've shown intent. \n(00:43:21):\nSo what can we do with that information? We can then say, \"The seller put it on sale. You should come back and check it out. This is selling out. There's only one of this item left. You showed some intent, you might want to come back and get it.\" And that's just one example of trying to close those loops.\n(00:43:35):\nAnd that's where we've worked on things like, we call it the updates feed, essentially a feed of activity that you've taken, that we're demonstrating how it's changed, what's new, and then pulling in the tried and true tactic of push notifications to make you aware of that, such that you're using your phone all the time. You see that show up. That's a pretty great notification to get right. \"The thing that I really liked is now on sale. I want to check that out.\"\n(00:44:00):\nAnd so those are examples where really leaning into that habit loop framework has helped us understand, we've got a lot of this activity. How do we close the loop? How do we make it really valuable for our buyers?\nLenny (00:44:11):\nZooming out a little bit, it's kind of wild that Etsy can exist in a world of eBay and Amazon. And I'm just curious what it is that you think the founders and the team did early on to carve out this space of, I know you could buy things from people, you can buy things on Amazon really quickly, to create a world where Etsy builds this massive business that continues to thrive. What do you think was done so well to carve out the space?\nTim Holley (00:44:36):\nI think that to some degree, resolves down to... And maybe that's a little too extreme, but a key component is the brand. The brand stands for something in people's minds. And that helps understand you're not going to get the same inventory on Etsy. You shouldn't expect the same inventory on Etsy as you might be looking for on eBay. It doesn't make sense to our buyers. The items that our sellers sell are unique. \n(00:45:07):\nAnd so I think that as the core nugget, combined with how we think about policies, and our way to some degree, maintain the integrity of the marketplace, those two things combined do set us apart. And I think if you ask many people, certainly here in the US, what they think of Etsy, a very specific image will be conjured up. That may be one that we want to evolve and build on, but it feels quite distinct. \n(00:45:37):\nAnd it's not the same as eBay and it's not the same as Amazon. And I think there's real deep value in that. And I wasn't here at the very beginning, but it's certainly something that was there at the very beginning of Etsy, that is still a through line to where we are today.\nLenny (00:45:53):\nThat makes absolute sense to me. On the other hand, I also don't know how that happens. Is there anything that you think about, of how the team did that and how they built that brand? What are some of the important elements? Is that a specific aesthetic? Is it a certain type of supply that you stuck to? What do you think was so important to building that brand?\nTim Holley (00:46:12):\nI think it is the supply. If you think about the marketplace, the vast majority of content is maybe what we might consider UGC. It's either the item is from the seller. Or as was mentioning before, the buyer review is from the buyer. And so just being really clear about what's okay to sell and what's not okay, I think does really differentiate us. \n(00:46:38):\nI also think over the years, our brand, and our aesthetic, and how we position ourselves has evolved, will continue to evolve as it should. But to the point where we are now, the statement we have is keep commerce human. And that feels really simple, super pithy, easy to remember, but has lineage when you go all the way back to where we started in terms of really valuing the unique, valuing the handmade. And so that does permeate decision making, how we show up, the type of features we work on, the things we would prioritize. Maybe never say never, but an item getting dropped off by a drone and a person never touches it, that doesn't feel very Etsy. That's not something that we might lean into.\nLenny (00:47:22):\nIt's interesting how many parallels Etsy has to Airbnb, because Airbnb is the same general idea. People's homes, people making things. And then also, I think the tagline for Airbnb early on was travel like a human. So it was actually a really similar concept.\nTim Holley (00:47:35):\nYeah.\nLenny (00:47:36):\nWhich touches on a question I wanted to talk about, which is many marketplaces as they grow, become supply constrained. And then there's this pressure to add different types of supply. In Airbnb's case, it was, \"We should add hotels, we should add property management, vacation rental companies on here. We should have everything people want to book, because we're losing business. They could book anything here, they should be able to.\" But the tension is, then we become like everyone else. And then what is Airbnb in that case? \n(00:48:04):\nAnd I think you went through that experience where there was a lot of cheap products from overseas, and it was kind of being flooded. Is that true, I guess? And then just how do you think about that limit, and where you draw that line?\nTim Holley (00:48:17):\nYeah, I think it does come back to some degree to the brand and the policy point from just before. And we take enforcing our policies really seriously. It's not an easy job at our scale, and that means we need to continue to invest and continue to make sure that only the best items, the most relevant items are on Etsy. That job is never done. The team that that works super, super hard, and is always looking for new signals to understand what maybe doesn't meet our criteria.\n(00:48:49):\nGenerally speaking, supply is something that we have in spades for the most part. Back to the point we talked about earlier, one of the things that we grappled with was around, how can we help sellers scale? They sell great inventory, but maybe they just don't have enough of it, or they can't meet the demand, because they're making everything by hand.\n(00:49:10):\nSo one of the things that there was an evolution, was leaning into what today we call production assistance. And the way I think about that is you still need to understand the provenance of your item. If you are saying, \"I have this design, I'm just going to throw it over the fence to a manufacturer that I've never met, that I don't know. I don't understand their processes, I may not agree with them,\" that doesn't meet our criteria. You need to understand how it's being made, who is making it, have a relationship with the person who's helping you scale your business. But that's something that we saw from people who maybe gravitate more towards being designers than being able to actually make the thing. They have this excellent idea, they just can't see it come to life.\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And so they need some help. And that was something we leaned into to be able to, like I said, help sellers that maybe weren't able to make a thing and sell it on Etsy. Or for sellers who were reaching the limits of what they could supply, really take it to the next level, and make more items such that they could make more sales.\nLenny (00:50:10):\nSo it sounds like essentially, this is just evolving definition of what a supplies allowed on Etsy, a team that stays on top of that. Imagine there was just a hard decision at one point of just, \"We will limit supply, and here's the supply that we want on the platform. Everything else we're going to take off.\"\nTim Holley (00:50:25):\nWe would limit the type of items, the number of those items, that as we talked about, there's a lot of them. But really having that clear definition. In some cases, it's easy. Some things, they violate legal definitions. And those things, that's the easy stuff to think about. It's where it's a little more gray, that it gets a little trickier.\nLenny (00:50:47):\nThat reminds me, so my wife is actually a designer, and she produces these hilarious charts about life stuff. And people take her designs and just sell them on every platform on Zazzle, and probably Etsy, but everywhere. And she's always trying to hunt them down and get them to take them off. But it's such a pain for a small designer. It's not an Etsy problem, it's just a general internet problem.\nTim Holley (00:51:08):\nYeah. And back to the, we have teams hard at work thinking about IP, and how to police it, how to enforce it. \nLenny (00:51:16):\nIt's tough.\nTim Holley (00:51:17):\nNot a domain I will suggest I'm an expert in, really, really tricky stuff, but we've got to be beyond that.\nLenny (00:51:23):\nYeah. Another I think problem that's sort of unique to Etsy, something that I think people call the graduation problem. Which is where you join Etsy, things start to grow, you become really successful. And then you're like, \"Why am I paying Etsy all these fees? Why don't I just make my own website and just sell it directly, and not pay any fees?\" And I think you guys went through that. And so if that's true, is there anything you've learned about just how to avoid getting people to want to leave?\nTim Holley (00:51:48):\nI think the core thought there is, our fees are generally low and highly competitive. So from that perspective, there's a reason to stay on Etsy. What we've seen and what we know, our sellers are really smart business people. And so if they can distribute their products through another channel, that might be their own website, another marketplace in person. Probably going to try to do that. They want to make more sales. Not all, but many of them are wired to want to grow their business.\n(00:52:21):\nAnd so really understanding the role that we play in that construct of distribution channels to make it a little reductive is really helpful to understand. And to some degree, we want to be the place that not only they make sales on, but they love to sell on, because our tools are really catered to the needs that they have.\n(00:52:42):\nSo there is some degree of stickiness. I mentioned Teams earlier. There are places where sellers go to congregate, share ideas, share grievances in some cases, but ultimately support each other. And so there are reasons to stick around. I'm sure there certainly sellers who scale out of Etsy who realize, \"I want to build my own website,\" to the example you cited. The reality is that's neither cheap nor fast. It's hard work. It's hard work to build, hard work to maintain, expensive to drive traffic to. And so that may be a part of the way they want to take their business, but oftentimes, Etsy still does play a role in how they're thinking, about where they make sales, and ultimately where they're going to see growth from.\nLenny (00:53:24):\nThe cool thing that I saw online about you, is that you built a marketplace essentially within Etsy called Etsy Studio. And I'm not sure if that's around anymore, but I'm curious what the story there was, and what you learned from that experience, and current status.\nTim Holley (00:53:40):\nYeah, well researched. Because no, it is no longer around. The white space we saw with studio was essentially saying, on the one hand you've got Pinterest fails, right? You've got all these great inspiring items or projects on Pinterest, and then you have people who've no idea how to make them, and they get so frustrated.\n(00:54:01):\nAnd then on the other hand, you've got a marketplace like Michael's, or these other places where you might go for craft supplies. They have stuff, but they don't necessarily have inspiration. And how can we play in that intersection of the idea and the items and the tutorials to see that idea come to life?\n(00:54:21):\nSo the genesis of the idea, felt from a brand perspective, super aligned. We stand for creativity, we stand for makers. And so we saw it as a big opportunity. The launch happened to coincide with the pivot in 2017, to really focusing on the core marketplace or refocusing on the core marketplace, maybe I should say. \n(00:54:41):\nAnd so it became clear that when we laid out what we're optimizing for, which is driving sales in the short term, marketing dollars being as ROI positive as possible, having teams focused on the core marketplace, it didn't check any of those boxes. And so really, really tough decision and hard to manage through, but that was ultimately the right call for the business to say, \"This no longer makes sense given the new constraints that we're operating in, given the new goals that we have.\"\nLenny (00:55:10):\nMakes sense. Also something that happened to Airbnb a lot, trying new things that they didn't work out, had to move on. \nTim Holley (00:55:15):\nYep.\nLenny (00:55:16):\nThat's how it goes. \nTim Holley (00:55:17):\nYep.\nLenny (00:55:18):\nShifting a little bit to just product leadership and writing the product team, and just a few more questions, what's something that you've found to be really important to having a productive, well run, well executing product team?\nTim Holley (00:55:31):\nYeah. One of the things that's certainly not completely novel but I think we have a pretty unique interpretation of is how we collaborate between functions. You'll often hear the three legs of the stool where you've got product and engine design,, and we've evolved that to five legs of the stool. And I fully recognize that a five legged stool probably is not a very stable thing, but go with the analogy for a second-\nLenny (00:55:56):\nI think it's even more stable. Is that the most stable stool or is it less stable with five legs?\nTim Holley (00:56:00):\nYou probably need a really flat surface. \nLenny (00:56:02):\nThat makes sense.\nTim Holley (00:56:03):\nRegardless, of course we've got product eng design and we've got our insights partners. So research and analytics, and we've got our marketing partners really working in a tight team to build the best products possible. And so I think that we can continue to get better absolutely, at how we make decisions and how we bring the various viewpoints together. So to some degree it's not the easiest path, but it's the best path I think, where you're really incorporating different viewpoints, different constraints, different considerations into the features and the products that we're building. And treating that as the core leadership team I think is really valuable.\n(00:56:45):\nAnd maybe that's partly because generally, we don't subscribe to this idea of PM as the mini CEO. You're up there directing from on high that we're going to build that feature and we're going to do that. And that's just not the type of culture that we have, and generally speaking from what I've seen, doesn't lead to good decisions or the best features or product being built. And so collaboration is something we really value and that we try to live through how we structure our teams, how we make our decisions. Is it perfect? Like I said, absolutely not. I think it's the way that we've found being really successful building product.\nLenny (00:57:21):\nDo you give the PM just a little more say in decision making and ask? Because with five people in the leadership team, you talked about how back in the day, it was like too consensus driven maybe, and I wonder how you navigate that with five decision makers.\nTim Holley (00:57:35):\nYeah, we're always looking to clarify, or re-clarify, or restate who ultimately is accountable. And in many cases it is the PM, right? You are the one who Nick, our CPO like to say you don't have to have the best ideas, but you have to choose the best ideas. And so really figuring out how you're selecting what you're going to build and then living with the consequences.\n(00:58:00):\nOf course ideally, successful. In many cases, back to your 80% stat that 80% of experiments don't work, owning what's next, right? Okay, did we learn from that? If we did, what are we going to do about it? That definitely does fall to the PM. It doesn't give you the permission to ignore other viewpoints or make decisions in a vacuum. It's certainly not that. But ultimately, when we need to move forward, it is the PM that is on the hook for those things.\nLenny (00:58:26):\nAwesome. So essentially, the PM can make the call if there's an unclear consensus?\nTim Holley (00:58:33):\nAnd given so many places are, but we're so heavily led by the insights either qual or quant. The decision in many instances is clear. When it's not, that's when we need the product person to step forward and say, \"We're going in this direction.\" Don't know if it's going to work out, but we'll certainly learn and we'll move forward.\nLenny (00:58:50):\nAwesome. And then just to go on this topic a little bit more, your teams are cross-functional dedicated teams. I imagine it sounds like there's these five leads for each team. Is that roughly how you organize?\nTim Holley (00:59:01):\nYeah. And the fifth leg, if you will, of marketing, that might be product marketing in some cases, that might be brand marketing in others. And so there's kind of different flavors of marketing that we pull in, based on the specific needs of the project. But that's generally speaking how we try to structure our teams from kind of the group level all the way down to the individual squad. We can't always have a dedicated research, and a dedicated analyst, and a dedicated product marketer to every single team. So it's certainly not perfect, but that's where we aspire to having at least coverage on those roles.\nLenny (00:59:37):\nGot it. So most teams have dedicated marketing person or a product marketing person. That's crazy. That's really rare, but interesting.\nTim Holley (00:59:43):\nSome teams-\nLenny (00:59:43):\nSome teams that I imagine are most in need of marketing support. Got it. Are you able to just paint a rough picture of the way the teams are laid out at Etsy? I imagine there's a buyer side and a seller side. How does that look for people to make sense-\nTim Holley (00:59:57):\nYeah. The way that we think about the structure right now, and the org design should ideally follow strategy. And if your strategy is always evolving, then your org design is always evolving. We call it the product stack. And so we've got our core customer teams, who are unsurprisingly thinking about buyers and sellers. And so they're the ones on the front lines with the customers.\n(01:00:26):\nThen we have, we call them our partner teams, and so they are working directly with the end customer. So think an organization like payments where they have clearly a way to capture payment from a buyer to remit funds to a seller, so they're really on the front lines with the customer. They also have other constraints working with the payment networks, and card providers, and things like that, so they just have a slightly different model. So core customer, partner teams, enablement teams that are really in service of helping deliver the best possible experience. That might be through our recommender systems or through our design system, in order to make developing that little bit easier, a little bit faster, a little bit more standardized in some cases. And then the foundation of it all sits with infrastructure, and the teams that you might expect that are much more technical in nature, that really, without that, we wouldn't have a website.\nLenny (01:01:20):\nWhen you're hiring a product manager, is there anything that you found to be really important or interesting, or maybe a unique insight into hiring teams?\nTim Holley (01:01:28):\nThe three things that I come back to time and again, is one, the collaboration piece that we talked about earlier. Not only a willingness, but a real excitement to do that. It's not everyone's bag. I get that. Some people just want to be in a make fast decisions and move forward place. We aim to make fast decisions, but you need to consult. That's one.\n(01:01:49):\nTwo is being decisive. We have tons of data, but it's not always clear exactly what to do with that, or we're using a new input. Maybe back to the point mentioned earlier of looking at competitive insights, let's make a decision, let's move forward. Let's ideally learn. Even if we're not making progress against our goals, we're at a minimum learning. \n(01:02:10):\nAnd then the third point is just curiosity. Because we're a relatively small organization with... Everyone says, \"If only we had more people,\" but we are quite small. \n(01:02:20):\nSo there is a lot of change. There's a lot of new priorities that crop up, and that means there's a lot of opportunity for the right folks, right? If I want to be in this space, and only this space, and this is my specific domain, and I just want to be in it forever more, that might be a little more challenging, because you might be asked to work on something net new. And so just having that curiosity mindset of saying, or maybe said differently growth mindset of, \"Okay, there's something to learn from the thing I'm being asked to do, let me really lean into that.\"\n(01:02:47):\nAnd to some degree, I'm not describing anything that's atypical of great product people overall. But I think we have either a slightly different flavor or we need it in a slightly different way here at Etsy.\nLenny (01:02:59):\nAwesome. Last question, before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Is there a framework or a process that you find really useful, that you find yourself coming back to, that you think listeners would potentially find really valuable?\nTim Holley (01:03:11):\nI won't pretend to know whether listeners find it valuable. But the thing that I do a lot, that we do as my team, that others do to some degree is a simple exercise of weekly focus. What are you focused on this week? And then reflecting on, did you get done the things you were focused on last week? Seems super simple, but just the exercise of thinking about what matters, writing it down, and having a little bit of social proof or articulating it out to others creates some degree of accountability, is something that is very, very easy and simple to do.\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And if you do it consistently, you start to see some really great patterns of, \"Those types of focus areas take me longer than I think. I should budget more time.\" Or, \"These are the type of things that crop up. At this time of year, I might need to start thinking about making some space for them.\" So I've just found that to be really, really, really helpful in the day-to-day.\nLenny (01:04:06):\nI love that. How do you operationalize that? Is it like a Slack channel people post these in, is it a Docs?\nTim Holley (01:04:11):\nYeah. In our buyer experience product channel, on Mondays, everyone's kind of sharing what they're focused on. How last week panned out, was it done? Is it still in progress? Things like that. It's very, very lo-fi, but it worked pretty well.\nLenny (01:04:25):\nSo it's kind of like a standup that happens once a week, and it's higher level essentially is what it sounds like?\nTim Holley (01:04:30):\nExactly, exactly. Trying to think about the priorities and not tasks. And that is a blurry line. I fully recognize that. But anchoring in those I think is certainly for me, personally more helpful.\nLenny (01:04:41):\nAnd is the comedian person in these and sharing funny things in the standup-\nTim Holley (01:04:46):\nNo, unfortunately, or fortunately, he's now actually a comedian.\nLenny (01:05:52):\nAre you serious he became a full time comedian? That’s amazing. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\nTim Holley (01:04:58):\nHit me.\nLenny (01:04:59):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\nTim Holley (01:05:03):\nCouple that come to mind Team of Teams by Stanley McChrystal has been, I think is just A, really fascinating read, and B, helped me think a lot about how you trust teams and how you think about disseminating decision-making to the right folks, tech language, push decisions to the edges. But thinking about it in the context that he describes there is really fascinating, and it just shows that it can work even in the most egregious world of military, which you think is top-down command and control, shows that there's a different way to approach problems.\nLenny (01:05:42):\nI was actually a fan favorite at Airbnb also.\nTim Holley (01:05:45):\nOh, cool. Other is back all the way to the top to what I love to do. Surfing and being outdoors. Let My People Go Surfing by Yvon Chouinard, the Patagonia founder. Incredibly fascinating read of someone who just had a deep, deep passion, turned it into a business, struggled, iterated, came out the other side really successful. So the business side, but also just how they think about treating their employees and the culture that they've built I think is to me personally, really inspiring. There's a theme here around trust and how you engage with people to make their day-to-day work lives, is really fulfilling. So that's another favorite.\nAnd then in a super different direction, Power Broker by Robert Caro. That is an absolute tone. It is huge. It took me probably an entire year to read because I'm an extremely slow reader and/or I fell asleep a lot. But it is so fascinating, especially living in New York, of how one human had such an incredibly outsized and probably terrible impact on the city. Access to waterfronts, really thinking about communities and tearing them apart. Just such a fascinating read.\nLenny (01:06:56):\nI have that book, and I've never read it. It's very long and intimidating. I think it might be back there, maybe in a different-\nTim Holley (01:07:01):\nI would chunk it out. Do a couple of chapters at a time, otherwise it feels insurmountable.\nLenny (01:07:07):\nIt's like infinite Infinite Jest where you're intimidated. Amazing. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show?\nTim Holley (01:07:15)\nSo my wife and I talk about this a lot. I think we're Western Files, if that's a thing. I'm from Europe and so it's a whole new world, different world for me. We've loved Yellowstone and all of the, I guess they're prequels. They've been just really, really fun to watch for people who are curious about that culture and that world.\nLenny (01:07:35):\nAwesome. It's also been hard to find where to even watch it. It's on the weirdest channels.\nTim Holley (01:07:39):\nIt is one of those where the old world of, we cut all our cords and we only needed Netflix. Suddenly you need all these really random providers of content that you're like, \"I have to subscribe to that now to watch this show?\"\nLenny (01:07:51):\nDon't understand where this even is. Just take my money. Favorite interview question you like to ask candidates?\nTim Holley (01:07:58)\nI'm a big fan of case studies, live case studies. I think you learn a whole boatload about how someone thinks on the fly, how they react to constraints. So we use those. I've used those a ton. We use them pretty heavily in product interviews. So I love those modulated for the type of business you're in, what you're actually trying to understand.\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]The other one I like to ask is around something that people have taught themselves, tried to get at a growth mindset. I think Julia, who was on the podcast a while ago, said something similar. But you get a ton of insight into someone. Ideally, you get a bit of passion and you often get something to go research. She's like, \"I don't know anything about that topic. I want to learn a little more.\"\nLenny (01:08:40)\nWhat is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?\nTim Holley (01:08:44):\nYou as a new parent maybe resonates when... So it's not new, because our kids too. But when I was looking, being in product, of course you want to track data. And so I was looking for apps that would be good at doing that, and they nearly all look like hideous medical charts where I just don't want to engage with that. \nI found this one app, I think it's called Nara Baby or Nara something. Super simple, allows both parents to enter information. Probably grandparents too. We only tested it with two people. Seamlessly syncs. Really easy to use. So at 4:00 AM when you can't see and you just want to say, \"I fed the baby,\" you can do that really easily. Just really, really simple, fit for purpose product. So that resonated with me.\nLenny (01:09:31):\nI'm going to be downloading that right now. I've been using Huckleberry, which is both awesome and not awesome, and so awesome tip. Great. What is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat often or share with other people, either in work or in life?\nTim Holley (01:09:44):\nOne of the things I talk about maybe internally more than anything else, but all or nothing. Go all in. Go do the thing. In German [German 01:10:08]. I grew up in Germany, so that's something I say to myself a lot is if you're going to do it, do it properly. I think those are often helpful words to live by.\nLenny (01:10:04):\nI love that. Final question, what's a favorite item you recently discovered on Etsy?\nTim Holley (01:10:10):\nI recently bought an engraved whiskey decanter for my wife and myself, or for the home. Super beautiful, so cool. Got it personalized with our names. Just such a cool, cool item, that I wasn't expecting to find that kind of thing. I'm not even sure exactly how you engrave a whiskey decanter, but it was really cool. And the other thing, I'm always on the lookout for greeting cards. If anyone has great greeting card seller recommendations, I'm all ears. I love giving out physical greetings cards to folks, so that's another always on Etsy favorite of mine.\nLenny (01:10:51):\nTim, we've talked about growth, culture, surfing, cabins, leadership. Thank you so much for being here. I'm downloading the Nara app right now as we speak. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?\nTim Holley (01:11:06):\nYeah, yeah, find me on LinkedIn. That's probably... Well, not probably, is my most professional platform. Instagram, like I said, is a farce. And being useful. Yeah, send me things that you're excited about in the Etsy product. Send me feedback. We're always really keen to learn how folks are experiencing the things that we build.\nLenny (01:11:26)\nAmazing. Tim, thank you so much for being here.\nTim Holley (01:11:28)\nThank you for having me, Lenny. Appreciate it.\nLenny (01:11:30)\nBye everyone. \n(01:11:34)\nThank you so much for listening.

If you look at the way each platform is doing, Google, you have to scroll pretty far down to get to an organic listing. Meta, it's almost a pay for play now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:13):\nWhen you take over for an agency at a company, you crush their performance within a month. I'm curious to what you find they are doing wrong?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:00:20):\nInstead of thinking about being on top of the page, and that's like ego marketing, I want to be number one. I want to be there all the time. It's about showing to the right person as often as possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):\nAny other tips for people just to experiment with the platform?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:00:33):\nEach platform is different. The user behavior is different. Make sure you're not too hard on yourself if it doesn't work. It's okay to fail because we're either winning or we're learning.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):\nToday, my guest is Timothy Davis. Timothy has led performance marketing for all of Shopify for the past two and a half years, and as a consultant has helped companies like Pinterest, LinkedIn, Redfin, and Eventbrite kickstart and scale the performance marketing teams. In our conversation, we get incredibly tactical on all things to performance marketing and paid growth, when to start investing, how to run signs of life tests on each platform, what platforms to investigate and what platforms to bet big on, what types of companies are best suited to invest big on paid growth whether you should invest pre-product market fit or not, what agencies often get wrong and what to look for in your investment when you're just getting started? Plus, what your first three hires should look like, tips for which platforms are most interesting right now, a peek at Timothy's actual reports that he runs to judge performance, if you're watching this on YouTube and so much more.\n\n(00:01:37):\nThis episode is for anyone who's trying to figure out how to kickstart or improve their performance marketing investment, and I guarantee you'll get something out of this that'll make your life better.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:02:04):\nYeah, thanks for having me. A long time coming.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:06):\nYeah, I'm really excited we're finally doing this. I actually posted on Twitter for people to suggest questions for this topic and there's just so much interest in what we're going to be talking about, which essentially we're going to be diving deep into all things paid growth, all things performance marketing. By the way, I have a cold. For people, if in case you wonder why I sound a little weird, but the show must go on. I want to start with just setting a little context for folks that aren't super familiar with performance marketing and paid growth. When we talk about performance marketing/paid growth, first of all, are those two terms interchangeable to you? And second of all, what falls under the umbrella of performance marketing/paid growth?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:02:42):\nPaid can be a lot of things. It can be online, it can be offline, it can also even be affiliates. Typically, when I talk about performance marketing, it's about online only, but you could argue offline could be performing and affiliates could be performing and stuff like that. They can be interchangeable, but I would recommend if you are talking about it, to specify which one you're talking about. Because when you do say paid, because I'm in the industry, I would just, \"Oh, they do Google Search and they do Meta and they do things like that.\" But if you do offline and you just say paid, we may be talking about things, but missing each other on two ships passing in the night. So I think historically, people, when they have said paid growth, have been fully focused on just online.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:43):\nJust online. Okay. Got it.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:03:31):\nBut I would argue in the last couple of years, you could definitely roll offline into that conversation as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:38):\nOkay. So performance marketing, when someone hears that term, it's essentially marketing that you can measure the performance up.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:03:43):\nCorrect. Yes, nail on the head.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:46):\nThis episode is brought to you by buildbetter.ai.

I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our long time podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:05:07):\nYes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:09):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:05:25):\nYes. So we just launched OneSchema file feeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:47):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead, use something like OneSchema, and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:05:58):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:18):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. And if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema. co.\n\n(00:06:32):\nIs performance marketing just something every company should be doing or is there certain business models where it's like, \"No, you're probably going to grow through other channels mostly like SEO or sales or word of mouth.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:06:42):\nHot take. I would say, paid is for everyone. If you look at the way each platform is doing, Google introducing AI, plus with paid taking up the first four spots, you have to scroll pretty far down to get to an organic listing. Meta, it's almost a pay for play now. You have to do promoted posts for people to even see your content. I would say it does depend on the industry you're in. If you're say, leaning heavily into influencer marketing, that is still a paid component. You may not be doing Meta ads, you may not be doing paid search, but that is a paid component. But I would say at baseline, everyone should be doing paid search. The way I usually explain it to people is paid search is user driven. You have to type in a relevant keyword for your ad to show.\n\n(00:07:36):\nAnything else is more disruptive media. You're on Meta and you're looking at pictures of babies and cats, and then all of a sudden, you see an ad for Shopify. You're watching a YouTube video, maybe a YouTube podcast, and then in between, you get advertisements maybe for Shopify, maybe for Pinterest, maybe for Eventbrite. So all of that being disruptive media may not make a whole lot of sense for where you are as a business, but I would say paid search being user-driven, having to type in a relevant keyword for your ad to show, should pretty much be for just about everybody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:11):\nEveryone should do it. Super interesting. There's also the most companies grow through one growth engine primarily, say word of mouth, or SEO, or sales or paid. So for some companies, paid will be most of how they grow like say, I always think of Booking.com and Credit Karma and just like most of their growth came from paid growth online, paid growth. For some companies, it's just like a layer, a small 10, 20% of their growth. What are signs that you have the potential for paid/performance marketing to be most of your growth, like say 70, 80%?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:08:47):\nI always say, where are your users? You will have some data that will allow you to understand that say right now, you're doing really well on TikTok. Some would argue that's an emerging channel right now. Great. If that's doing really well for you, maybe you take... Because that content could be used on something similar like Snap, see how that does for you. You could also lean into your Google Analytics or whatever analytics tool you are using and see if you're already getting users from that platform. If you're currently managing that, if you don't have a profile on there and obviously, you don't have a presence, it would be really hard for users to find you and get there. But always look at the data that's available to you within your analytics platforms and say, \"Users are already finding us here. How can we turn that knob up to 11?\" And you can do that with paid. Because if they're already finding you through that channel, what would happen if you were to just turn it up to 11?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):\nIs there an example of a company you worked with that's known that as an example of that, where you're like, \"Oh, I see everyone's looking, finding them on Google. Let's go turn it to 11.\"\n\nTimothy Davis (00:09:55):\nYeah. So there was a company I worked with a couple of years ago called, Hairstory and IPSY. I know, very funny. Guy with no hair working on a company called Hairstory, but they were doing really well from a Google shopping standpoint. But when I started consulting with them, we looked at the analytics and we actually saw that they were getting a lot of people from Meta and TikTok at the time. And TikTok was very, very new and they didn't really know what to do with it. So said, \"We'll do a small test.\" We can start on Meta with just some customer testimonials. Let's see how that does. We'll get interest in, build a funnel, get retargeting, and hopefully get conversions. TikTok was so new at the time that it was like, \"We don't know what's going to work. Let's just try with what is currently available.\"\n\n(00:10:47):\nThen once we started doing it, we started noticing, \"Hey, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a creative standpoint.\" We were missing the mark of what we were using on Meta was working, was not working on TikTok. So you can't always just take what is currently working on one platform and apply it to another because it is a different user experience. It is a different mindset that the user has when they're on there. So that was an example of where we were able to take those instances, look at their data and say, \"They're already finding us here. How can we turn this up a little bit?\" And I don't remember the numbers exactly, but it was pretty exponential.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:24):\nOkay. So the core advice here so far, is look for where people are coming to you from today, and then that gives you a sign of where you should start to think about running paid ads, performance marketing on those platforms.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:11:38):\nYeah. And also, there's a saying that my current director likes to use, which is signs of life. You can always do a very, very small test. You can just put a little money into a platform, see if there's a sign of life. If there is, then you can pull back and say, \"Okay, we have signs of life. Now let's build a campaign around that.\" There's no reason to say, \"All right, we have a signs of life. Let's now turn it up all the way.\" Do we have the right creative? Do we have the right campaign? Do we have the right messaging for the users on this platform? Then let's take that approach, as opposed to just, \"Hey, signs of life, great, go run a hundred miles an hour.\" Make sure you're doing the right thing when you get into those platforms.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):\nLet's follow that thread. A lot of people run little experiments on say, TikTok, and Snap, and Twitter, and things like LinkedIn, and they often don't see a lot of results and it's always like, \"Hey, did we do it wrong or is it the platform's not working?\" I know it's a very difficult question to give like, \"Here's how you do a sign of life test correctly,\" But what are some things that you think either people do often wrong when they're trying to experiment with the platform or that you just think they should do when they're trying to look for signs of life?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:12:49):\nThe number one thing I tell people all the time is use your own data, start with your own data. So take the existing customer base you have, load that up into the platform to build lookalikes. From there, you can do... And I'll use Meta as the example. You can do a 1%, all the way up to a 10%. So 1% match, 2%, 3%, so on and so forth.\n\n(00:13:12):\nWhat I tend to do is build ad sets, one at 1% because we know that one's going to be highly correlated to what we're looking for. Then a two to four, and then a five to seven, and then an eight plus. More times than not, the eight plus does not work, but there have been times where it has, so it's, \"Hey, let's do it. Let's try it.\" But if you also have a very limited budget because some people don't have the luxury of having an unlimited budget like we do in some of these other companies I've worked at, just start with the 1%. See what that sign of life is because you already know that this is so tied to your existing customer base. If that sign of life is giving you a positive signal, now you have the information you need to build a campaign you need to be successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:02):\nWhat are these percentages referring to? You may have mentioned it, but when you say 1%, 2%, 3%.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:14:07):\nYeah, yeah. So that is how closely tied they are to that user's behavior on the platform. So they're 1% tied to what they're doing. They're visiting similar pages or they have similar behavior on the platform, so they're more than likely going to be tied to what that user... They're not going to be that user exactly, but they're going to be very correlated to them where 10% is pretty wide base that you're going to hit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:35):\nI see. So the smaller the percentage, the closer they are, the closer it will look like there.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:14:39):\nYep, there you go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:40):\nHow do you know if it's the creative that is failing versus it's just never going to work? Is there something that tells you that's what's not working?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:14:47):\nIt's a million-dollar question, to be honest with you. Because you could look at some of the metrics that currently exist in the platform. Click-through rate basically just tells you, are the users engaged? Because start with the target. You're getting the impressions are there. Is the target right? That should be your first thing. Yes, the target is correct. Users that we want to see are seeing our ads, but they're not engaging with it. That would be the first thing.\n\n(00:15:15):\nBut the part that I think you're really trying to ask is creative versus the content. Because sometimes depending on the ad unit, you could have a story creative that is literally the creative has to stand on its own, not necessarily the content that's in it, but something like an in-feed creative has a headline, a primary, a description, and a creative. That's where honestly, the only way you're going to get an answer to that outside of the data that's available to you like click-through rate, reach, frequency and all those things to pull in more metrics, is a focus group to understand, \"Hey, when you saw this image with this content, what was your result from it?\"\n\n(00:15:58):\nNow, you can build a test within the platform to do a control versus a test where say, you take the creative with the same primary and the same description versus a creative that's just your logo with the headline and the description and see what the results are. But more times than not, you're not getting the understanding from the user of, well, why doesn't that creative resonate with you? And they'll give you suggestions in the focus group. Why does that work better for you than not? So that's a really, really hard question to answer without having those dialogue with the user to understand that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense. How long do you recommend these tests run for these signs of life tests? And I like this term, by the way. I haven't heard this before.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:16:40):\nIdeally, in a perfect world, you're going to hear the word, statistical relevance. Mathematicians will tell you exactly what that number is. And I'm not going to pretend like a mathematician, but a lot of times, it's budget constraint. So there could be a VP finance. Anyone like that could just come to you and just say, \"Hey, do you have $25,000 for this test?\" You only have 5,000. Just get that information, get that data. You can then also build an off size off of that. Hey guys, we worked with our Meta partners, we worked with our Google partners. We put $1,000 behind this test. We know that our impression share was this, our reach was this. If we were to put $10,000 into it, this is the expected return we can get from it based on the click-through rate, the conversion rate that we got from the test that we ran.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:34):\nGot it. So basically, we have limited number of dollars to spend. That'll tell you how long you could run one of these for.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:17:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:42):\nAny other tips for someone that's trying to experiment with a platform early on for these signs of life tests? So one is try a lookalike that is the most targeted version of the lookalike. So 1% you said, and then incrementally grown and incrementally increase that percentage as you spend more. Any other tips, I guess, for people just to experiment with the platform?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:18:04):\nMake sure you're not too hard on yourself if it doesn't work. A lot of times, companies I've either consulted with or worked at, there was always pressure or there was always a need to succeed at whatever experiment we put into market. I believe in creating an environment where it's okay to fail because we're either winning or we're learning. And more times than not, if we put something new into a platform that we know nothing about, we're learning the bells and whistles, we're learning the functionality of it. Just know there's going to be things you're not going to understand because each platform is unique, each platform is different, the user behavior is different. So give yourself some grace, understand that this may not work. And as long as you're learning from it, you're going to be okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:56):\nI love that. In terms of which platforms people should explore, obviously there's Google, there's Facebook, Instagram, what are the platforms people should seriously consider at this point?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:19:09):\nGoogle for sure. And when we say Google, let's make sure everyone understands what Google entails. Google is YouTube, Google is Google search, GDN, Google Display Network. There's a lot of things in Google that you can do. I always say, if you have the creative available, you should really, really be looking at doing video because video is one of those things that I'm very bullish on. It is doing really well when you measure it the right way. And as long as you can get that creative and get it consistently just because you have one piece of creative, if it's doing well, you do need to have that creative refresh, kind of that flywheel going. Make sure you're doing Google Search, again, user-driven, YouTube, and Meta, and Meta contains both Facebook and Instagram. And then based on the data available to you, if you do see users on TikTok, definitely go after those. But if you're just starting out and you just want to get your feet wet into something, I would say start with Google Search, then get into Meta. And if you have video available, definitely get into YouTube.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:19):\nAwesome. Okay. So Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. What about LinkedIn? Do you see things happening there for say, B2B companies?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:20:30):\nYeah. LinkedIn is very expensive in comparison. So just know if you're going into LinkedIn, it's going to look almost three times more expensive than other channels. The targeting that's available on LinkedIn, knowing job titles, industries, actually targeting people at certain companies is very powerful. The example I always tend to use is that I worked at a company called SoftLayer. SoftLayer was acquired by IBM because they were trying to build out their cloud portfolio, couldn't do it. So they're like, \"Hey, let's do the next best thing and buy this company.\" But when we were just SoftLayer, we were trying to get Coca-Cola as one of our clients. And you know those Coke freestyles where you can pick whatever drink you want and put the flavor in it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:21):\nNo, that's awesome.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:21:22):\nOh man, these are great. Maybe it's a cell thing, but basically, you go up to a Coke freestyle and say, \"I want Dr. Pepper and I want cherry flavor in it.\" Or you want Coke Zero with cherry and vanilla in it, you can do that. It's the freestyle you get to pick. The reason they wanted it to be cloud-based is because there's a ton of drinks in there. So you need to be able to efficiently and effectively say, \"This store needs more Sprite or this store needs more Sprite Zero.\" Because you have your whole portfolio in this one machine, so you want to be able to update things more readily. And it was between us, AWS and Microsoft. And met with the sales team and said, \"What do we need to do to win this?\" Because it was a big ticket item for us.\n\n(00:22:14):\nAnd what we found out was they had two concerns about us. It was recency and private security. So what we did was we found out where the decision makers were. So A, in LinkedIn, we took the anyone who works at Coca-Cola, we want you to see ads about security and recency. Outside of that, we also geo-fenced it because you would think Coca-Cola Atlanta, that's where the decision maker sits, but they were actually in LA. So in LA, we geo-fenced them, and we knew that they worked at Coca-Cola. The next time the salesperson got on the call with the team to say, \"Hey, just wanted to check in.\" He was like, \"Hey, hey, I get it. Security is fine. Recency is fine. We hear you.\" That was great to hear because it was something we were able to do on LinkedIn and we did it in other platforms as well. But we knew we were able to get not only to the decision maker, but everyone around that decision maker to say, \"Hey, these guys may be the ones we need to go with.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:16):\nOkay. So just to mirror back what you're saying, you're saying you ran ads on LinkedIn targeting the execs at Coca-Cola, trying to influence them to overcome these barriers they had to buying to working with you guys. Amazing. I've seen people do that on Google Search, but I've never heard of... It makes so much sense to do on LinkedIn and it worked. And did they know that you did this or they're just like, \"Oh, I just changed my mind\"?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:23:42):\nOne of them was like, \"We get it. We're seeing it everywhere.\" We actually tried because at the time, we didn't have an offline team. We actually tried to buy the billboards around the office as well, but I didn't know enough at the time from an offline perspective of the right people to talk to, how long it would take to do it. So we were trying to pour it on hard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:03):\nThat's incredible. I could see why LinkedIn is more expensive. That's incredibly powerful. And is the advice then that LinkedIn makes more sense for higher LTV, higher CB type of products?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:24:15):\nYeah, exactly. I would not recommend getting into LinkedIn and my LinkedIn reps may kill me for this. I would not recommend getting into LinkedIn until you've tested Google and Meta first. Now, you could be an enterprise level company and it does make sense to start with LinkedIn for sure, but depending on your audience, I would say more times than not, it would be a Google, Meta discussion before going to LinkedIn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):\nOkay. So just generally, start with Google and Meta. Is there one or the other usually? I guess, yeah, which one would you start with if you had to pick one?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:24:49):\nAlways Google Search. I'm always going to say, start with Google search, but it's also creative dependent. If you don't have the right creative for Facebook, it's going to be really hard to convert because users are just going to either be turned off by what you're putting out there. And then also, depending on where your user base is. If they're not on Facebook, it's kind of a moot point. But if they're browsing around on GDN or YouTube, it makes more sense to go there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:15):\nAnd then you said this insight about video is performing super well right now and you're recommending people use video. And the key there is you need to be able to make videos, video ads.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:25:25):\nYeah. You got to make sure you have that flywheel.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:27):\nAnd the flywheel is just people internally or some company agency that can make video ads for you?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:25:32):\nCorrect. Yep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:33):\nCool. I guess, is there any advice there of just how to do that or what ads work well or anything there for someone else-\n\nTimothy Davis (00:25:39):\nSo yeah. The thing with YouTube is I always say, start with emotion. If you can have an emotional connection with the user, is going to be way more impactful and way more powerful than anything else. And to take that further, when I say emotion, I'm talking about comedy, I'm talking about...\n\nTimothy Davis (00:26:00):\nI'm talking about happiness. It's not necessarily just, \"Oh, we need an emotional connection with the brand.\" It is just making sure the user feels something after seeing your ad. Because then, they're more times not going to remember it, which then they will take a favorable action after the fact.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:21):\nThat is super interesting. One last question about platforms. Are there any other platforms you see working for people that are emerging maybe that people aren't thinking about, Reddit, or Snap, or X, or I don't know, anything along those lines?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:26:34):\nWhen you say emerging channels, my brain kind of goes to connected TV, podcast, VR, advertising, audio/voice search, and even AI stuff right now. I can tell you podcasts are doing really well for the people that I know are able to measure it correctly. Connected TV is also doing really well. You can take the, again, you're doing YouTube right now, being able to take that creative and repurpose it. But the VR stuff and the AI stuff, that is stuff that is, I would say, very emerging right now. Because to be completely transparent, I haven't experimented with those things yet. I kind of like letting other people be the guinea pig and learning from them, and then if someone comes to me and they're like, \"Hey, we have budget for this, let's go ahead and test it.\" \"Great. Let's go. Let's see what we can learn.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:34):\nAwesome. Podcast ads. I'm glad you suggested that. I'm a huge fan. Thank you. They're working really well for a lot of our sponsors and I'm very biased, so you don't need to pay attention to me. But I also think there's a lot of opportunity there. Okay. Let's talk about when to start investing in performance marketing/paid growth. So, say, you're a startup, do you have any advice for when it's time to start, signs of life test or even... And then also, just when is it time to scale to go like, \"Okay, let's go big on this.\"\n\nTimothy Davis (00:28:08):\nIf you are a startup, typically, whenever I consulted with them, it was what are the goals, what are we trying to achieve, and when? Because if you're looking for something quick, paid needs to start immediate. And paid [inaudible 00:28:24] started yesterday because SEO takes time. SEO, depending on the market you're getting into, if it's emerging, people may not even know your product exists. There was a product I was working on years ago that if you were traveling to a hotel, and say, it was a romantic getaway with you and your partner. And you wanted the hotel suite or room done up with flower petals, and champagne, and stuff like that, they would do it for you. Well, they were working with someone before that was like, \"Oh, we should totally be in paid search.\" And if you look at the keywords that they were doing, it was like, booking hotel rooms. It's like, \"No, that's complete disconnect.\" And they're like, \"Yeah, but we're trying to build awareness.\"\n\n(00:29:08):\nYou don't want to build awareness through search. You build awareness through display media-based type media. When we transitioned all of their money over at the time, and this will age me, before Meta was a thing, when we transitioned everything over to GDN, that's when the company started really reaping the rewards. Because we were building the awareness around the product. So, it depends on what is the demand of your product and market. If you're doing something that is similar to another product and market, you could do competitor, I call it coattail riding. Say, Lenny, you and I create a product that is similar to monday.com. We can go out there and just start bidding on monday.com and say, \"See why Lenny and Tim are better than monday.com.\" And start getting some people in interested, maybe kicking the tires, starting free trials, but they also have other keywords that they can go after in market. But if you're going after something new like hotel room, flowers, and I forget what keywords we were bidding on for that, it was years ago. People weren't thinking of that. It wasn't something they were searching for. So, it just really depends on, A, when do you expect results because SEO can take time. And B, what is the demand in the market for your product?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:33):\nSome people use paid ads to drive early growth to bring customers, to help them figure out what to build kind of pre-product market fit growth. Is that something you recommend? Is that something you'd advise against? Is that strategy that you've seen work?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:30:48):\nYeah. Product market fit is a huge thing. We've run into some of this at Shopify, and we definitely ran into this at IBM. So, for the longest time, IBM is, \"We're a global company, we should be everywhere.\" But when we started looking at the data, it was, \"Should we be everywhere?\" For example, Africa, we were in the whole continent. We weren't just in, say, South Africa, or Egypt, or something like that. And the more we dug into it, the more we realized the biggest issue wasn't necessarily that users weren't interested in our product and weren't purchasing it, it was because we didn't have a product market fit mainly from an operation standpoint.\n\n(00:31:33):\nIn Africa, there are multitudes of different types of currency. There's the franc, there's the rand, there's the shill, and we were just, \"Hey, USD, thank you.\" So, of course, they weren't converting unless they were going out of their way to make a way to convert that. So, when we took a step back and we said, \"Okay, where do we want to start?\" It was South Africa. That's really where we were trying to get, quote, unquote, \"stronghold\" in, so we had to make sure we had the rand available. Once we did that, we started doing tremendously better because we had a product market fit. They had demand for our product, and now we were able to serve them, meet them where they were.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):\nSo essentially, you're saying probably not smart to run a bunch of ads if it's not working, if you don't have something people actually want yet in that market?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:32:28):\nRight. Or able to convert.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:31):\nBecause conversion is going to end up being really low, no one actually cares about what you're doing.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:32:35):\nAll you're going to do is really annoy the users. Because, say, in the future they are, \"Hey, I'm still interested, but I don't want to use that product because I already tried.\" It's like, \"No, no, you can totally use it now.\" \"I already tried. I had a bad experience with them.\" And some users will hold you accountable to that. One bad experience and I'm just never giving you my business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:56):\nInteresting. So, is that generally your advice if you're startup, you're not feeling like you actually have product market fit yet, should you even experiment with and do signs of life tests, or should you hold off until it's like, \"Okay, it's actually working, let's go.\"\n\nTimothy Davis (00:33:10):\nFrom an operation standpoint, I always want to make sure those things are tied off. Yeah, it doesn't make sense to, again, if you have a major budget and you're trying to get awareness into a market, great, yeah, you can go after a market. But just know that it's probably not going to convert very well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:28):\nGot it. So-\n\nTimothy Davis (00:33:29):\nI wouldn't recommend it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:31):\nOkay, great. Awesome. Very clear answer. Let's talk about the mistakes that you see companies make when they're investing in performance marketing. We got introduced through Casey Winters's illustrious former podcast guest, two-time podcast guest and asked them about you. And he told me that when you take over for an agency at a company that you've worked with, you crush their performance within a month. I'm curious to what you see and find they are doing wrong that allows you to be such a hero when you come in and take over.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:34:03):\nI think agencies have playbooks. Now I've worked at agencies, I did consulting for a long period of time and it was never an approach I took. I looked at each account and each company as its own thing. But I think a lot of agencies just come in and they go, \"Oh, this is like AB&C company. And this is what we're doing. Copy, paste, done, move on.\" And they're also not willing to get deep, deep, deep into the weeds of stuff. I may get a little too far into data than some other people. For example, I have ops cadence that myself and my team follow. So, within that ops cadence, we have things like finance, performance, structure, keywords, ad copy, quality score, targeting, et cetera, et cetera. And then, within each of those we have specifics. For example, the keyword subsection is keyword granularity, brand versus non-brand, search query reports, negative, so on so forth.\n\n(00:35:06):\nI feel like agencies don't necessarily get into all of those things every single month where some of those we're doing weekly, some of those we're doing biweekly, and some of those we're doing monthly. But they touch the things that they think they need to touch. They turn on automated bidding, they're doing their search query reports, and then they just kind of move on with their day because they have 50 other clients they have to get to. Well, what about looking at your conversions? Where are we converting? Have we tested different landing pages? What is a better user experience that we could be getting users right now? It's a five-step process, can we get it to a three? Partnering with PMMs to say, \"Hey, here's something that I think could help improve our lead to conversion.\" Just stuff like that, that they're too busy with too many other things to focus really, really deep into those.\n\n(00:36:03):\nAnd typically, whenever I managed an agency in the past and I consulted, I made sure that you weren't stretched thin enough that you couldn't do those things. Because I'm a firm believer in hiring smart people and then getting out of their way. But each week having one-on-ones with them, just spot checking things, just saying, \"Hey, I looked at this. This doesn't look right. What's going on there?\" \"Oh yeah, I do that on this day.\" \"Okay, great. Just making sure you're covered.\" Because sometimes people won't scream uncle when they should be screaming uncle because they think it's a sign of weakness.\n\n(00:36:40):\nBut let me know when you're overwhelmed. Maybe I have a solution for you. Maybe there's a way I can coach you to be better at something, or we just need to hire more resources. Because the client portfolio you have is five, and when we took them on, they were all at 100K, but now they're all spending 2 million plus. We need to offload some of that from you because you're doing such a good job that you've scaled them up. Let's give you three clients instead of five and hire someone to take those two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:08):\nSo it sounds like basically they just don't have the time to care and spend on all the things that they need to be doing. And when you've held companies, you actually go deep and you have the time to do it well. I guess, when someone's trying to find an agency or someone like you, I know you don't do this much anymore. Any advice for just how to know if they're going to be great? Is it just agencies in general probably not a good choice? Is it hire someone in-house? I guess, what advice do you offer people that are like, \"Oh man, I want to avoid this.\"\n\nTimothy Davis (00:37:43):\nAgencies are a good place to get things started. Even when I was consulting, I would, honestly, I'm a big believer in forward thinking, backwards planning. So, if I'm taking this contract on with this new client, what's the end goal for you? If your end goal is to have this at performing in $100 million spend, there's no way one person can do that. So let's create milestones along the way of making sure we're checking in and saying, when is the right time to hire? Whether that's a data scientist, whether that's a creative person in-house or replacing me full time. There's no reason that you should be holding a company back. If anything, you should be helping them get to that milestone. And I think that's why I've been able to do so well for myself because I show that, \"Hey, I have the best interest for you and your company.\" As opposed to how much more money can I squeeze from you by holding onto you as a client.\n\n(00:38:47):\nI would say, agency consultant is a good way to start. Because if you as a business owner, you shouldn't have to log into, \"Oh, I haven't logged into Google in three weeks to look at stuff because I'm doing payroll, I'm doing HR stuff, and I'm meeting with clients, and I'm doing sales.\" Start there, get it to a good place. Create that milestone of, \"Hey, when we're spending 50K a month, I need to hire somebody full time to take this over.\" And just have that conversation with your agency and your consultant. I think more times than not, you will have a positive reaction to that. But if you don't, I would say that's a major red flag and probably someone you shouldn't be partnering with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:27):\nAwesome. Okay, so your advice is to get started on paid growth, buying an agency or a small shop consultant type person to get you started, have a conversation. And when we reach a certain scale, we're going to hire someone internally to run this for us. And then, potentially, they'll keep working with you. Potentially they'll start things in their own. Or is the assumption they'll start working with you, they'll become the owner of this thing, or is it like we may transition you out?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:39:52):\nThat's a really good point actually. So, there have been times where a client's like, \"Hey, we've reached our milestone. I want to bring someone in.\" That person comes in, and say, they're an expert in social media, like, \"Hey, I still want you to execute on Google and Bing, because that is just not my bailiwick. I'll take over the social stuff, but we do need to talk about your fee. Maybe it does need to go down.\" \"Completely acceptable. Let's have that discussion, make sure we're both aligned to what that should be.\" But yeah, there have been times where they're like, \"Hey, we've reached our milestone. We got to bring someone on.\" But that person that they bring on is like, \"Actually, I see expansion in this direction, but I can't do this. Are you willing to stay on, and help me with this? Great. If not, I'll just have to find someone else who can.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:37):\nI want to talk about the team that you build over time, but later. But specifically, for this first person that you hire, what sort of person is this person? Is it like a data person? Is it a person that's just done specific performance marketing on channel? Or what do you look for ideally?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:40:55):\nI'm a big believer in... There was a book written by Nate Silver called The Signal and the Noise. Are you familiar with it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:04):\nNo.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:41:07):\nSo, Nate Silver is the guy who created.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:08):\nFiveThirtySeven?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:41:12):\nYeah, yeah. And in the book, he basically... I'm going to use the word art, I'm going to use the word art, detailed the art of probability statistics and applied him to real world circumstances. It included case studies with baseball, which of course I loved. Elections, climate change, poker, stuff like that. And I liked that book. It's kind of dense. But the thing I liked the most about it was the title. And just changing the title ever so slightly to signal not noise. So typically, whenever I hire people, I want to hire smart people and kind of get out of their way. But the biggest thing I want to focus on is what is your thought process when it comes to data?\n\n(00:42:05):\nBecause I can teach anyone how to do Google ads. I can teach anyone how to do Meta ads. That is not the hard part. It is the data part that is the hard part because there is so much noise going on in those accounts. They give you everything, which is great. It's great that they give you all this information, but you can have someone that's \"Oh, but look at the reach, look at the frequency, look at the CPMs, look at the CPC, look at the conversion rate. Look at the cost per lead. Look at the cost per MQL. Look at this.\" Hold on, that's a lot of noise you just said. So what is the signal and what is the noise? And let's make sure we're focusing on the right signal versus the right noise. And that has to be a data person because there's a lot of data in these platforms.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:51):\n\\This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shape weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged analytic cycles.\n\n(00:43:43):\nEppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's get E-P-P-O .com/lenny.\n\n(00:44:10):\nEveryone I talked to that's worked with you is just like, \"Timothy is incredible at working with tons of data and finding the things that matter.\" Someone told me that it actually comes from your love of baseball, that you just go crazy with stats and spreadsheets of baseball games, and players, and things like that. Is there something there that you could share that is interesting?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:44:28):\nYeah. So I played baseball my whole life, but when you blow out your arm and you're as fast as a sea otter, it's not very conducive for you to continue chasing that dream. But the one thing I always liked was the stats. Even as a kid when I would watch baseball games on TV, it's like, what's this guy batting? How often is he getting on base? How many RBIs? Like, \"Oh, this guy is terrible average, but he has a lot of RBIs, so that means if there's a runner on base, he may not get a hit, but he's going to get that guy in. So you want to make sure you put him in the right spot in the batting order, so on and so forth.\" I could talk about that for hours. But again, that could be another thing where there's a lot of data available, which one should you focus on?\n\n(00:45:16):\nAnd ultimately, what is the optimization you're going to make to the lineup or to where you place fielders on the field to ensure that we're doing the right thing and becoming as efficient and effective as possible? As far as dealing with all that data, that is just, I would say, a skill I've learned over time. Early in my career, whenever someone was like, \"Oh, we have this new project. Who wants to work on it?\" \"I'll do it.\" I was always just eager like a sponge. I wanted to get in as much stuff as possible. I did SEO for a portion of my career. I did email marketing. I did affiliates. And then, eventually, I remember the first time I saw paid, because again, I was doing SEO where I was like, \"Yeah, we're going to do this and we think it's going to work.\" But we won't know for about six months.\n\n(00:46:12):\nSomeone showed me the paid platform. I was like, \"Wait, you know this is the keyword you're bidding on. This is how many times the ad was shown, how many people clicked on it? How many... Wow, this is amazing. I need to get more into this.\" And that's just kind of where it started. And when I usually hire people and we go through the interview process, I make sure that they can be data focused. Really, it's just ensuring that we're focusing on that signal and not the noise. And one of the interview questions I usually ask is I throw a bunch of data points at them and then say, \"Out of all that, what would you do to optimize the account?\" And more times than not that they're just overwhelmed. But the people that I like are like, \" Well, what's the purpose of the campaign?\"\n\n(00:47:02):\n\"The purpose of the campaign is to drive conversions.\" \"Okay, well, I would focus here, focus on how many clicks we're getting, and how many conversions, are we targeting the right people?\" Because who cares about how many impressions you're getting? Who cares about the reach? Who cares about the frequency? If the goal of the campaign is to get the conversions, that's what we should be doing. If it was awareness, it's how many people saw it. If it was a consideration, how many people were getting into the funnel and are considering us from a white paper download or a demo as the product solution that they're looking for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):\nThat's a great segue to the next question I wanted to ask you, which is just metrics that you love to focus on, pay attention to when you're helping people with paid ads. A lot of people think about CAC, a lot of people think about return on ad spend, LTV to CAC. I know it really depends on the goals as you said, but I guess, is there anything that you find is like, forget these metrics, these are kind of the bucket that you focus on most?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:48:01):\nYeah, so for those metrics, I would say, I really hope you have a great finance partner. Shout out to Courtney and Nick the fantastic finance partners I have at Shopify. Nick's not there anymore. Sad cry emoji. But Courtney, we're able to collaborate on those things. Understand, this is the investment we're putting in, this is the expected return, this is the CAC that we can basically put a guardrail on. You have to be within. So, hopefully you have a really strong financial partner you can use for those. But as far as the stuff that I focus on, there are things that whenever we're looking at accounts, we'll kind of hyperfocus on. For example, Google will give you information about what is going on with your ad copy and how to ultimately show as often as possible. What I'm showing here is a visual of brand versus non-brand when it comes to expected click-through rate, landing page experience, and ad relevance.\n\n(00:49:08):\nThe reason I like building reports like this is because it'll kind of show you where your hole in the ship is. If you look on the left side expected click-through rate, 75% above average. Landing page experience, 84% above average. Then you get down to ad relevance, a lot more colors than there are green, only 35% above average. So, for your brand ad copy, the clear direction you have from the data that's available to you is jump into the account and make it more relevant. That will improve your ad strength. And once you improve your ad strength, that will improve your quality score. And more times than, I think, it's a 12% increase in the number of impressions you can get if you increase from a below average to an above average for the data that's available here. And then, on the non-brand side, clear expected click-through rate, you really need to be working on.\n\n(00:50:13):\nAnd that data is also available here that you can kind of see. I put in red the one for brand, your quality score being at a nine, but your average CPC is $8. That is very interesting. It should be, the higher your CPC is, the lower your CPC should be. So that is an investigation that's like, \"Hey, here's a signal, let's go do a deep dive.\" So there's further reports that you could look at. Looking at the ad strength again, average, excellent, good, or poor. You can see clearly on the non-brand side doing really well. They're doing really well here. Most of their ads, 46 of their ads are excellent and a bulk of their spend is going there. But if we look on the brand side, you have one ad, one ad that you could go in and just click pause on, that is a poor. And look at that CPC $7.\n\n(00:51:19):\nSo just turning that ad off by itself, not only will... I'm a firm believer in that there's an account level quality score, not just necessarily a keyword or an ad quality score. So, just turning this one off and removing it from the account, this one ad could dramatically improve your performance. And then, Google actually tells you what you need to do to increase those strength things. So this report is ultimately powered by this one. So for your ad strength improvements, they'll tell you, \"Try adding a few more unique headlines or unpinning some of the ad sets. Try including more keywords in your descriptions or your headlines.\" So-\n\nTimothy Davis (00:52:00):\nIncluding more keywords in your descriptions or your headlines. So they're actually giving you this information, but more times than not, I just feel like people are just missing this and just not taking action on it. So definitely some stuff available within the account that will help you focus on that signal versus the noise that you could be just getting from the clicks, the impressions and all those things that are available to you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:24):\nThat was amazing. For folks not watching on YouTube, you pulled up actual reports from, I think, imagine, past clients, is that what the data was from?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:52:24):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:32):\nOkay, so actual reports from past clients of how you evaluate, and this is Google Ads, basically.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:52:38):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:38):\nGoogle Ads data. Incredible. Okay. And so within those reports, you had poor, excellent. How do you determine when something is going great? Is that something you set, like if it's above this threshold? Is that a benchmark you have, or is that Google telling you, \"This is poor, or this...\"\n\nTimothy Davis (00:52:54):\nYeah, so that's Google telling you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:56):\nOkay.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:52:57):\nThere's sometimes where you'll work really, really hard to take that poor to an average, that average to an excellent, and there's just not a whole lot you can do sometimes. It kind of is what it is. But I would argue more times than not, people are not doing those things to improve their ad strength. So just if you have the change history available in every account, in Meta, in Google, if people are doing the test to try and improve and get better, great. You have the right people working. But if not, that's a clear indication that there's definitely room for improvement.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:40):\nSomething that someone asked on Twitter is for benchmarks around any of the stuff. How do you know when your CPC is good? I guess you just look at... Do you look at Google telling you it's excellent versus poor? How do you know if your conversion rate is good? How do you know if your CAC is good?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:53:54):\nYeah, every industry and every company is going to be different, healthcare, lawyers, those are some of the highest cost and average CPCs I've seen. If I was to compare that industry, say to a B2B industry, it would not be very good at all. Honestly, what I would tell the user to do, every single platform has partners available, more times than not, they're kind of like salespeople. I actually really like the partners that we have at Shopify, because I do feel that they are partners. Shout out to Francisco at Google, and Sami and Alana at Meta. And Nick, and Sam, and Brian at LinkedIn, in case they all hear this. But I think they're really great partners, and they will give you that information.\n\n(00:54:44):\nThey will actually say, \"If you give me the five people you consider to be your top competitors, I will tell you if you are above or below a certain threshold.\" Now they can't tell you CAC because they would have to have transparency into conversions. But click-through rate, conversion rate, cost per click, things like that, they will give you that information because they will anonymize it, so you won't know who is who. If you say, \"My competitor's monday.com,\" they won't say, \"monday.com has a click-through rate of 5%.\" They won't tell you that. But they will tell you, \"Of the competitors you gave us, and we added three more in just to say, hey, we found some people.\" And also to where if you only give them two, you can be like, \"Oh, it's one or the other.\" That they'll give you that information because they want you to succeed. Because if you succeed, you spend more money on their platform.\n\n(00:55:38):\nSo if you find out your average CPC is really high, take the actions that are in the account that tell you what you can do to lower it. But if you find out that you have a lower CPC, you're like, \"Oh, great, I thought that was worse.\" And then you can communicate that internally to your team and say, \"Hey, our average CPCs may seem high, but in reality we got with our partners, and we are on par with the industry.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:02):\nGot it. So the advice is, don't seek generic benchmarks for any of these metrics. You can talk to your rep at Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, et cetera. And they'll give you essentially the numbers-\n\nTimothy Davis (00:56:13):\nGreat summary. Yes, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:14):\nAmazing. Okay, going back to the report you just showed, is that a report you developed custom that gives you, here's the most important stuff to pay attention to? Or is it basically an export from Google Ad Manager, and...\n\nTimothy Davis (00:56:26):\nSo these are all exports, so that this is just the visualization of the data that's available. So this all data is available in every account. This is data available in the account, this is data available in the account. Now in saying that, there are more reports that we get into, like impression sharing frequency. This is something I tend to look at, that not a lot of other people do. It's not about showing as often as possible because that's what impression share tells you, and that's kind of like ego marketing. I want to be number one, I want to be there all the time. It's about showing to the right person as often as possible.\n\n(00:57:06):\nInstead of thinking about being on top of the page, you should think about serving the right user, which can be measured with our click share. And then Google will put us on top of the page, which we can see through our top impression share. That's what this whole visualization is here for, where I feel like a lot of people don't do this type of visualization. And this can be done by leveraging all the user data available on Google, such as demographics, locations, if any audiences, in-market audiences. Testing different bid strategies and more.\n\n(00:57:40):\nSo the data's readily available, but it's just making the visualization a little bit more digestible. And the reason that I actually have two here to show is because this is an example of when I was working on an account back in 2023, where we started making some changes. And you can see that, clearly, our impression share, I would say was baseline. It didn't really change too much, but look at our click share going up. Because now again, we're talking more to the right people, not necessarily just everyone, generic people. Versus this campaign that was... This was the test and this was the control, and you can clearly see that we were talking to a lot of people, but no one cared about what we were talking about. So this was an easy test to call and just say, \"This one's performing a lot better.\" And then verifying the other metrics still look good, conversion rate, number of conversions, stuff like that. This one was the clear winner, so we went in this direction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:41):\nThis is super cool. I love that you're showing this. And again, plug for YouTube to actually see the charts you're talking about. I see one more slide on this deck. I'm curious, what's there?\n\nTimothy Davis (00:58:49):\nYeah, so this one, I'm hoping you have show notes that we can give a shout-out to somebody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:55):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nTimothy Davis (00:58:56):\nYep. There's a website called PPC Hero. What I usually tell people is, \"Terrible name, great content.\" The actual website used to be a little bit more cartoonish with superheroes on it, but now it's, they've refined it. But the writer there, his name's Jacob Brown. This is what he calls the true competition metric. And again, this is why I highly recommend we give people the link to the article because this does get a little dense. So what he does is that he creates four new metrics with the Auction Insights that are available. And two of those metrics are position above rate when we show, and amount of times they show and we don't. Added together, and it will show how often a competitor ranks above you in all auctions you're available for. Using this type of lens is an effective way to identify genuine threats.\n\n(00:59:56):\nNot that just, this data can be used to gain comprehensive insights like determining your position and impression share, but by creating a baseline that you can see how this data changes over time through different bid strategies, keyword ad copy optimizations and more. This is a very, very powerful one, because I do know a lot of people are always concerned about, \"What are my competitors doing? How are they doing it? Why are they doing it?\" And with all the smart bidding currently available...\n\n(01:00:25):\nBack in my day, it was all manual bid, so you could change the bid ever so slightly, and then be like, \"Oh, now my competitor's showing above me,\" and this is even before Google gave us Auction Insights data. This is now available to us in the platform. Using this report will actually identify a true threat, as opposed to making an assumption based on personalization that maybe you're seeing when you Google a keyword, or using a tool like Semrush that ultimately is saying, \"Oh, this person's appearing above you. Well, let's run this report and see if it's a genuine threat,\" as opposed to just maybe ego marketing going on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:09):\nSuper cool. And this comes from PPC Hero, is this what you're saying?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:01:13):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:13):\nCool. We'll definitely link to that. Are there any other tools or workflows that you find really helpful in analyzing this endless amount of data?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:01:24):\nPlease, audience, if you are using AI in this way, let me know because a lot of this stuff I do can be a little manual and can be a little time-consuming. If they've found ways to automate through AI where I can provide the information that isn't sensitive, that they will make it a lot cleaner, and a lot more digestible, let me know. But a lot of the things, I have templates that you can load the data into, and it will just automatically give you the result from it. But yeah, right now, it is a little manual, but if there's a way to automate this through AI, please, users, contact me on LinkedIn and let me know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:09):\nSounds like a startup opportunity right there.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:02:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:12):\nSweet. Okay, let's move in a slightly different direction. Attribution, what a sexy, exciting topic. So attribution, basically it's how do you assign credit to a channel and to a campaign, so that you know where growth is coming from, what's working? What's the state of attribution today? What do you find is helpful? How do people do attribution well in today's world?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:02:35):\nYeah, I'm a big believer and proponent in multi-touch. I fall into the camp of more time decay. Historically, the research I've done, users tend to forget very quickly where they first found your brand. Yes, you should get credit because this is the first time they saw your brand or the first time they interacted with it, for sure, let's give you some credit for that. But definitely not the reason that they ultimately converted. Linear is fine as well, but overall, I do think attribution by itself is biased. It does not answer the question of whether the person clicking on or seeing an ad would've converted anyways, even in the absence of that ad.\n\n(01:03:24):\nThis is why numerous companies like Netflix and eBay have done studies to get an understanding of the incrementality of paid advertising campaigns, whether that's conducting GeoX or Conversion Lift tests at important slices of the marketing channel. I know eBay was very popular when they did that experiment. I think it was like 2012, and I'll have a link for you for that as well. Where they ultimately decided to cut almost all of their brand spend, because they found that users were already going to find them through organic anyway, so they were just kind of throwing money out the window. And it was really hard for competitors to get their ads at the top of the page because their quality scores were so low.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):\nOkay, so multi-touch is the way you like to think about it. Basically give credits to all of the channels that you detected the user saw your ad on, and less credit if it was further back in time.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:04:19):\nRight, yep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:20):\nAnd then in terms of tooling, is there tools you love? Is it stuff you build in-house generally? How do people go about doing this sort of stuff?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:04:28):\nYeah, I don't know if I want to say I have been fortunate or not, but most of the companies I've worked with, like the big companies of the world, the Pinterests, the Shopifys, the IBMs of the world tend to build things in-house. So from a third-party tool, unfortunately, I don't have a whole lot of go-tos for that. So again, either that's a, I've been fortunate or I've been sheltered.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:54):\nAnd then, are there tools that you see people use, or is it just really nothing amazing out there?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:05:00):\nYeah, none that I've seen that's like, \"Oh wow, that's amazing.\" I will always say, make sure you're trying to leverage the in-platform tools because the biggest thing with performance marketing is the signal you're sending the platform. Because if you are telling the platform, \"Oh, I want to get more of the users that are doing this action,\" it's going to do a really good job of giving you that. But if that action doesn't equal business results, you're not helping yourself at the end of the day. You're giving it, again, a lot of noise instead of the right signal. So try and leverage the in-platform tools. Or if there is a tool you're using, make sure it does allow third-party integration through the Google, Meta, TikToks of the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):\nThen let's talk about incrementality. You mentioned this idea of how do you know if the money you spent led to incremental growth that wouldn't have happened if you didn't run that ad. Is there any advice there, anything you've seen about just how to think about incrementality correctly, and not just give yourself all this credit for stuff that would've happened anyway?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:06:09):\nYeah, I mean, there are many ways to judge the effectiveness of growth overall. Like some of the stuff we talked about before, brand metrics, awareness, recall, things along those lines. There are also, I know some companies look at leading indicators like visits, and clicks, or tribute, which of the efforts are linked to or perceived drivers of actions. Like leads, conversions to prospect, prospect to scale. But really the results should be coming from either that GeoX or Geo experiment or Conversion Lift. The results of those experiments should ultimately fuel the plans for what we call IAF, incrementality adjusted factor, and will allow you to be more precise and how efficient each channel is.\n\n(01:07:03):\nIdeally, by region, sometimes you just have a holistic of like, \"This is how Meta is, this is how YouTube is.\" But if you don't have it by region, don't fret, it's fine, just have it by platform. And kind of like what does that look in practice? When you're running a Conversion Lift test, you intentionally do not show your ad to some users when you win an auction, and instead Google shows the next bidders' ad. This is your control group, and adds up to some opportunity costs that is estimated in terms of impression share percentage, as well as spend holdback. Spend holdback is like how much money you will not spend because of this test.\n\n(01:07:42):\nAnd all of the platforms are willing to partner with you on this, because Facebook knows this, LinkedIn knows this. All of them know that they are very visually-based creative assets that are not getting as much credit as they deserve. So if you go to any of them, if say you don't have a dedicated rep you can call, and if you ask for this, more times than not, they are willing to partner with you in saying that, if you're not spending enough, they probably will not help you with this. Because there are certain spend thresholds you do need to meet. But I would say at least start there. And also if you're not spending more than I would say 50K a month in the platform, doing this is going to be a lot more work than you're going to get result from, you're just not going to have enough signal there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:36):\nSo basically don't worry about running incrementality tests when you're-\n\nTimothy Davis (01:08:39):\nYeah, when you're starting out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:42):\nGot it. Okay. And so basically to understand actual incrementality, every platform has a way for you to actually test it on the platform, and the team there can help you run it.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:08:51):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:52):\nAwesome. Okay. Let's go back to talking about team structure and how to build your own performance marketing team. So we talked about the first person that you hire and the advice there was someone that's very, understands how to find signal in noise. So there's that one person, and your advice there was maybe around like 50K. Was that like an actual threshold that you usually recommend, or is that just like an example?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:09:14):\nEvery business is slightly different. I mean, if they're well funded, 50K may not... the threshold may be higher. But yeah, everyone's different. 50K may be, like if somebody said... If you were to just say, \"Hey, give me a number,\" I would say, \"50K to start having those conversations.\" Because if you're at 50K, say for the month of June, great, it's going to take us three months to hire someone anyway, so at least start the conversations now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:39):\nAwesome. Okay. What do the first three to five hires look like generally, that you recommend for scaling internally from its marketing?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:09:48):\nSo the first thing, like we said, someone data-driven that can get into the platforms. The next is going to be creative. Because I need those two now working hand-in-hand, making sure the creative is matching the tone and also the performance that we're trying to achieve as a business. And then third would be a dedicated data scientist, a fully dedicated person. Because they can help you with things like the incrementality testing. They can help create reports that will ultimately make everyone's lives better. They will be able to build analyses that as a generalist will not be able to do yourself. There's a saying of like, \"I'm not a data scientist, but I like to play one online.\" Because what they do, they ultimately make us look really good. Because we're ultimately the ones reporting on the performance of it, but they were the ones that helped build that environment, and build all those things for us to succeed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:54):\nAnd then in terms of the creative person, is that like a graphic designer? Is it like a marketing person? What's the actual skill set there?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:11:02):\nIt would be more graphic design/branding. The reason for that is because if you have a good marketing mix, you're going to have... If we keep it to a three-step funnel of awareness, consideration, purchase, you're going to need to build some brand equity in a specific direction. You're going to need to make sure you're communicating value, which now you're not being as creative, you're being more directional. And then ultimately the purchase is like, \"Hey, click here, convert now.\" So you do want to give them the ability to still be creative. \"Hey, I hired you because you have a good creative eye and you're good at what you do, but now we need to focus on getting that person to convert.\" So you give them a little free rein to be creative, but then you also need them to be able to execute against that creative, you need to get those users to convert.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:54):\nAnd they're also writing the copy, I imagine for the Google Ads.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:11:59):\nI usually say that should be collaborative. The performance marketer should be able to write most of the ads, but I can't tell you how many times in my career where I've written an ad and I'm like, \"This is the greatest ad ever written known to man. People will write stories about this ad, it is amazing.\" And it flops because I'm not the target audience, more times than not. So I think it should be collaborative, and no idea should be left on the cutting room floor because... Perfect example. I was working with ADT, the security company. We wrote the most perfect ad when Google Ads only allowed a headline and two descriptions of 35 and 35. We got every single value prop in there somehow, it was amazing.\n\n(01:12:50):\nAnd the ad that it was going against was dollar sign, zero setup fee, dollar sign, zero install fee. That ad won. It was like that is... No, how did that... It barely uses any of the characters, and it tells you almost nothing, but it won. Had more conversions, a higher click-through rate. So we took that, and we applied that with the value props, and it did better. So it should never be like, unless the idea is don't buy our product, which hopefully someone is not writing that ad copy. It shouldn't be left on the cutting room floor. Always test it. Always be willing to learn what works, what doesn't.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):\nFor this first hire, what's the title of this person, usually in your experience?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:13:38):\nLately, it's been growth marketing specialist, growth marketing manager, because they're going to wear multiple hats. Like at any startup that you're at, you're going to be asked one day to, \"Hey, I want you to do performance ads,\" and then tomorrow it's like, \"Hey, I need you to help me build out this spreadsheet for a spec sheet that you have no idea what you're doing.\" So you're always going to wear multiple hats, so just having a general title like that to start out with. And then if that person matures into a role, you can make them more of a specialist. Or if they start showing signs of like, \"Hey, I really like doing the social stuff, and we've scaled enough. Okay, let me hire a paid search person.\" So yeah, I always start with a general, and then as the team grows, we get more into specialties.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:28):\nSo growth marketing person, it's kind of like the broad umbrella.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:14:32):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:32):\nAnd then are these people sitting in Google Ad Manager and Meta Ads and just like running ads manually?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:14:38):\nAt Shopify, we call it GSD, getting shit done. I'm a firm believer in getting shit done. You should be in the account, like I mentioned earlier with that ops cadence, we have stuff we need to be doing weekly, bi-weekly, monthly. The bigger the company gets, the [inaudible 01:14:55] you wind up in more and more meetings talking about the things you want to do, and how you're going to do it and stuff like that. But keeping those people kind of sheltered away from that and focused on those things, are going to drive the best results for you, you possibly can get.\n\n(01:15:11):\nAnd that means hands-on keyboards in the Ads Manager, tweaking things. Setting up a calendar. I'm a firm believer in setting up a calendar. \"We started this test on this day, that means this test will end a month from now.\" Put a notification, so you have a cool down period, and you report out to the org what you did, how you did it, why you did it, and then the results from it. And then, all right, what we learned from this is this, and we will be applying that to our next test, and this is how. So yeah, hands-on keyboards doing all of those things. So again, hiring those smart people, and just getting out of their way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:47):\nI love that. In terms of how this team grows, you mentioned when we were chatting, that you wait for someone to cry uncle, to hire more and to add to the team to kind of avoid bloat. Talk about that.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:16:02):\nUnfortunately, we've seen a lot in the news lately with a lot of tech companies letting go of some really talented people, and that is, I feel like just created bloated organizations. We, every month, my current manager, Dean, created this calculator that we look at that says, \"How much time are you spending in meetings?\" If you have any PTO coming up, put that in there. Optimizations, reporting, stuff like that to basically add up to how many days are in the quarter? Because every quarter... Well, not every quarter, but most quarters you'll have vacation, or you'll have, say, what we call a Shopify burst, where it's we meet in real life to get shit done in real life as opposed to remotely. Put all that in there, and then what does the number equate to? Oh, we're in the red right now for these two to five people.\n\n(01:16:59):\nHow many quarters has it been that way? Okay, it's only this quarter. This quarter, we have a summit coming up, or we have a burst coming up, or we have a lot of travel because we're meeting with partners, so on and so forth. So maybe this is an isolated thing, let's go ahead and wait till next quarter. All right, next quarter, it's red again. All right, now maybe we need to start having the conversation of, what this new hire will take over, what they will be responsible for, and how much work they'll be taking on and doing, to replace some of this red that is going on.\n\n(01:17:31):\nAnd if it equates to a full head, great, we can move forward, we've made our business case. But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes we're just red, and we need to do a better job of making sure, \"Hey, we need to step out of these meetings. These meetings are sucking out our time and we don't need to be a part of it.\" Or, \"This launch, we don't need to be a part of. We just need to be consulted on it. We don't need to be in every single meeting every single time, or every single communication.\" So just making sure we're looking at the right things before we decide to hire someone and making-\n\nTimothy Davis (01:18:00):\nJust making sure we're looking at the right things before we decide to hire someone and making sure that we have stuff for them to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:06):\nAnd red means they have more work?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:18:09):\nYeah. More days than there are in the quarter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:12):\nAnd so they basically estimate, \"Here's how many days I need to do the things I've committed to for the quarter.\" And then it's like, \"How many actual days do you have this quarter?\"\n\nTimothy Davis (01:18:20):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:20):\nThat is super cool. And so step one is, 'Okay, if you're in the red, let's cut some stuff.\" And then if they're still in the red and you've cut stuff, then, \" Okay, we need to start hiring.\"\n\nTimothy Davis (01:18:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:32):\nThat is very cool. Is that a Shopify thing or is that something you do at your team?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:18:36):\nI've done stuff like that at other companies before, but kind of bringing it forward again, I don't want to take the credit for it. Dean was the one that brought it back up. It was like, \"Oh yeah, I used to do this. I don't know why I stopped doing it.\" So it's definitely something I've used at other companies for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:52):\nThat is super cool. You mentioned this opps cadence. Is that something you can describe just what this cadence looks like of how you run?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:18:59):\nYeah. So I love me a spreadsheet. So it's just a spreadsheet. And visually, I'll do my best to describe it. Let's say column A has those buckets I was talking about a finance, performance structure, keywords, so on and so forth. And then within those buckets ... Or let's call those ... Everyone loves rocks and pebbles right now, right? So that's your big rock. Your big rock is keywords.\n\n(01:19:24):\nThen within that you have pebbles. Keyword granularity, brand versus non-brand, search query reports, negatives, so on, so forth. And then within that we say how often we're doing it. Are we doing it weekly, bi-weekly, monthly? And then that allows us to ... If anyone in the organization's like, \"Hey, how often are you guys updating ad copy?\" Easy answer. \"How often are you guys doing search query reports?\" Easy answer, And it allows us to make sure we hold ourselves accountable to those things because a lot of times we have a lot we're doing, We're working in Google, we're working in Meta, we're working in YouTube. You could easily forget, \"Oh, I didn't do that. I got to make sure I do that again.\" So it's a way to hold yourself accountable, but it's also a way for me as a manager to go in and kind of spot check that and make sure that they're doing the things that need to be done in the account.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:19):\nThe core of this, essentially, there's a spreadsheet that everyone aligns on of here's when and how often we do certain activity to operate this performance marketing machine that you've built.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:20:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:30):\nAwesome. And it's both internally so that everyone knows, and then also when people ask, \"Hey, when are you going to do this?\" \"Okay, here's the data.\"\n\nTimothy Davis (01:20:37):\nYeah. Yeah. So if a cross-functional team or partner wants to know, easy answer. \"We got it for you right here. Here's our whole opps cadence.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:46):\nIn terms of the team, something else folks told me about you is that you're very hardcore about training new people that you hire. What does people mean by that?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:20:56):\nYeah. There's a book called ... I think it's The First 90 Days, and in it actually has a graph that shows when the person starts having impact and how many days it's been. And more times than not, it takes about ... We've all heard it. 90 days for someone to have impact.\n\n(01:21:14):\nI want to try and make that 45 days, if not 30. Most of the time it has to do with learning the culture, learning the people understanding, \"Yes, you've done paid before at this other job, but this is how we do it here.\" That's where the opps cadence really comes in handy. It's like, \"Here's how often we do it here. I understand maybe you did it monthly there, but we do it here biweekly. And you're saying you used to do it biweekly, we do it weekly and this is how.\"\n\n(01:21:47):\nAnd also giving them responsibility early on for something. For example, Kat on my team was hired 8ish months ago. She was thrown into the fire very quickly. It was like, \"Hey, we have this campaign coming up called additions. Here's everything we did last additions. This is the results. These are your responsibilities, these are the expectations. Go. Go forth and conquer. As you come along. There may be something that doesn't make sense. I'm here by all means ask questions.\"\n\n(01:22:24):\nBut what I've noticed is twofold. One, when you're clear in what is expected of them, like, \"You are expected to do this when and you already know how to do it. Great.\" Or also in one-on-ones, I'll just open up the account and say, \"Hey, this is how I do it. Let me show you the way I'm doing it and how quick it is for me. And you can learn, even though we're remote, I'm showing you as if you're sitting right over my shoulder or we're face to face. This is how I do it.\" So if you're doing something different maybe ... One plus one is two, three minus one is two, and that's fine. We both got to the same answer. But if you're doing nine times five minus two times 12 divided by 15, nope, we can simplify this.\"\n\n(01:23:13):\nSo making sure that they're efficient and effective with their time, they're focusing on that signal versus that noise and giving them responsibility early on to really take ownership of something. You can see that people are a lot more quicker to pick up things and start getting that flywheel going of, \"Hey, I want to have impact as soon as possible.\" Versus, \"Oh, hey, go read this handbook week one. Week two, let me introduce you to the team. Week three.\" It's like slow rolling. \"We can speed this up guys. We can get people up to speed and making impact a lot sooner.\"\n\n(01:23:52):\nAnd also don't expect them to be perfect. You can't expect people to be perfect right out the gate. \" I can't remember every little thing I need to tell you, and there may be things I can learn from you.\" I can't tell you how many times I'm still learning from people around me. It's like, \"Oh, that's great. I didn't even think of that or I haven't tried that. I should totally do that.\" So just know that they're not going to be perfect out of the gate, but giving them clear direction and expectations, we'll get them where they need to be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:28):\nI could see why your team is so effective and so successful. This all makes a lot of sense. You mind if I do a rapid fire set of questions that people asked on Twitter about very specific stuff?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:24:40):\nYeah. By all means.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:41):\nOkay, ATT, there was a huge change to the way cookies and attribution and tracking worked online and it felt like paid ads kind of like, \"Oh, shit. That's not going to work anymore. It's over. Facebook is dead.\" Clearly that hasn't happened at this point. Just what is the impact that ATT has had on paid ads and performance marketing?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:25:02):\nWe were just talking about this the other day because we have ... Full transparency, we have people fully dedicated to mobile on the team, and I had reached out to Sasha who's on the team and said, \"Hey, what are we doing with ATT? What are we doing scan? All those things? Because has any of our tactics really changed because of say, low opt-in rates?\" And the direct answer I got from her was, \"As long as we can use scan to provide attribution and measurement for iOS, we're fine.\" It's like, \"Okay, that's very straightforward. I appreciate it.\" So as long as you're doing those things, you should be okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:50):\nAmazing. That's great. So basically the show goes on, things change, but people find ways to work around it. Okay. Creatives, how impactful are creative in the performance of ads generally? Is that like, \"Holy shit. People are way under estimating the power of a creative.\" Or is it like, \"Okay, it's like a fringe impact?\"\n\nTimothy Davis (01:26:10):\nWay underestimating the power of creative. The best example I can give ... Do you remember Dollar Shave Club?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:19):\nAbsolutely. Their video.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:26:21):\nAll right. There you go. You remember it. That was creative. Now the person buying it may have done a really good job of just targeting males, but I would argue girlfriends at the time probably would've been aware of it as well. Really good creative should be doing a really good job of telling a story. And if it does that ... Again, going back to what we talked about at the very beginning, if you get that emotion with users, whether that's pulling at the hard strings or comedy, it's going to have a lasting impact.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:57):\nOkay. Chuck on Twitter asked, \"When someone steals your traffic, say in Google search results and buying up keywords around your companies, what should you do? Any advice?\"\n\nTimothy Davis (01:27:07):\nYeah. So that actually goes back to the visual that we showed and I'll pull it back up as I'm talking through it. The biggest thing is just know that anyone can do that. You can do it too, if you are ultimately concerned about it. But a lot of times competitors could be doing it on accident. And what I mean by accident is within Google, if you're bidding on keywords, Google will do what's called a close variant. If you were to do say e-commerce solution, I bet you Shopify shows up as a close variant at some point or Square or anyone like that. So they could just be mismanaging their account first and foremost. Don't give them that much credit that they're doing this maliciously or even doing it with intent.\n\n(01:27:59):\nAnd again, it will be in the show notes. If you do pull this report and you do notice that there is a clear threat that's going on here, first things first, let's make sure that they're not doing anything egregious like saying, \"Lenny and Tim are better than Monday.com.\"\n\n(01:28:15):\nYou cannot be, if the brand is trademarked within Google, they cannot use your name within the ad copy. Google more times than not will disallow it, but they could misspell it. I can't tell you how many times I've seen Shopify spelled with two I's because Google isn't catching it, but we can always put in a claim to say, \"Hey Google, please remove this.\"\n\n(01:28:40):\nBut if we do run this ...You can kind of see that the orange line here, and for those that are just listening. Orange line is rather consistent over time. There is a two week period where it dips, but it does come back up. There's another line that at the beginning of this visual, green is actually above orange. And if you look at the green one over time it almost disappears. So the reason I would say make sure you're looking at this report, and it's not just ego marketing, it could be an error. The issue could be the green one, specifically, could have been getting a close variant. They identified it, they removed it. \"Oh wait, a couple of weeks later, we didn't fully remove it. Now let's remove it completely. And now they're almost gone completely.\" So make sure you're looking at the data and reacting to consistent competitor conquesting versus something that could just be an accident or users not knowing what they're doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:40):\nAmazing. And this is PPC Hero again, right? PPChero.com or whatever?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:29:44):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:44):\nOkay, cool.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:29:45):\nWe'll share it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:46):\nYeah. We'll link it to it in the show notes. Okay. Last question. AI. You mentioned AI. You're looking for AI tools to help you with your workflows and analyze data. I guess is there anything you've seen AI impact in the work of paid growth and performance marketing, or is it like in the future might, other than obviously the algorithms on the platforms?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:30:06):\nI remember having this conversation a couple of months ago. AI, couldn't get away from it, right? It was everywhere, and what we were doing was leadership on know, \"In all of our quarterly planning, what are we doing about AI? How are we using ai? What are we doing that's different?\"\n\n(01:30:28):\nAs always, I go to the partners and I say, \"Hey, what are we doing about this?\" And Francisco at Google, actually, he made a really good point. \"You guys have been using AI for years now. Smart Bidding is AI. All of the recommendations within Google Ads is AI. Ad copy recommendations is AI, and that's always been in the platform, so we've always used those things.\"\n\n(01:30:59):\nSo it was kind of like, let's reset the conversation of, \"Hey, this has been here. We have been using it, this is how we've been using it and moving forward, these are some of the things we think we'll start doing.\" I do think it's having a huge impact from a content standpoint and a creative standpoint. Now, if those two kind of converge together, you have a perfect storm, right? But it is something that I keep a relative close eye on, but like I said earlier, hopefully some of your users can share more information with me. But it's not something that I would say is overly impactful yet, but I could see how it could be used maliciously if you can do API connections and things along those lines, for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:48):\nWait, what do you mean by that?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:31:49):\nAgain, Google will disallow certain things, but it takes time sometimes. If the term is copyrighted in Google for ad copy, it'll disallow it immediately. But say they need to do a check, you'll see a lot of times under review or pending in the account. But you'll also see impressions potentially attached to that. It's because Google's like, \"Oh, we'll serve a little bit of it, and then if it's malicious, we'll pull it back.\" I could see a way that somebody could automate AI to where it's always updating it to where it's like, \"Oh, let's just get a little drip here, a little drip here, a little drip here.\" And that little drip equates to a lot, but that's something AI could help with a human doing that would just take forever and be a total waste of time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:34):\nGot it. Just run tons of ads, just keep trying, trying, trying trying stuff. Slip through the cracks. You mentioned creative. It actually came back to question I forgot to ask. Going back to the team that you hired to run this sort of stuff, you hire this one person, growth marketer, specialist type of person, and the next hire is a creative. What's a sign that it's time to hire the creative person? Is there anything there? Is it just like, \"We have budget and this is working?\" Or is there anything else of, \"Like, okay, this is a good time?\"\n\nTimothy Davis (01:33:00):\nYeah, if you're using a creative agency and they're getting you everything you want and you're happy with it, then it may not make sense to hire a creative. But more times not what I've noticed from creative ... Creative independence tend to do better than an agency. The biggest difference I see is that matching the right tone, matching the right creative look and feel that you're going for is accomplished way better in-house, and also coming up with new ideas that you can test quickly and iterate on versus, \"We only have so many hours with the agency this month, or we only have so much budget we can spend with them.\" Where if you have that person in-house fully dedicated to the product itself, you'll never run into those caps.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:49):\nIt feels like if anywhere that scenario AI is going to empower that initial hire to do more creative on their own, you would think?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:33:56):\nYeah. Yeah. And that's not always the best way to go. I've seen some ads in there where it's like, \"Oh yeah, they're being scrappy. I see what they're doing.\" But to your point, maybe that's where AI kind of bridges the gap. Because I can't tell you how many times in the past it's like, Guys, we've got to be able to do retargeting, but we have no creative to do.\" Google has the dynamic ad builder and they've had it for I feel like years now, and that was just like, \"Give us a couple of images and we will make a display ad for you that should perform because we're testing many different iterations of it.\" Meta is probably going to come along with something as well that it's like, \"Give us a picture of your product and we'll put different backgrounds on it and test what works and what doesn't.\" Things along those lines.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:45):\nThat makes so much sense. Timothy, we've covered so much ground. This is everything I was hoping it would be. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think would be important or valuable for listeners when they're trying to do this stuff on their own? Any other nuggets left that we haven't already covered?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:35:05):\nYeah. I said it at one point, but I'll reiterate it. I'm always forward thinking, backwards planning. Just as you're going through it, \"Where do you want to be and ultimately how do you think you're going to get there?\" Because say your goal is to be on all platforms. \"I want to be on Pinterest, I want to be on X, I want to be on everything.\" \"Okay, forward think. That's where you want to be. Now let's backwards plan. \"What can we do right now? We can do search because that's only content and that's keywords. We can do that. All right, now we need creative, but where do we start?\" And then make iterations along the way. It's just always forward think, backwards plan, and that's for anything.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:49):\nWhat are other examples of forward thinking? Because in a sense everyone will be like, \"I want to be on every platform.\" I guess what are other things that people think about when they're like, the forward thinking is like, \"Oh, we want to win Google search.\" Is that an example of forward thinking? What else? What else should people thinking?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:36:06):\nYeah, exactly. What are those goals you want to hit? One of the things that we look at is what emerging channels to perform in it. \"So what is it going to take for us to consider this channel a performing channel that is an always on, we're we're adopting it as BAU? So that's going to take a thousand conversions a month at this much spend with this much lift associated with it. So okay, we know what that looks like, so we're going to backwards plan where we're going to start. We're going to start with this one ad creative. \"Okay, that works. Then we're going to go to this next ...\" Because within each platform, they all have multiple types of ad units You can use. Say in LinkedIn, there's feed, there's conversation, there's video, there's carousel. So it's what are the milestones along the way that you're going to do to ultimately get it from testing emerging channel to perform them? So that would be an example of something more micro than macro.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:16):\nGot it. Well, with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:37:22):\nOh yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:23):\nFirst question. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:37:28):\nDaily Stoic by far. A book I read every day. Quick excerpt of what you can do from a stoic philosophy standpoint. Great By Choice is another good one. And Deep Work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:45):\nFavorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:37:49):\nX-Men '97. Thoroughly enjoyed that. But that may be a lot of nostalgia. I actually never watched RRR when it first came out. Highly recommend that. That was a lot more enjoyable than I was anticipating. The Playlist, which is about Spotify, Welcome to Wrexham and Billion Dollar Code, also on Netflix, about Google Earth. Very interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:16):\nYeah, RRR. That movie is intense and very long also. It's like, man, I\n\nTimothy Davis (01:38:21):\nThree and a half hours.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:23):\n... just have to split it up into different days to finish it, but it is incredible. No intent. Okay. Favorite recent product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:38:31):\nI drink too much caffeine and I've been trying to cut it out and I kind of circled back to this product I used to use called Magic Mind. It's a little shot every single day. Tastes really good and it does help with focus I find. If it's a placebo, great, I don't care, but it's helping me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:52):\nThat's amazing. I'm also a huge fan of Magic Mind. I'm friends with the guy that started it. So funny that you love it. I drink it often.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:38:53):\nGreat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:00):\nI am on the subscription plan and I think he uses Shopify to sell it.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:39:05):\nHe does. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:06):\nIt all connects. Amazing. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends or family? Find useful in work in life?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:39:15):\nHappiness is dedicated by expectations or dictated by expectations. That can't be more true more times than not, and it's similar. That's why I said there's two, and this one's similar to it. You won't see it for what it is until you stop looking through the lens of what you want it to be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:35):\nAmazing. It reminds me of an equation a colleague of mine once shared. He wrote a book of emotional equations or life equations. It was happiness is reality minus expectations.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:39:48):\nYeah. Love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:51):\nOkay, next question. Who's had the most influence on you in your career?\n\nTimothy Davis (01:39:56):\nWell, we mentioned him before, so I got to bring him back up. Kasey Winters for sure. We were at a wedding. He showed me the original version of Google Analytics. For those of you that don't know, it's called Urchin, and when he showed that to me, it was, \"Wait, you know all of this information about users coming to the site.\" I knew I wanted to do marketing, but at that moment I knew I was going to do digital marketing and watch him grow in his career. He's watching me grow in my career. We still balance each questions off of each other. We cannot not have a phone call under an hour. So definitely the most impactful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:36):\nIs there something about Casey Winters that people may not know? He's a two time podcast guest, huge friend of the show.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:40:44):\nCasey is really good at tennis, like insanely good at tennis. You want to know how good? This is how good he was. In high school, he played ... I'm pretty sure it was our senior year. He hadn't played in a year, maybe a year plus. He was still ranked top 10 in the state of Louisiana for tennis players. Hasn't played in a year and still considered one of the top 10 players. Insane.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:15):\nDid not know that. I actually played tennis in high school, and so that's amazing. I did not know this. Thanks for sharing that. Timothy, this was incredible. I think this is going to help a lot of people figure out [inaudible 01:41:28] marketing, run more paid growth ads, figure out who to bring in to help them do this. Thank you so much for sharing and for being here.\n\nTimothy Davis (01:41:36):\nOf course. Appreciate the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:38):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:41:40):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How we restructured Airtable's entire org for AI | Howie Liu (co-founder and CEO)\n\n## Transcript\n\nTobi Lütke (00:00:00):\nYour podcast is a podcast by a builder for other builders. Here's the most interesting question I think people can ask builders, what is your energy source? My energy source is dissatisfaction with status quo. There are so many books are about this ... Technology leading to dystopia. Like no one who really thinks about this would want to be born into a world 20 years before today. I think today is the dystopia of the future. It behooves us to try to build the kinds of products that leads in ... Towards progress.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):\nThere's a couple quotes along these lines I've seen that describe the way you think about this stuff. \"If most people are doing it a certain way I by default don't want to do it that way.\"\n\nTobi Lütke (00:00:34):\nThere's an aesthetic in the world that exists which is that business people dress in suit and tie, they are speaking much more sophisticated than I do, usually without an accent. They usually have a stick and show dramatically at the chart that is behind them. How much is that aesthetic overlapped with outperformance? Pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated. Optimism always sounds dumb or at least naive. The most powerful unquantifiable things in the word of business are fun and delight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):\nI don't know of any other company that operates where the founder has this 100-year vision of where the product needs to go and working backwards from that.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:01:11):\nI talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot, right? It's like what would we want to have done 20 years ago on this? We have very long-term plans. At 100 years you can't talk about this software project but you can talk about the mission itself, whatever things that will survive for 80 years that are left on this particular timeframe. Entrepreneurship is just precious. Shopify exists, basically, to make entrepreneurship more common.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):\nIs there anything you want to leave listeners with?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:01:37):\nI really, really, really think that there is not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential. Reminding people of their own potential constantly is actually a wonderful thing to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:54):\nToday my guest is Tobi Lütke. Toby is a man who needs no introduction so I'm going to keep this very short and get you right to this jam-packed conversation. If you enjoy this podcast don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube, it's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that I bring you Tobi Lütke. This episode is brought to you by Sinch, the customer communications cloud. Here's the thing about digital customer communications. Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes, or account alerts you need them to reach users reliably, that's where Sinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally use Sinch's API to build messaging, email, and calling into their products.\n\n(00:02:42):\nAnd there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about, Rich Communication Services or RCS.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:04:24):\nI'm glad to be here. I'm excited for our conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:26):\nI've listened to so many of your other interviews, I've talked to a bunch of people that work for you. I want to try to do something a little different. There's basically two themes that emerged over and over and over as I've listened to you share advice, and interview, and in talking to people that work for you. One is thinking from first principles, the other is maximizing human potential. I'm just going to plant these seeds for now. I'm going to not ask about these directly, I'm going to come at these from the side with the many questions that I have for you. Something that I've heard people describe at Shopify called the Tobi tornado.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:05:01):\nOh, wow. Okay, that's a start. I like it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):\nWhat is the Tobi tornado?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:05:08):\nA Tobi tornado, I would say, is a whole lot of change management or a conversation or conflict or real talk compressed into a very short timeframe. I see something it doesn't ... It's not good, I have a conversation. I have learned something very quickly about hey, I need to update my priors, or cool, let's do it differently. At which point a project might be stopped and we get back together in a room and then we start a new version of a product. And everyone who's currently on the team, of that particular project, is no longer on the project but they are the founders of the next version which is built differently. And that might be a bit whiplashy for people. I mean, I certainly hope that's true, it's certainly what people tell me. It's also what they appreciate about the company. It's like what is best ends up mattering a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:08):\nBasically, it's you going into a chat room being like \"Hey, this\" ... \"We're going to end this project we're\" ... \"Let's try something else\" because you've discovered or realized this is a bad idea. Some people complain about this practice of like \"Oh, Tobi kills the we've been working on.\" My lens is, you realize we're just wasting time on this thing that is not going to work and we shouldn't do it. Is there anything there along those lines?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:06:32):\nNo. This is everything. Again, once I imagine something might be not the right thing to work on I'm either incorrect at which point this is super important that I understand why or I'm correct at which point it's super unfair for letting people work on something that isn't going to make it. There's a third wave which is I could also ignore it but that's an abjection of my CEO and founder responsibility that I'm absolutely not willing to make so that's just not a path forward that I see valid. I understand that's what a lot of people choose to do. So yeah, compressing time is important. We have a fairly limited time in our careers, right? Our careers are not that long. If you're lucky you have 40 years in the industry. Most people spent more time in school and then maybe leave later if they're so lucky that they can. So it's not even that.\n\n(00:07:33):\nI think you want to do the maximum amount of things you can be proud of at the end of your career. When you look back you want to be saying, \"Hey, holy shit, we shipped this thing which was absolutely an incredible contribution to a mission I cared about at a company that was full of other people who cared as much as I did.\" And also are very proud of working. And maybe even thinking of working with me and being really, really glad that we spent time on projects together. Yeah, none of this happens if everyone's sort of optimizing a thing that probably shouldn't be there, right? And, therefore, I think it's the better thing to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:16):\nAnd, by the way, I love this way of describing ... Of compressing it in time to just make a decision, not focus on making it come across the most kind, nicest, sweetest way. When you give feedback to people when something is not the way that you think it could be or as good as you could be it's often very direct and often hard to hear. To me this comes across as you're trying to maximize their potential, you're trying to push them to do something better. Is there anything there that you think is a way of approaching feedback?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:08:49):\nI really, really, really think that there is not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential. I just think everyone is way, way, way, way, way better than they think. And the reason why we're not performing at this level is a series of ideas, maybe certain approaches for cultivating our skills and our crafts that have not yet been discovered and, therefore, we could not take advantage of them. It's an environment that just narrows the focus on fairly unambitious things at which point you get stuck competing with literally everyone else in the world because everyone's unambitious.\n\n(00:09:33):\nI have found that reminding people of their own potential constantly is actually a wonderful thing to do. And I have a history of being right about people's potential more than they are themselves. Now, in a way, this dooms me fairly often to be disappointed, right, in myself. By the way, I'm talking about myself here too. I think I have way more potential than what I bring to bear and I hate that so I'm trying to cultivate the skills that I need for tomorrow and constantly challenge myself. I'm harder on myself than on anyone else. By some discount rate act equally to the people around me, especially the ones who just so, obviously, are brilliant.\n\n(00:10:23):\nSpending time and longer time in careers with people and then holding them to a high standard means that they accomplish very often things that just they didn't imagine they could. To me this is the most wonderful thing to see. And frankly this is a throughline for all of my career because this ... My product is that. I want my product to cause people to be more successful than they thought they could. And, in fact, become more ambitious about what they are building with their online stores and their businesses than they are actually initially set out to do.\n\n(00:10:56):\nBecause something like this happened to me, right? I started a snowboard store at some point. I didn't set out to build Shopify. If you are committed to following your curiosity as to the next step, and optimize for maximum amount of learning when you choose these steps, it takes you from one place to another and you actually realize the world's full of lies about human potential and progress. Maybe people are not malicious about it but they're definitely confused about it. School teaches you that you have to learn this particular piece of math in this 12 month period, and it doesn't matter how much you understand it. It's like the outcome can be variable and will grade you on a variable outcome for a fixed amount of time which has nothing to do with anything I've ever seen or learned or see ... Or witnessed about how to actually learn things. You follow that thread and you just find that there is no speed limit for personal growth. In a way Shopify has been a wonderful experimental lab for this sort of conviction. I've just seen this to come to be true. And, of course, hearing from someone that you respect that \"Hey, I think you had it in you to do this thing significantly better because I think you probably saw fairly early in the project this sort of path A path B. You chose path B potentially out of convenience even though you knew that wasn't the right thing. And I actually expected better of you and I expected\" ... \"I think the next time this happens in your career you should go path A because\" ... \"Based on your conviction.\" And, therefore, that's hard to hear, right, because it's right. But it's also extremely valuable, right? What I love is an environment of people who are holding each other accountable to the actual potential rather than sort of their current level plus or ... Plus some, I don't know, a little bit extra.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:19):\nThere's so many threads I want to follow here. The example of the school is such a pertinent one. To me right now we're looking at preschools for our son and I'm ... They're describing their education philosophy I'm like, I don't know why I should believe this is the right approach. And it makes me just want to spend all this time researching what education approach works. I know it's just preschool and maybe not as critical yet.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:13:38):\nDid you have a bet yet? I have three kids too and this is sort of a decision that every parent faces, right? So many of your listeners are probably product managers of machine learning products that maybe this resonates. So there's a funny thing about machine learning which you're just like ... You train on a lot of data, and, hopefully, you get something that predicts the thing you want it to predict correctly out of it. The biggest problem of this is overfitting, right? What does good look like, a loss function? Which is a heuristic because it's not the actual task that the thing will do in the future it's something that proxies to the task that you want the thing to do in the future. Predict fraud, predict the next word, whatever. So overfitting is basically model learning how to cheat on the benchmark or on the fitness function.\n\n(00:14:39):\nSo there's a business analogy of this which is that ... It's called Goodhart's law. It's literally the same thing as overfitting just for businesses. Goodhart's law just says, \"Any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric.\" Same exact thing. The universal truths are things that almost any competitive field will invent for itself by different terminology often. And I think this is also, by the way, why it's so interesting to focus on personal growth and learning a lot about a lot because you end up finding these sort of hidden harmonies behind things, the things that are clearly enduring correct insights. So overfitting, Goodhart's law are the same thing. School optimizes for what? Marks supposedly, right? In fact, overfitting in school is literally the kids cheating to get marks, right? You get another analogy. What is however the right loss function for children? Have you made a decision yet?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:53):\nNo, I have not we just started down this path. You told me-\n\nTobi Lütke (00:15:55):\nIt's the kind of thing [inaudible 00:15:57]. You have to actually go fairly deep in philosophy to figure this out. And then again afterwards you can build, you can find the schools that you like. For us it was just maintaining curiosity. This is a completely different goal from being good at marks. But I just think everyone's born extremely curious and school has a habit of getting it out of kids. Literally, there's a foundation model of a child, and you fine-tune it at school, and it just loses the neurons of curiosity because it's actually discouraged to meander into other topics and explore them just because they're interesting. I don't know. This is sort of not the beat of a podcast but I just think about this a lot. It's funny how these things just recur constantly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:48):\nSo when Archie was on the podcast, he's the head of growth at Shopify ... I don't know if that's his official role. Basically drives a lot of the growth. He talked about how the core product team, outside of the growth team, operates without KPIs, without specific goals. And decisions are driven by taste and intuition primarily you, and Glen, and some other leaders. And a lot of people heard that and they're like \"I\" ... \"First, I don't believe that. Second of all, how does one operate that way when there's no data to tell us exactly what is right and good?\" So the question I have is just how does one operate in that way successfully? What does it take for a company to work that way because a lot of people will try it and fail?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:17:25):\nThis is very close to what I just talked about before with [inaudible 00:17:28]. Goodhart's law is real. The moment a metric becomes a goal it's no longer a useful metric, right? I think that's more or less a precise wording. Why? Because no metric by itself is a complete heuristic for a complex business because business are complex. There's a million of different tensions in a company and you can't all keep them in harmony by optimizing for one fix. It's true that we don't have KPIs and we don't have at least OKRs in the Silicon Valley sense but we are extremely data-informed. We have invested enormous amounts of money and time into systems that give us basically everything at our fingertips. I sent this demo to other founders and they're completely bowled over by the way we can dig into basically every constituent atomic bit part that makes up the cohort that just got formed 15 minutes ago by the end of a ... At the end of a quarter or month or week.\n\n(00:18:39):\nIn a lot of different places, this is one of them but also in its products, it's just not overfitting for the quantifiable. Everyone competes for everything but it's highly quantifiable because it's ... It's fun, it's like a game. You tweak a number and 0.1 more is better than 0.1 less. That's an immediate gratification thing. But I just think the overlap of most valuable things you can do with a product, and for things that happen to be fully quantifiable, it's like maybe 20% which leaves 80% of a value space unaddressable by the people who will only look at quantifiable things. Shopify is comfortable with the unquantifiable things such as tastes, quality, passion, love, hate. It's with the strong emotions that people have.\n\n(00:19:49):\nThe sort of deep satisfaction that a craftsperson feels when they've done a job well is actually better proxy if you allow it to be then the ... Do a unit test pass. A unit tests might not pass. And the unit tests will pass 15 minutes later because we already fix them or adjust the one or two things so they support us. We have systems that tell us exactly if something goes the wrong way. There's an extremely sophisticated rollout system in Shopify that forever holdouts and correlates everything with everything for ... In every experiment and so on and so on and so on. But if you think about it as a cockpit for a pilot. The decisions are still made by pilots and we think this leads to better results. It's just the same with our product. There's plenty of A/B testing tools and all these things for commerce, and it's, of course, really important to figure out what your conversion rates are. But are you representing your brand is an unquantifiable question? Are you proud of the thing that you have built? Do you feel it's your own, right?\n\n(00:21:03):\nAnd so I think there needs to be more acceptance in businesses or for unquantifiable things. The most powerful, not unquantifiable things in the world of business are fun and delight. If people have fun when they're doing something that is just upstream from so ... Sorry, downstream from so many other things. I think that if all the metrics are pointing down but everyone says, \"My God, I'm having so much more fun,\" I think that the very next thing that will happen with some time delay is all metrics will start going up. And if that doesn't happen then we adjust course.\n\n(00:21:51):\nThe reason why we specifically don't have OKRs and these things is because ... If you want to hold the unquantifiable as things that are stable and exist ... That people actually do really defer to them and really actually learn to be okay with someone just saying, \"Hey, this is actually just really great and they're shipping this\" then you need to make certain edits to a business that don't remind everyone too much of the companies they might have come from which the only way to get promoted is by driving the metric up. It's a bit of a [inaudible 00:22:24] conversation I suppose. Good on the fortune cookies saying, \"Shopify doesn't do OKRs or doesn't do metrics\" and so on. But it's actually just because the metrics take us [inaudible 00:22:37] function where we often defer to just more ... Sometimes a little bit emotional but generally less quantifiable things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:48):\nI imagine if someone were to hear you describe this of focus on joy, and fun, and love, and delight, maybe ... It's easy to dismiss that.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:22:58):\nIt sounds completely idiotic, right? Again, there's an aesthetic in the world that exists which is that business people dress in suit and tie, they are speaking much more sophisticated than I do usually without an accent, have a full head of hair. They talk about metrics, they are in front of PowerPoint presentations, they usually have a stick and show dramatically at the pie chart that is behind them. And highly charismatic, highly ... So that's our aesthetic. How much is that aesthetic overlapped with our performance? I don't know but some of them ... Some people pull it off who are like this. I think the world is sort of stacked to lead us astray based on our stories about what optimal looks like are just so incorrect in so many ways. Optimism always sounds dumb, or at least naive. Pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated. Metrics driven sounds extremely sophisticated. Talking about fun sounds like naive.\n\n(00:24:14):\nWell, first of all, I've always ignored what people think generally. That came pretty natively to me somehow which I'm very lucky about. But I've now actually learned that almost all of the alpha in the world is now in the ... Exactly the things that are unobvious but true. And the things that people dismiss as naive or so. The most successful business person on planet Earth is Elon and he conforms to no idea of what the most sophisticated business person ought to be like in any which way you can imagine. I think we live in a world where the counterfactuals are winning because our ... Because aesthetics are just leading us astray.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):\nThis is an awesome segue to the other theme that I wanted to spend some time on which is thinking from first principles, Elon is the classic example of that. Honestly, I think you're the other most classic example of that these days. And we'll keep talking about all the ways you operate very differently from other companies which are examples of this. But I want to read a quote from Glen Coates, he shared with me, of how he sees you that gives an interesting lens into your first principles thinking. So here's what he said about you. \"Tobi is at his heart a true futurist, he's obsessed with the way things should be in the future. Being data-driven is innately being anchored in the way users and technology are behaving today. He's never really said this to me explicitly, but knowing him I think any design that is drawn primarily from the way things are or were is one that he sees as inferior to one that is skating to the puck of the way things could or should be.\" Does that resonate?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:25:55):\nYeah. I mean, I think that's correct. That's actually really interesting. Your podcast is a podcast by a-\n\nTobi Lütke (00:26:01):\nYour podcast is a podcast by a builder for other builders. Here's the most interesting question I think people can ask builders is like, \"What is your energy source? Where are you getting energy from?\" I think fundamentally the world exists at room temperature. Almost all companies are running at that, humming along, doesn't do anything. There are certain individuals who can inject heat into businesses. Founders do this very well. All the startups anyone's ever heard of have people who are injecting heat because if no one would inject heat into the business, at room temperature, you cannot outperform anyone else. You can't be hotter than everyone else if no one's injecting heat into the concern. So fundamentally, there is a injection of energy into companies that comes from founders and the best leaders, like all the people you've had on the podcast from Shopify have a perfect set of cast of characters of people who are just exothermic. They are just like wellsprings of energy that leads to all the amazing results that we get to enjoy.\n\n(00:27:21):\nSo the question is where does energy comes from? And that's another one of our discussions which very quickly goes into the emotions. Actually, there's a really... So I watched The Last Dance, the Netflix special of Michael Jordan a while ago, of course, but there was one scene where he just, I'm sure this is a super famous story and he just made up an insight that someone told him so that he would then go and just want to destroy them afterwards, which he then of course proceeded to do because it's hard to imagine anyone more exothermic than him. So we know what his energy source is. It's rivalry. It's potentially it's insight or it's anger, something like this.\n\n(00:28:06):\nI am not... My energy source is dissatisfaction with status quo. My fundamental belief is all this talk about technology where all... So many books are about just technology leading to dystopia. You know what dystopia is? Today, compared to what it will be in 20 years ago or any. And you can play this for any part of human history. I'm not making a future statement. I'm making a almost totalical statement about the experience on planet Earth. No one who really thinks about this would want to be born into a world 20 years before today rather than today. And so I think today is the dystopia of future, and I think it behooves us to try to build the kinds of products that lead in towards progress in a small way or a big way. But yes, I think if someone comes to me and says, \"Hey, let's go do this thing. And we've looked around and here's how people solve this problem, let's make a good version of that,\" I'm like, \"That was not the job.\" Because everything that you encounter, that every solution, every product, everything that exists is path-dependent, highly, highly, highly path-dependent, and often path-dependent based on having to make compromises, based on things that were true at the time a decision was made but are no longer true.\n\n(00:29:38):\nThe entire field of... What was it? I forgot the name of a field. Chomsky's field, the linguistic research field. It's cool. We now have autoregressive models that are just like, we don't actually need to set up a complete... We don't need to research the structure of grammar to be able to make machines also engage in the spoken word. We actually can just train on the internet, it turns out. So that was not possible back then because you didn't have the right architecture for this, but now it is. So I think what you have to do is to actually have, when you come up with a new product or you discuss a new product, you have to derive it from first principles. You have to say, \"How would we solve this problem given every fundamental building block that we have available right now?\"\n\n(00:30:25):\nFor that, to do that, you actually have to understand the power and the composability of all the building blocks that exist right now, which is a tall order and no one is perfect at this. But so this way, you go ahead and say, \"Okay, cool, so this is how we are implementing this thing. This is how it will be implemented today.\" And now we can talk ourselves in taking shortcuts. \"Maybe we should actually start up doing it the way everyone else does. Maybe we derived exactly what everyone else does as the correct thing to do.\"\n\n(00:30:56):\nSometimes there was a lot more wisdom encoded in the status quo than you expect, which is I think is super delightful. Then you figure that out and so when you act on it. But what isn't okay is skipping the exercise and doing the same thing everyone else does because that is again a abdication of product leadership. And so yeah, I would say I become extremely suspicious if I get a pitch to do a good version of the same thing everyone else does because I just find that in our space specifically very rarely to be the best solution.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:33):\nThere's a couple quotes along these lines I've seen that describe the way you think about this stuff. \"If most people are doing it a certain way, I, by default, don't want to do it that way. And if you want to do something world-class, you can't do it like everyone else.\"\n\nTobi Lütke (00:31:46):\nYeah. I don't even think that's an opinion that I hold. I think that's actually... We are basically in axiom territory here. If you want to do something better than what exists, you have to do it differently. That does not make a statement about if it will be better in the end after you do it. It could also be worse. But you can't get something better done if you do the same thing. It's like axiomatically not possible to do. It's fails Archimedean logic, yet it's something... You would be amazed how many business plans are actually failing Archimedean logic in this way like, \"Let's do a good version of this thing that we've already been doing and we will capture 1% of the market,\" and just like this stuff. It's like, \"Trust me.\" I find it kind of cute.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:36):\nIs there an example that you can share of you approaching the problem this way? I imagine it's constantly happening. You also mentioned you're born this way. So I think it's hard for someone to just sit down, learn, think the way Tobi thinks, but I'd love to help people start to approach problems this way, so maybe an example might help.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:32:54):\nI think this is entirely learnable, I think. And so I encourage people to just have a practice of think step by step essentially and just do it. It'll become a habit pretty quickly because it just, it also just outperforms.\n\n(00:33:09):\nExamples. The very first example is Shopify itself. It's cool. So there was lots of e-commerce software and it was all the way it was because of path dependence because everyone who want it in 2004, 2005, e-commerce was an existing retailer and therefore they had complex businesses that needed to be ported online, including all of their somewhat Byzantine business logic. \"I wanted to make e-commerce software that would do very well on the internet of the future and I believe that we can make it easier to start new businesses online than it is in a physical world because the physical world is encumbered by a lot of regulations and also upfront costs for leases and so on. So let's optimize for that case and build something that is so intuitive to use that frustrated people in dead-end careers can spend their lunch breaks making progress towards building their own business, which then eventually allows them to do it on their own way.\"\n\n(00:34:25):\nAnd so being fortune was biased, eventually it turns out to be a much better prep for also solving all the enterprise cases because no one had to... Enterprise software is overfit to the sales process, which is that it wins the RFPs because it has every feature ever or at least a way of putting a checkbox next to every RFP line ever. But they're not good, right? An RFP is a great example of overfitting in the world of procurement because it tells you nothing about the quality of software behind it. But honestly, this happens all the time. It is just like here, we are setting the stage for much more, much higher quality retrieval for the products on Shopify and across Shopify. I think we've been in a local maxima on search and we think that, especially with the advances of the new models, certain things are now possible to do that could not have been done yet because again of these layers and layers of path dependence and no one coming and saying, \"Is that the best way to do and maybe we should rebuild this component periodically?\" We can now do a better job if search that will leads to much more delightful experiences. And so this is a fun project that this happening right now in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:50):\nI think this is really interesting because what I'm looking for is like the Tobi algorithm of first principles thinking. Elon's got these famous ways of thinking he shared. One is start with the cost of metal to help you understand how much a rocket should cost. And then he's got this five-step. First, decide, do we need this thing? Then figure out how to optimize it, then automate it. What I'm hearing so far, and I'm curious if you've thought about this? And if not, this feels like a really good blog post in your futures, the Tobi first principles algorithm, but I'll share a couple of things I've heard so far as you've described it.\n\n(00:36:24):\nOne is analyze the path that existing solution has relied on, almost like the assumptions that were true for it to be built back and it was built. And the other is this overfit, what is it overfit for? What is it over solving that maybe isn't necessary? Is there anything along those lines of just how you approach problems?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:36:43):\nThis is probably too nerdy technical. You are right, but I should figure myself out a little bit. My brain runs on a meter language but isn't directly something I can translate into words, I suppose. I think more about things like this in terms of programming constructs, pure functions, overstate. And I think in any moment, the best decision to do is I think the perfect product lead is almost like a thermostat for high quality product. It's like you're setting, saying, \"I would like to build something really, really great and I'm going to go through a series which is much, much more complex than what a thermostat does,\" which basically checks the temperature and then makes a decision of air con or heating. You make you re-derive literally every decision that is valuable, every foundational assumption, every foundational ABC direction. And you want to see the observation you've made in the meantime since you last derived the next step. Re-running the entire function over the state that is now updated, the higher fidelity information, would you come to the very same thing?\n\n(00:38:08):\nSometimes fairly early in the construct in the tree of foundational assumptions, change is made. An example we all had was beginning of COVID when we suddenly had shelter in place. So Shopify has that incredibly good office spaces and we were very in-person company and we've... Our floor plans because I think we really added something to the understanding of how to put great... I got a lot of founder energy from my co-founder, Daniel, to build great collaborative spaces for creative work with lots of happy accidents, people running into each other and so on.\n\n(00:38:46):\nAnyway, we were very, very, very, very determined on doing that. But somewhere in this construct of nesting functions, you have to rerun and foundational assumptions. It's in the stack is the fairly basic Boolean of are people allowed to leave a house? Which was yes. The moment that flips, it's not that just like, \"Okay, over here let's do the best what we can do.\" It's actually that the entire tree now moves into a different place. And it can be a very far place, different, that you land because you will make the same quality of decision on every step, but you need to rerun something that takes you to a completely different landing zone. And so then this is also easy for us to say, \"Cool, we are going to be remote only forever? Let's go.\" And because we realized that the temporal shelter in place would cause a series of events that would make that for optimal best set of trade-offs for the company. And so I think this is... Can I put this into a piffy five-step? I wouldn't know, but maybe it resonates with someone who can help me figure out the coded English language for this because it has been nerdy way the I explained it, even to me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):\nThis remote work example is something I definitely wanted to touch on, which is I'm glad you got there. So in this decision, is there anything more you could share about how you got to that place of like, \"Oh this Boolean changed so we should rethink this?\" Because I know you probably, you weren't... I don't know. Were you in the shower and just like, \"Oh wow, we should really go remote because of this\"? How did that actually come about? And then I wanted to ask on another part-\n\nTobi Lütke (00:40:27):\nYeah, pretty much actually yes because again, I rerun over all the inputs and figure out what happens. And here's a couple of other things that were starting to fray on the decision to be in person as well. We started in Ottawa, Canada, which is a city of a million people, and it has some tech heritage and good universities. But at a million people, it's just not population dense enough and has a depth of talent pool that it can support a company that is going to 10,000 people. So anyone who runs this optimization function I'm talking about here about location strategy for a new startup will come to the conclusion if they do it right that everyone should be sitting around the same table. Only if you can't do that, do you say, \"Okay, let's be all in the same couple of rooms.\" Only if that doesn't work anymore, you say, \"Okay, let's be spread over one floor.\" If that doesn't work, in the same building. If that doesn't work, in the same city. If that doesn't work, at least stay in the same time zones or make sure that there's good hub connections between.\n\n(00:41:39):\nThis is how it works. It's just like some assumption somewhere along the line is invalidated. You end up in a different side of a decision tree. But what was happening to us was we already were in four or five cities. We were adhering to the same time zone at this point. But my experience was I went through, sometimes at the Ottawa office, through an entire day where I had 10 hours of meetings, which is fairly normal, but I do every single... I don't think I had a single other person sometimes with me because every one of them was with people in another office. Some people are dialing in remote and so on. So there was an awkward hybrid-ness which we ended up in making only good decisions along the way.\n\n(00:42:29):\nThis is actually the most dangerous thing. Most of the time you end up in a bad part of a tree, in a local maxima of a path-dependent environment, by only making good choices. People think that making a good choice inoculates you from making mistakes or that the presence of a downside of an idea ends up disqualifying the idea. Both of those things are incorrect. So what you need to do then is... So that was an overlay to decision.\n\n(00:42:59):\nThe moment COVID started, then we also had this thing of shoppers exploding because we were actually an asset to people during COVID, e-commerce for the local businesses. And we took that very, very seriously trying to make more businesses survive COVID, small businesses survive this particular calamity than otherwise won't which is important because small businesses tend to be wiped out first anytime the times turn fragile. And so we needed to staff up. And so there's a very weird question about where to staff up. So clearly the better input there would be if you could hire people everywhere. And so once that decision flipped, you can see how this is actually now super easy to say, \"We are going to remote,\" because there is no turning back. There is no... Even with this decision, it's a better set of trade-offs for the future is to accept the vast additional difficulty of building a remote company. It's way harder.\n\n(00:44:03):\nIt's not something you should recommend to anyone to do this because it's the same as trying to run a world record marathon run in Aspen, Colorado. It's like there's not enough oxygen up there to do that. But if you end up pulling it off, you're a real Chad. That's very cool. So I find difficulty itself interesting. And again, I spent enough of my teenage years on the internet to know that there's amazing cultures that can be put together purely remote like, I don't know, Wikipedia, World of Warcraft, Raiding Guilds can at least have excellent cultures. And so we are like, \"Okay, cool. Let's come to a new stable part.\" That stable part was don't port the office online. Let's port the internet into a company and then we are like, \"Let's go.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:00):\nThis episode is brought to you by Loom.

I want to talk about this talent stack concept that you've touched on a couple of times that I think so much. But before we get there, I want to go in a different direction, which I think is an interesting foundational element to your ability to be successful in your first principles thinking, which is you getting to the metal, to the core of the problems you're solving by actually spending a lot of time coding. And I actually heard a story about how you all had this huge all-hands summit. You flew everyone in. You're all together. There was a three-day hackathon. And the way it was described is you're sitting at a table with headphones in, coding, just like any IC engineer. No one would've known you're the CEO of this company, the founder of this company. Why is coding and working in the code to you still so important?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:46:46):\nIt's so funny that that's the way the story goes. It's right, but I don't know why that is surprising. That's my happy place, being able to clear out free days of my calendar and being there till midnight with all these remarkable people who join us on journey, just building stuff. It's like, I do my job so that that is the jobs that exist for other people. That's a job I actually want. That's the one I couldn't find because no one did a company for me. But at least back in most days, I think still not really.\n\n(00:47:26):\nAnd so I just love coding. It's one of the greatest, I don't know, hobbies and pursuits. I've done it for a very long time. I came across it very, very early. It fits my brain like a glove. I appreciate so much of the craft behind coding. I am a trained apprentice in... Sorry, I've apprenticed as a programmer in Germany, which has a dual education system that you can do such things. So I've been professionally in companies spending all day. And I really mean it, programming ever since I just turned 16. I think first day was just before I turned 16 when I started my apprenticeship.\n\n(00:48:18):\nAnd so I love it. I have a view on my screen left of you is a cursor right now, which is opened to a Juniper notebook where I'm working on some projection stuff that I'm playing with. I try to sanity-check as much as I can of what I get. I try to find... It's a game for me to find new insights in data. And I just think, I don't know, it was cool. Maybe this is the picture you talk about. There is a picture that someone captured, which is really fun where I'm on my laptop with a bunch of engineers and then Harley, so president, is on stage DJing. This was taken at 1:00 AM or something like this. It's a picture which actually really precious to two of us because it perfectly summarizes our relationship in a way which these happy accidents are wonderful and these long journeys, I've been doing Shopify for 20 years now, so I appreciate these artifacts. But yeah, so...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:32):\nTo be clear, the reason this is unusual is, and why someone told me this story, is most CEOs do not do this, don't just sit there and code along with the team. And the reason I thought this story was important is and the reason I think your first principle approach works is you're actually in the engineering details, similar to Elon if you think about it, of just in the weeds doing the thing, understanding how the thing works, not just coming up with ideas out of pontifications. And so I guess is there anything there of just how important it is, if you want to approach thinking from first principles, it is to be really close to the metal, to the bare metal?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:50:11):\nWell, yeah. First principles thinking starts from, I think Elon puts it as physics, which I think is a little bit atoms-coded. I think just from the atomic building blocks really is a right starting point. Atomic building blocks are the computers we are using. Computers are our instruments. We use them to create the music that when people appreciate to receive in the form of software. So you've got to understand how they work, at least to work the way I do.\n\n(00:50:48):\nNow, is the way I work optimal? Of course not. This is my point about the aesthetics of how to behave, how to work. I probably don't conform to the traditional view of what the most of public companies should be like or even should spend their time, but I think I'm successful because I don't try to conform to anything other than what I've learned works. And so what I learned works is be in as many details as you can. Really, really, really just understand the stuff that we are making decisions about and be willing to don't put too much stake into the sunk cost fallacy. Try to inoculate business or your parts of a company from a sunk cost fallacy as much as possible because that allows you to just see better solutions and so on.\n\n(00:51:45):\nAnd I think what we were doing, if I remember right, is at hack dates is we were working through pros or cons of just merging all of Shopify into one huge monorepo and we are sketching out directory structures and tooling that we would need, and...\n\nTobi Lütke (00:52:00):\n... tooling that we would need and... Again, monorepo, now for companies, it's a very much one of those door A, door B kind of things. It's a very consequential choice that is incorrect to go say yes to at a certain size, and then it becomes very correct in my mind to say yes to, but at that point it's an enormous amount of effort. So, it's a kind of thing that actually is something I'm uniquely positioned to be involved with because it's actually a business strategy thing as well. That's an investment, a very real investment to say, \"Hey, let's change the way we are building system. Let's figure out what the best way is.\"\n\n(00:52:47):\nThere's going to be change management. There's going to be some people that have very strong opinions on yes or no. And frankly, \"Tobi said so.\", helps. It also compresses a lot of time, because everyone knows the way I book. Everyone can come to me with better ideas about anything, and if you're right, I will change my mind. But I will hold my opinions very strongly until the point of being convinced that they're not the correct ideas. Maybe that's another aspect of this Tobi Tornado thing you talked about earlier, people do fight.\n\n(00:53:27):\nAgain, the aesthetics of our times put a lot of stake into consistency. I remember various politicians losing campaigns because they were called flip-floppers at times, which I... Although, I'm more of a Maynard Keynes school of... \"When the facts change, I change my opinion. What do you do, sir?\" It sounds like a better OS to go by.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:52):\nIt's awesome, because I'm extracting more of your algorithm of how you think about stuff. A few things you just shared are, ( 1.), you need to be in the details. This is thinking about to be successful as a first principles thinker is (B.), you need to be in the details in your case code. In Elon's case, it's like, build the thing and be at the factory, sleeping on the floor. As you said, he's very Adams based. You're more digitally native. And then also, don't be so reliant on some costs. Like you said in this Tobi Tornado case, \"I know you've been working on this project, we're going to kill it, because it's not going to work better if we do that now versus this. Just keep going, because we've been going.\" And then, coming back to the stuff you've shared previously is, analyze the path that you've been on, that the previous products and solutions have assumed the path dependence of them, and then don't look at what they've overfit potentially, that isn't correct. Love it. Okay. This actually is a good segue to something else that someone that you work with suggested I ask you, Farhan, your head of engineering. I asked him, \"What's the best way to get a glimpse into Tobi's mind?\" And it's actually along the lines of what you just described, which is, the question is just, what's the best way to disagree with you?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:55:02):\nI think just disagree with me. I immediately love it, honestly. I really crave it. It's very funny. I know how this really surprises people. And I actually appreciate it even more because it requires courage, and frankly, I actually do find that... But it also makes me immediately trust the person more, partly because I, first of all, think they will do what they think is right rather than what is convenient. Agreeing with a group tends to be much more convenient. But more than that actually, that they're courageous enough to do it right then. I think courage is really, really rare. I found a lot more high IQ in industry than courage. I found a lot more maybe even genius than courage. I like that. I wish it wouldn't require that. This is why I try to be very inviting of it.\n\n(00:56:08):\nWhen someone disagrees with me, I tend to immediately stop and say, \"Cool, let's figure out why there's disagreement.\" And it's almost never, I find, in the, \"I just feel like we should do this differently.\" What I'm looking for is offer unstated foundational assumptions. What is our divergence point? Because you might be right. In fact, people often are, when it gets to this point, I found. Sometimes it's an unstated foundational assumption that I hold that is incorrect. People tell me and then I'm so glad we talked about it, because I will stop forever nagging on this thing because now I know we can't do it because of Sarbanes-Oxley or something like this. It's just like, \"Well, cool.\" My mental model of Sarbanes-Oxley, which is regulation for public companies, is not perfect. I have not in-depth studied all the details for it, so I will not consult this in my mind when I am saying, hey, we should solve the task at hand in a certain way. So, this is very good.\n\n(00:57:24):\nHow to disagree? I really like debate. I will play devil's advocate actively if everyone agrees on something. Again, especially if a proposal is something that feels like I could have predicted would be a proposal before it got into the meeting and there was nothing surprising in it, I will make myself an end boss of a level and just say, \"I'm going to say this is just not that good. I think we could do way better.\" I want people to then argue more in-depth for the veracity of the decisions, and that leads to a form of disagreement. I think all these things end up building trust.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:08):\nI like that that touches also on this idea of, again, maximizing potential, the potential of the teams, the potential of the employees\n\nTobi Lütke (00:58:14):\nBecause of course, the really important decisions, we don't talk about. This is the most important thing. Shopify probably makes... What?... millions of decisions every day, like, write this code this way, yes, I'm going to add this unit test, maybe I'm skipping a unit test. Might be the difference between a future production audit. Millions and millions of these tiny decisions. So, you're not hiring engineers primarily or accountants, you're hiring people who make excellent decisions, given their specialization and areas they're overseeing. And given that, decision making as a concept is actually really understudied, I find.\n\n(00:58:59):\nI think these are instances where we can just learn to make decision making together. Because I think while a lot of decisions are made independently, we are a product company, we are on a mission, and we want our product to feel like something that a single person made, in the same way how any author tries to write a book that clearly reads that it came from one mind. Because people can see and spot this, if this doesn't happen. You end up with something that looks like a television remote, where there's a Netflix button over here... It's like you can reverse [inaudible 00:59:41] from the remote control. That's important.\n\n(00:59:48):\nUsing these moments and also bringing decision making inwards to go and say, hey, let's have very efficient opportunities for as many people that can possibly get together, make decisions together, not as a democracy but with clear who needs to convince who. That because otherwise this ends up just taking way too long. Give a opportunity for everyone to change my mind over Glenn's mind, and so on, is an excellent practice, I find. I think this is a more optimal way of going about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):\nSpeaking of disagreeing, it reminded me of a story I heard, about the Tobi Tornado actually, the way you operate that. I love it. It ends up being this interesting microcosm of your first principle's way of thinking. The story is, I think you've said at one point that the best way to get people to give you insights is to say something they disagree with on the internet.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:00:42):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:44):\nThat's often the way you approach this is, you post in a Slack group, \"Hey, I don't think this product is going to work, and here's why.\" And that ends up creating the most information for you. Is there anything along those lines that might be helpful to share?\n\nTobi Lütke (01:00:56):\nI don't think that's one of my better ways of doing that. I have to be somewhat careful. The people I worked with a lot, I will do this, just because it's funny. But even I can see that that would seriously stress out the interns.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):\nYou guys have a lot of interns. I think you have 1,000 interns this coming year, is what Farhan shared.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:01:20):\nYeah, we just started. I was in the office yesterday and it's absolutely full of interns. It's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):\nOh, man. Love interns, so much energy. This idea that you shared about building one product, building towards one vision, this actually reminds me of something that came up basically every time I had someone from Shopify on, which is this idea of a 100-year vision that you keep. I don't know of any other company that operates in this way, where the founder has this 100-year vision of where the product needs to go and working backwards from that.\n\n(01:01:48):\nCan you just speak to that, of that way of operating, why you find that helpful, how that actually works?\n\nTobi Lütke (01:01:54):\nI talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot. What would we want to have done 20 years ago on this, or 10 or 5 years ago? What's the decision our future selves would want us to make, is useful. I find future casting to be generally extremely valuable. I definitely did not build Shopify to flip. I had lots of opportunities to sell Shopify to various people. I didn't consider it, because it's just too interesting of a journey and I think that's too... If a endpoint [inaudible 01:02:34] all companies is a convergence on a set of four or five people who can afford them, that just creates too much of a monoculture, I think, in thinking.\n\n(01:02:43):\nI like that Shopify is different. I think this is good. I think it's a terrible place to work for many, many, many people. It's the best place in the world to work for some people. That's so good. That's what we want, I think. We want more of this. We want people to be able to window-shop for a place where they can be enormously successful, because the place's set of beliefs just fits you like a glove.\n\n(01:03:14):\n100 years. We have very long-term plans. 100 years, you can't talk about this software product, but you can talk about the mission itself, whatever things that will survive for 80 years that are left on this particular timeframe. Entrepreneurship is just precious. Shopify exists, basically you make entrepreneurship more common. That is the thing we wanted to cause in the world. We have had, I think, success doing this already, but again, there's no speed limit and no stopping point for this. As I keep saying, the word's unbelievably path dependent. And therefore, if we are part of a path, we can cause it to be more in adherence to the things that we value and would like to see. This is the wonderful thing about company building. They can have lasting impact.\n\n(01:04:16):\nWe are making decisions based on all the things that we can do. What are the things that will be most long-term valuable for the long-term pursuits we are on, and how can we normalize entrepreneurship? It's a thing that's really important to me, just because people don't spend enough time on it. It's all economics. Our [inaudible 01:04:44] living entirely depends on businesses. We are all part and tag of an environment that is extremely entrepreneurial and actually celebrates entrepreneurship as a courageous act and a glorious act even.\n\n(01:05:02):\nBut that's not true in most of the world. In fact, most people never encounter anyone who engages in doing that. It's not something people see as one of their options. I want us to make these choices. And I think the long-term focus matters. It's also really powerful for decision making. And I know this is potentially intuitive to most, but also rarely practiced. You've had a lot of people from Stripe on here. Stripe and Shopify have had a very long-term partnership. Stripe and Shopify had potentially the most valuable partnership, or at least one of the top ones in history, of technology, because we were both very small companies and we decided, hey, let's work on an assumption that both of us are going to win our markets, and work together. So, Stripe's [inaudible 01:06:02] for payments and we're allowed a part of Stripe and so on.\n\n(01:06:07):\nWhen you're in a partnership like this, you play basically iterated prisoner's dilemma. Every instance, every turn you can make a choice: coordinate or defect, defecting if the other person collaborates, collaborator effect. If both collaborate, everyone gets a point. If one defects and the other one collaborates, you get a lot of points, all at one moment. Being a good partner in business is like this corporate marshmallow test that companies tend to fail in a very funny way.\n\n(01:06:44):\nIf you see the videos of kids doing actual actual marshmallow tests, the smart ones actually turn the chair around, look away from the marshmallow, and sit on their hands, and just go vibrating. Because they know it's the right thing to wait for getting two marshmallows in the future, but man, if they just look at a marshmallow, they'll just eat it. Most CEOs, most companies can't even successfully do that and just engage in pulling future profits forward at a discount or even defecting on partnerships that would be much more long-term valuable.\n\n(01:07:16):\nIf you're talking about long timeframes, like 100 years, there is no question. But clearly, the correct way to play iterated prisoner's dilemma is coordinate for both sides. It's way more valuable [inaudible 01:07:27] doing that over long periods of time than any momentary defection could possibly be convenient at a moment. It's a huge amount of product decisions. When we are deciding roadmap, end up being very influenced by this, because I get pitches for things we should do and why don't we do this kind of change to the system, there's so much money in it, and all these kind of things. I'm like, cool, but almost always come in a form of putting future profits forward at a discount.\n\n(01:08:08):\nBut we have a long time horizon. Let's not take the discount, let's... Also, you often compromise the entire business after a while because you end up just... Your customers notice if you're going into value extraction. The best companies, I believe, at least from a perspective of a leader, resemble some kind of cockpit, or maybe a room full of dials or levers for monetization. My job is adding as many of these levers as possible to the room, and then not pulling any of them. Because I think we do best if we are on the same side of a table of our customers and we had them become entrepreneurs, which is a mission, and we want to support them to be more successful, which is the business model we are in. We get a very, very small stake of the sales in our monetization system. And therefore, we are incentivized to make everyone as successful as possible.\n\n(01:09:11):\nAgain, when I get a PowerPoint from investment bankers or so, where they tell me I have enormous pricing power and I could massively change the prices, I'm like, \"Yeah, but I'd leave Shopify if that happens to me, so how is that good?\" He's just like, \"Why?\" It just goes like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:30):\nThere's a quote that you wrote somewhere that, to me, identifies this point so succinctly, \"On a long enough timeline, playing positive-sum games with your customers is the ultimate growth hack.\" Yeah, beautiful.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:09:46):\nI think that's pretty piffy and it's also just... Try to argue with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:53):\nThat's true.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:09:54):\nPositive-sum games have incredible returns, especially in the worlds of software, where you can experience exponentials very easily. I see company building as... I wish there would be better analogy than chess, because chess is a game of perfect information, which is totally incorrect. But one thing which I like about chess as an analogy for business is that it basically is two games, that you have to be good at at both. There's a positional game that you learn: Develop your pieces, gain influence by your pieces over the board. That's really, really important. And then there's tactics, which you learn tactic training. You go get a puzzle trainer and you drill tactics and you learn the intuition to sports tactics, sense them. Both of them are actually super independent of each other.\n\n(01:10:53):\nThe business world only talks about tactics. It only talks about the conversion of we did this thing. We did an A/B test and we changed the color of blue, and conversion red went up. We lionize the easy hack. I don't think that's important, honestly. You need to be good enough at tactics to not go out of business. You can't get margin code, sure. But the sum total of all the value of a potential tactics that you could employ stays with you if you are actually are doing the positional game.\n\n(01:11:36):\nThe positional game is like, what is the territory on the map that you are taking? What role do you play? How much trust do you have of merchants? Do merchants want more from you or less? Are you the kind of thing they're trying to optimize out of their software spend, or the one that they ask to subsume all other software spend? Do they rely on you? Are you part of a team, or are you used as a tool in the toolbox, usually forgotten, sometimes coming out when certain task is being done? What does your product cover? What industries are you addressing? And so on, so on, so on. This is the positional game. How well do pieces fit together? Do people like relying even deeper on you?\n\n(01:12:25):\nIf you do that well, the tactics are yours and you can hire a lot of people who are extraordinarily good at spotting tactics and using them. But if you do it too much, you end up extracting through tactics the entirety of the value that you have created and that is yours to take through a positional game. And if you do that, you have nothing left in the tank. That's for companies that we all see, that just got to a point and then just fade. Those are the companies that got tacticked out of their position.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:01):\nThe skill, obviously, is finding the balance between these two things of short-term, not get margin calls, as you described, but also think ahead.\n\n(01:13:09):\nIs there any kind of heuristic for founders listening to this who are like, \"How do I do this? How much should I be thinking about the future versus now?\", I guess? How do you try to create this pie chart of driving goals immediately and show investors we're killing it, while also thinking ahead?\n\nTobi Lütke (01:13:22):\nIs there a good heuristic? Objective number one is: Don't die. Again, in the end, for companies that become historic companies are the ones which did not die. It also sounds very basic, but actually it's more actionable than it might seem. Past that point, I would argue: Just focus on the positional game. I think this is where a bit of a discrepancy of the founder and the rest of the company sometimes lies. I think the founders create finite, winnable games for people, that are very much serving the infinite game of developing, that the mission implies, the quality of position on the board.\n\n(01:14:14):\nBy the way, it's an infinite board. Just picture the chess board as the initial terrain, but there's, I don't know, fog on the board and it's a terrain that's much larger that you will explore over time. I think that's the most prettiest way of mentally thinking about the experience of building a company. It's an exploration and a collaborative inquiry into a question that is implied by the mission. And you will get to explore how correct your mission is and how good your decision making is along the way. And you get to learn a lot, and this is why I think it's a valuable thing to do.\n\n(01:14:55):\nBut they often, the founders, and the mission of a company are in alignment, but they are, again, non-quantifiable things. They are pursuits. Maybe as time horizons that go past, all of our time horizons of our careers, therefore that makes it hard for people to care deeply yet. But they do care about the instances, the games along the way, the [inaudible 01:15:24] that have to be done to explore a part of a map, the tactics that have to be executed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:29):\nI'm not going to take us here, but I know you're a big fan of this book, Finite and Infinite Games. I actually had it once at a book club and it blew my mind open. I'm going to link to it. People should check it out. You've talked about this on another podcast. I'm not going to [inaudible 01:15:40].\n\nTobi Lütke (01:15:40):\nYeah, it's a lovely book. James Carse did an incredible, underappreciated... I think they essentially wrote one of the best business books. They is trying to write a hard philosophy book. I don't know if it works for its intended purpose, but I think there's more value in what he actually accomplished. Maybe, sadly, it may be that he didn't know before he died, which would be very sad.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:08):\nIt's a little hard to read for people...\n\nTobi Lütke (01:16:08):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):\n... so just stick with it and just try to wrap your head around what he's trying to say, is my advice.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:16:14):\nI think reading... I don't know how many it is, but... the first couple of chapters really helps you get your arms around the story, his insight. The rest of the book are examples of his ideas applied. My takeaway from reading his examples is that he did not fully appreciate the insight of his own idea. It just ends up being very locally limited and very narrow-focused. It's a much grander idea than I think he really... This is why I say I don't think he fully appreciated quality of his own idea, which...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:58):\nI think we need a Tobi version of this book, with a foreword, and...\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:02):\nI heard Simon Sinek...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:04):\nUh-huh.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:04):\n... wrote a book of a similar title. I've actually never gotten around to read it, but I think he would be very good at interpreting this if that's what he did.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):\nThat's what it sounds like. I feel like his book is that book, written in a different way.\n\n(01:17:15):\nI want to come back to something you talked about, which is focusing on entrepreneurship and the merchants that you all work with. To me, this is another example of maximizing human potential. The way I think about this, people always talk about Y Combinator and Stanford and all these places that create all these companies and founders. If you think about it, Shopify does this orders of magnitude beyond, and I don't think you guys get enough credit for that, the amount of businesses you create, the amount of lives you change.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:43):\nThat's because we don't want the credit. That's the point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:46):\nIs there a platform?\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:47):\nWe don't want the credit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:47):\nNo.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:48):\nI mean, maybe if you wanted it, you could also not get it, but we don't need to explore that because we actually, literally don't want the credit. Shopify is a company that pushes from behind. We don't want to be written into the story. We want to just...\n\nTobi Lütke (01:18:00):\n... want to be written into the story, we want to just kind of have you do your thing. There's just too much grandeur in wanting to front it all. This is also what caused us to go and help people build their own things rather than start with a marketplace that everyone gets to lease a little component of at prices that corresponds to magically exactly your margin, as this usually goes in marketplaces. And so yeah, I think we don't want it. I'm proud of it, but that's intrinsic. I don't need very extrinsic appreciation for it, I suppose. There's millions, millions and millions of people that use Shopify daily and that represents the business and it causes major amount of employment around the world actually, definitely in North America specifically and Europe. And so I think that's really gratifying. I'm sure there's a way of saying that many of us businesses might actually have existed without Shopify.\n\n(01:19:18):\nI also think you can make a case that a good number exists because of Shopify, because what we've observed is that this was actually, it's my favorite thing in the entire Shopify journey that we sort of rigorously determined, which is that because I really, really, really prioritize good UX, legible interfaces. You can tame enormous complexity with great UX in a way that makes sense to people. I think this is actually almost a moral obligation to do for software because when software goes bad, it makes people feel dumb and machines do not get to negatively influence people in my mind. That is the inversion of the priority of the hierarchy of how machines are tools wielded by people to be more powerful at the things that they're already great at than they might imagine. That's when this all needs to fit together, but beyond the moral point, which is 10 years, and you could definitely take the other side of what we have determined is that every single time we make a complex thing simpler. It is actually that more businesses will exist on a platform.\n\n(01:20:38):\nSo I think this is intuitive or at least directional, but sometimes people are not like, \"Well, don't you just need to have all these features?\" This is the RFP view of a world of software, right? \"Don't you need to just have all the features then people can implement their plan?\" Well, no. Think about the mental state and entrepreneurship entrepreneurs, they are, I mean especially if you're first entrepreneurs, they're unsophisticated. They don't know what to do. They're kind of scared. By the way, engaging in building something again is an act of pure courage and usually one which is very hard to hide from others. The people around you will know that you're doing this thing. Ask any entrepreneur. The amount of people who tell you to not do this is actually stunning. People do not want people to just step out of a box that exists that they sort of explain to themselves around them and have a chance of reaching higher because that would sort of invalidate their own life story in some meaningful way.\n\n(01:21:38):\nSo there's actually a whole lot of nay saying that discourages people already, which is not super helpful. So now you have a situation where people are telling you to quit potentially, you don't have a lot of money presumably, you're asking yourself, are you even doing the right thing? Hopefully there's some elements of encouragement. Hopefully there's a passion. Hopefully you're trying to create a thing. Then comes to a situation that stuns you in some way, somewhere where suddenly the software starts talking about APIs where this is something you've never encountered in your life before or that just the option that you think it should have on the text configuration screen doesn't make sense given what we know about local taxes and so on. Here's the thing that happens. So the beautiful thing with Shopify is there's basically no tax configuration screen. It's just correct. The amazing thing about software is we can actually just overtake this piece of complexity.\n\n(01:22:53):\nWe know what the taxes are everywhere and we are just doing it for you. You don't have to think about taxes. In this case we have someone encountered something that stunned them, that stopped them in their tracks. On the wrong day, what that means, it's like they are going to close a browser and they say, \"You know what? Fuck it. I'm not cut out for this.\" Or, \"This piece of software I use sucks and it's too dumb for understanding the thing I have in my head,\" or something else. Everyone has a different rendering of the same thing, but just like progress stops. It is not just the businesses that shouldn't exist anyway that stop in this way. In fact, it's actually, and this is again what the data says, so many businesses get very close to this point many, many times. I can tell you Shopify did many times and I have more tools on entrepreneurial journey than most. I'm a computer programmer and I love those things. You tell me I can spend 14 hours programming for the next couple of years. I'm like, \"Holy shit, let's go.\"\n\n(01:24:01):\nMost people aren't like that. So I've had unfair advantages that allowed me to overcome very technical climbs on this learning curve, but I know that's like most people can't have these advantages and therefore will churn out of a test. And so in other words, lowering complexity, making good UX, creating software that just autopilots taxes or payments or any of these kinds of things, fraud, actually causes more entrepreneurship. That is the best thing, the best answer to the most important question of my life that I've encountered because up to this point it was an intuition that doing the Shopify thing would be valuable in absolute sense, in a hundred-year sense. Afterwards I knew, right? And so that also just means now seeing things that are overly complex or shouldn't even be there, it's just physically painful because I know, it's like all these business that are trying to get somewhere and could exist and could now employ people and delight customers just died along the way because of something we did wrong or poorly and so on. And so this is a great source of energy for me to keep going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:26):\nI feel that, I feel that pain of the idea of anytime a button's broken or it's not as... the button's wrong color and more people would be converting means that you're not creating as many businesses, many entrepreneurs. The feeling you described of being scared to launch something, I exactly felt that when I started the newsletter. And my solution to that as I launched it is, \"I'm just launching this as an experiment. We'll see where it goes, just don't worry about it. I might blog once in a while.\" And that really helped just lowering the stakes and I could see how just things like that and advice that can help someone get over that hump.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:26:01):\nYes, and I think this is an under explored thing in the word of UX. Random example, I was absolutely delighted by, maybe TikTok has the same thing, I don't know, but I was posting a video to Instagram and it allowed me to run a try run of the reel. It just seems like a new feature and just saying it shows it to a couple hundred people out of network and if they like it then it's going to post to my profile. I'm like, \"I don't need that.\" But I thought that was one of the more... I honestly just closed Instagram and was like, \"Holy shit, this is probably one of the most profound insightful pieces of software I've encountered. And as a connoisseur of good ideas, I've never had this as a valuable thing.\" It feels like a step function upgrade to the traditional A-B test as a concept because it's so understandable and I'm like, \"What else in the world should have try runs that run out of network?\" Basically everything, isn't it?\n\n(01:27:03):\nThis is an amazing thing. Like I said, the rarest thing in the world, it's not even creativity or genius, it's courage. So let's lower the net amount of courage needed. Honestly, that's one of those things you can probably run an entire career or reinvent an industry on. These things unfurl into incredible amounts of value if you really pursue them and come at them from first principles rather than how can I do the things I want to do anyway slightly better because of insight. That's good and people should always do it, but not usually where most of the value ends up becoming, like manifests when a new idea comes around. So I talk radically about an Instagram feature. That's a weird thing to do, but I was actually just really to delighted because again, it just came up a few days ago.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:54):\nI love this thread of courage. The example you gave reminds me also of I feel like going on a dating app at a different city for the first time is another example of this where it's a dry run, nobody knows you.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:28:06):\nBut even then, shouldn't there be like, \"Hey, post my profile to a different city for telling me if it's any good.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:14):\nSO people like it.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:28:14):\nI mean I've never dated basically so I mean at least not in the last 25 years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:19):\nYeah, of the podcast.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:28:20):\nSo I'm pre swipe left and right dating, so my conception is very low of this. Maybe I should look more at dating apps. I'm pretty sure there's some amazing UX in most things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:34):\nI imagine. I feel like dating is going offline more and more. I'm feeling like that's what people are trying to do. They're tired of the swipe, but anyway, going to go in that direction. Maybe a couple more questions while I have you here. One is this idea of the talent stack. You've mentioned this concept before and this is the term that I've seen you describe it as of this idea of the power of focusing on your unique talents and curiosity and that leading you to the biggest opportunities, especially early in your career. Can you just talk about what your insight there.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:29:04):\nYeah, again, I only lived one life, so I can't Monte Carlo all the decisions I make and just figure out which ones ended up being load baring, right? I'm at this point pretty amused by the following thing which keeps happening. But I am getting curious about some absolutely random thing and it really is fairly far-flung stuff and like magic it becomes the way that ends up allowing me to make a very important choice a year later. It's ends up being a better analogy that I've learned or a different way to see something or another idea that I found being represented in this area of expertise that is actually just again, another repackaging of another foundational idea, which allows me to go and look for more examples.\n\n(01:29:57):\nAnd it's just funny this way. So even early in career just I followed my curiosity. I love programming and I love computers and I loved the internet when it came along and I just like, \"Cool, I'm going to find a task that I find valuable,\" which I was always engaged in retail and I have a lot to say about how retail should be brought by the internet to people. But this is a beautiful intersection of all the things that I find interesting. And then on top of it, I found Ruby, which I loved as a technology and then just now I was highly motivated to tinker, explore a space that was clearly emerging but just felt very obviously of value in the future.\n\n(01:30:44):\nBut I didn't do it because I was following money. I did it because I like learning by doing stuff and I like tinkering the things and so this was a way of financing my tinkering by selling snowboards and then it led to other things. And I've kind of been doing that thing all along. It's great fun, great fun for me. I don't know how much of a advice that is, but maybe a proof point that can work really well. I sometimes worry though that things like this end up being a little bit like all you need to do is buy a lottery ticket, set for lottery ticket winner, right? So it's, who knows?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:30):\nIt does resonate. It reminds me of something Brian Armstrong once shared, which is the reason that he-\n\nTobi Lütke (01:31:37):\nHe's also, by the way, you have to add him to the set of first principle thinkers if you're starting to cultivate one. And I think there's plenty of startup success, successful founders, CEOs, especially for public companies are surprisingly alike in this projecting slightly different, maybe coming from different backgrounds, but Brian is extraordinarily strong at this [inaudible 01:32:06] by the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:06):\nOkay, here's to the next nominated for the podcast, Brian. We'll get on it. But interestingly, he had basically exact same advice for what allowed him to create Coinbase is his background was economics, coding and cryptography or something along those lines. And it's the Venn diagram, is like, \"This is the thing I'm uniquely strong at and have an opportunity to win it.\"\n\nTobi Lütke (01:32:29):\nYeah. So this is what we very actively tell our customers, right? There's a 2005 essay by Kevin Kelly saying, \"In the future on the internet you just need a thousand true fans.\" It's what the internet and I think what Shopify celebrates, that instead of trying to create toothpaste, which is of course a huge term but hard to differentiate. It's much better to figure out a triplicate intersection of three different things and nail it. We took a winter vacation with my boys and my family in the Caribbean and I like playing poker with them. I like playing poker and it's great limited information game. I think this were valuable for kids and so I found this, I might have mentioned this in some place, but I found this pirate gold I think it's called.\n\n(01:33:32):\nIt's just amazing poker set, poker chips that look like they come right out of the treasure chest or in Pirates of the Caribbean. Think about just the intersection, so this is online Texas Hold'em, quality poker set instead of... because you can play with just anything, right? People were in the market for spending money on something like this and pirate themed. You're like, \" But I'm such a big fan, I'm telling you about it and people might actually purchase it because I'm enthusiastic about it.\" And because enthusiasm is actually the best marketing and they have at least a thousand true fans, and it's just better to make amazing things for some people than make something that everyone wants maybe or would tolerate. And I think that's really, really good. So I think that works for your career too because by the way, we are all entrepreneurs so we're ready to think about any career.\n\n(01:34:36):\nIf you actually ask me for career advice is we are products, we are engaged in entrepreneurship, we are basically software as a service if you want, or talent as a service. We are selling a subscription in the form of our employment we call it, but it's actually just rebranded the subscription frankly because it comes some extra protection, which is very good, but it's still the same thing, it's a double opt-in company. Like you would say, I can do these things and I will be of significantly more value to the company than you will have to spend on me. There's like a positive ROI ideally for a company and a company either says, \"I agree or I don't agree with you.\" And that's actually what employment is. So I think people should think about themselves as a product. Your career is not based on mentors you find or getting a promotion or not.\n\n(01:35:34):\nIt's about what are you too good to ignore in? How good can you be? Can you be absolutely work? Can you be excellent? I mean you don't have to be work class and stuff, but you have to... Ideally you find a thing where you are just in this sort of tiny space of five intersections or so versus we just know more than everyone else and then everyone calls you. Like I said, we use Ruby. Ruby was not that fast. Shopify would rather have it very fast. We found people who got PhDs in dynamic language, garbage collection dynamic language, just in time compilation to make Ruby fast. And they're having delightful time at Shopify and Shopify is now very fast and it's very good. And everyone gets to profit from us needing this because we merged it back into Ruby Core and now everyone can have a JIT compiler. So it's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:40):\nI feel like every story is a fractal into other hours of other podcast conversation we can have. I know you have to go run this nine, 10, 10,000 person company and do real work. So I'm going to end it there. We got through almost everything I was hoping to get through, but there's infinitely more questions I still have. Just to maybe end it, is there anything you want to leave listeners with? Any last nugget that maybe you didn't mention?\n\nTobi Lütke (01:37:03):\nIf I get to talk to again people who look at product and product management, here's my thing that I think maybe only implicitly came through in all this. Every product in the world, the quality at the end of the day is simply a reflection of how much the people who created it gave a shit about the product. And it is not possible to make great products if the people work on it do not give a shit about the product. And I actually think this is a very important role for product leaders to make sure that the team gives a shit. And I think this is something that can be done with building empathy for people using it, but also it can be done infectiously by the product leader. The product leader has to give a shit. Do not engage in product work on product that you don't care about because you cannot produce the thing that the person will give you a task is looking for.\n\n(01:38:04):\nAnd I think again, so much goes into this unquantifiable conversation which we already had, but boy is that important because it just isn't about the brief document, it isn't about the aligning stakeholders. Sometimes in some places some of those things are aspects of it and I think they correlate sometimes with people. But I think the higher order bit is if you are in product, you have basically free roads. You have to have the team sits, look around corners that they don't see. You just have to understand this thing that's being done better than everyone else because that's a role. Now, you don't have to do this by yourself. Everyone on the team is of a resource to you and you can query them and therefore determine what is around the corners and so on. But in engineering and UX and so on, but that's very important. Second is you've got to be exothermically infectious with actually caring about this thing because just that one thing alone will make a 10 times better product. It's crazy how much of a change this makes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:25):\nI feel like honestly what you're describing here is like founder mode, what the outputs are. Giving a shit, being exothermic excited and looking around corners. I feel like this is its own conversation here.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:39:37):\nYeah, I agree. I don't think founder mode, so I mean I think, yeah, founder mode is a super valuable term, but I actually do think that I answered the question about what I think about founder mode in the discussion about pumping heat into systems. That's what I do. It's just that founder mode in a founder run company, I think this has an easier time existing because people dislike the people who are pumping heat into a thing. People fight them, people probably take them out, and if the boss is like this, boss can protect the other people like this. And therefore I think founder run companies can be innovative longer because there's a substrate by which this can stay a thing for a long time. So anyway, that's my tear down on the founder mode discussion, which I think is a really fascinating recent discussion. I find it's very valuable. I'm sure it's misunderstood in all sorts of ways, but I think it's more actionable than people think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:40):\nTobi, I appreciate you continuing to drop nuggets, even though I know you have to go, by the way, your video looks incredible right now. This is amazing editing, we're doing like a rainbow streaming across your body.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:40:53):\nYeah, we really hit the rainbows here like, \"Let's go and invent.\" I hope you've got to gold that you were hoping and-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:00):\nSo much gold.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:41:00):\n... I was sufficient leprechaun here to deliver.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:05):\nWhat a metaphor. Okay, Tobi, thank you so much for doing this. This was incredible. I feel like this is going to help so many people build great companies and thank you from first principles.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:41:13):\nOkay, I got to run. Bye-bye.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:15):\nOkay, bye.\n\n(01:41:18):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "title": "A framework for finding product-market fit | Todd Jackson (First Round Capital)",
  "transcript": "# A framework for finding product-market fit | Todd Jackson (First Round Capital)\n\n## Transcript\n\nTodd Jackson (00:00:00):\nFinding product-market fit is the single most important thing that your startup does in the first three years, and it's just underexplored and it's just underexplained as a topic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):\nYou've been working on a product-market fit framework.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:00:11):\nWe've published dozens of articles on the First Round Review, and we have found a very consistent set of patterns, demand satisfaction, and efficiency. But the interesting thing is that you don't go for all three of them from the very beginning.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):\nThere's essentially four levels of product-market fit: nascent, developing, strong, extreme.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:00:27):\nRoughly, 60% are never going to get past L2.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:29):\nThese four Ps is essentially what you should try to change if you're stuck.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:00:34):\nYou've got the persona, the problem, the promise, and the product. Lattice kept the first one but changed the others. Vanta changed all four.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):\nHearing level three tells me level two is basically your pivot from: I'm just grinding, selling, pitching.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:00:47):\nThis is where it starts to get fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):\nToday my guest is Todd Jackson. Todd is a partner at the legendary VC firm, First Round Capital. I rarely have VCs on this podcast, but as Todd shares at the top of this episode, Todd is a very special VC. Prior to moving into venture, he was product lead for Gmail for four years. He was product manager of Facebook's newsfeed, photos and groups, including leading a major redesign of the newsfeed. He's also a director of product management at Twitter and VP of product and design at Dropbox.\n\n(00:01:21):\nHe's also a founder and sold his company to Twitter. This episode is a very different and special kind of episode. Todd and the team at First Round have spent the last year looking at all of their data and the journeys of the hundreds of startups that they've worked with over the years. And through that, have put together a very practical and very actionable framework to help founders find product-market fit. They're turning this framework into a three-month program for founders, and in this conversation, Todd shares an exclusive peek into the program, in particular, the stages of product-market fit.\n\n(00:01:55):\nWe talk about how to know which stage you're in, what to do if you're stuck in that stage, and also what you can change in order to get unstuck. If you're a founder or building a new product within a company and feeling like you're not making as much progress as you'd hope, you will find tremendous value in this conversation. With that, I bring you Todd Jackson after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.\n\n(00:02:26):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS.

That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. And hundreds of other companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom.\n\n(00:02:56):\nWorkOS also recently launched AuthKit, a complete authentication and user management service. It's essentially a modern alternative to Auth0, but with better pricing and more flexible APIs. AuthKit's design is stunning out of the box, and you can also fully customize it to fit your app's brand.

Todd, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:04:56):\nLenny, I'm excited to be here. Thank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):\nSo first of all, just to mention you're a VC, which is very rare for this podcast. But you're a very special VC, you have a deep background in product, and I thought it might be helpful just to give a little bit of context on your product background, your product bona fides so people will get a real sense of just how legit you are as a product thinker.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:05:17):\nYeah, you got it. So I am a VC. I'm a partner at First Round Capital now, and I've been at First Round for four years. But I was not a VC before First Round. So I started a company in 2013 called Cover, and that was actually funded by First Round 11 years ago. That's how I got to know First Round. And before that, I had worked on Gmail as the product lead in the early days, early 2000s and at Facebook.\n\n(00:05:39):\nAnd then I started Cover, and we ended up selling Cover to Twitter in 2014. And I worked on a bunch of different products at Twitter. And then I was the VP of product and design at Dropbox. That was 2015 to 2018. So I have always loved product, and that's actually the reason now that I love being a seed stage VC because I love investing at the early stage founders who are pre-product-market fit and then helping them get there. And I just love doing that over and over again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:07):\nI feel like we could have a whole other podcast episode on why you decided to move into venture versus staying in product.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:06:12):\nWe can do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:13):\nBut we're going to stay focused. So the reason we're here is that for over a year, you've been working on a product-market fit framework, essentially, a framework to help founders and product teams find product-market fit, which we should talk about this. But this is the most important thing you've got to get right as a founder in a product team is finding product-market fit. I got a peek at this framework. I love it. I love the way you've structured it, the way you're thinking about it.\n\n(00:06:36):\nSo what we're going to do today is walk through this framework in depth. First, I just want to spend a few minutes on setting a little context just so people understand who this is for and how to think about this. So maybe a first question is just why do you believe people need a framework for finding product-market fit? And just also, if you want to touch on why is product-market fit so important? Why is that something people should even be thinking about?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:06:57):\nThe thing about product-market fit is that I find it's mysterious to a lot of people, and people tend to think about it purely as an art rather than a science. And all the advice that you find out there on the internet is very general when it comes to product-market fit. You'll know it when you see it, you'll know it when you have it. It's not specific. And there's so many other startup topics where there is good content on the internet like hiring your first salesperson, running board meetings, stuff that is specific and tactical. But there isn't that much content around product-market fit that is that specific.\n\n(00:07:33):\nAnd so I think that's actually why Rahul from Superhuman is well-known for his approach to finding product-market fit. That was published on the First Round Review in 2018, and it was immediately popular and interesting to people. And I think the reason is because it was specific and because it was tactical and it brought a little bit of the science to something that people thought was just an art. And I think it's why your content is really popular too, Lenny.\n\n(00:07:57):\nYou and I worked on this product validation article together a little while back, and the seven part series that you did on B2B SaaS companies and the PMF benchmarking data that you had, I think it was how long it took to get to a product and a customer and to product-market fit, that was super well-read. And there just isn't that much good specific content about this. But like you said, product-market fit is the single most important thing that your startup does in the first three years and it's just underexplored, it's underexplained as a topic.\n\n(00:08:28):\nSo we felt this was a very important thing to do, something worth focusing on. And I've personally talked to hundreds of founders about this topic. We've published dozens of articles on the First Round Review. We call this our Paths to Product-Market Fit Series where we interview founders about the early days. And I'm just always interested in what are the patterns. If you talk to enough successful founders, and in this case, it can be enterprise founders, and you ask them, \"What did you do in the first six to nine months of running your company, of starting your company? What patterns emerged from that?\" And we have found a very consistent set of patterns, and that's what we decided to base our framework around.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:07):\nAmazing. And I think you're at such an interesting Venn diagram of exposure to develop something like this. One, you have a deep product background, you started a company, you see tons of startups going through the journey, many succeeding, many not. So I get why one, you wanted to do this and why I think this is going to be so valuable to a lot of people. You talked briefly about why product-market fit is so important, and maybe it might be helpful just to share a little bit more just why is this something people should be so obsessed with and why did you spend so much time developing this?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:09:40):\nI think as a founder, there are so many things you have to do. You have to pick a market, you have to find a co-founder, you have to hire a team, you have to raise funding, you have to build a product, you have to sell a product. And so sometimes it gets lost that actually, the only thing that matters in the first couple years is finding product-market fit and actually, what we define as extreme product-market fit, and I'll go into that. Because if you find extreme product-market fit, the momentum just carries you, and the market pulls you along. And it's easy to know what to build because you're building the thing that your customers want and it's motivating as a team. It's easy to hire people, everything becomes easier if you find product-market fit, it is the thing that propels the company.\n\n(00:10:25):\nAnd so we are a seed stage venture firm. We tend to work with very early founders who are pre-product-market fit. And the hard truth about it is that most of them don't get past the first couple levels of it. The majority of startups do not get past, what we call, level one product-market fit or level two product-market fit. And I'll go through and define all that stuff. They get stuck at one of those first couple levels. And if they can unlock the right product and the right way to explain it to a customer and make a customer deeply satisfied, and there's enough customers out there like that, it just pulls the whole thing along.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:02):\nWho is this framework for specifically? And for people that are listening, how do they know if this is for them or not?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:11:07):\nThis is for early B2B founders, and specifically founders who are doing something that is more sales-led than bottom-up. I think bottom-up is its own world. It's closer to consumer product development in my mind. And I have done consumer products. Consumer product, I think there is a little bit more alchemy involved. It's about having great taste and finding the right thing at the right time and it's like catching lightning in a bottle.\n\n(00:11:36):\nI think the good thing about enterprise, and specifically sales-led B2B, is that there is more science to it. And so it is for sales-led B2B founders who are in, let's call it, the first six to nine months of starting their company and want to set the foundation for product-market fit right from the beginning.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:53):\nAwesome. Okay. So B2B founders, sales-led in the first six to nine months of their journey. Awesome.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:11:59):\nThat's right. Yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):\nYou talked about the science of this. I imagine you don't want to overpromise this is going to help you find product-market fit, step one, two, three profit. How do you think about just what the benefits of this are and how people should think about the chance that they will find product-market fit at the end of this journey following this framework?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:12:16):\nWe can't guarantee success here. I just want to contextualize that finding extreme product-market fit is very, very hard. And what we are trying to do is increase your odds, increase the odds, reduce the role of luck, give you a framework and way of thinking about the things that you need to do. And I think that that can increase the odds. Like I said earlier, the majority of startups are getting stuck at these first couple levels. I think if you know what the path looks like and you know what the levers are at your disposal and you know what you need to aim for, I think we can get more of these companies to level three and level four product-market fit, which is where you really want to be and where you have a very valuable company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:54):\nPerfect. Okay, final question. You launched a whole program for founders to go through and learn all of this in depth, many week kind of program. We're going to be covering a lot of it here for folks that want to go a lot deeper and actually go through this program. Talk about how they find this and how this program works.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:13:11):\nSo we launched a new program, and we call it Product-Market Fit Method. It is designed, like I said, to help early B2B founders increase the odds of finding product-market fit. It's totally free, it's a very intensive program. You can see all the details at pmf.firstround.com, and the application deadline is May 7th. The program starts on May 29th. And we actually ran a beta version, a test version of this late last year with 11 founders, I think probably some you know, Lenny, from Stripe and Plaid and Airbnb and Twitter. And the feedback, it was great. It made me feel very good.\n\n(00:13:47):\nOne of the founders was like, \"I feel like these 14 weeks saved me two years of time in what would've been wandering through the desert.\" And so there's eight sessions in the full program, and the first one is the one we're going to do today. So the first session is on what we call the levels of product-market fit. The second one is on customer discovery, and we actually refer to it as dollar-driven discovery. We get very specific about not just the normal way of doing customer conversations and customer discovery, but how do you find that a customer is willing to pay money for this thing and a lot of money?\n\n(00:14:22):\nWe talk about market validation, product positioning. We do a section on design partners because I think a lot of founders have questions about that. How do I find the right design partners? What's the right way to structure an agreement with them? How do I convert them to paying customers? All that stuff. We talk about product iteration and pivots, and I refer to this stage as the grind, the grind of product iteration. And then we spend a ton of time on founder-led sales.\n\n(00:14:47):\nAnd the reason that we do that is we really like working with very technical founders, builders, people that are either engineering background, product design, data science, people who are builders. So that's the program in a nutshell. And like I said, any founder working on a new B2B SaaS company, welcome to apply. And then bonus points if you are technical, like I said, if you have a clear product idea or a hypothesis, but that you're less than six to 12 months into building the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:19):\nI love how incentives are so aligned here. You help companies find product-market fit. If First Round does great, everyone does great. It makes so much sense to build something like this. One thing I can't help but mention or ask about is you said it's an intensive program. How do you find founders have time to do something like this and also be building their company? I know this helps them build, but how do you just think about they have so much to do, they have time to do a program like this?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:15:41):\nThe way that we think about it is that the program roughly takes about 10 hours a week for each founder, and it's 10 hours of work that you were going to be doing anyway. It is literally you're talking to customers, you're improving your positioning, you're doing critical thinking about your market and what you should be building. And so the way I think about it, and the way I've heard from the 11 founders that went through it is it just added structure to what I was doing anyway and it actually made me more efficient.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:10):\nLast question, you mentioned that it's free. How does that work? How does that work for everyone?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:16:14):\nSo it's 100% free and literally, it costs you $0. We give you $0, we own 0% of your company. And it's pretty different than I think a lot of other programs out there. And this is just something we do. Over the years, we've run First Round Angel Track, which I know you were in, Lenny. We've run the First Round Review for 10 years. We make these things free and our belief is that you have to create value in the ecosystem.\n\n(00:16:36):\nYou have to put stuff out in the world that is useful, and if you can create that value, create enough value with the audience, then you'll be able to capture that value at some point. And so we think there's a win-win here. We get an inside look at some of tomorrow's great companies and they get an inside look at First Round.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:49):\nGot it. So companies don't have to take money from you guys to be a part of this program.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:16:53):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):\nOkay, let's get into it. Let's talk about this framework. Maybe just as a broad strokes overview, how does this framework work? How do companies find product-market fit?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:17:03):\nSo the framework starts with a very simple idea that is product-market fit is not a one-size-fits-all thing, and it doesn't just happen overnight. And for B2B companies, specifically, it does tend to follow a repeatable pattern. And so we start with defining the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is to get to extreme product-market fit. And we have a precise definition for this. Let me read it to you. So extreme product-market fit is a state of widespread demand for a product that satisfies a critical need and crucially can be delivered repeatably and efficiently to each customer.\n\n(00:17:40):\nAnd so there's three key ideas in there: demand, satisfaction and efficiency. And I think efficiency is worth highlighting because that's what most people would leave out of their definition. You talk about like, \"Oh, it's a product, people like it. That's good, that's product-market fit.\" But if you look, there's products out there. I was a big fan of WeWork, as a customer of WeWork. And I'm a fan of Casper and these other products. Those products managed to achieve customer satisfaction and demand, but they never got the efficiency right, and so the whole business just never worked at scale.\n\n(00:18:18):\nAnd my partner, Brett Berson, at First Round, he gives this example of the $100 vending machine, and I really like this example, which is imagine I built a vending machine and I stuck it in the middle of San Francisco. And you walk up to this vending machine and you put a dollar in and $100 bill comes out. And that's the product. That would have insane demand. There would be a line at that vending machine. I think people would be extremely satisfied. They'd be like, \"This is awesome.\" The retention would be very good. I'm sure they would come back tomorrow. But the whole thing is it's ridiculous. The whole metaphor is ridiculous because it's just not viable to do something like that.\n\n(00:18:59):\nAnd yet you see a lot of startups kind of do this. They're basically with their products, giving away $2 for $1 and it gets them pretty far. But that's not real product-market fit. And so that's one of the reasons that we think efficiency and how you think about the economic model of what you're doing is very important. And then this other aspect that I like, which is we have this concept that we call the marginal customer, and the next incremental customer you're going to get for your company, for your product. And if you have product-market fit, and as you are progressing along this journey, the marginal customer should be getting easier and easier and easier to get, easier to acquire them, easier to give them good service with a good product.\n\n(00:19:42):\nAnd that means your efficiency is increasing along the way and your product-market fit is strengthening. So you've got to have all three of those things: demand, satisfaction, efficiency. But the interesting thing is that you don't go for all three of them at once from the very beginning. And so product-market fit, it happens in the sequence of levels, it happens over multiple years. And for the best enterprise companies, I would say they tend to reach extreme product-market fit in roughly four to six years. There's some variance, but roughly four to six years. And so we label these four levels. We say level one product-market fit is nascent product-market fit. Level two is developing, level three is strong, and level four is extreme. And that's where you want to get.\n\n(00:20:26):\nAnd along the way, you're trading off these three dimensions: satisfaction, demand, and efficiency because they're intertwined. You could spend a bunch of money on marketing, and that's going to increase your demand, but you're decreasing your efficiency if you do that. You can invest a bunch in efficiency and automating a whole bunch of stuff, but that actually might harm the customer experience and you're reducing satisfaction. So that's an interesting thing, I think, is you're actually making trade-offs at each level and what you should optimize for at each level is different. And so we talk about all these signs, whether you're getting stuck at a given level, how do you get unstuck and how do you progress along this path.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):\nAmazing. And we're going to go through each of these. And the idea, as a listener, what I'm thinking is you're probably in one of these buckets. What we're trying to do is help you out of that bucket and help you move further up the ladder to the next level. So just to summarize, I have my notes here. So there's essentially four levels of product-market fit, basically, the strength of product-market fit that you have: nascent, developing, strong, extreme.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:21:24):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:25):\nOkay. And then you have three dimensions within each of these levels: satisfaction, demand, and efficiency. We're going to talk about what all these mean and how you use these. Let's talk about level one, nascent product-market fit. What does that look like? What do you do when you're there if you're stuck? And what are some examples of companies that felt nascent product-market fit?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:21:44):\nYeah. Okay, level one, nascent. So at this point, you're probably like a pre-seed or seed stage company. You've got less than 10 people on your team. And at level one, your job is to find three to five customers that have a particular problem that is worth solving and to deliver them a satisfying solution. And you got to pick a problem that is both important and urgent to them.\n\n(00:22:08):\nAnd the solution that you deliver needs to satisfy some kind of promise that they care deeply about. So of the three dimensions that you just recapped, Lenny, it's satisfaction first, demand second, efficiency last when you're at level one. It's actually okay to be inefficient at this stage if it helps you uncover something that delivers an insanely good customer satisfaction. And so I think that one of the best examples I can think of that is this company called Vanta.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:37):\nLove Vanta. Also, a happy sponsor and I'm an investor. What a great example.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:22:42):\nWhat a great example. So Vanta was founded in 2016 by Christina Cacioppo, and she had come from Dropbox and we got to work at Dropbox together, which was awesome. She was the PM of Dropbox Paper at that time. And so Vanta, it's a company that does compliance automation, continuous monitoring. And most startups think of Vanta is how you get a SOC 2, but they didn't do that at first.\n\n(00:23:03):\nAnd I remember in 2018, Christina and I went on a walk around the South Park neighborhood in San Francisco. And this was the first time I heard the idea of Vanta. And she had actually, in 2016, 2017, tried a few other ideas. She had this smart speaker that would record meetings and it would send meeting summaries over Slack.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:24):\nB2B Alexa is what she called it. I remember.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:23:25):\nB2B Alexa. And she had this other idea, something about dropshipping, but she didn't know anything about dropshipping. And she had just been in this mode of like, \"We're building stuff and then we're seeing if anybody wants it.\" And then she realized that wasn't working and she changed what she was doing. And she started talking to potential customers, and she was very interested in the idea of security and why a lot of startups didn't use any security products.\n\n(00:23:48):\nAnd she was talking to security engineers and CISOs and just CTOs and startups. And she would ask them, \"What is the thing you hate most about your job as it relates to security?\" And over and over and over they would say, \"I hate filling out the security questionnaires. I hate doing the compliance audits. It's so much grungy manual work. I'm in there filling out spreadsheets and taking screenshots of my AWS account. And the whole thing just doesn't make sense.\" And she had actually felt this herself when she was on Dropbox Paper and the experience of getting a SOC 2 was onerous.\n\n(00:24:26):\nAnd the reason that she needed to get it is because we wanted to start selling Dropbox Paper into enterprise. And so she said to me, \"There's this pain out there, I think I can solve it, and I think there might be a revenue unlock.\" And I was like, \"What do you mean by that?\" And she was like, \"Well, I've got these first few customers or design partner, pseudo customers. It's Segment and Front and Figma.\" And this is 2017, '18. So these companies were smaller at the time, not the big companies they are now. And she was like, \"Yeah, they're trying to sell into Fortune 500 companies. One of them is actually trying to land a Fortune 10 right now. And they said the thing that's holding them back is they don't have compliance certification, they don't have a SOC 2.\n\n(00:25:08):\n\"And I told them, 'Hey, what if I do that for you?' And they were like, 'Oh, you can just do that?'\" And she was like, \"Yeah.\" And she did it, and they landed the deal. And it's one of the clearest examples to me of a product that satisfies a promise, but this product is going to unlock revenue for you. You are going to be able to land this enterprise deal. And so I think they just did a phenomenal job of that. And that's what you're looking for when you're at level one, a problem that really matters to three to five customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):\nThat specific example, I think she delivered a spreadsheet. There was no product, she just manually filled out a spreadsheet and gave it to them.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:25:49):\nCompletely manual. She was the one behind the email address posing as the AI, but doing it herself. And I think that's revealing of it's okay to be inefficient at level one, as long as you are delivering incredible satisfaction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:03):\nYeah, I was just going to say that. This is the ultimate example of efficiency is not important, which I love, is what you're pointing out at this step. I know you're going to share another example, but just to summarize what this stage feels like from earlier when you talked about, essentially, of less than 10 people, you're trying to find three to five customers. I think that's so important. You're not trying to find tens or hundreds, you're just like, \"Three to five people.\" And the customer element, I imagine, you're implying they're paying you money.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:26:29):\nYes, they're paying you money and you're delivering a product that solves a problem for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:33):\nAnd the product could be potentially a spreadsheet or super Wizard of Oz at this point even.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:26:37):\nYeah, that's okay at this level.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:39):\nI know RAMP actually had barely a product when they started selling. Initially, they had someone just updating things behind the scenes on these dashboards. And then you talked about the problem needs to be important and urgent, which connects to people paying attention to a startup that they don't trust or know anything about because the problem is that important and urgent. And you also mentioned it has to satisfy a promise you're giving them, \"We'll solve SOC 2 for you,\" and then you actually accomplish that.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:27:03):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:03):\nIs there anything else maybe as a benchmark that tells you you're at this step of product-market fit?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:27:10):\nYeah. So like I said, you're pre-seed less than 10 people. Probably, your demand source at this stage is mostly people you know. It's friends and family, it's your network, maybe it's VCs. You haven't probably done a lot of cold outreach at this point, and it's hard to find customers. You're trying to get three to five. It probably takes you 20 warm intros to get one, something along those lines. So maybe to get to three to five, it's at least 50 conversations. That's very normal at this stage because you're just trying to find the right problem and find customers who have it. You're probably in the $0 to 500K ARR, somewhere in that zone. I would say that you're at level one.\n\n(00:27:48):\nAnd then there are metrics to track efficiency, things like burn multiple, gross margin, NRR all of these things. All of them are just not applicable at this stage. It's too early and you shouldn't be worrying about that stuff. And so you want to be feeling this sense of progress that there are customers who need what you are building and the thing you're building works. And so conversely, the signs that we see a lot of founders get stuck, and this is a very common level to get stuck. And so if you're hanging out here for six months, nine months, 12 months, and there's yellow flags that are appearing, you're starting to feel stuck.\n\n(00:28:24):\nAnd so the yellow flags are something like, let's say, your product disappeared overnight, your customers wouldn't be super disappointed. Let's say you have a handful of happy customers. Let's say you've got four or five customers, but the most important feature is actually different for each one of them. That starts to look a little bit more like a consulting business than a product business. Or it just feels incredibly hard to find the marginal customer, the next new customer. Or your usage is low. The product is in their hands, but the usage is low, it's not growing that much. It lasts for six months.\n\n(00:28:55):\nAnd I think, there's a really good example, Jack Altman, who's the founder of Lattice, he founded Lattice in 2015. We've talked to him a bunch on the First Round Paths to Product-Market Fit and other things. So for those who don't know, Lattice is a people management platform, but it didn't start that way. And most people don't know about this, Lattice actually started as an OKR tool back in 2015.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:15):\nOh, didn't know.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:29:16):\nYeah. And so Jack had just seen this at other companies. He's like, \"Okay, companies are doing OKRs, but they're not very good at it and it causes a lot of arguments among the executive team and employees are noncompliant. They think the whole thing's dumb. So I can fix that with software.\" And so the original version of Lattice was for managing OKRs. And he was able to sell it. And so his buyer was the head of HR, and they said, \"Okay, yeah, we'll give this a shot.\" And he had a couple companies using it, and they would use it for one quarter. And then the next quarter would come around, and they were like, \"Didn't go that well last time. I don't know, the employees don't seem to like it. I don't know.\"\n\n(00:29:59):\nAnd then the quarter after that, they were like, \"No, we're not buying this, we're not using this.\" And so Jack pulled off the pivot to people management. And the way that he did it was he actually kept the persona. And so this gets into the ideas of the four Ps, and I'll talk about this a little bit more. This is our version of the four Ps. You've got the persona, the problem, the promise, and the product. And all four of these things have to line up. Your product has to deliver a promise that solves the problem of your persona. And so Jack actually kept the persona. He was like, \"I've gotten to know these heads of HR really well over the last six to nine months. I text with them, I go out to coffee with them, I'm friends with them, I know them really well. This OKR thing just doesn't seem to be a big deal for them, but they've got other problems that I could look at solving.\"\n\n(00:30:53):\nAnd the interesting thing was that timing, it was mid-2010s, performance management had started to come back in favor. It was like this pendulum. There was a period of time where performance management was really important, and then all these companies were like, \"We're not doing this anymore.\" And then the pendulum swung back, and around 2015, 2016 was that time. And so Jack literally showed them Figma mock-ups. There was no product, but he's like, \"What if I could solve performance management for you in a way that is much more modern and much more employee-friendly and manager-friendly and the whole thing's just going to work better?\"\n\n(00:31:25):\nAnd the response was off the charts. And people wanted this thing. And I believe he sold his first five or 10 customers with Figma mock-ups. Before, he hadn't built anything really. And so that, I think, is an interesting example of he was stuck in the zone of people didn't love what he was doing. He kept the persona, but he changed the problem that he was solving and the promise he was delivering through the product. And we do a whole section on pivots and when to pivot and how to pivot. And I think this is actually the best framework for this, is the four Ps. Lattice kept the first one but changed the others. Vanta changed all four.\n\n(00:32:08):\nThere are other products like Plaid that actually kept elements of the product they were doing. So I don't know if you know the story of Plaid, but Zach Perret was building... Plaid started out not as like a API for bank accounts. It started out as a consumer budgeting app. It was a consumer app. And it just was supposed to help you save money and budget and stuff. And it just wasn't that popular. And the founders were frustrated, but they had built this part of the product that enabled the app to connect to your bank accounts, and had solved all the nitty-gritty issues with that. And then they found that their friends wanted to license it from them.\n\n(00:32:46):\nSo Zach had a friend at Venmo who wanted to license this, and they got Robinhood at some point, they got Coinbase at some point. So that's an example of they actually kept a lot of the code that they had written. They kept the product, but they completely changed the other three Ps. Instead of solving for consumers who have a problem with budgeting, we are going to solve for developers at fintech companies who have a problem connecting to bank accounts. And it was a total flip of the four Ps. But that's why I really like this framework because I think it really helps founders think in a structured way about this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:15):\nTodd, this is amazing. I'm so happy we're doing this. I think this is going to help a lot of people. I want to move on to level two, but first let me try to summarize some of these key elements. So these four Ps is essentially what you should try to change if you're stuck in this level or any level. And just to summarize, you can change who you're targeting, the persona, you can change the problem you're solving, you could change the way you're pitching it, which is the promise is how you describe it, basically positioning. And then you could also just change your product. You mentioned Vanta changed all four, some companies change just one. Any advice for how to know which of these to change? What points you to change this versus change that? Is there anything that you've seen?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:33:55):\nI think different founders approach this differently. And I've seen a lot of founders who are build first and then sell, and I've seen a lot of founders who are sell first and then build. And they can both work. I tend to gravitate towards the, \"I want to sell it before I build it,\" because I really want the signal from customers and I want that to be the guide and the oxygen that drives what I'm building. I find that very motivating. I also find it easier, honestly.\n\n(00:34:25):\nRather than guessing like, \"Oh, I'm going to write 50,000 lines of code and then see if somebody wants this thing,\" I think it's better to talk to a bunch of customers, know that, \"Hey, if I had this thing, if I could build this thing, I know it would sell. I know these people want this thing.\" So I tend to approach it from that point of view and therefore, I focus on the persona and the problem and the promise. What is the promise that is really going to click for that buyer, for that persona? And then the product's job is to satisfy those first three Ps really.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:55):\nAnd obviously, those are much easier to change and play with versus rebuilding your product. So if nothing else, you should probably start there. I actually have a post with a bunch of awesome examples of changing the positioning, changing the persona, and so we'll link to that in show notes if people want more examples. Finally, let me try to summarize the stage. So I think it's important to note at this nascent stage, it's not roaring product-market fit. It's, as you described, very nascent. You're getting customers, but it's hard. You said it's 20 introductions to one sale, but you're getting them.\n\n(00:35:25):\nI know Retool has a great quote. David has this quote of, \"Every customer he got early on, he felt it was the last customer he was ever going to get. No more people want this thing and it's always a struggle.\" So I think that's very normal, is what you're describing. The beginnings are rarely off and to the right. And it's okay if this takes a while. You said that if you spent 12 months at this stage, you're probably stuck in the stage, and signs that you're stuck in this nascent stage versus this is actually normal. Signs you mentioned are if you ask people if this went away and they wouldn't be disappointed, they'd be like, \"Nah, all right. It's cool.\"\n\n(00:36:01):\nYou have many customers, but they're using different features of the product. So to you, the way you described it, essentially, you're professional services for them. You're not actually building a product. You consult a lot of people. And then they're actually not using it often. They're buying, they're paying for it, like the last example, but they're not necessarily using it and they're going to churn pretty quickly.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:36:19):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:20):\nAnything else you wanted to touch on there before we get to level two?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:36:23):\nThe last thing that I'd add at level one is there's this founder from a company called Persona, his name is Rick Song. He's super awesome. Persona is a First Round company. They do identity verification. And Rick's analogy, I just love it for level one, is you don't want to get friend-zoned by your customers, where your customers like you, but they don't love you and they don't need you. And he was super paranoid about this in the early days of Persona. And his technique for doing this, which I really like, is super simple, was he was very close with his first five or 10 customers.\n\n(00:37:00):\nAnd he would go to them and sit them down one-on-one and say, \"I need your help. It is very important to me that this company succeeds and does not fail. So I don't want you to be nice to me. I want you to tell me is Persona a necessity for your company? If we went away, how painful would that be? If a competitor came along that charged half as much as us, would you switch to them?\" And he's really trying to get to the essence of: is Persona critical for you or am I in the friend zone? And I just think that's a really great way of thinking about this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:35):\nI love that story. It's like in a relationship, it's the talk.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:37:37):\nIt's the talk.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:38):\n\"Are we a thing?\" I love that. That's so good. The sooner you know the truth, the better. And it's hard to hear bad news, but I love that, just advice of just sit them down one-on-one. Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product pop-ups really annoying, \"Want to take a tour?\" \"Check out this new feature.\" And these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible.\n\n(00:38:08):\nBut every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. They use AI to get closer to user intent. So they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words, and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions.\n\n(00:38:36):\nAnd they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny. Let's talk about level two. So what does level two look like? And what should founders be focusing on when they're in level two?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:39:19):\nYeah. So level two is developing product-market fit, and your job at level two is now you've got to go from five satisfied customers to 25 satisfied customers. And so now you've got to start thinking about demand in addition to satisfaction. Because it is very hard to just grind your way all the way to 25 customers with sheer willpower, but you can do that to five, maybe 10. And we see some founders who just have phenomenal willpower and grit and grind their way to five or 10 customers. To get to 25 and to get beyond 25, the product has to be doing a lot of the heavy lifting for you. And so that is the essence of this level.\n\n(00:39:58):\nSo if you're at this level, now you're seed or Series A style company, maybe you've got up to 20 people at the company. And you're starting to work on this demand source where you have the early signs of a scalable channel, and it's not just warm intros from your VCs or from your friends. You're maybe investing in cold outreach and getting that tuned and humming. You might be investing in content, you might be doing community events, but the whole idea is you're trying to scale the demand source. It's still not easy. A benchmark, we would say, is that your sales conversion without a warm intro is still probably 10%, something like that.\n\n(00:40:38):\nFirst call to close one is around 10%. If you get higher than that, that's great, but that sort of benchmark for this level. You're in anywhere from the 500K to five million ARR zone, that's a hallmark of level two. And you're actually starting to think about efficiency metrics and sales metrics. You might starting to be thinking about magic number, which is a new ARR that you take in in a period divided by the CAC you spend in that period, so something in the 0.5 to 0.75 range. You want to get higher eventually, but that's pretty reasonable for this level.\n\n(00:41:10):\nYou're just starting to think about retention. You've been around for a year, so you've got renewals and you want those renewals renewing. Maybe something like 10%, 20% regretted churn is okay. You don't want to be higher than that, and you want your NRR to be at least 100%. And then things like gross margin and burn multiple, they're still not the focus. Those are the classic efficiency metrics. They're not the focus right now.\n\n(00:41:30):\nBut we would say you want your gross margin to be not worse than 50%, and you'd want your burn multiple to be not worse than five X. Your burn multiple, by the way, is just how much you burn in a current period versus how much new ARR comes in. So if you burn $5 million and you take in one, then you've got to burn multiple of five. And you don't want to be worse than that at this stage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:51):\nAmazing. There's a lot of these benchmarks which I love. I imagine not everyone's going to hit each of them exactly. These are just rough guidelines of like, \"You're probably in this stage if you're in this level,\" right?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:42:03):\nYeah, exactly. There's some wide bars around these metrics. It's just representative of, generally, the stage of five to 25 customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):\nI love it. And it's so interesting that people think of product-market fit, as you said, as this binary, \"I have it or I don't.\" And the way you're talking about this is in this level to developing product-market fit, a company has 25 satisfied customers, they're over five million in ARR, a lot of cases they have 20 employees.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:42:28):\nBetween 500K and five million. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:31):\n500K and five million. They have 20 employees. In theory, you would think this is a roaring success. They're killing it, they have all these customers, they're growing. But it's still just level two of product-market fit. So I think this has a really interesting insight, and it reminds me of when I did a bunch of research on product-market fit.\n\n(00:42:49):\nSo many founders are like, \"I never felt that product-market fit. I didn't have it. It was always, 'I don't know, maybe when we get to 100 million ARR, I'll really feel like we got this.'\" So I think this is a really good reminder that a lot of times you're not actually going to feel so confident this will last, and you're going to get to lasting durable product-market fit. So I think that's a really great insight here.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:43:12):\nYeah. And the thing that's really, I think, the hallmark of level two is you've got a product that a handful of people like. It's satisfying a critical need for them. Now you've got to open the demand floodgates so that we can get to 25 customers and beyond. And different companies do this in very different ways. It's much easier said than done. Looker is an example. So Looker is a First Round company founded in 2012 by Lloyd Tabb. They do business intelligence. And Looker is interesting because they spent actually a long time at level one, but then flew through level two. And the reason is because Lloyd, the founder, the first five customers of Looker, he was basically going in and doing consulting for them.\n\n(00:43:59):\nAnd the reason is because of the nature of the product. People don't get Looker until they see their own data in it, and their data is modeled and they see the dashboards and they're like, \"Oh, my God. Wow, I didn't realize these insights.\" So Lloyd understood Looker is not a product you could sell with Figma mock-ups. And so what happened was Lloyd would go into these customers, spend 20, 30, 40 hours before they were even a customer, modeling their data, teaching them how to use it, showing more people within the organization the power of the data and the dashboards.\n\n(00:44:32):\nAnd later, they called this their forward deploy process. This is how they figured out sales. And so it actually took them a long time in level one to get this right, but then they were able to do this repeatably. And so they went from five to 25 fairly quickly, and a lot of amazing... 75% close rate because they were only selling customers who were already using it. There was zero churn. And Lloyd explains once he got to 20 customers, he's like, \"I know I'm onto something. And I think I figured out a model.\"\n\n(00:45:03):\nAnd the model stayed the same until they ended up selling to Google. And so they did these other things too. They started focusing on demand channels. They got a couple SDRs who were prospecting. I think they did some partner marketing with AWS Redshift. They did these look-and-tell customer events in San Francisco where they got Looker customers together to talk about what they were doing in Looker and how they built the product. But really, the groundwork was set at level one and then they moved really quickly through level two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:32):\nSo again, the way to think about this phase, is this is when you're starting to scale a way to drive demand. You're not just grinding sales, cold outreach. There's a way you're starting to bring in customers that are more efficient. And in Looker's case, they just started coming because I imagine there's word of mouth and people started to talk about it.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:45:50):\nYeah. Let me do another example. A really different example is a company called Ironclad. Ironclad, it's legal. It's a legal tech company founded in 2015. Jason Jason Boehmig is the founder. AI-powered contract management software. So this was interesting because Jason, he started out calling this an AI legal assistant. And in 2024, people are like, \"Oh, AI legal assistant. Yeah, that's awesome.\" But in 2014, people were like, \"What?\" And he found it really hard to sell. No one was looking for an AI legal assistant. And so he told us this story.\n\n(00:46:29):\nThere was an email address on the Ironclad homepage, hello@ironclad.com. This is in 2015. And he doesn't get very much email, but Jason is checking the email. And one day he gets this one line email, and he almost archives it because he doesn't know who it's from and it's one line. But he sees that it's from a person at a publicly-traded company, and so he's like, \"Oh, maybe there's something here.\" And the one line email is just, \"Are you a CLM?\" And he was like, \"What is a CLM?\" And he Googles for it. A CLM is a contract lifecycle management platform. And he's reading up about CLMs, and he's like, \"Oh, we do that. Yeah.\"\n\n(00:47:08):\nAnd so he replies to the email, \"Yes, we are a CLM.\" And the customer gets them on the phone. And the customer says, \"Oh, I'm in the market for a CLM. I'm looking at 10 or 12 different vendors, but you guys look pretty cool because there's some automation and some AI stuff going on. Can I check this out?\" And Jason's like, \"Of course.\" So he and his co-founder take the train from San Francisco down to San Jose. And on the train, Jason is telling his co-founder, Cai, \"Hey, I need you to code this up right now to make it look like what this customer is expecting.\"\n\n(00:47:42):\nAnd they get to the meeting, and they do the demo. And the customer has no idea that they just made this demo on the train, and they're a very small company. And they win the contract against these 10 or 12 other established bases, because Ironclad, it's more modern, it's automated, it's got this AI stuff. It's just a better product, or the demo looks like it's going to be a better product. And so Jason reflects on this and he's like, \"Yeah, the thing for us is we had been trying to create this new category of AI legal assistant, and it was just a slog.\n\n(00:48:10):\n\"And instead, when we changed our positioning to play in an existing category of CLM, but a much better CLM, but customers are already looking for a CLM, they're already looking to spend money on a CLM, and just expand the definition of what that category is, things just started to click.\" And that's how they got through that zone of 10, 20, 30 customers. And even if you look at the Ironclad website today, it says AI-Powered Contract Management Software. That really is the key idea still.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:38):\nAwesome. So this is an awesome example of positioning/promise is the lever they pull here. I love the point about category design. That's one of the ongoing debates on this podcast, whether you should try to create a category.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:48:50):\nI know, it's a hot topic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:51):\nHot topic. Sounds like you're in the boat of probably better not to create your own category.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:48:56):\nI think it's hard to create a category. It certainly works in some cases, but if you actually have a really interesting spin on an existing category, there's already buyers spending money on that thing. They're already looking for something to buy. So if you can do it, I do actually think that way is easier.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:13):\nBefore we get to level three, what are signs that you're maybe stuck at level two, and what should one do about that?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:49:21):\nYeah. So the whole idea of level two is this thing that the marginal customer is getting easier. And so you've got to be focusing on demand and the repeatability of demand while you maintain satisfaction. So the yellow flags are things that are the opposite of that. Your current customers are pretty happy, but you're just having trouble opening the floodgates. As you're getting to the top end of level two, you should start to hear some startups know who you are like, \"Oh, you need a SOC 2, you're a startup. Oh, Vanta.\" \"Oh, you need AI-powered contract management software. Oh, Ironclad.\" You start to get known for a thing.\n\n(00:49:59):\nAnd so if you're having trouble opening those floodgates, and you're sitting there for, I don't know, 12 months, 18 months, that's a problem. Or you have things like your regretted churn is greater than 20%. That's a satisfaction warning sign. And again, you have to maintain the satisfaction as you work on these other things. Every level just gets more things you have to do. Or you could be finding that the sales cycle's taking too long, you're losing deals late in the funnel, you're losing the competitors. You're just not feeling the urgency from customers or you're struggling to hit the price point that you want.\n\n(00:50:33):\nAnd the way that customers will say this to you because customers are nice, right? They'll say, \"Oh, we don't have the budget.\" Or, \"Oh, it's just not the right time for us. We'd love to talk again next year.\" That means no, when you're hearing that from customers. You want customers who are like, \"Oh, of course. Yeah, this is expensive, but I'm going to make this work because I need this.\" And so if you're seeing any of those signs, those are the signs that you maybe are stuck or plateauing at this level. And I really think it's important to think about the four Ps and think about: how am I going to pivot my way out of this? Jack Altman, who I mentioned earlier from Lattice, he's got a great quote on this.\n\n(00:51:14):\nIt's up in a video on the website. What did he say? He said, \"Most founders do a 10% pivot, and what they need to be doing is a 200% pivot.\" Jack didn't say this, but I think part of my interpretation of this is it's psychologically hard as a founder. You've gotten to this many customers, you're starting to plateau, but you're like, \"I don't want to throw this whole thing away.\" But you have to be willing to let go and really focus on nailing the four Ps at this point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:46):\nAnd in your experience, do you find, essentially, pivoting is the answer if you're stuck?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:51:52):\nI think sometimes it's nice when it's the Ironclad thing, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:56):\nYeah.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:51:57):\nIt's nicest when it's the Looker thing of you don't have to change anything. It just starts working and basically, the whole thing works the whole time. That's not common. It's nice when it's the Ironclad thing when you just change one of them, or maybe two of them. Starting over with all four of these is hard at level two, but oftentimes, it's what's required. I was mentioning earlier, level two is the second most common level to get stuck.\n\n(00:52:20):\nA big chunk of companies are going to get stuck at level one, and the second biggest is at level two. So sometimes it's hard. I think the trap is not doing enough to realize that you're actually not progressing to product-market fit in the way that you need to and just starting to burn money and not make progress. And you've seen many startups struggle with this. I think it's the hardest part of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:42):\nYeah. Especially once they're a million, two million, three million ARR and they're like, \"Look, we're making all this money.\" And they don't necessarily realize that they've been stuck at this stage for so long. So just to summarize flags that something is wrong and that you should probably think about changing your persona, your problem, your promise or your product, is it's been 12 to 18 months at this stage of product-market fit. You are churning about 20% of customers. And these are logo churn, I imagine, just like businesses stop using you.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:53:14):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:14):\nYour sales cycles are really slow. Is there a sense of what slow means? Just a rough heuristic. What should it...\n\nTodd Jackson (00:53:20):\nWell, some sales cycles are slow. If you're selling to companies that are big, you're selling to government, that type of thing. I don't know. Rough rule of thumb is... There's different ACVs also. If you're the kind of product that is 20K, 30K annual contracts, that was Looker, right? But they were able to do the sales cycle very repeatedly because they closed so often. There are some contracts that are 100K, 200K, six figure contracts. Those can take a long time. Those can take three to six months. You can't basically be in the worst of both worlds where you've got a slow sales cycle and a low ACV. That is the quadrant of death basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:57):\nAwesome. Okay. And then the other sign is just you're not finding demand starting to come to you. You're not finding a channel to drive demand. And is a big part of this inbound? You're supposed to start seeing more inbound coming at you? Or is it more just sales becomes easier?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:54:12):\nIt's both. So sales becomes easier, but I think if you are starting to get to level three, which is where we're getting to next, you've probably got 10%, 20% of your inbound coming or completely organic inbound.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:25):\nAwesome. Okay. So again, if you're stuck at this stage, and these are signs that are like, \"Oh, man, this sounds familiar,\" your advice is find one of these things to shift the person you're going after, the problem you're solving, the way you position it and/or your product if you have to.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:54:41):\nYeah. And probably just look for something that is a lot more of a burning pain. It's usually that the problem is not significant enough, important enough to people, or the promise is not valuable enough. It's usually one of those [inaudible 00:54:54] assuming you have a reasonable persona.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:56):\nAwesome. And the reason I am spending so much time here, as you said, most companies get stuck here, like B2B SaaS companies. So I think it's really important to make sure people have something to go with. And in the course and in the post you put out, there's more examples of companies going through this and what they did. Let's talk about level three. What does level three look like? What should you be focusing on there?\n\nTodd Jackson (00:55:16):\nYeah. So level three is strong product-market fit. This is where I think it starts to get fun. This is where all the product-market fit adages come in, \"The fish are jumping into the boat. The rock is rolling down the hill and I'm trying to chase it instead of pushing it up the hill.\" And keep in mind, for most enterprise founders, we're now three, four or five years into the company, so it's not easy to get here. And to get to L3 here, you are looking for repeatability. The marginal customer has become much easier.\n\n(00:55:48):\nAnd so you mentioned, Lenny, this quote from David Hsu from Retool, which I love too, and I'll read it again. He said, \"We talked to someone who said that finding product-market fit was so visceral, you immediately felt it like a geyser.\" And we honestly never felt that in the first couple years. At Retool, every customer we got, whether that was number four or number 14, felt like the last customer we were ever going to find. It felt like rolling the stone uphill, and if you stop pushing, it's going to roll back on you and crush you.\n\n(00:56:15):\nAnd that's how it felt until we had a few million in ARR. That's when the boulder went down the other side and we had to chase it to keep up. And you mentioned earlier, founders were like, \"I'm not sure I ever felt product-market fit.\" This is when you start to feel it. And Jack Altman, again, from Lattice said, \"The biggest shift was in the ease of getting leads.\" I remember thinking, \"I don't even know where these leads are coming from, just more and more of them are showing up each month.\"\n\n(00:56:43):\nBut that is a great feeling. That is a great feeling. Filip Kaliszan from Verkada, he's in some of the videos on our website too. His quote, I'll read it, was, \"After our first year of sales in 2018, those next two years were crazy. We were barely keeping up with production. We had to scale all the systems. A lot of things had to happen in the span of 12 to 18 months in order to deliver on everything that customers were hoping the solution was going to do for them. And that in itself was a very formative and tricky part of the journey.\"\n\n(00:57:11):\nSo the benchmarks when you are at level three are now you're probably 30 to 100 people inside your company. You're probably at Series B-ish territory in terms of venture, maybe late Series A, maybe early Series C, but probably around Series B. You've really cracked a demand channel. You've cracked marketing and sales. You've got at least one channel that is very scalable. And probably 10% or more of your inbound is coming from just referrals and word of mouth and you're getting known, like we talked about.\n\n(00:57:45):\nACV ranges are very high. Very wide, I should say. I'd say where you want to get to with level three is 100 customers. And so if you're approaching 100 customers and maybe you have 75K average ACV, that would be strong. You're in this wide zone of five million, all the way up to 25 million ARR. That is very level three. And you're actually starting now to think about some of these efficiency metrics. Remember, we've been punting efficiency. We were saying it shouldn't be worse than a certain number, but it's not a focus. Now, it's got to come into focus.\n\n(00:58:20):\nBecause the way that we get to level four is we keep ripping on the satisfaction and the demand, and we tune this thing to get very efficient. So we're talking about our gross margin needs to be above 60%, hopefully above 70%. Our burn multiple is now below three. Ideally, we're close to one. Burn multiple in the one to three zone is where we want to be at level three. Regretted churn's less than 10%, NRR is greater than 110%. These are good benchmarks for this level.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):\nHearing level three again tells me level two is basically your pivot from: I'm just grinding customers, selling, pitching, constantly trying to find new people, to level three, where it's coming at you and basically, it's the way you always hear about it, as you described. It's rolling downhill. Fish are jumping in the boat. I haven't heard that one before, but I love this.\n\n(00:59:11):\nSo essentially, you found a demand channel. You found a way to get people to come to you. A lot of them are just hearing about you from other people, you don't even know where they're coming from. 10% you said are coming from referrals and you're getting to 100 customers. I actually have another quote from David Hsu at Retool, and he actually said even at 100 customers, he still felt like every customer he was getting was the last one.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:59:33):\nOh, wow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:33):\nHe's like, \"I can't believe we got DoorDash. That's incredible. Okay. I think there's no more. That's it.\"\n\nTodd Jackson (00:59:39):\nHe is a critical person and critical of himself, but a very high expectations person, let's say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:43):\nYeah. Actually, another quote from Ali Ghodsi from Databricks actually said even at 100 million, he wasn't sure they had product-market fit.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:59:50):\nI mean, come on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:54):\nBecause he's like, \"I don't know.\" I don't know. He felt like, \"This is it. Okay, we're done. We're going to cap out here.\" And I get that.\n\nTodd Jackson (00:59:58):\nI think if you told many, many pre-seed founders that they'd be able to get to 100 million and not know whether they had product-market fit, they'd probably take that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:05):\nBut I think that's maybe an interesting insight. It's often good to be really paranoid and not feel like, \"Okay, we're on our way. Let's start pouring in money. Let's do it.\"\n\nTodd Jackson (01:00:13):\nI think that's what makes a lot of the best founders the best.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:16):\nIndeed. Okay, so level three, anything else that would be useful here? Maybe what are signs that you're struggling at level three, you're stuck?\n\nTodd Jackson (01:00:25):\nYeah. So level three problems. And again, it's hard to get to level three, so awesome work for getting here. But the problems that might start to emerge are you've got a leaky bucket, your NRR is below 90%, or your regretted churn's greater than 10%. Maybe growth is just slowing down. You grew three X each of the prior two years, but you're struggling to do a two X this year. At level three, or five years into the company or so, there's probably a lot of competition. If you've gotten here, you've got something that's working, and people are starting to notice and there's going to be competitors.\n\n(01:01:01):\nAnd they could be the big competitors, they could be the new startups, but you're going to have to figure out how to navigate probably a tougher market than you entered five years ago. And so maybe you found your first scalable channel, but it's getting saturated, you got to find a new channel. These are the level three problems. Or you're growing, but like I said, with efficiency, you're spending too much money to grow. So you feel like, \"Okay, yeah, we can grow at three X year over year, two X year over year, but that's going to push our burn multiple above three again.\" And that's a little bit of a pickle to be in when you have to trade off growth and spend like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:37):\nYou make it sound like life's great, level three people are coming at us. I think it's important to note never is it easy, never is it like, \"Okay, we're good. Let's just ride this wave. Life's going to get so much easier from now on.\" It's never easy. As you said, there's all these things, you're always still juggling, you still aren't sure it's going to keep going.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:01:55):\nNo, I agree. It's like you're spinning plates, and the higher levels you get, there's more plates. You have to keep spinning. And so at level three and getting to level four, we've got to maintain satisfaction and demand. We cannot let them regress in a market that's getting harder, and we have to really start focusing on efficiency. And the companies that can maintain satisfaction and demand and continue to grow and become really efficient, now we're at level four.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:21):\nLet's talk about level four. What does that look like? What are some problems people run into there?\n\nTodd Jackson (01:02:26):\nSo first of all, congrats. If you get to level four, you have a valuable company. You are probably already a unicorn, and you're starting to think about, \"Can I become a decacorn?\" And so you've reached the highest levels of satisfaction, demand, and efficiency. And so the benchmarks at level four are like, \"Okay, now your team is probably bigger than 100 people, you're Series C, Series D or beyond. You've got more than 100 customers and you're starting to figure out, 'How do I get to 200, 300, eventually 1,000 customers?'\" You're beyond 25 million in ARR, so 25 million and up, I think in ARR, it qualifies as level four. And your other metrics are looking really good too. Your sales conversion first call to close one is probably better than 15%, your magic number is greater than one, your tax payback is less than 12 months.\n\n(01:03:13):\nAll these things are super awesome. And finally, now you've got your gross margin above 80%. Your burn multiple's ideally less than one at this point, you've got less than 10% churn. You've got greater than 120% NRR. And so now the whole thing is like, \"Well, how do I keep growing?\" This thing's gotten pretty big. And this is generally when we get to 100 million, especially and beyond, the stage that founders are thinking about, \"How do I keep growing by expanding TAM, by expanding total addressable market?\" And to expand TAM, I can usually take my product and bring it into new markets, or I start to think about multiple products as a way to expand TAM.\n\n(01:03:55):\nAnd so this is where you see all the truly great companies, the legendary companies are all able to do that. Vanta has begun to do this. They have the Vanta trust management platform, they've got security questionnaires, they've got vendor risk management. So they're starting to do this. You think of Verkada, who I mentioned before. They started with cloud security cameras, now they do alarms, now they do smoke detectors, now they do badge readers. Stripe has classic Stripe, but they've got Stripe Radar, Stripe Atlas. Square has the Square Stand, Cash App, Square Checking, Square Loans. All the companies that are tens of billions of dollars of value have figured out a way to do this. And it's like the never-ending journey that you said before, Lenny. Like, \"Congrats, you got to level four.\"\n\n(01:04:40):\nBut there's just this endless thirst for continued growth. And the interesting thing about that is that it requires finding product-market fit over and over again. Just because you got to level four on your main product doesn't mean product-market fit is free on all these new products. And you've been inside Airbnb and I've been inside Dropbox and Twitter. Getting new products to be successful is hard and it requires this mindset of like, \"Yeah, we've got a little bit of advantage because people know who we are, and we have a customer set that hopefully we can layer on new products to. But it's not easy.\" You have to get into this mindset of product-market fit is never easy, and if we want to continue to grow, we got to find it again and again and maintain that mindset.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:22):\nCasey Winters has this great point also that expectations of customers ever increase. And so you have product-market fit today, but there's going to be better products coming out, they're changing, the world changes. And so not only do you have to worry about competitors, there's just expectations continue to rise. So it's a never-ending battle. To give people a little bit of a broader sense here, what percentage of companies do you find make it through each of these stages in your experience, what are rough numbers you may have in your head?\n\nTodd Jackson (01:05:52):\nThe majority of companies, so greater than 50%, probably closer to 60 or 70%, are going to get stuck at L1 or L2. And so that leaves, roughly, let's say, 30% make it to L3 or L4 just in our experience looking broadly. And that's our entire goal. Because again, once you get to L3, you've got a real shot, you've got a real shot at building an awesome company. And so if we get that number, help founders get that number above 30%, imagine if that was 50/50 and half the companies that we were working with at seed were able to get to level three strong product-market fit. I think that would be epic. And I think our founders would... There'd be incredible benefits to the ecosystem from that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:36):\nOkay. So essentially, 60% ish of companies don't make it past L2. And I love the way you're framing it of just, \"If we can just get a few more companies further, that makes a massive dent both in the world and the lives of founders and people that want to use products.\" Another question I wanted to talk about briefly is just again, the timelines of each of these levels. Just in your rough experience, how long do each of these levels roughly take so people can get a sense of like, \"Oh, it's taken a lot longer. Maybe there's a problem\"?\n\nTodd Jackson (01:07:10):\nSo again, this whole thing probably takes four to six years, and so let's just pick five years as the number to get to level four. I think the way this works, ideally, is you probably take 12 to 18 months to do level one, because that is the most important level, honestly, in my mind because that's where you're really choosing the right persona and the right problem to focus on. And I think just that choice is one of the most important choices that founders make. And the interesting thing, my partner, Josh Kopelman, talks about this all the time, is that founders spend 99% of their time building because that's what they've done.\n\n(01:07:53):\nAnd they spend 1% of their time picking, in picking the market, picking the problem, picking the customer. And in reality, it's that pick that determines the constraints and the boundaries of where you're going to be working for the next, hopefully, 10 years of your life. So there's a real imbalance there. And I actually think that that pick is the most important thing. So I would actually like to spend, let's say, somewhere 12 to 18 months in level one, just really figuring that out and figuring out my four Ps. And then, hopefully, I move very quickly. It takes me a while to get to my first five satisfied customers, but they love it.\n\n(01:08:28):\nAnd then I go quickly through L2, maybe that takes about a year. This is like the Looker path, the happy path. And then L3 is long just because we're going all the way from five million in revenue up to 25, and that might take a year or two, probably two years even in a good case. And then getting from 25 to 100 million is hard, obviously very hard. And then that probably takes a couple years. And then you're figuring out all of these things.\n\n(01:08:53):\nYou're growing your team and your company's got a lot more moving parts and functions, and there's a demand generation side of the house and sales and there's engineering and the whole thing just gets more complicated with a lot more people. But I think that if you set the foundation really nicely at level one and level two that hopefully the whole thing... The boulder is rolling down the hill and it's carrying you forward and you don't just feel like you're pushing this rock uphill for five years. That's not a fun place to be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:22):\nThere's a lot of founders in that place and I know a few, so this is really interesting. So you're roughly saying that maybe spend a year, year and a half on level one, which is you're just grinding, cold emailing, reaching out, selling customers, and maybe getting to five customers in the first year and a half. That's at the extreme, but that's a good outcome. And then maybe another year trying to get to... What was it? 20? 25 customers.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:09:45):\nGoing from five to 25 quickly. Yeah, if I see a company go from five customers to 25 in a year, that is almost always a sign that there's some pretty strong product-market fit there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:56):\nAwesome. So many companies don't go through that, and they have the funding to keep iterating, exploring, trying to figure things out. I don't know if you have the answer here, but just what's your advice of if it's been four years and demand is not starting to come to them, they don't have 25 customers? Is it, \"Wait until you run out of money, just give it a shot\"? Or is it, \"Let's just give the money back and move on to something else\"?\n\nTodd Jackson (01:10:21):\nWell, that's a personal decision for founders. I do think if you've been going at it for four to five years and you haven't started to find anything that you're really feeling pull from the market on, I don't know, you've done it for four to five years, what are the chances that you're going to magically find something? I think there are probably a handful of startups that do it that figure it out and get back on an amazing growth curve, but that's the exception rather than the rule.\n\n(01:10:46):\nSo if a founder wants to return the money to investors, if a founder wants to look for a soft landing, there's no shame in that. Product-market fit is very, very hard. That's why we're doing this. It's why we're trying to increase the odds. And we're also trying to make it clear what it looks like and what it doesn't look like. And everybody knows when they do a startup that the odds are that you will not get there. So there's no shame in that, and I would completely be supportive of any founder who wants to take that path.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:18):\nI love that advice. I think that was a really important point to make. Let's quickly summarize the levels and then I want to also summarize the four Ps again, because I think that's the thing you can actually do. And so I think I just want to reinforce, \"Here's the four things you should play with if things aren't going in the direction.\" So first of all, let's summarize the levels, what it looks like and what you should be focusing on there.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:11:38):\nOkay. So level one, nascent product-market fit. You're just trying to get three to five customers and you're focused on satisfaction first and foremost. Level two is developing. This is where you're going from five to 25 customers, and you're really starting to focus on demand. Level three is strong product-market fit. You're going from 25 customers up to 100 or more, and you've got to start thinking about efficiency at that scale. And then level four is extreme, you're more than 100 customers, your company's awesome. You got to keep doing all three of those things well, and you have to start looking for ways to expand your total addressable market.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:14):\nOkay, perfect. And then let's come back to the four Ps. I have the draft. I have your post up here, so I have the detailed version of each of these things. But could you just talk through these four things? What is it you should be thinking about changing if things aren't working, the four Ps basically?\n\nTodd Jackson (01:12:30):\nYeah. So the four Ps again are: persona, problem, promise, and product. And the persona is interesting because in some ways, it's synonymous with the market. A lot of people think of the market in this macroeconomic way where it's like, \"Oh, it's this category of ERP software or whatever.\" I think it's much more tangible for a founder to think of the market as a collection of people. Jack Altman was thinking about his market as all of the HR leaders out there, and he was thinking about how many of them are there and what are the problems they have and how much money are they willing to spend on solving those problems.\n\n(01:13:12):\nIt's a collection of people who have money to pay for a product or pay for a service. And so that's really the first piece, find the persona and really try to get into the mind of the persona. That's another thing I was amazed about spending time with Zach from Plaid, and Lloyd from Looker, and Jack from Lattice. They had all of these people, they were text messaging with all of their customers and they're meeting them on the weekends and stuff. They really, really knew their customer well. They were friends with their customers.\n\n(01:13:45):\nAnd so you've got to get so deep into the mind of the persona and: what are their challenges? What are their goals? How do you help them succeed at their job? That's the stuff that earns you the right to get the rest of the Ps right. And so the problem, obviously, comes next. And I think about this, and I can actually get into, Lenny, a little bit if you want to get into some of the customer discovery stuff because that's the second session.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:13):\nPerfect segue.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:14:14):\nAnd I was talking a little bit about we think of it as dollar-driven customer discovery. And I think a lot of founders are familiar with customer discovery. I think they at least talk to customers, which is good. I don't think most of them do it in the highest signal way because again, the customers, they're people, they're nice, they're going to be polite. They're also not good at predicting things that they will use or buy or want.\n\n(01:14:41):\nThey're very good at talking about their problems, but they're not necessarily good at predicting their own behavior. So we think about it in terms of dollar-driven discovery, which is how do you test the dollar potential of a hypothesis? And this is a whole two-hour session, but I'll try to do it briefly here just to give you a sense of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:00):\nNo, let's get into it. Let's keep going. I'm just joking.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:15:02):\nSo you've got to identify extreme value. This is independent of what I'm building, Lenny. I want to hear about your problems and your challenges and what is most important to you. And so I need to do it in this non-leading way and I need to avoid the trap that we call happy years. Because I found a lot of founders, \"I want to build this thing, I want you to like my thing.\" And so I look for the things that you say that support what I'm doing. That's the trap. And so I could just try it on you, Lenny. Yeah, I might say...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:35):\nLet's do it.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:15:36):\nOkay, Lenny, so you're doing Lenny's Newsletter and you're building Lenny's Podcasts. When you think about we're sitting here in April, over the next three months, let's say, what are your top three goals for Lenny's Newsletter and Lenny's Podcast?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:53):\nOh, wow, interesting. I'm trying to find a more scalable way to do this newsletter long-term. It's basically something I have to do for the rest of my life, in theory. I don't know if there's an exit path for this newsletter career, so I'm trying to find ways to scale this over time. That's one. Two is just up-leveling the quality of each podcast episode in terms of visuals and audio and trailers and things like that. And then three is make the community more valuable to everyone that listens that's in the newsletter community. Those are top of mind.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:16:26):\nOkay, awesome. And so what's hard about those three things? You said you want to scale the newsletter, you want to increase quality, you want to make the community awesome. What's hard about those things? Or what's standing in your way of doing those?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:39):\nI don't have the answer yet, I guess is the answer. I don't know exactly how to do this yet.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:16:44):\nYou don't know how to do it. Okay. It's probably a service in this case, not a product. What if I was able to give you a service that said, \"Lenny, you're going to be able to scale this podcast. We are going to help you find the 500 best guests in the world that are really excellent. We're going to guarantee they show up. You're going to have endless content on your podcast, in your newsletter\"? What do you think about that? What do you think about that idea?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:16):\nI'd pay a lot of money for that.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:17:18):\nOkay. So that's an example of a wow statement. And you probably had in the back of your mind, \"How are you going to do that? Is that actually going to work?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:27):\nThat's right.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:17:28):\nIn my experience, that's a good thing and an exciting thing. If I'm pitching a product idea to somebody and they are like, \"Wow, does that really work? And if that thing works, I'd sign up for the wait list today.\" That to me is like, \"Okay, now I got to figure out how to build that thing, but I know if I am able to build it and deliver on that promise, they are going to want it.\" Or you would maybe say signs like you would demonstrate a behavior that shows that you're interested in. You'd be like, \"Oh, Todd, can we meet again next week to talk about this?\" Or like, \"Hey Todd, I actually would love to show this to the people I work with. Can you send me the deck?\"\n\n(01:18:06):\nThose are the signs that I'm looking for. If you had reacted like, \"Yeah, that sounds kind of interesting,\" that's a no, right? That is a no. The word interesting is a polite way of saying no, right? And so I'm either looking for wow statements or I'm looking for demonstrated behavior that shows interest. I then would probably, if I want to keep going with this, and this is all in the identifying extreme value, I'd ask you, \"Well, what stands out as valuable here to you?\" And I want to hear you answer quickly. You mentioned it's either going to make my products so much better, it's going to drive success for my business, or it's going to save me a bunch of money or something. Save me a bunch of risk.\" But something where you would very quickly be able to identify why that's valuable to you.\n\n(01:18:51):\nSo that part one is extreme value. Then I got to figure out ability to pay and willingness to pay. And for you, this is easy because you're not a 5,000 person company and you're the boss. So this is probably pretty streamlined. There's no procurement function at Lenny's Newsletter. So let's say I'm going after a bigger company. The questions I'd ask on confirming the ability to pay are: are you currently looking for a product like this? Or are you building something internally?\n\n(01:19:24):\nThis is the Ironclad thing where Jason was like, \"Oh, you're looking for a CLM already.\" Another way I think about it is if a customer has a problem, and I really think they have a problem, and they know they have the problem and they're looking for a solution for the problem. Or they've even tried to build their own solution to it and failed, that's the best customer. They want this thing badly. They've demonstrated that and they've actually failed at building it because they underestimated how hard it was. So are you currently looking for building a solution here?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:57):\nEssentially, there's a budget. You're looking for, \"Is there money to go towards this problem\"?\n\nTodd Jackson (01:20:01):\nThat's the next question I was going to say is where would a budget for this come from? And the best answer is that there's an existing budget. Either we already spend money in some way for a competing tool, or something that can be displaced by you, or we're spending, we put five engineers together to help build this thing. There's some source of budget that I can get. Then the question is, \"Well, how does your team make decisions on third-party tools to bring on?\" And you're never going to get the cleanest answer here. In larger companies, you might get semi-clean answers, but it's something like, \"Okay, this manager can approve it directly up to a certain dollar amount. If not, it goes to this next level up of manager. And if we're going to spend more than 50K on it, we actually have to compare three different alternatives.\"\n\n(01:20:47):\nBut whatever, there's some known process. That's what I'm looking for rather than just a bunch of ambiguity. So that's ability to pay. And then I'm going into willingness to pay. I don't want to try to quantify that. That's where I go, \"What's your budget for solving this? What are you paying for this other tool? Let me show you mine. You think that you'd pay less for that or you'd pay more for that? Can you replace this other thing with the thing I have?\" And then I love this question. I think you've had Madhavan Ramanujam on the show, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:16):\nMm-hmm.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:21:17):\nHe has this question, he's from Simon-Kucher. I love his thing of like, \"Lenny, what is a fair price you would pay for this thing that I just described to you?\" And then you say your thing. And then I go, \"Okay. Well, what would be an expensive price?\" And then I say, \"Okay, what would be a prohibitively expensive price?\" And you ask those three questions. And generally, when people tell you the fair price, it's a little bit of like they're trying to get a deal. And if the product's good, the expensive price is the one that they would actually pay.\n\n(01:21:47):\nWhere they're saying it feels expensive, but you put it in front of them, and you say, \"It costs this much,\" and if it's really good, they want it. And the prohibitively expensive one is the one that's too expensive and they'd have to just, \"I just can't do that.\" So I love these style of questions. I think they're just a lot more specific than what I see most founders doing, which is just chatting with customers. You really want to try to put them to some questions where you know they're going to answer honestly because you're asking them questions. You're not asking them to speculate and you're asking them fairly concrete stuff.\n\n(01:22:18):\nOh, and the thing I should say is it's a two-hour session, like I mentioned. It's one thing to explain this stuff, but it's another thing to see it. And so we show tons of Zoom recordings from founders who have gone through the program, and we actually do this thing where all the founders who are going through the program, they recorded all their videos, their customer discovery videos, and then our team watches all of the videos and creates highlight reels.\n\n(01:22:45):\nAnd we sit around in a room and watch them together and we say like, \"Oh, look at these questions that Lenny asked. And did you see how the customer responded? Wow, that's an eyes-light-up moment.\" Or, \"Todd asked these questions, he's leading the witness a little bit and the customer didn't seem that interested.\" So the thing that's interesting is as a founder, you never see anybody else's version of this. You only have your own experience. And so just seeing how other founders do this in a real live setting is super. People love it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:13):\nAnd it's always easy to hear these things. It's much harder to be the person asking these questions to a potential customer you're trying to sell. And it's just asking, \"How much would you pay for this?\" So I love that you kind of force people through the actual practice of it. Todd, you're going to get a lot of applicants for this program. This sounds amazing. I know you're giving a peek at the stuff that we haven't really talked about. On this point you just shared, which is essentially trying to get real skin in the game insight into how big of a problem this is, I love that you just basically shared a bunch of questions.\n\n(01:23:43):\nSomeone could just rewind right now and just write down all these questions that you shared and use them when you're talking to customers. Obviously, the classic problem is they tell you they're going to buy it but they don't. And all the stuff you shared is, \"Here's ways to get at: will they actually buy it before they have the actual product?\" Is there anything else you want to say on that? Just tips for not being tricked and people just saying, \"Oh, yeah, I love this thing\"? I know you talked through a lot of this, but anything else?\n\nTodd Jackson (01:24:06):\nYeah, I think there's a couple of things. One is you have to know what to show people when you're actually showing them something. Lattice is the kind of product I mentioned that could be sold with Figma mock-ups. Looker couldn't be sold that way. Looker, you actually had to do a demo with their real data. So it required a lot more work to do that. Vanta was neither like a demo or a mock-up, it was actually doing the work. And Pilot was like that. There's a bunch of companies like that. So you have to figure out what is my product and how does it solve the problem? And therefore, what fidelity does my early product or early demo have to be at in order to land the sale?\n\n(01:24:44):\nAnd then I think you have to know when you've talked to enough people. It takes time to talk to people. And the rule of thumb is if you talk to enough people and you can predict 70 to 80% of what the next person is going to say to you, because you've just talked to so many people and you've heard the pattern so clearly, that's when you've talked to enough people. But these are all things you got to learn. And that's why doing it experientially in the way that we do the program we think was best.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:10):\nIs there anything that we haven't covered that you wanted to touch on before we let you go?\n\nTodd Jackson (01:25:15):\nNo. If you're listening, if you're a B2B founder in those early days of starting your company, or you know anyone who fits that description, and you have an appreciation for just how hard it is to find product-market fit and you don't want to go it alone, then please apply to this program or share the application. Like we promise, we will review every single application. And I'm just really looking forward to working with a group of 20 or so amazing founders, and helping them navigate these early days of product-market fit finding. It's what I love to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:43):\nSo just to make sure the right people apply, remind people who is a great fit. So it's B2B founders, and you said they've been at it for six to nine months, something like that?\n\nTodd Jackson (01:25:52):\nYeah, something in that zone or earlier. You have an idea of what your product is. You have a hypothesis about what it is and who it's for, but you probably haven't started writing any code yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:01):\nAnd if they've been at it for four years and haven't found success, this is not a fit.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:26:07):\nI could try to help them one-on-one, but no, that's not a fit for this program.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:10):\nAnd then how do they apply and when are their applications due?\n\nTodd Jackson (01:26:13):\nYeah. So you go to pmf.firstround.com. Applications are open. They're going to go till May 7th, and then the program starts on May 29th. And if you want to reach out to me specifically, you can find me on Twitter. I'm @tjack, T-J-A-C-K. You can follow me, DM me. And yeah, I'm looking forward to working with some amazing founders that I know are listening right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:34):\nAmazing. I'm so happy we did this. I feel like this conversation is going to help a ton of founders, and they're going to come back to it again and again. Todd, thank you so much for being here.\n\nTodd Jackson (01:26:43):\nLenny, it's been a pleasure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:44):\nIt's been my pleasure. Bye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
