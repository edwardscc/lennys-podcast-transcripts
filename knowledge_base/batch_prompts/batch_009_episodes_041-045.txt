You guys are generating $2.3 billion in ARR and you're profitable. You're also growing 60% year over year and it's accelerating.\n\nCameron Adams (00:00:12):\nI run everyone through the culture of Canva. One of those sections is on giving away your Lego, finding joy in the other things of building a team, passing on your experience, helping other people do great writing or great product building or great engineering.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):\nWhen is this coaching concept? I've never heard of this.\n\nCameron Adams (00:00:27):\nWe don't really have managers, but everyone at Canva has a coach. They're constantly working with you to look at your skills, but also when it might be time to move on to the next level.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):\nI'm curious just how you think about product management.\n\nCameron Adams (00:00:39):\nI didn't want to do product management like they did at Google, and that's because of the different cultures. I have seen product managers at other companies who are very independent of teams and that seems very weird to me. For us, product managers are really connected.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):\nIt feels like Canva has just been this non-stop up into the right all win, all success. In reality, that's never actually the case.\n\nCameron Adams (00:00:56):\nHow many failure stories do you want? We got plenty.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):\nToday, my guest is Cameron Adams. Cameron is the co-founder and chief product officer at Canva, which is a truly incredible business and company. At the top of the episode, I share a bunch of stats. They'll probably surprise you about the scale that Canva has reached these days.\n\n(00:01:19):\nIn our conversation, we cover a ton of ground including how Canva stays product obsessed, their freemium strategy, lessons about building MVPs, how Cam and the product team think about AI within their product, also peek into their unique team culture, their SEO and growth strategy, and also peek into some of the stuff they just launched.\n\n(00:01:37):\nThis episode is for anyone building or growing a product or company, and I guarantee by the end of this conversation, you'll be as blown away with Canva as I am. With that, I bring you Cameron Adams. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.\n\n(00:02:01):\nCameron, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nCameron Adams (00:02:04):\nIt is so great to be here, Lenny. I'm very excited.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:07):\nI'm even more excited. I have at least a billion questions for you. I'm hoping I get through at least half a billion. There's so much I want to talk to you about, but I want to start with a warm and fuzzy question. Do you ever just take a moment to reflect on the insane success of this business that you've built? And before you answer that, I'm going to share some stats about Canva that I think are going to blow people's minds. So think about the answer.\n\n(00:02:30):\nSo I was researching Canva, all of this was just... I didn't know any of this actually, and I think it'll surprise a lot of people just the scale that Canva has reached at this point. Okay. So Canva is bigger than Figma and Miro and Webflow combined both in terms of valuation and in terms of revenue. You guys are generating $2.3 billion in ARR per year and you're profitable. You've been profitable for about seven years at this point. You're also growing 60% year over year and it's accelerating, faster than last year. I think this is all quite unheard of at this scale. Do you ever just reflect back on this and, like, \"Okay, I've done well.\"?\n\nCameron Adams (00:03:11):\nWhen you say it all like that, it sounds pretty amazing. I don't think every day you're cognizant of that growth and that achievement, but there are particular moments where you get to really reflect, and for me, it's most of the time when we bring the team together. Obviously now we're in a pretty virtual world, hybrid in some best cases. But when the team all get together and we celebrate is when we finally have those moments where you get to step out of yourself, look at this huge sea of people and realize what you've achieved together.\n\n(00:03:48):\nProbably the most recent moment we got to do that was for our 10th birthday last year. So Canva is largely centered in Australia. We've got lots of offices around the world, but we had a big birthday celebration in Sydney right on the harbor there in front of the water and we had thousands of people there, and we just got to look back on everything we've achieved over the previous 10 years, and that was the pretty amazing moment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:11):\nWhat about just personally, you basically went from a designer on Google Wave to a co-founder of one of the most generational successful startups in the past decade. How does that feel?\n\nCameron Adams (00:04:24):\nI still think I'm constantly growing, I'm constantly learning stuff. I don't feel like I've achieved a ceiling or being a massive smash hit. We're always changing how we're doing things. We're always doing things we've never done before and we feel totally like a fish out of water. So yeah, I've achieved a few things personally, but I still feel like there's so much more to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:50):\nThat sounds right. I want to talk about the flip side from the outside, like I described, it feels like Canva has just been this non-stop up into the right all win, all success, just killing it all the time. In reality, that's never actually the case. It's often really helpful for people to hear a story of, okay, there's actually this moment of this may be all falling apart or a struggle for yourself. Is there a moment that comes to mind of just like, \"Oh, man, this was really scary and hard for me.\"?\n\nCameron Adams (00:05:17):\nI think there's probably a few different stories that would resonate with your audience because there's like business kind of stories of how the actual company's tracking. There's product stories of stuff we launched that didn't go anywhere. There's team stories where you're dealing with people and all the different quirks that entails. I think I'll choose a business story. There was a moment around our 100 million valuation mark where we were putting together around... We had a lot of existing investors who were really keen to invest. This is probably our third or our fourth round by this stage, and it was all looking good. There was a particular investor who was really to lead out. We were fine with that. They were doing due diligence, got to the stage where every other investor in the round had signed on. They were super excited. They'd wired the money into our bank accounts already. They'd signed all the long docs but lead investor.\n\n(00:06:15):\nAnd about two days before they were due to sign and get all the money into our account, they came back and said, \"Look, business is going great, but essentially we think we can get a better deal, so we're going to cut your valuation by 50%.\" It was a huge surprise and totally screwed up the entire round. All the other investors were like, \"What the hell are you doing?\" My co-founders, Mel and Cliff, pretty much jumped on a plane that night to go to Silicon Valley, rallied around a whole bunch of other investors, found a new lead investor, took them about a week. This was the week right before Christmas. It was incredibly stressful, incredibly tumultuous.\n\n(00:07:05):\nWe eventually came out of it better. We actually got better terms on the deal that we came up with. That investor has fallen to the wayside now and it was a real learning moment for us in terms of how to approach fundraising and also how to be totally independent, and that's one of the reasons why we've focused on profitability for so long now. We've been profitable to spend the seven years and one of the reasons is that we never want to be put in the situation where we have to go to someone for money to ensure the survival of the business, and being profitable means that we never have to do that. We can always do it on our own terms and in our own time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:49):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS.

That's A-T-T-I-O.com/lenny.\n\n(00:10:01):\nSomething that I've heard from one of your investors actually will not be named is that at your board meetings, you have one slide on the financials of the business and then the rest of the deck is product updates, the roadmap. I think this is very rare, especially for companies at your stage that become really focused on financials in the business from the CFO perspective and a lot of founders lose sight of the product. Can you just talk about this element of how you all think about the product that's so central to the business?\n\nCameron Adams (00:10:32):\nI think one key thing is that we don't know it's very rare. We approach a board meeting just like we do anything, we craft the experience about how we think it should be and how we think it's going to be useful. So just like our board meetings or our product meetings or the way that we do launches, we have shaped that in the image that we want it to be and in the way that we think it's going to be most effective. We've always been an incredibly product-led company. We always think first and foremost about the product. That was the whole genesis of Canva itself, having a product that we thought people would love to use and desperately needed to get out into the world and that's the lens that we approach everything through.\n\n(00:11:13):\nIn terms of board meetings, I think it's been very helpful that our financials and our growth have been amazing for so many years that we don't need to focus on it and we can just have that one slide with the graph going up and to the right. We've also attracted investors who believe in us and who understand that us driving product and getting as much product value out to our customers is probably the most important thing we can be doing. So that's why the board meetings do focus on that because what we are launching in the product, what's ahead is really determining the success of the company. Obviously, financials are important and you can do a bunch of lever pulling and thinking about margins and all that kind of stuff, but product is at the end of the day the most important thing to Canva and the thing that's going to help us stand out and continue to have success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:02):\nI really like this point you made about how you didn't know any better almost, and it reminds me of something else I heard about Canva. It took you guys a long time to hire outside execs. Almost all your leaders are homegrown and it took you a long time to even hire outside of Australia. Its even higher in the US. Can you just talk about why that's been so important and just the impact that has come out of hiring people internally and helping people be promoted internally?\n\nCameron Adams (00:12:26):\nOne thing really focused on is team and culture. I think you can probably bring in the world's best person at X, Y, and Z, but if they're not fitting into your team and understanding your culture and have the same passion and vision that you do, they're not going to succeed. So it's super important that we have people along with us for the ride and that might mean everyone at Canva is awesome. They mightn't be the number one person in the world for that particular thing, but they get more done than the number one person could because they've built that trust and that safety with their team. They know how to communicate their ideas, they know how to bring other people along with them and lay out a vision in the way that we understand it at Canva, and that is a critical thing to building a great company, I think, is having that alignment across everyone, across your product teams, across your marketing teams, across your customer happiness.\n\n(00:13:21):\nThey all need to be aligned and we all need to be rowing in the same direction. We have brought in leaders, and some of them have been incredibly successful. We have brought in leaders, and they've exited the company after a few months just because there wasn't that fit and they didn't manage to figure out or understand what Canva was and how to work within this big ecosystem. Now we've got 4,500 employees now and it's not just a matter of you coming in and bringing all your ideas. You also need to work together with all the other leaders that we have and the team that's surrounding you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:56):\nAs a lens into what is important. Canva, when you say that they didn't understand what Canva is, what's something that doesn't click for people a lot of times that forces them to be exited potentially? What is it that's so maybe unique or important to the way you all think about stuff?\n\nCameron Adams (00:14:12):\nI have this theory that the type of product you're building very much influences the way that you think, and this stemmed out of a chat I was having with one of the product leaders at Spotify. And they said that at Spotify they do an incredible amount of talking about problems. They'll have a meeting, they'll talk about this new product feature and they'll just hash it out through conversation. And I imagined that that was because Spotify is a very auditory product. Everyone there thinks about music, sound, podcasts, that is their mindset. At Canva, we're all about visual communications. It's pitch decks, it's social media posts, it's video, it's t-shirts that you can make, and that's how we think about things in a very visual manner.\n\n(00:15:01):\nSo one of the things that's very particular about Canva is really setting visions. And I'm in visions, not just in the sense of looking forward two, three years, but also visions in the very visual sense. We need to be able to see it. We need mock-ups. We need prototypes. You need to get that idea out of your head and present it to someone in a visual form that helps you talk about and communicate about it. That's one aspect of why some people I think don't land on their feet at Canva because they aren't necessarily visual thinkers and they don't end up communicating what they want to do in a visual way to the rest of people at Canva.\n\n(00:15:38):\nAnother way is that the way that we've grown, the way that we've built product has been quite idiosyncratic over the years. And as I said, we've learned so much just through doing and established our own processes. And I think in any system, if someone comes up from the outside with preconceived notions or this idea that they're an expert and tries to bring that in, it's going to be rejected. So you really need to work together and I think the advice that I can give to people coming to Canva is just listen for a couple of months, figure out what is really working at Canva and why it works before you try and change it. We're very open to change and to new ideas, but just coming in wholesale and totally changing the process, just because that's what you've done somewhere else isn't going to get you the most level of success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:31):\nThat makes so much sense. We're talking about cultural elements and so I have one more question around culture. I saw a video interview you did once about how you love this concept of giving away your Legos, that's part of your culture and the culture at Canva broadly potentially, and this was originally popularized by Molly Graham in this first round review article. That's something you still believe in and if so, can you just describe that concept briefly because a lot of people haven't actually heard about this?\n\nCameron Adams (00:17:00):\nYeah, Molly wrote a great article, which I actually refer everyone who joins Canva to in the cultural onboarding session, which I give them. So I run everyone through the culture at Canva and what they can expect over the next few years as they work here, and one of those sections is on giving away your Lego, and it's really important to us because part of being in a startup is scaling, when you're scaling from zero users to a million to a hundred million, and when you're scaling from three founders to 10 employees to 100 employees to 4,000 employees. You're scaling everything from the product to the internal processes you have, the finance team paying people how you deal with user feedback. Everything's just constantly growing, growing, growing. And I think this is slightly different to a traditional job where you get good at the thing that you always do and you try and turn that into a process that just continually works all the time.\n\n(00:17:58):\nAs a startup, you just have to be changing and we want people who are flexible, you can bring new ideas, you can go to that next level. You can think about not just a million people, but 10 million people, 100 million people, a billion people using the product, and to constantly ratchet up that multiplier, you need to change yourself, which means that you probably need to give away some of the stuff that you're doing now in order to get to that next level. If you're the first email copywriter at Canva, you can get away from writing all the emails for the first year maybe, but when you're writing emails for 100 million people in 190 different countries, in 100 different languages, all at different stages of their journey through using Canva from beginners to intermediates to experts, that just massively multiplies the complexity of the job that you have to do. And if you're trying to write every single one of those emails, you have no chance of scaling.\n\n(00:18:56):\nSo you need to think about who you're going to bring in to help you, what systems you're going to introduce, what are the processes needed to get 100 different languages translated every time you send out an email and that requires you to hand off that stuff. You need to maybe stop writing every single email, give that to someone else, be comfortable with doing that because you often build up a lot of self-identity and doing that and you get a lot of joy out of it. That's why you're a writer in the first place. But finding joy in the other things of building a team, passing on your experience, helping other people do great writing or great product building or great engineering is really what giving away your Lego is about. And we still encourage everyone to do that, to think about those moments where they need to level up in their impact, how they can bring their team along with them, how they can pass on their experience and help everyone really have a tremendous impact with the skills that they have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:51):\nI think a lot of people and a lot of companies struggle with this idea, and I'm curious if there's something you've learned about how to actually implement this. Is it just like, \"Hey, go read this article and then I might bring it up sometimes when things are changing and there's a reorg.\"? Or is there anything even deeper of just this is a cultural element of we are constantly giving up our Lego's giving things that we own?\n\nCameron Adams (00:20:10):\nProbably the deeper thing I think is giving people opportunity so you can talk about growth than just say, \"Please grow.\" That's not going to be terribly effective, but giving them the opportunity and the support to do so is super important. We have a system we call coaching at Canva where you have a coach and they're constantly working with you to look at your skills, how you can improve each of those individual skills, but also what it is that you're actually doing and when it might be the time to move on to the next level. Say you are just doing a product role in this particular product and now you need to be a coach of other product managers and help build products. Understanding those pivot points is really important and our coaches help everyone at Canva. Everyone at Canva has a coach that is constantly thinking about this aspect of their personal growth.\n\n(00:21:00):\nAnd finding those opportunities where you can push someone to do something that they haven't done before or to expand upon an idea that they've had and give them ownership of that idea is super important. So when people do come to us with an amazing product idea or a feature that they want to build or an entire team that they think should be spun up, we really listen to them, and if it makes sense, we say, \"Go and do that. Go and build that part of the product, grab a couple of people and start building video at Canva. Do that thing that you're talking about.\" And I think if you give them the opportunity and a little push to go beyond what they think they're comfortable with right now, that is the best way to drive growth in your team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:44):\nOkay. There's two things I want to follow up on there. One is this coaching concept. I've never heard of this. So how does that work? Do they have a manager and they have coach, and who is this coach?\n\nCameron Adams (00:21:54):\nWe don't really have managers. So your coach is the person who thinks about you in a specialty sense. So we have specialties, engineering, product design, we got tens of different specialties across Canva, and your coach really helps.. Your coach is a similar specialty leads, so if you're a product manager, they're a product manager, so they know the skills that you have to use. They know the trajectory that you could possibly grow into. They know the structures that are around Canva that you could slot into when you want to go to the next level. And your coach constantly checks in with you, has sessions, might help you with the strategy doc, might have a one-on-one with you. They just constantly thinking about those ways that you can grow and improve at Canva.\n\n(00:22:42):\nAnd then we have probably more of a, I would say, collegiate managerial circle of colleagues who help you who do 360 feedback, all that kind of stuff. So that's the structure that we've arrived on and it's worked pretty well for us and it was driven actually by a formative coaching experience that we had as founders quite a few years ago from an external coach and we decided to bring that into Canva as a whole philosophy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:10):\nAnd these coaches, are they professional coaches or they're people in the company that are like, \"I will be a coach for this function.\"?\n\nCameron Adams (00:23:15):\nThey're people in the company. So we've got probably close to 800 or 1,000 coaches now at Canva.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:22):\nWow.\n\nCameron Adams (00:23:23):\nWe do have very specific coaches who are just coaches and they can drop into any situation. They're not product managers, they're not designers, but they're relatively few. I think, we've got probably five of those type of coaches and they just work in very special situations, but what we're focused on is enabling the broader circle of coaches, so those 800 people to understand what it is to be a coach and have the skills of coaching. So we focus a lot on teaching them the skills of coaching, how to build a growth mindset in their coaches, all the skills that you need. So yeah, it's a massive part of Canva.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:02):\nAnd so there's a product management coach and this person helps all the PMs become better at the craft of product management.\n\nCameron Adams (00:24:09):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):\nWow, so interesting. Okay, and then the performance review piece, how does that work?\n\nCameron Adams (00:24:13):\nYeah. So your coach feeds into that, but we also do 360 feedback from all the people that you work with and we do that on regular cycles. As with everything at Canva, the cadence of those cycles has changed over the years, but now we do that every six months.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:29):\nWe talked about product for a little bit. I want to spend a little time on product management. I'm curious just how you think about product management. There's this constant debate across tech companies about the value of PMs. Are we better with more PMs? Are there too many PMs? What do PMs do for you? You're a chief product officer. Where do you find product managers bring the most value to Canva? And then do you just have thought on the future of the field of product management?\n\nCameron Adams (00:24:54):\nI don't know. It's one of those things that I don't want to quantify. I don't want to put it in a box and say this is product management. Because I've worked at a few places now. I've actually only had one real job, which was at Google where I got to experience product managers the Google way. And the way that they do product management is totally different to the way that we do it at Canva, and that's partially by design because I didn't want to do product management like they did at Google, and that's because of the different cultures that they have. Google's a fantastically engineering-driven culture and the way that they think about product management is mostly in the technical sense of like, \"Here's a piece of technology, what can that technology do, how do we scale it?\" At Canva, we focus a lot on experience and as I said before, it's a very visual experience, so we require a different product management process, but also a different product management mindset.\n\n(00:25:51):\nI think we probably did that more from the ground up than a lot of other startups just because Mel and Cliff were a lot less, I think, inculcated into how product management has done other places. I had a bit of experience from Google but was still fairly independent in my thinking, so we almost went back to first principles on how product management should be done, and to be honest, we didn't want to have the term product manager for a long, long time. It wasn't until about year '06 or '07 where we actually had product managers, we decided to cave just because it was easier to explain to people.\n\n(00:26:30):\nBut it also took us four or five years before we even had another product owner who wasn't us. Part of that was us giving up our Lego, and I think we took a little too long to give up our Lego on that one, but the other part of it was us figuring out exactly what we wanted and how we built product and how to communicate that to someone else and get them to do it in a similar way and work with the teams in the way that we did.\n\n(00:27:00):\nFor us, product managers are really connectives. They connect the team, ideas, data, a whole bunch of different things, and it's very messy. There's no exact recipe for how to do it, but connecting these disparate areas and moving the team and the technology and our customers to a new place, a new vision is essentially what product managers do, and it's going to involve compromise, it's going to involve changes in the feature scope, it's going to involve timelines of like, \"Okay, we can't ship it in May, it's going to have to be July. Let's figure out what we can do with marketing to make that work.\" This constant movement and connection and reorienting around the constraints that have suddenly arisen in the last week, and that's where we see great product managers operating in Canva.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:56):\nYou mentioned Mel and Cliff. For folks that don't know, they're the other two co-founders of Canva and they were dating when they were starting Canva, I think it was called Fusion Books back in the day before Canva. Now, they're married. What's it like working with a married couple as the other two co-founders, and is there something they did well that didn't make you feel like this third wheel person that isn't married to them?\n\nCameron Adams (00:28:22):\nIt is always tricky working with a couple because they're on it 24/7. When you leave the office and they head home, they're still talking about product, business strategy, all the things. I think they've done a really good job of evolving those ideas overnight through the conversations they have and over dinner and walking, but then bringing that back the next day and being transparent about that and that's super important. If you are working in that kind of dynamic. There are definitely moments where I have missed out on a memo and stuff has rapidly proceeded, and I think I've just gotten used to that and gotten used to catching up really quickly, having a word with them on the side to clarify what the motivation is here and just constantly maintaining that alignment.\n\n(00:29:11):\nAnd I think it happens in any partnership or team. There's moments where there's small alignments, there's more tectonic stuff that happens over months or years, and you need to realign at some stage. I think it happens with friendships, it happens with my wife, it happens with our product teams. There's always these moments where you need to re-communicate things and relay the land of it. And I think we've been great at doing that as co-founders even for the small things and also for the more tectonic things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

I know that it took you guys a year of building before you launched it, so it took you a year to build the MVP essentially. And I know you have some strong opinions on how long to wait, how MVPs are often way too early. Can you talk about that just why you guys waited so long before launching clearly worked out and so I'm just curious your lessons from that experience.\n\nCameron Adams (00:30:59):\nYeah, so when we launched or when we were building the Lean Startup book came out, so that was all anyone talked to us about investors, other people building products, trying to give us advice. They were like, \"Just get something out the door, as crappy as it is just to get in front of users.\" I think, for us, the product is the experience and giving people a great experience is an intrinsic part of the product. It's also an intrinsic part of how we've grown. People having a good experience of being enthusiastic about it has been how we've spread the word of Canva and organic word-of-mouth growth was the biggest driver of Canva's growth for many years and probably still is, I think. People just telling someone else to jump on this amazing product, I don't think we would've had that if we just put our pretty crappy product that people didn't have joy in using. Sure, it might've got the job done, but if they weren't excited about using it the next day, then that wasn't a bar that we wanted to hit.\n\n(00:32:08):\nSo we did hold off on launching the product for a long time and investors did ask us many, many times, \"When are you launching? Can you just get this thing out the door?\" But we had done enough research, we knew the problem space, we knew what people wanted from the product. Part of that was due to the work that Mel and Cliff did on Fusion Books in a very constrained area. They had looked at school yearbooks, they had built an experience for that, and they had observed what worked didn't work and how they might scale that into a bigger product. It also worked for me who'd worked in a lot of creative tools and built a lot of creative tools over the previous 15 years. So I had a lot of understanding of how people interacted with these systems and the experience that we wanted to build.\n\n(00:32:57):\nSo we did hold off and the product we launched launched, we obviously weren't happy with. You have to launch something that you're not completely happy with, all the rough edges, but you're releasing it knowing that the rough edges are going to be outweighed by the joyful experience. We still did a ton of user testing, right? It's not like we just launched this thing blind and said, \"We hope people like it.\" We did a ton of user testing. We did a ton of user research into the features that people wanted, and we built that up over time. And one year to me actually seems like short time, a lot of people think it's a long time, but one year was just enough for us to scrape in with an experience that people did truly love when we launched, and particularly the market that we went after when we launched really loved it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:49):\nI'm curious just what advice you share with founders when they're asking you how joyous does this first version have to be? How awesome does my MVP need to be? One thread I picked up as you were describing your experiences, you all had deep experience in this space, so you knew what you wanted to build. It wasn't like this dark forest of exploration is like we know what we want generally. Do you have advice you share with founders of how awesome their MVP should be and when it's worth spending a year or two or three building it?\n\nCameron Adams (00:34:20):\nThere's a couple of points in there. First is that even today we build for ourselves, and I think this is advice that probably a lot of product people wouldn't give you is that you shouldn't build for yourself, you should build for your customer. But I think we're fortunate that we are our customer and that the problems we experience are the problems that hundreds of millions, billions of people experience. I think that is maybe a fortunate part of just the problem area that we're interested in, but it has enabled us to move really quickly on the product because we can quickly know what's working in the product, whether this feature is useful, whether it's reached that bar of a great experience.\n\n(00:35:03):\nSo that's one aspect of it and I think that is also about being passionate, you entering an area that you are extremely passionate about. I often hear people are like, \"I want to do a tech startup. What is the best area I should focus on to build a product in?\" And to me, that is totally the wrong way to go about building a company that you're going to spend the next 10, 20 years in because if you're in an area that you are particularly passionate about but you see the opportunity to make a bit of money or have some external measure of success, that is a terrible way to go about being a founder because you're going to hit these rock bottom dark places and if the passion isn't driving you through that, you're going to have an incredibly hard time getting to the next step. So that's probably the first area I talk about in terms of knowing when a product is amazing.\n\n(00:35:58):\nThe second one is that it really needs to spark, joy, and delight in people and just pure excitement. It can't just be like, \"Oh, yeah, this is a useful tool for me.\" It needs to light up their eyes. They need to be like, \"How do I sign up for this thing tomorrow? How do I get it? How do I pay for it?\" And they need to want to talk to other people about it because in the early days of your startup, you don't have marketing dollars, you don't have channels which you can go to immediately get access to a million people. You need to really foster the first people that are going to use your product and they're going to be the ones that are going to spread it and they're going to set the foundations for your growth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:41):\nInteresting. So piece of advice number one is work on something you really want yourself that you're excited to work on. Two is get it to a place where it lights up people's eyes. They're just so excited with this thing. For that second bar, what was it for Canva? Was it just that it was impossible to do this design in a browser?\n\nCameron Adams (00:37:00):\nIt was 2012, 2013 when we launched and visual content was still in its infancy. Instagram had only been out a couple of years. Pinterest was on the rise. People were just getting used to creating visuals and it was hived off to a very select few because to create those visuals you needed to afford some expensive software, know how to use that expensive software, nowhere to go to get fonts and photos and illustrations, know how to put that together into something that looked decent and then ship that off. It was something that only 1% of the world could do and democratizing design, empowering the world to design is Canva's entire mission, and we saw this sweet spot at the time in social media. It wasn't what we set out to go after. We set out to democratize design to bring design to literally everyone in the world and to everything that they're doing.\n\n(00:37:59):\nBut through the user testing that we did, through the levels of excitement that we saw from different people, social media managers really came to the fore at that time. So we knew that they really fit what we could ship right now. We didn't ship a presentation product or a T-shirt builder in our very first version. We shipped a thing that could make square landscape and portrait graphics and blog post graphics, and that got a particular segment of society excited. We added on all the things afterwards because that was part of vision and ultimately what we wanted to build. But with a team of 10 people in the space of a year, building something that really got social media managers excited was what we could pull off. And that's something we realized in the last six months of that launch year. We didn't quite know who our audience was going to be. We knew it was a tool that anyone could use, but in that last six months of user testing and refining is when we really identified that first target market and we just leant into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:08):\nThere's so many things you all nailed early on. One of them is the focus persona/ICP, which is you said social media managers. Just to take the lesson from that, you basically saw that segment getting the most excited about the product and that told you, let's focus on this group. Is that right?\n\nCameron Adams (00:39:27):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:29):\nAnd was it like an order magnitude more excited? What do people look for there that tells them, \"This is the one.\"? What did you see there other than just more excitement?\n\nCameron Adams (00:39:39):\nIt was just incredibly emotive language, like sheer joy. Particularly coming into the product, we worked a lot on the onboarding process in the last couple of months of launch and that was really pivotal because the product features were there. You could add text, you could add images, you can change the color of things, you can move stuff around the page. It was a simple but powerful product, but there was this thing holding people back from actually using it and understanding what Canva could do for them. And when user tested the onboarding of Canva a ton, actually usertesting.com had just launched them, which really unlocked us because we didn't have to do these big formal labs or anything like that. We could just go online and get results in the space of half an hour. So that was like a pivotal unlock for our product process and that's something we still employ today.\n\n(00:40:39):\nAnd through that, we tailored the onboarding process to get people excited and to understand the deeper goal with Canva and the deeper impact it could let them have. It wasn't just about letting them put a pretty picture on the page, it really unlocked their ideas and let them do things they couldn't do before. And we shaped the onboarding to do that and it resonated the most with social media managers because they had this massive content need that they couldn't really service. And in the first minute of Canva with the right onboarding, it just unlocked the whole realm of productivity and impact that they didn't have before and that's why they got super excited.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:23):\nWe talk a lot on this podcast about the power of onboarding and the impact that can have on retention and everything down funnel. Do you remember what the unlock was in terms of and getting more people activated? Is there anything that's something that other people can learn from?\n\nCameron Adams (00:41:38):\nFor us, it was taking that first step, particularly with Canva and any I think creative tool. There's a real fear of the blank page. So prior to any onboarding thought from us, we had a blank page. We had a few coach marks that said, \"Here's where you do this, here's where you do this.\" And then they'd be left on this blank page and people would freak out. So what we really focused on was just taking that first step and then the next step and then the next step. And before they knew it, they built a design. And the way that we did that was to encourage a really simple step. So the first one was click on this search box and search for a monkey. It literally said that.\n\n(00:42:18):\nSearching for a monkey is something you probably don't do in most tools. So it was a little surprising, which was a good inroad, but it was still super easy. Anyone can type monkey. And then you type that in, it comes up with this whole sway the monkey images, which look hilarious, and just dragging one of those out onto a page is another simple step. And we just got people to walk through that keeping their interest up, keeping the bar of effort quite low, but within three or four steps, they'd built up something that they'd never been able to do before, and it surprised them. The words that we literally got out of years at testing were, I didn't know I could be a designer. And that was what we managed to do through several rounds of refinement on the onboarding process. It is lowering the barriers to entry and also increasing the amount of delight, and I think those two things are what you should be aiming for with your onboarding.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:16):\nThat's an incredible insight. Is there a video of that original onboarding out there or is the current one still similar?\n\nCameron Adams (00:43:22):\nThe current one isn't similar. We have constantly gone back to it because it performs really well. We do actually apply the same approach of little steps building up into bigger accomplishments, and that's actually rolled out through our last round of launches for the last couple of years through something we call learn and play. So with every launch that we do now, we think about how to teach people about that feature and how to get them really involved in it. We have a whole series of learn and plays where when we launch AI photo editing, they can try it out right then and there. They've got some great content that they can immediately operate on, and it's a super simple step for them to type in a prompt and see the result of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:05):\nI think an interesting and really important takeaway here is you built a very delightful, incredible, innovative product, but it still didn't work until you figured out the onboarding and that you needed to figure out the persona to focus on. All those things end up being incredibly important, it's not just build something amazing and delightful.\n\nCameron Adams (00:44:25):\nDefinitely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):\nStaying within this realm of growth, you've grown in large part thanks to this incredibly SEO template strategy. You mentioned in interview there's this guy, Andre that came on early and helped you figure this stuff out. Is that true? And if so, what was the key insight that he had that led to such a great success in terms of growth for you all?\n\nCameron Adams (00:44:49):\nAndre is an amazing guy. He's actually been in and out of Canva three or four times now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:54):\nKeep pulling him back.\n\nCameron Adams (00:44:56):\nYeah, keep pulling him back. We originally found him, he came from a startup that was going under here in Sydney. We had thought about SEO. We knew it was this thing that you could use, and I think in a couple of our pitch decks, we had SEO as a whole growth channel that we were going to execute upon in order for investors to make a ton of money, but we pretty much knew nothing about it. And it was sitting away in our backlog of things to do in the first couple of years of Canva. And we came across Andre and he just really crystallized what SEO was and how it would actually help us grow. So we brought him on, he rolled out his strategy and it was fantastically effective. It was also incredibly cheap, and it was super easy for us to do ourselves.\n\n(00:45:51):\nHe set up a whole team of people who looked at people's motivations and the top jobs to be done that Canva could service. He then mapped that through the entire experience of going into Google, typing a search query, getting that search query, seeing that it was a great result, firstly getting to the top result, but then also the experience after they landed on Canva. So if they searched for want to make a Halloween poster, the top Google result would be Canva. They'd click on it, they'd land on the Halloween poster landing page. It would tell them how they were going to do, it show you how the product was going to do that, have a button there that immediately took them into a Halloween poster template, went through a fantastic onboarding of customizing that poster really simply, and then they would hit done, download the image, and they had a fantastic experience and he thought through that whole end-to-end flow from first landing on Google and typing into the search box through to that magic moment where they're like, \"Canva just helped me do something amazing and I want to do it again.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:58):\nAmazing. Okay. So a few things I'm hearing there. One is figure out the jobs to be done of potential users, figuring out where their search volume, figure out ones you can actually solve for them, like say a Halloween poster, and then think about that experience end to end from search to landing. And obviously, you have to deliver on that promise. You have to actually show them a really cool Halloween poster that they can create, right?\n\nCameron Adams (00:47:19):\nYeah. Again, it's like product led truly means product led because you can't just SEO the hell out of something that is a terrible experience. So tying that experience at the end of the SEO journey is just as important as the technicalities of SEO itself, and Andre really harnessed the whole spectrum of that to produce the end experience, which ultimately ended up with an active user having a delightful experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:47):\nIs there anything else along those lines that was really surprising to you or really, wow, that worked a lot better than I thought because it's probably one of the most well executed, most successful SEO strategies in history. And I'm so curious, just if there's anything else there that's just like, \"Oh, wow, that was really effective and I didn't expect that.\"\n\nCameron Adams (00:48:05):\nThere's a ton in the SEO realm that Andre drove that can get quite technical. But I think one of the other pivotal growth moments for us was internationalization. I think as an Australian company, we're fortunate in that Australia isn't a great market to focus on. We've got 25 million people here. It's okay, but it's not sizeable. It's not going to make you a huge success. Whereas probably a startup that starts in the US will tend to focus on the US because it's a huge monetizable market, and you can entirely create a great company that just services the US. But from Australia, we needed to think about the world. And that meant that we very quickly got into internationalization.\n\n(00:48:52):\nWe started localizing and internationalizing our products three years after launch, which is quite early compared to a lot of other companies. And we tackled it with real vigor. We had a goal of being in five different languages within the first year of localization, and we actually hit eight in that first year. And then we set ourselves a goal of being in 100 different languages the next year. And the internationalization team smashed that goal by the end of 2017. And it has drastically changed Canva's growth trajectory because being in other languages, offering a localized experience, something that people in Brazil or Indonesia or Spain or Poland can authentically feel like they're using a product that's made for them has totally changed who our market is, how quickly we can grow. And the way the product's used internationalizing into Brazilian Portuguese meant that we had to focus a ton more on the Android mobile experience, which was really different for us because we focused a lot on the desktop experience for the first four years.\n\n(00:49:58):\nPeople also in Brazil run entire businesses from their mobile phone and the types of content they're creating to interact with their audience is totally different. So it's actually shaped our product and changed our product trajectory as a result of thinking about internationalization. And it has just fueled tremendous growth. Brazil, India, Indonesia, they're all in our top five markets and they grow way faster than the US does.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:25):\nI know you went international in your four, something like that, which is really early for a company. It also makes sense for SEO plus internationalization. Makes tons of sense.\n\nCameron Adams (00:50:35):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:36):\nIt's a lot more surface area. Okay. I'm going to have two more questions. One is around your freemium strategy. Another a thing you all nailed. There's just this, you're both seeing incredible growth and incredible monetization. I'm curious what your philosophy is on what to include in the free plan versus what people should pay for because it's clearly worked out great.\n\nCameron Adams (00:50:59):\nFreemium for us wasn't so much a growth strategy or a monetization strategy as much as it spoke to our core mission of empowering the world to design. We truly want to democratize design, which means we want to get design into the hands of as many people as we can because we think that the world is a better place when more people can create really rich visual content. So freemium just made sense to us because we could get the tool into billions of people's hands and they wouldn't necessarily have to pay for it. And much of the world can't pay for products because they just don't have access to that level of income.\n\n(00:51:36):\nSo providing that equality was really important to us. But also you need to build a viable business because you can't help the world design if you can't afford to keep the lights on. So freemium just really hit this sweet spot for us between philosophy and business building, so it was always part of our plan since day one. We initially had element sales as our business models. So when we first went to pitch Canva, it was all about create a design. Anything you use in that design will cost you a dollar. So if you dragged in a monkey and you wanted to export that whole design, you'd have to pay a dollar for the money.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:14):\nYeah, I've done that many times.\n\nCameron Adams (00:52:15):\nYes. It was really exciting to investors at the time. It was also really exciting to the content creators who were giving us the monkeys to put into our product. It was a totally new business model. It unlocked, I think, an area that a lot of people were unfamiliar with, which was stock photography. Most people had not paid 100, $500 for photo, and that really held them back from being visual content creators. So it was a really unique innovation for us. And for the first two years of Canva's life, that was how we derived our revenue. It grew pretty well. It was still like, I don't know, 30% month-on-month growth in terms of revenue. But you can do that in the early stages of a startup. It wasn't until we introduced our first subscription product that we saw really hockey stick growth in our revenue. And that was always the plan to launch a subscription product.\n\n(00:53:09):\nBut as with many things, it was a vision that we didn't quite have meat around the bones. So we knew we wanted to put in a subscription what exactly that subscription would look like. We didn't quite know. And through the first couple of years of Canva, we started noticing what people were asking for, what they would be more likely to pay in a subscription for. And that formed the first few features that became what was then called Canva for Work, which is now called Canva Pro. And we launched our first subscription, I think about three years after we launched the first product, and we just rapidly saw the revenue from the subscription start overtaking the $1 image payments.\n\n(00:53:53):\nSo much so that three or four years later we made image element payments part of the subscription. And again, that was like a second hockey stick in gross in terms of the revenue from the subscription because all you can eat images inside the Canva Pro subscription with just amazing value add for people. And I don't even know if we get any revenue from image element sales now. It's all about just going into this subscription.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:24):\nAmazing. Just hockey stick after hockey sticks. Speaking of another hockey stick, I want to talk about AI.\n\nCameron Adams (00:54:29):\nOh, a whole hockey team of hockey sticks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:32):\nJust need to acquire hockey teams. I want to talk about AI, something on the top of everyone's minds these days. It's another area you guys have nailed. You're doing amazing work with AI. It's providing actual value and business impact. I hear you have an amazing internal AI ops team. Is there anything that you've learned so far that you can share about just how to integrate AI successfully and effectively into a product?\n\nCameron Adams (00:54:58):\nAs a technology company, you always just need to be constantly evolving and using the best technology. And when we started that was mobile phones and cloud computing. They were the innovations that came in that really unlocked Canva. AI is the next decade I think of innovation. It's the next pivotal piece of technology that helps you build better products, but it also can't just be the basis for your product. You can't just be a product that's purely built on AI on being a rapper around an LLM or something like that. You still need to think about what it is that people want to do and how you build a product that actually meets that need. It isn't just about slapping a chatbot on something that already existed. It's about deeply thinking about how AI can help them get to that goal even faster. And we view AI as the next way of democratizing design and empowering the world to design, helping more people design, helping more people design quicker, helping more people design quicker with better quality. And that's how we approach every aspect of including AI in the Canva platform.\n\n(00:56:04):\nWe've had a team of machine learning engineers for probably seven years now. I think their work has become a lot more visual now and more customer facing way back when they were just doing recommendation engines inside our emails and our homepage and suggesting templates to you. But now they get to work with some really cool technology, which lets them produce images for people and create designs and summarize text and translate to a hundred different languages like it's really stuff that you can put directly in front of customers now, and that's super exciting. And over the last couple of years, we've built up more and more visual AI experts inside Canva, and we approach AI inside the product through three pillars.\n\n(00:56:53):\nFirst of these is that we need to build some of our own AI tech, and we focus on building the AI tech that we have the biggest advantage in that we have the most data that we can put into it, the most insights, the most criticality to our product and our business. So we have teams building our own AI models around design and images and that stuff. Second pillar is just finding the world's best AI people to partner with. And there's a whole bunch of stuff that you don't need to internalize in your company. You don't need to create an LLM because it's a commodity thing now. And there's a bunch of providers who can do it way better and have way more resources to do it with than you do. So finding a great partner like OpenAI, and we partnered with RunwayML to do video generation, finding the world's best and bringing them into your product with a great integration, the second pillar.\n\n(00:57:48):\nAnd for us, the third pillar is our app ecosystem. So we're fortunate now we've got 170 million people using the product every single month. We have quite an audience that people want access to. And through our app developer ecosystem, they can build apps which directly integrate with the Canva product to give them access to those hundreds of millions of people when people are quite eager to do that. Now, we've seen huge uptake in that from AI developers who have included stuff in Canva from music generators to virtual avatars that can present your presentation to you to a whole slew of things. And those three pillars have, I think, allowed us to create a really coherent experience and one that still keeps a focus on what people want to do, how to help them reach their big goals in a way that doesn't just push technology in the face in a way that just is part of the experience and is a natural way of getting them to where they want to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):\nI was also looking at the GPT story of the fifth most popular custom GPT where people can generate logos using it. So maybe that's driving some growth too. I know you wanted to share something that you guys are launching or have launched by the time this episode comes out. Is that true?\n\nCameron Adams (00:59:08):\nYeah, so we've got a big event in Los Angeles in a couple of months. It's our Canva create, which is an evolution of the season openness that we used to do. So season openers are no longer just inside Canva now. We actually invite our whole community in, and we're going to have probably about 4,000 people in the theater in LA and a couple of million online. And we're really going to be pulling the covers off pretty much the next decade of Canva. We've focused for the first decade of Canva on unlocking individuals and small businesses, giving them the tools that they need to design and to express themselves and create visual content. And as Canva has grown and people have gotten used to creating this stuff, they've invited their teams in, they now collaborate with people on presentations, on Canva videos, on swag T-shirts that they need to make for their event next week.\n\n(01:00:06):\nAnd as more and more people are using Canva together, it's picking up a lot of steam. We've got 95% of the Fortune 500 using Canva. We've got huge teams of thousands of people using Canva. And this has really opened our eyes to not only the enterprise opportunity, but also just the way to redesign the way people work. And that is what the event at the end of May is about. It's really redesigning work for a whole number of different verticals, from marketing to sales to HR to IT to creatives that work inside large teams, large organizations, large enterprises. We've redesigned Canva for this collaborative enterprise age, so we'll be pulling the covers off that alongside work kits, which are a whole verticalized experiences for people inside marketing and sales and HR that want to use Canva, as well as a bunch of improvements to our AI products and an actual enterprise skew that we're launching as well.\n\n(01:01:13):\nSo through this growth and through getting to understand the needs of CIOs and heads of security at enterprises, we've realized that there pretty much needs to be a new enterprise product of Canva that meets the needs of hugely scaled teams, which has been quite different for us because we have scaled from those individuals just using the product all by themselves and organically growing the teams. And now looking at it from a top-down lens and building that enterprise products is what we've been focused on for the last couple of years. So we'll be pulling the covers off that as well in LA.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:50):\nI see another hockey stick approaching. I'm excited of all these things you're launching. What a business you've built. I feel like it's still way too under the radar, even though it's this juggernaut. Nice work, Cameron and team. Two more questions I ask everyone, where can folks find you online and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nCameron Adams (01:02:06):\nThey can find me online at themaninblue.com, which is my blog that's been around for 24 years now. What was the other question? How can you-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:15):\nYeah. How can listeners be useful to you?\n\nCameron Adams (01:02:18):\nI love their design stories, how design has helped unlock something for them, whether it's starting their first business or helping a nonprofit that they volunteer at. I just love bumping into someone in the street and seeing the joy of design right up in their eyes. So please do that whenever you see me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):\nBeautiful.

PMs, they tend to be the front-facing person for initiative. Engineers sometimes think that they don't get the credit for their work because the PM takes all the glory and all the credit for the project that they really worked very hard on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):\nI find the best PMs are the ones that talk the least and encourage other people to do the presenting-\n\nCamille Fournier (00:00:23):\nThe next thing that engineers really get annoyed about with PMs, when they just don't understand the details and act like they don't matter, it just shows a real lack of empathy for the work that engineers are doing and I think it really can be very off-putting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:34):\nIs there any insight you can give about what people may be missed about the motivation of engineers, what gets them excited?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:00:40):\nA lot of people assume that engineers just write code and don't underestimate the ability for your engineers to want to understand the business problem, want to understand the customer problem. I think the product managers that have done the best, they're not threatened by other people having ideas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):\nToday, my guest is Camille Fournier. Camille is one of the most respected technology executives in tech and the author of the Manager's Path, which many considered the definitive guide for navigating your career and moving into management. Over the course of her career, she was CTO of Rent The Runway, VP of technology at Goldman Sachs, global head of engineering and architecture at JP Morgan Chase and head of platform engineering at Two Sigma. She's also releasing a new book later this year called Platform Engineering, A Guide for Technical Product and People Leaders, which you can actually pre-order today and we get into this topic in the latter half of the conversation.\n\n(00:01:36):\nWe also dig into what PMs do that most annoys engineers and how to stop doing these things. Why major rewrites are often a trap. Why you may want to be doing fewer one-on-ones. What most surprises people when they become a manager and some really useful heuristics for how long you should stay in IC before you make the leap into management and tons more. This episode covers a lot of ground and we'll help you think about management. platform teams, team culture and the PM and end relationship in a whole new way. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.\n\n(00:02:09):\nIt's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Camille Fournier. Camille, thank you so much for being here, welcome to the podcast.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:02:23):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:25):\nIt's my pleasure. I want to start by asking you a question that is on the minds of a lot of product managers is how to be less annoying as a product manager. I know you worked with a lot of engineers over time. I'm curious what it is that PMs do that annoy engineers most and how can PMs stop doing that?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:02:42):\nI would say there are a few things that PMs do that annoy engineers and to be clear, I am sure that engineers annoy PMs, just as much. So I've realized this is a two-way street. So I think there's some things that are really easy to fix and some things that are maybe a little bit harder. So the easy things to fix are hoarding credit. Sometimes I think PMs because they tend to be the front-facing person for initiatives, they're talking to customers, they're talking to the executive team, whatever. Engineers sometimes think that they don't get the credit for their work because the PM takes all the glory and all the credit for the project that they really worked very hard on, right?\n\n(00:03:26):\nSo making every effort to be credit sharing and inclusive of the engineering team and giving them the opportunity to speak about their contributions when it makes sense. I think those are all things that PMs can do to avoid that kind of ... What I consider a pretty easy annoyance, just like don't pour it all the credit. This is not just you, right? There's a lot of work has to go into that. I think that sort of dovetails into the next thing that engineers really get annoyed about with PMs when they just don't understand the details and act like they don't matter and I think this is just a little bit of a cultural difference.\n\n(00:04:05):\nI mean, even managers, just normal managers, people like me who are looking across really broad areas or you have to be kind of big picture focused, and you forget that engineering done successfully really is all about the details and you don't necessarily have to understand all of those details, but when you act like they don't matter and you don't care about them and it's just like, I don't care, just like tell me when you can get this done or why is it going to take so long? My god, this just seems like such a little thing. It just shows a real lack of empathy for the work that engineers are doing and I think it really can be very off-putting.\n\n(00:04:42):\nEven though I will totally agree that sometimes you're going to get details that don't really matter and you just have to be a little bit patient in those circumstances.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:50):\nToday's episode is brought to you by DX. If you're an engineering leader or on a platform team, at some point your CEO will inevitably ask you for productivity metrics, but measuring engineering organizations is hard and we can all agree that simple metrics like the number of PRs or commits doesn't tell the full story. That's where DX comes in. DX is an engineering intelligence solution designed by leading researchers, including those behind the DORA and SPACE frameworks. It combines quantitative data from developer tools with qualitative feedback from developers to give you a complete view of engineering productivity and the factors affecting it.\n\n(00:05:28):\nLearn why some of the world's most iconic companies like Etsy, Dropbox, Twilio, Vercel and Webflow rely on DX. Visit DX's website at getdx.com/lenny. Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product pop-ups really annoying. Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature, and these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone.\n\n(00:06:09):\nCommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product, growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product, without annoying them. They use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions, and they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps and websites.\n\n(00:06:42):\nAnd they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny. By the way, CommandBar just changed their name to Command AI.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:07:08):\nThe third is playing telephone. Anybody in a manager role can fall victim to this, but I think PMs especially can be very annoying. So if you are being asked questions that you cannot answer because you just don't know or because that's something that involves a level of technical detail that only the engineers have that you just don't have, and you put yourself in this in-between position where people ask you questions, you turn around, you ask the engineers questions, you take whatever they say, especially when you don't really understand it, which happens sometimes, right? Go back to the original asker and sort of get in this middle-person scenario.\n\n(00:07:51):\nI think that is very annoying and frankly, it's a waste of time for everyone. This is something that managers of all stripes do, but PMs definitely do it and that drives engineers, particularly senior engineers on projects, it's crazy. And then, the last one that I wanted to put on this list is just when sometimes it feels like product managers want to hoard all the ideas for themselves, right? They want to be the ones that come up with every single sort of product idea and every single detail. What I see happen in those cases is that I see engineers start to over-engineer things, because engineers are like, well, I need to take control of something.\n\n(00:08:30):\nI want to have some creative outlet, so I'm going to use my engineering skills as my creative outlet and I'm going to spend a lot of time obsessing over the right framework or the right this, that or the other. That may actually not matter that much with products delivery, but when you take the people that are part of the project team out of the creative loop entirely, they're going to find that creative outlet somewhere else and it's actually kind of bad for the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:56):\nThat's really interesting, the last one. So you're saying if you keep engineers from having a voice in what you're building and prioritizing, that's what encourages engineers to rethink, let's just rebuild this thing, let's use a new framework, let's rewrite this system.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:09:09):\nYeah, I mean that's my ... that happens without you doing that, sometimes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:10):\nYeah.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:09:18):\nI do think ... I think when I see it worst and I can basically always predict what I'm going to see, a lot of that kind of engineers building stuff, finding creative outlets and kind of building stuff, maybe they shouldn't be. I'm going to find that in places where they are so quashed their creativity for the actual business or product that they're building and their voice in that is so ignored that they don't have any outlets in that space and so, they are going to use the space that they have an outlet in, the place where they have some control and that's usually the technology choices and the details there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:54):\nThat's fascinating. I want to actually dig further into that around rewrites. You have a really interesting take on that, but before we get there, let me spend a little time on some of these. These are awesome. So on this theme of not involving engineers in ideation and coming up with what you're actually building, what have you seen just very tactically, is there anything you've seen that PM do super well?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:10:17):\nI think the product managers that have done the best, they're not threatened by other people having ideas. They're not threatened by the engineering team being full of smart people because they realize that yeah, some of the engineers may have good ideas, but they still don't really know how to do the product job. Just my experience is there are plenty of engineers who actually think they can be product managers and they don't really understand all of the elements of the product job that they would need to be successful. And when product managers take the time to build those relationships, well, make sure that people do feel like they can both share their ideas, but also that they start to appreciate what the job of this product person actually is.\n\n(00:11:02):\nAnd what they're really bringing to the table in terms of really how do we measure this input? How do we really understand the customers, how do we really think through the details of what's going to make this successful from a business or a customer perspective? I do think that that creates just a much better interaction pattern and then, engineers can feel good about sharing ideas and understanding that many of them won't go anywhere, but there's somebody that's actually going to listen and take the time to care about them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:37):\nComing back to some of the things that you said annoy engineers of PMs, this idea of playing the middle person, sounds like the solution clearly is there. Just connect the engineer to the other engineer or your engineer to the PM that's trying to figure this out, right?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:11:49):\nThat one is not always easy because again, you have this tension of a lot of the job, of any management role is being in meetings and filtering stuff so that people who are in focus ... individual contributor mode can focus and get things done and not spend half of their weekend in meetings. You've just got to be very careful about knowing when you're crossing that line and when you're crossing it too often. And if you're having to often say, \"Let me get back to you, let me get back to you, I don't know, let me get back to you.\" Maybe the person you're talking to is asking the wrong level of questions of you.\n\n(00:12:26):\nMaybe you need to connect them to the engineers directly, but just being aware that that shouldn't be a default behavior. That will happen occasionally, but it shouldn't be a thing that happens a lot because if it's happening a lot, then you're likely missing something, you're likely losing something in that telephone game translation and that's going to cause problems over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:47):\nAwesome. So basically, if you're just finding your middle person too much, then it may be time to connect people directly. And I know the reason PMs often are afraid of this is the engineer may agree to something that they think is a bad idea for their team or may not understand all the ramifications on the product or just obviously, just spend their time in meetings and not be building anything.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:13:12):\nYeah, yeah, and sometimes you mean you do it in a group meeting. I feel like Slack and other chat type things actually make it a lot easier to see, have the right people in a group in a thing, but again, that's distracting. So there's not an easy solution to that one, just I think it's important to be aware of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:27):\nYeah, that's a really good point. And then, in terms of hoarding credit, is there any tactical thing you've seen PMs do really well here is it, just every time they're announcing the product, \"Hey, these engineers were involved or-\"\n\nCamille Fournier (00:13:37):\nIt's more than just saying thank you to all these people, but it's actually sometimes stepping back and letting other people speak, especially if it's something that's a really, really big technical lift. I don't think there's a super easy fix to that. I think it is just really being mindful that that can be very much a sore point for engineers when they just feel like, \"This is my work, I'm not getting any credit for it, and this person is hogging all the glory.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:07):\nI love that. Yeah, I find the best PMs are the ones that talk the least and encourage other people to do the presenting and announcing. And so, I think that's a really good reminder is let your engineers do that. Okay, amazing. So we talked a little bit about this idea of rewriting and how engineers sometimes just want to rewrite the system and I think a lot of PMs do too. A lot of times you're building your features on a thing that someone that doesn't even work at the company and were built five, 10 years ago, and there's always this sense of, \"Okay, maybe we should just rewrite this thing everything will move so much faster.\"\n\n(00:14:39):\nDo you have a really interesting take that I think a lot of PMs will love to hear, which is that rewrites are often a big trap and often don't end up being what you think they might be? Can you just talk about your experience and perspective on this?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:14:50):\nYeah, so I mean I have personally overseen a number of, if not quite rewrites, re-architectures and major system evolutions. So I absolutely do think they are sometimes a thing that needs to happen, but I also, have seen so many instances of cases where the engineers have convinced themselves that the only solution to the woes that they're experiencing with the system, it's hard to support, it's hard to change. Nobody wants to work on it, because it's this old crappy technology, is that they just have to go over to the side, build the new thing that will replace this old system and that is going to sort of free them from their misery.\n\n(00:15:41):\nAnd I think projects where you acknowledge that you do need to do an uplift, but you make a very thoughtful staged plan as to how you're going to do that, and you really think through, okay, we don't need to touch all of this stuff, but we're going to take the recommendation system, it really needs to be uplifted and that's a well-contained, you know, API and so we can start to fix that without having to change the whole whatever web framework, right? So I do think there are ways to do these evolutions, but people really underestimate. They underestimate the time to migrate stuff from the old system to the new system, is a huge, huge problem.\n\n(00:16:24):\nParticularly when you're talking about systems where you have sort of external people using the system in some way, whether it's web UIs or APIs. You think, \"Oh, we kind of know what's going on, so it's not going to be that big a deal.\" Engineers notoriously, notoriously, notoriously, massively underestimate the migration time for old system to new system and that causes a lot of problems. By the way, you still have to support the old system while you're working on the new system. So I doubt many of the PMs in the audience are ever happy when they hear, we need to go away for six months, a year, two years to build this new thing and we just can't really add any features to the system in the interim.\n\n(00:17:08):\nThat's infuriating, I'm sure, and frankly that's a problem and I don't know that that should be an acceptable answer in many cases. There may occasionally again be a case where that is what has to happen, but I think most of the time you can't really afford to just say we're going to go away and we're not going to touch the system for a long time and we're going to build something new over here. So many things about why that doesn't make any sense. So this is a little bit of field of the blog post that you're referring to. So, if you've got a system that doesn't really need feature enhancement or development because it's just sort of fine and the users are using it.\n\n(00:17:47):\nAnd it's just annoying to the engineers, why in the world would you invest so much money in writing a new version of it? There's a little bit of a cognitive dissonance that sometimes happens if you need to do new stuff and the old system literally is not ... it's not possible to do the new stuff that you need to do, you need to figure out a path to get to a sustainable system or you can continue to add and evolve. You should be investing and so there does need to be an investment, but you have to ask yourself, if I could go away and not touch this and not do anything to it for a long period of time without it really harming my business, is it worthwhile to change it at all?\n\n(00:18:28):\nDoes it matter, and there's some questions there. I also think that when people try to do rewrites, particularly again if it's something that you're really trying to just move to a new language for example or sort of modernize in a certain way, [inaudible 00:18:45] a lot of times people really underestimate what the old system does and how well they know what the old system does. There's so much logic buried in legacy systems, it tends to be undocumented, it tends to be weird. You haven't thought through all the business rules, you haven't thought through the data formatting and I think again, it's much, much harder to replicate all the important things from the old system to the new system than people expect.\n\n(00:19:14):\nSo there's more than that, but I do think sometimes you need to evolve systems and my advice would be when you're struggling making an evolution plan, take pieces potentially of the old system, uplift them, make them more scalable, make them easier to work with, clean up the tech debt, but trying to say we're going to just go away. We're going to rewrite, we're going to build something brand new and it's going to solve all our problems, it just very rarely works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:42):\nI think a lot of PMs will be like, \"Yes, thank you so much for saying this, because I think that's also always a big struggle between the ENG team and the PM team.\" So just to summarize what I think a lot of people miss or what you're saying a lot of people miss when they're thinking about let's rewrite this thing, is the migration to the new system, migrating customers, users, data to the new thing is going to take a lot longer than you expect. You underestimate knowing what it actually does and you're going to miss features and you can introduce new bugs. This actually is very similar to what I've seen with redesigning a whole product flow.\n\n(00:20:15):\nThere's always this sense of let's just rethink this onboarding flow from scratch or let's rebuild this part of the product and always it ends up being a negative experiment result. It always ends up being less good and then, you have to spend all this time clawing back to get to where you were and also, you forget the stuff that would ... the features that you had and you're like, \"Oh, shit, I forgot about that feature, I forgot about that feature.\" So it's interesting, there's a very similar situation in the product side. Okay, amazing. I'm going to go to a slightly different topic, which is around engineering leadership.\n\n(00:20:45):\nSo I know you've written a lot about engineering leadership, you spent a lot of times with engineering leaders, so I have a few questions here. One is that I know that one of the things that haunts engineering leaders most is finding the balance between staying technical and their technical expertise, and their leadership expertise and basically finding the right altitude of how high ... where to be in the org and also how in the details to be, and also staying technical enough to be relevant. What have you learned in your own experience of finding that balance and how do you advise engineering leaders as they struggle with this?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:21:18):\nYeah, so one piece of advice I give everybody is don't stop being a hands-on technical until you feel like it's in your bones. You feel like you've got mastery that you could ... if you know a second language fluently or if you played an instrument really, really seriously for a long time or maybe a sport really, really seriously for a long time, you'll be familiar with the ... I haven't done that in a long time, but if I was to pick it up, it would be rusty, but I would get there pretty quickly, right? Maybe physically, I wouldn't be as strong as I was or whatever, but I would get there. You can do that with writing code.\n\n(00:21:58):\nYou can do that with technical skills if you do it for long enough, I think you can develop sort of a baseline mastery, where you're not going to be as fast and a lot of the challenges of being technical is actually in all the tooling and all the tooling evolution, but you're not going to be necessarily as fast as people who have been doing it, but you won't be completely clueless and I think that all the things you learn getting to that really comfortable mastery of some part of hands-on tech will stay with you and will help you just maintain a level of confidence in your own technical know-how and maintain a level of empathy for what it means to be a good engineer.\n\n(00:22:38):\nAnd I think just make you a lot less anxious about being hands-off, even though I think everybody who makes that transition for a year or two, especially if you're really have to be hands-off or you just don't have time to write code at all, you are going to be anxious for a while no matter what. The things to then think about from that point is, being technical is also just about knowing what's going on and paying attention and being able to ask ... what people care about with technical leaders in my experience is they want people who actually seem like they sort of understand what you're doing and can ask good questions and help guide you to better decisions without actually being the one who's like, \"Oh no, you need to use this library instead of that library.\"\n\n(00:23:25):\nIt's actually sort of annoying when somebody that's very senior and hands-off tries to tell you, don't use this library, use that library because I don't know about you, but I don't really believe people who have been hands-off for that long when they try to tell me what to do and the thing that I'm kind of the expert in right now, but I do appreciate it when I'm given more guidance around, well, have you considered this? Tell me about how you're planning to handle that situation. What are the major technical challenges with implementing this and that can actually spend the time to listen and ask thoughtful questions on the back of that.\n\n(00:24:00):\nThe last thing I would say is surround yourself with smart technical people, also as much as you can, and be willing to listen to them, talk about tech and ask them questions about things. I feel like that's part of the reason that I am able to stay technically savvy and credible amongst people who work for me is not that I'm writing code because I'm not. But I am listening to a lot of very smart people talk about technology a lot, down to the level of I'm trying to debug this database issue, what the heck is going on? And just constantly being interested in those stories and learning from them and learning what really smart engineers are thinking about and worrying about.\n\n(00:24:47):\nThe more you can build that network of people that are still hands-on and stay in touch with that, I do think that helps a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:56):\nSo on my last point, how are you actually doing that? Is it watching ... going to conferences with friends, something else?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:25:01):\nYeah, yeah. I mean, I guess for me it started with going to conferences, meeting people. Now, I'm in a lot of different chat groups where people are just sort of regularly communicating, staying in touch with ... staying in touch with former colleagues. I will admit I'm kind of a social person and I have a big network, so this may be easier said than done, but I do think being in the right group chats ... I also think, I'm sure reading various tech news and tech sort of commentary and discussion boards, I mean it's definitely a mixed bag of that stuff I think that like ... but there are smart people. You find the smart people in there, you sort of follow what they're saying. I think that's another good way to keep that perspective.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:51):\nIs it a sign, I wonder if you're not interested in that anymore that maybe you should move into something else. I don't know. If you're like, don't really pay attention to engineering technicalness.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:26:02):\nIt's hard for me to say because I'm such a nerd. I really love tech. I'm in this industry, because I'm just actually genuinely very interested in certain corners, not every corner of technology but certain corners of technology. I want to know what the latest stuff that's happening in databases and infrastructure and I find it all very interesting. I find the problems interesting. So I think that makes me very successful because I just have that natural curiosity and passion and interest in it. But I don't know that that's a total prerequisite.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:36):\nYeah, but you've been talking about ... it reminds me a little bit of this guy, LevelsIO on Twitter. Have you heard of this guy? He was just on Lex Friedman. Have you listened to that yet?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:26:47):\nI think maybe I saw a clip of it, but I haven't listened to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:48):\nSo I think one of the most successful indie engineers where he just works on his own thing all by himself, never raises money, just launch his products that make money. And a funny thing about him is he works ... all stuff is in PHP and jQuery. He's just like, this works. I've always had this to do, learn Node.js, learn Python. And I'm like, I'm too busy to build ... while I'm building to learn these new things and he's been incredibly successful. So it touches on sometimes maybe you don't need to just keep rewriting to the newest frameworks.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:27:15):\nYeah, no, I mean look, I actually ... I feel like I know a lot of smart engineers who are in that category. They're like, we built amazing things in PHP and relatively simple SQL and so much of tech is over-engineering things and I don't totally disagree. I think the challenge is though, of course, what works as a one person show, doesn't always work in a scaled organization for better or for worse, we're in different like, you've got to match what makes one person really productive. Will it make 100 people, 1000 people, even 10 people really productive? That's always a little hard to tell and that's why I do think you should be not ... I think it's always a good idea to be keeping up with what's happening and what's changing in whatever kind of side of tech you're in, but not obsessively chasing every fad.\n\n(00:28:15):\nI think being aware of, but not necessarily chasing them, but particularly, if you're working in groups, teams, larger companies, even midsize companies, there is some amount of, you're balancing the tech that makes one person go fast with the tech that makes 10 or 100 people go fast and those are not always exactly the same thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:35):\nJust to kind follow this thread a little bit and to kind of nerd snipe you a little bit, is there a platform or language or framework these days that you're either very excited about that you think is helping people move faster and do better work or the opposite just like this is ... everyone is excited but this is not good.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:28:52):\nI will say this, one example I actually put in my own notes for this conversation was GraphQL. I would not tell a team to use or not use GraphQL at this point because it's a bit out of my expertise zone and my level of management. It's not really my job anyway, but it is one of the things that is both popular and thought relatively poorly of by most of the senior people that I know. And so, I guess I would say that's one where I would say if you're seriously thinking about it and you're not Facebook, you may really want to make sure you know what problem you're trying to solve because the impression that I have from sort of listening to people talk about it is that GraphQL is kind of trying to promise front-end engineers that they don't really have to collaborate with backend engineers.\n\n(00:29:49):\nAnd they can just sort of build whatever and it'll all be fine, and it just doesn't ever seem to work out that well for anybody who actually does it in practice. Again, obviously, it can work out that well because Facebook has made a great go of it. I'm sure there are other companies that are, but that's one where it's not that new but it remains one of these things where it seems like an interesting fad that maybe is burning a lot of people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:13):\nThat's awesome. I appreciate you sharing that. I don't know if this is exactly an example of this, but on that podcast levels, I forget his actual name, Peter I think, shared that whenever there's a framework that has a VC funded startup behind it, that's not a good sign because their job now is to convince engineers to use it and then pay for it and that's not necessarily going to be the best product.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:30:34):\nThat's true. Although I will say that some of the most time-wasting frameworks have also just come out of big companies, or the context of the big company that may have made that framework super useful within that context doesn't translate to startup or small company or even big company that doesn't have the rest of the context set, but I don't think ... He's not wrong. I also just think big companies share the blame on that one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:05):\nI guess we should all just come back to PHP and jQuery and be simple.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:31:09):\nMaybe.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:10):\nOkay, so to close out this thread on engineering leaders, finding the right balance, just to summarize your advice here. One is get to mastery before and is your advice here, get to this point before you move into engineering.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:31:23):\nEngineering management. I will say part of this is also in particular, if you happen to be a woman or otherwise, underrepresented person in tech because people will tend to underestimate your technical abilities just unfortunately as a get-go. I also think it's particularly important to kind of develop that internal confidence in your abilities before you make this sort of scary leap, which is scary for everyone of have a ... if you have that mastery before you make the leap, I wish more people would do this because honestly, I do think there are a lot of people who never really gained the mastery. They go into management, they lose it and some of them are still perfectly good managers and look, there are good managers who were never technical to begin with.\n\n(00:32:09):\nI don't want to say that that's impossible. I just think that if you care about being technical, if you are technical now and you want to maintain that tech-savvy, don't just become a manager the first time somebody offers it to you. Make sure you've really spent your good time writing code.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:28):\nIs there a number of years heuristic you think about or some way to tell you that maybe you've hit that point?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:32:34):\nI think this has been since disproven, but it was that 10,000 hours idea of mastery at some point. For me, it was like an undergraduate degree, a graduate degree, and four or five years of full-time work. So maybe I might be slow. I didn't start coding a lot in middle school like people might do now, but I felt like ... I took several years of hands-on work in a very intense undergraduate and graduate programs for me. So I do think it's probably somewhere in the 10-year range of really having spent a lot of your time over those years writing code and really understanding how to be a technical expert.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:17):\nGot it. So essentially if you're thinking about moving into management as an engineer, you may want to wait until you've done it for 10 years in some form, which I think is a lot longer than a lot of people would've thought. And I imagine many people are not doing that. And then, in your experience not doing it as well, it could be-\n\nCamille Fournier (00:33:35):\nIf you were programming a lot in high school and you got an undergraduate degree, so let's say you've got six years-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):\nI see.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:33:42):\nYou may only need four or five years of work, 40 hour a week writing code experience. I'm sure it depends on the company, but I do think when you see people that are 23, they are just out very recently out of school, it's a different thing if you're a founder and that's a whole different life, but if you're at a big company and somebody is like you have great communication skills, why don't you start to become a manager? Often they're actually pushing you to become a project manager, which is actually also the worst sort of path to real leadership in my opinion. If you don't feel like you're done ... Also, if you just don't feel like you're done, if you're still having fun writing code, don't rush becoming a manager, writing code is awesome. Have fun, enjoy it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):\nI know exactly what you mean. So I used to be an engineer, actually I was an engineer for 10 years. I definitely don't have mastery at this point. I moved into product from that and I definitely so missed actually just sitting there and writing code and building stuff, that was very hard to give up. I imagine you still missed that.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:34:45):\nI think I might've forgotten about it at this point, but there is nothing as satisfying because you get the fast feedback loop. It's just wonderful. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:56):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda.

On the topic of moving into management, you wrote maybe the definitive book on engineering manager career path, and so when someone moves from IC to management, what do you find is the most surprising thing to them? What do they most often not understand or are surprised by like, \"Oh man, I did not see this as part of my job or my life.\"\n\nCamille Fournier (00:36:24):\nYeah, I mean I think there's a few things. I do think ... assuming that they're actually trying to do it well, I do think there are a lot of people who move into management and then just don't really understand the job at all and aren't even self-aware enough to know that they don't understand it, but for those who are trying to do it, trying to do it well. I think a few things that tend to surprise them are the fact that you really don't own your time as a manager. Your team and your management and the company owns your time. More and more the more senior you become as a manager. I think individual contributors often think that if they become a manager, they will still have some of the freedom that they have as a senior individual contributor.\n\n(00:37:08):\nBut then they'll also be able to tell people what to do and they'll have all this authority. And the reality is, management is much more ... I'm not a huge fan of servant leadership exactly, but management really is a service job. You are serving the team, you are serving the company. Your job is to help make things better and that usually doesn't mean that you're making all the decisions. It usually doesn't mean that you snap your fingers and people jump. Because if you try that, especially in tech, right? People are just going to revolt. They're not going to listen to you. It's just too hard to have ... that's not the culture that we live in.\n\n(00:37:53):\nAnd I don't think that's a good culture. I don't think that command and control, I tell you what to do and you do it. It just doesn't create creativity, right? It's the same thing as like PMs, trying to have all the ideas, right? No, you've got all these brilliant people working for you on a team, your job as a manager is not to tell them what to do in every single case. Occasionally, yes, a lot more. If you're trying to convince them of what you think should happen. In some ways, you're sort of nudging, you're encouraging, you're directing, you're setting guardrails for processes or behaviors or whatever, but it's not this glorious fearless leader.\n\n(00:38:36):\nI make all these decisions and everyone looks up to me and it's awesome kind of job. It's much more grueling, much more ... you are really just sort of reacting to things in the moment. And it can be very ... it's a hard job. I do think particularly management when done well, when you're really trying to do it in a thoughtful kind, but also, productive way is a very hard job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:06):\nI wonder if engineering is where most ... where the highest percentage of people that move into management move back to IC. I've seen that a bunch and I wonder if engineers are the most common.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:39:16):\nI don't know, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:18):\nAfter realizing what you just said is true, like, \"Oh, what I done-\"\n\nCamille Fournier (00:39:22):\nSo do you not think product managers also do this? Because I think product managers also actually suffer from exactly this kind of-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:28):\nThey do.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:39:28):\nMaybe sometimes-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:28):\nThey do.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:39:28):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:30):\nBut interestingly, I was an engineering manager earlier in my career. I really did not like it. I was very unhappy in that role. As a PM manager though, I was very happy, it was a lot easier.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:39:43):\nYeah, because PMs are way easier to manage. PMs are awesome to manage. PMs want to ... they're just so helpful. They want to do this ... they're good communicators. I love managing PMs. I have to say, I have to say, just my experience, engineers are such a pain. They're all primadonnas. I am an engineer, but PMs are more fun to manage my experience. So actually, you have a point. You have a point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:12):\nBut I wonder. Yeah, because I haven't seen a lot of PM managers move back to IC product management. I find that once you can build product through teams and not sit there all day in Excel and check in on deadlines and things, it's hard to give that part up. You kind of enjoy being higher up in that chain. Yeah. Kind of along these lines, something that you have a really interesting perspective on is one-on-ones. Most people are like have one-on-ones with everyone, have them regularly, they're really important. You actually have this contrarian take that maybe you should have less one-on-ones, especially as an engineering manager, you talk about that.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:40:46):\nYeah, so to be clear, you should have one-on-ones with your direct reports and your manager and you should hold those sacred ... I tend to do my weekly or maybe every other week. So this is not about that set of one-on-ones. So the one-on-ones of the people that you are directly managing and with your own manager. But I think there is this ... I don't know if it's the remote work, sort of explosion that's happened or it's big companies or what, but what I've seen and I've heard a lot of friends at many companies complain about is this idea that everybody is doing one-on-ones with everyone else. So the manager is doing one-on-ones with their team. They're also doing one-on-ones with all of their peers.\n\n(00:41:35):\nThey're doing one-on-ones with all of their stakeholders. They're doing one-on-ones with product and design. And I think that it's just not a scalable approach, right? Linearly scale with the number of relationships you have. And so, as your company grows, as the number of things your team supports grow, as the team grows, you just can't scale that way. You cannot expect to maintain a one-on-one approach to kind of organizational relationship building and awareness passed a fairly small team/company. I also think that people think that one-on-ones will solve all of their problems. And I think the reality is you have this one-on-ones with people that don't really want to have a one-on-one with you.\n\n(00:42:30):\nIf they're not in the mind to invest in your relationship, if they don't really care about what you're doing, they actually may not like it that you're asking them for a one-on-one, let me show up like, because it's like, okay, well I should do this to be a good corporate citizen or whatever. But they're just like, why are we doing this? What is the point of this? I also think that one-on-ones, particularly when you use them first of stakeholder management. So when you're meeting with people that's not your team, but other stakeholders that you may need to deal with, if you have a lot of stakeholders ... so I've been in a lot of positions where I have a lot of internal stakeholders because I build internal platforms is a big part of what my job has been in the last many years.\n\n(00:43:07):\nHaving all these meetings as one-on-ones with those stakeholders can actually be kind of a weakness because when your stakeholders just tell you in a one-on-one that they're happy or unhappy with things, your unhappy stakeholders aren't hearing that. So you may have one really unhappy stakeholder and five really happy ones and all you're saying to your unhappy one is, \"Well, everybody else is happy and they're not seeing it for themselves.\" And they're just having to say, \"Trust me, because I've had these other one-on-ones with all these people and they're saying it's fine.\" And it just kind of sounds whiny.\n\n(00:43:37):\nAnd so, when you're dealing with a lot of stakeholders and trying to just rely on one-on-one management of that is actually not very productive in a lot of ways. So in general, I guess I just think people should respect their own time more. As much as I just said management, you're kind of at everyone's mercy and that is true, but also respect your time. Don't just load yourself up with meetings because you're a manager and that's your job. Do you really have something to talk to a person about? Do you really need to ... when you have a one-on-one meeting with someone, you are asking for their time. You shouldn't just be doing that kind of haphazardly for fun.\n\n(00:44:24):\nThis is a little bit of my personality. I'm not a great company networker. Some people are really good at just like, let's go to get coffee, let's go to lunch and let's hang out and build a relationship. And honestly, those people are really successful in many ways that I am not. I do sort of envy that skill. I'm really good if I work with you. If I work with you on something, generally speaking, people really come to respect me because I'm very engaged and I'm a really good collaborator in various ways, but I'm really bad at just getting to know you random one-on-one, where we don't have a purpose to the meeting.\n\n(00:44:57):\nAnd that's not to say those are always bad, but I do think that a lot of people with ... that's your comfort zone, if that getting to know you, random, relationship building one-on-one is your comfort zone, I should probably do more of them. You should probably do fewer of them because you should always be pushing yourself to get out of your comfort zone and are you really getting something out of that or are you just being able to tick a checkbox that says, I had eight meetings today, therefore I was productive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:26):\nYeah, that super resonates. Kind of pulling on this thread of how you operate and how you work something that I've heard you're really known for, is creating a work culture where people work really hard but also, have a really good work-life balance. And when we were chatting, you, you actually told me you're not a great believer in working too hard. Can you just talk about this philosophy on building a great culture where people don't work too hard but also, get stuff done and don't burn out?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:45:51):\nI think we all understand that if we could just figure out and focus on really the most important things, we would just ... everything would be better. And it's hard to figure out what the most important things are, but overwork kind of lets you just sidestep doing the hard work of figuring out what's important in the first place. I listened to one of your podcasts where you talked to someone who said, if you've never fired someone and regretted it, you don't know where the line is, of who you should and shouldn't buy. And I will admit I have mixed feelings about that, although I get what you're saying. If you don't regularly reset your expectations of what you should and shouldn't let slide, do you have any idea where the line of what is actually important to work on is?\n\n(00:46:41):\nI just think ... and the thing about that is it's not like firing people where you do it once or twice and you regret it and you learn pretty quickly, unfortunately. I think you actually have to kind of regularly test the circumstances and challenge with, am I really getting the most out of myself? Am I really producing the best value or am I just making ... swaging my internal guilt about I need to work 60-hour weeks, I need to sleep in the office, I need to whatever, to show that I'm a hard worker and I care. And so, I guess I do really think that people should challenge themselves to be focused and get the important stuff done and always be asking themselves what is important to do?\n\n(00:47:37):\nAnd what's important to do does change over time. But if you're not regularly doing an audit of your time and trying to knock things off that list that don't matter, you're probably wasting a lot of time on things that don't matter and okay, you don't want to work less. You love working a lot, that's fine, but you could probably just be getting a lot more valuable stuff done if you would do these audits regularly, right? I also think people don't delegate enough. So, if you don't delegate, then you get overwhelmed because your team doesn't know how to do anything, because you haven't bothered to spend the time delegating, which actually takes more time initially, usually, you have to teach people whatever it is that you're trying to get them to do.\n\n(00:48:19):\nNot always, sometimes they'll surprise you and they're better at it than you are, but maybe not. And so, you have to teach them, but then you finally ... you freed yourself up to scale. So I guess I'm just a real believer that working hard and a focused way for over fewer hours I think is a more productive way to approach work. And I think I have lived my career that way. I've been successful in it and I have encouraged it and people who have worked for me, and I think I've seen a lot of success through it, but it's not a thoughtless exercise. It's an active process of constant reflection to get to that focus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:11):\nFor someone that is listening to this and is like, I want to start doing this, is there anything ... any specific practice you've found useful or any specific tactic to actually do this well?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:49:23):\nI think there's different approaches you could take, right? One approach you could take is just like every Friday I'm going to stop working at 4 PM or something, let's say, and I am not, or I'm not going to let myself work this weekend. Forcing yourself to log off, forcing yourself to have boundaries and saying ... and then doing out of what did I get done, I think can help. That's scary. And people don't like doing that, but I do think that that's one of the best ways to do it is really just saying, I'm going to log off. I'm going to log off every day this week at 6 PM. I'm going to ... because your brain is probably going to keep thinking.\n\n(00:50:10):\nYou might still be a little stressed out, you're still thinking about work, you're still worrying about it, but there is a difference between thinking about it and doing it, and particularly for those of you who are earlier in your careers, this was actually, I think one of the reasons that I did get to mastery was because I was extremely good at being focused when I was at work, when I was a hands-on programmer and really writing code for many of the hours of the day. And that meant I was not ... this was pre heavy social media. I was much less distracted, which I don't know if I would be able to do it in the modern era as easily, but having that real heavy focus time because I was like, \"I don't want to work on the weekend. I don't want to stay here until 9 PM every night. I just want to get this done.\" And it meant that I didn't do quite as many copies.\n\n(00:50:58):\nI didn't go to lunch and chat with people all every day, but I was very, very productive and I learned to get a lot done in a short period of time. And I do think learning those skills earlier in your career and then continuing to apply them throughout your career is another piece of advice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:16):\nIn terms of staying and getting focused, is there anything that helps you focus? Is it like headphones, a drink? What gets you in the zone?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:51:24):\nI mean, yeah, I have a lot of rituals. I have my caffeination rituals.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:31):\nSay more.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:51:32):\nWell, I mean I can't drink coffee anymore because my stomach got messed up at some point, but I drink tea in the morning. I drink caffeinated water also. I have a Diet Coke at lunch, so I have these rituals of my caffeine hits that help me. I have to be in a quiet place. I do find non-music that is ... I really like Four Tet, for example, as music to focus or the new Andre 3000 Flute album is extremely good for focusing, where it's not quite predictable, no lyrics and not quite predictable. For me, that helps me focus a lot. I can't be listening to any words and focus. My brain just cannot ignore words. So those are some of the things I use to help folks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:24):\nThat is awesome. I have a similar caffeine strategy. I'm drinking tea always during these podcasts and this little thing I got here and then, my wife doesn't want me to drink Diet Coke because she thinks the sugar and it is not good, but I still drink it sometimes and it works great. I switched to green tea. That's my approach. Start with black tea and then switch to green tea.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:52:40):\nThat's smart.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:41):\nMan, there's so many things you shared that I wanted to dig into. Let me share a couple of things. Your point about delegating I thought was really important, and there's another benefit to learning to delegate, which is team members feel empowered. You give them a chance to take on responsibility and they feel like I have an opportunity to show I can do this other thing.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:53:02):\nYeah, and you're never going to scale if you don't delegate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:06):\nYeah, and it's hard to start learning to do that, but once you get good at it, it becomes so great. I love just delegate everything every time, and people enjoy it. They're like, \"Amazing. You're giving me opportunity.\" The thing you said about how ... if you're not sometimes regretting something you cut or potentially firing someone you don't regret, Elon actually, Elon Musk has a great approach to this. I don't know if you've heard his philosophy on optimizing. He has this whole five-step process of figuring out how to optimize something, and one of them is try to cut things like, do we need this thing or not? And if you don't recognize that 10% of stuff you cut, it was a mistake, you're probably not cutting enough stuff.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:53:45):\nYou'll have to figure out your own metrics. But I definitely think testing the limits, it's scary though. I'm going to be honest. Doing that is always scary. It brings up like, I forgot to finish the assignment nightmares of school, especially for the overachievers that often end up in these kinds of companies and jobs. Again, you got to do things that scare you or you're never going to grow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:14):\nOkay, I'm going to go in a whole different direction. You've got a book coming out about platform engineering and platform teams. This is something that I get a lot of questions about. A lot of people are thinking about moving to a platform team or struggling working on a platform team or struggling working with a platform team. So I have a bunch of questions along these lines. The first is I asked a bunch of people that worked with you what to ask you and someone that worked with you shared this quote about his frustration working with platform teams that he's often complaining to you about and he works on customer-facing products. And so, he said platform teams that are often slow.\n\n(00:54:48):\nThey're often pushing us to compromise on features to adopt their systems. They often get infinite funding even though they don't have to show any ROI. And so, maybe from the perspective of working with a platform team, say you're building something customer-facing, any tips for effectively working with a platform team and building a great relationship there.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:55:08):\nI'm very sympathetic to anybody who feels that way because part of the reason that I wrote this book, I co-wrote it with a friend, Ian Nolan, is that so many platform teams are guilty of all the things that he's complaining about, that my friend was complaining about, that they don't listen, they're not delivering effectively, they're not explaining their value to the company. And it is infuriating when you're dealing with that. And honestly, I'm very sympathetic. The thing that I would say though is the more you can, first of all, spend the time understanding that the platform team's problems a little bit and trying to collaborate and work with them and be clear about what it is you actually need and how you're willing to work with them, I think the better.\n\n(00:56:01):\nI think if you get mad and you just try to avoid them or undermine them or whatever, that may work in the long run, but it's just going to make everything worse in the short run. So I do think that if you've got a platform team that you're frustrated with, some tips, I would put are like, \"Look, find the parts of that team that are good because I'm sure there are some,\" right? Maybe the databases team is awesome. And really make sure you are maintaining a good relationship with that part of the team and you can point to how you are collaborating extremely well with that part of the team. Help give them product feedback.\n\n(00:56:44):\nThis is annoying but sometimes needs to happen because a lot of companies, I actually think product ... you need to have a product mindset and frankly, you need to have product managers to build good platforms, internal platforms. A lot of companies just don't do this. They don't believe that they should waste head count on product managers for internal teams. So you end up with this platform team that has a lot of smart engineers, but they don't really know what to build. So they're just sort of building whatever they think is right. And so sometimes your job is to product manage them, is to tell them, these are the problems that we have and this is what we need.\n\n(00:57:16):\nAnd the clearer you can be about that, particularly when they don't have a product team, oftentimes, you can kind of lead them from the side in that way. And so I think that's another approach that I would take when you're in that situation. Find the parts of the team that are working and working well with your team and make sure you develop those relationships and try to just get over the anger and frustration and just be clear about what it is that you need and help them understand what they should really be doing and building.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:48):\nThat is really interesting advice. So especially, you're saying if they don't have a PM helping, make sure they're guiding things well, is you can help them ... basically help them think through stuff that will benefit them and also, help the stuff that you're trying to get done.\n\nCamille Fournier (00:58:03):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:04):\nThat's awesome advice. Okay, so what about from the leadership perspective, trying to build an effective platform team, do you have any advice on how to structure these teams and incentivize these teams to help them be successful?\n\nCamille Fournier (00:58:17):\nFirst of all, I'm a very strong believer that platform engineering has to involve software engineering. If you don't have any software engineers on your platform team and you only have more operations systems engineers, DevOps, SRE, which I realize there are some SREs that are software engineers, but they tend to not want to write big software. I think you're kind of missing the picture. Platform engineering is not just maintaining cloud infrastructure and doing small scripts or blueprints or enablement projects for other teams, because that doesn't really create a cohesive and coherent platform. It doesn't create products and frankly you need to be ... platforms are products, ultimately.\n\n(00:59:04):\nYou should be thinking about how do I create coherent offerings that make this company more productive? So you need software engineers. Yes, you need sort of operations systems, SRE specialists as well. And of course, you need product people. I had product teams on ... product managers for all of my platform teams. I've really developed out that practice in the companies that I've worked for doing this because I just believe that you're not going to get great results if you just believe that to engineers and engineering management. They will do their best and you do occasionally find engineers that have really great product instincts in this space, but the actual details.\n\n(00:59:49):\nAnd focus of the product work is just you can't write a bunch of code and/or manage a big software engineering team and be a product manager at the same time. That's actually just asking, I think, too much of people to do that really well, at least for very long. So I think when it comes to structuring a team, recognize this is not just like SRE V2. This is more than that. You want software engineers, you want systems engineers, you want product people. And then, one of the reasons you want product folks is because you want to be thinking about impact-based, outcome-based approaches, not just like, \"Well, we built this thing that seemed cool, we adopted this technology from this company because that's what everybody on the internet is talking about.\"\n\n(01:00:36):\nWhether it's VC funded or big company. We actually thought about what are the problems the engineers at my company are facing? How can we improve their productivity or deliver leverage to this business through whatever it is we're building, right? Are we reducing the cycle time for engineering tasks? Are we solving problems that are preventing products from launching and scaling? Are we making really meaningful cost reductions or efficiencies and, in our products or in our platforms? These are some examples of measurable contributions, but I think one of the challenges is that people create these platform teams and think that they can be sort of divorced from having an impact focus because it's like, \"Well, you just got to run the infrastructure and make sure it works.\"\n\n(01:01:29):\nAnd it's like, \"No, you actually do still have to do ... if you do that OKR stuff or goal setting,\" or whatever, you've got to take a lot of the best practices of product. It's a little different in the internal world, but it's still very important if you want to do platforms.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:45):\nOn the line of having PMs within the platform teams. Some of the best PMs I've ever worked with where PMs on platform teams, and that just tells me, it's not like where you put PMs that are just meant like that's ... where you could have some of the highest leverage because platform teams enable the rest of the company to move faster.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:02:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:02):\nAnd one difference there, I'm curious if you agree, is your ratio of PM to engineer can be a lot higher. You can have a lot more engineers per PM on platform teams.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:02:10):\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's right because I think so much of the work in a platform team is not exactly product work. A lot of it is like scaling or really deep kind of technical, like I got to figure out how to actually do this technical thing or I've got to do this performance efficiency and you don't always need a product spec for that, right? It is often just a very engineering heavy task. So yes, I think the ratios do tend to be a bit different.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:42):\nWe dove over right into this topic. Maybe it might be helpful to help people understand what is a platform team, just what are examples of teams that would be considered platform teams.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:02:51):\nI mean, I guess the high level definition that I have of platform engineering is if you are developing and operating platforms that ... where they're trying to manage overall system complexity and deliver leverage to your business. So a lot of the teams that people think about nowadays and when they're talking about platform teams, they're talking a lot about teams that may have formerly been called dev tools. For example, so your CI/CD tooling for the company, a lot of the cloud infrastructure provisioning and tooling. If you're at a company with certain technical problems, you may very well be building semi bespoke storage systems. For example, maybe part of your platform teams. I actually think that there are ... And then, actually web frameworks ... Web mobile framework and support for that.\n\n(01:03:50):\nThat set of engineering can also be part of a platform offering. I actually kind of believe that there's also sort of what you might call integration platforms or platforms that are in between that infrastructurey developer tooly stuff and products. So billing platforms for example, if you have a single billing platform for all of the different products in your company, that shares a lot of overlaps in the challenges of those more dev tools, infrastructurey platform teams because you're probably supporting lots of different product lines that are using this system that needs to be able to scale with certain efficiencies. You need to still do the product discovery.\n\n(01:04:33):\nYou probably have a little bit more of a business product focus than the pure internal tools teams, but that gets to the blended area.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:44):\nFor founders that are earlier stage or companies that are smaller hearing this and they're like, \"Oh, shit do I need a platform team?\" So yeah, you're shaking your head, if people aren't watching on YouTube. What's a sign that's time maybe to start creating a platform team and setting aside resources for something like that?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:05:00):\nSo first of all, I think it gets to be like, you have 50 plus engineers. I don't think this is the kind of thing that you start when you are 10 engineers, right? But when you are ... so there's a lot of ad hoc coordination that's probably happening amongst your engineering groups right now, where maybe you just have one ... you have your GitHub and somebody is making sure that all of that stuff is sort of working. You have a few cloud databases and you got a couple of people on each team and they kind of share notes to figure out what's going on or whatever. Okay, it's all good, but at some point, you hit either a lot of inefficiency where you're seeing the same people across a bunch of different teams.\n\n(01:05:54):\nEach team has the same kind of people having to solve the same kinds of problems. It just seems like why do I have three people in every team, dealing with this instead of centralizing it and making it a little more efficient. It also could be that you hit some core scaling issue that starts to really need a dedicated team to solve. Again, that could be developer productivity. Every development team is trying to do it their own way and everybody is just super slow because you just can't get code released and it all has to be coordinated across every different team and it's just like, what is going on? We need to fix that or you actually have a technical challenging area that needs a focused team to fix the scaling.\n\n(01:06:36):\nThose are some of the signs that you may want to start thinking about a platform team, but it's really like ... generally speaking, I would not jump into it early. This is something for companies that have matured where it's worth investing and making people internally more productive and centralizing certain functions just from a cost and efficiency basis at minimum.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:02):\nSay you're on a platform team, say you're an engineer or even a PM, any advice for how to be successful and thrive within that environment and be a great platform team.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:07:11):\nIf you want to do platforms. If you're an engineer, certainly if you're an engineer or an engineering manager, you've got to remember that half of the work is actually the operational quality, operational excellence of these things. Platform engineering is not just writing code and then throwing it over the walls to someone. Being interested and passionate about the operational challenges and scaling bits of systems I do think is fairly important, if you want to be a great platform engineer from a software engineer perspective, if you're more like a product manager, \"Look, you've got to really care about ...\" I think you got to be really both interested in working with really smart engineers who are going to know way more than you do about things.\n\n(01:08:06):\nAnd almost being a really good, not necessarily zero to one but past one person because actually a lot of the best platform type offerings in companies start in individual application teams. An application team has a problem and they solve it for themselves and it turns out that that's actually a really good idea for how to solve that problem. So a good platform team is often looking around for those and then sort of taking them and then assimilating them and making them available to more and more people. And so, I think if you want to be in that kind of zero to one building the brand new stuff all the time, you may not be as happy in a platform team.\n\n(01:08:45):\nBut if you're really interested a little bit more of taking things over, stabilizing, scaling them, making them efficient, making them evolve as a company evolves, I think you'll be happier in that circumstance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:01):\nAwesome. Is there anything else along these lines before we wrap up and yet a very exciting lightning round that you think might be helpful for folks working with platform teams or working on a platform team, building platform teams?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:09:14):\nI think there are two things that we haven't touched on or maybe three that are really hard about platform teams and that I think don't get much press, which is running platform projects is a little bit different than running agile projects. You can take a lot of the best practices you may have learned from agile type product delivery, but you are running longer, running larger scale, more complex builds because a lot of the stuff that you build at the platform level just takes longer. It's a little bit more complicated. So you've got to be willing to get into that kind of stuff, especially if you're in a management job in that space.\n\n(01:09:55):\nYou are going to deal with a lot of migrations as well. So it is very annoying. Migrations happen, even if you don't force them on people, your a cloud provider is going to say, oh, you've got to migrate from EKS view 19 to 121 or whatever, and that may require changes in code and then that's a real pain in the butt for all of the application teams. So people who are interested in how to smooth over the customer and company impact of this underlying change, I think we'll be very happy in platform teams. If you're not interested in that, you may not enjoy the work as much. There's just a lot of detail oriented work and platforms. And then of course, the final part is the stakeholders are a nightmare. My friend who wrote the question about how his product or his platform partners drive him crazy. I have no doubt he drives them crazies.\n\n(01:10:55):\nBecause you've got all of these stakeholders, your peers and tech, maybe product managers, maybe executives that are like, what is this team? Are they really worth the money? Why are we spending so much on it? I don't understand what they're doing. I could do it better in some cases. So there's actually a big part of the job, particularly as either product managers or engineering leadership is stakeholder management and really learning how to do that well. And that is not always, that's probably I think universally agreed to be the least fun part of the job. I don't think anybody loves it, but it is certainly a skill set. I'm glad that I have. And so, I think if you are thinking about building one of these teams.\n\n(01:11:40):\nAnd you're like, I can just do the fun tech stuff or the cool product stuff, I'm really passionate about engineering productivity or I'm really passionate about state scale storage systems and I don't want to think about any of the other stuff. You may not actually be happy in the long run in leadership positions. It may be fine as an individual contributor, but for leaders in particular, there's a lot more to it than the fun tech problems, the fun operations problems, even the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:07):\nYou said there's a few things we haven't touched on. Is there anything else?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:12:13):\nThat's the fastest and anybody who's interested, my book will be coming out in the next couple of months from O'Reilly and covers all of this depth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:22):\nYeah, is there a date specifically people should watch out for?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:12:25):\nI think it's actually pre-order on Amazon now. It's called Platform Engineering, and then, there's ... I think it's like a guide for technical product and people leaders, something like that. But I think the release ... I don't know exactly when the Kindle release will be, but we're still in copy edits, but it should be done pretty soon.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:42):\nOkay, amazing. So you can pre-order it now. Rolling to it obviously in the show notes and description, it's called Platform Engineering. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, I want to take us to a recurring segment on this podcast that I call AI Corner. AI is very top of mind for a lot of people and I'm always curious how people are finding it valuable in their work or in their life. So the question is there anything you've found AI to be helpful with ... in your AI work? Any way you use it in an interesting way?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:13:11):\nI find it helpful, for example, if I've written a sentence and I'm like, I like this sentence, but I feel like, I don't like the phrasing or the format that I've used, it needs to be edited, but I can't quite figure out how. I will often put it into ChatGPT and be like, \"Can you reframe this? Can you rephrase this for me?\" It doesn't always work well, but sometimes it does. It's like, \"Oh yeah, if I just switched this around or changed this word choice, it's a much easier to read sentence.\" I do think it's ... I think it's just before that and small. I think it's large, lots of texts I haven't had as much luck with. I'm a little bit of an AI novice still, I would say.\n\n(01:13:52):\nWhat I will say is that AI is really bad, if you try to ask it for quotes or at least ChatGPT is. I haven't used a lot of the other ones that much. I actually saw there was some Twitter or some social media thing that's like, did Francis Ford Coppola get fake reviews from ChatGPT of the new, what is it, Agopolus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:14):\nYeah.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:14:14):\nAgopolus maybe.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:14):\nYeah.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:14:16):\nAnd I was like, I actually had that scenario where I was like, I need a quote ... I was looking for quotes for the book and I was like, maybe ChatGPT knows, but I was like, \"Can you give me any good quotes on ...\" I forget what it was. Let's just say it was on managing complexity or something like that, and it gave me these really interesting quotes. I was like, that's great, but I better double check that. And they were not real. They were never real, not a single quote. And I'd be like, that's not actually a real quote. Yes, you're right. That's not, so here's a different one.\n\n(01:14:45):\nI was like, that's still not a real quote, so don't ask it for quotes because ... or if you do, make sure it's a real quote and not just an interestingly phrased ... I mean good summarization in some ways of the text, it was sort of quoting from, just not an actual quote.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:06):\nThat's a good reminder of just generally don't assume what it's telling is true. Generally, it's not giving you real things. It's making things up and usually they're right, but often they might not be right. That's a really good reminder. On that first tactic, is there a prompt that you find helpful for how to actually feed it in there? Is it just here's a line, help me come up with a better version of it?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:15:26):\nNo, I have not figured out the prompt engineering thing at all. I tried to get it to summarize a paper for me the other day, and it literally gave me the summary of a different paper, and then I asked friends and they were like, \"Well, here's a summary.\" I was like, \"Actually, that seems like a good summary.\" And they're like, \"Well, first I told the AI that it was an expert in the field and that it needed to read carefully and that it was really smart,\" and I'm just like, how do I have to manage the machine? I already have to manage all of these humans? Why are you making me manage machines now too, please?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:00):\nI thought this was going to solve all of our problems. Yeah, that role. There's an acronym for how to approach engineering, and there's always like give it the role. Here's the role you're going to play for me. You are an amazing writer and here's what I want from you. Yeah. I'm also very bad at it. By the way, Claude I here is really good at writing. That's one of its superpowers, so if you want to try writing, that's worth trying. Claude by Anthropic. On the second point you made of fake quote. So, yeah, Francis Ford Coppola is coming out with this movie with ... As you mentioned, this trailer is just full of all these quotes that people supposedly said about all his other movies that Godfather and stuff. And they're all like, these are terrible ... They're all terribly mean quotes about his movies.\n\n(01:16:41):\nIt turns out, yeah, they're all not real quotes, and they actually took down the trailer, I just read because he's just making up quotes by famous critics.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:16:49):\nWell, so maybe-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:50):\nMaybe it was ChatGPT.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:16:54):\nYou can get fooled. I don't know if it was ChatGPT or a cheeky intern or something, but we can get-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:58):\nOr very intentional marketing stint.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:17:04):\nOr that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:04):\nYeah. Anyway, with that Camille, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:17:08):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:09):\nAmazing. Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:17:15):\nSo the first one is, What Got You Here Won't Get You There. I love it. I think anybody who is trying to challenge themselves and grow, should read it, it's fantastic. The second one is called When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron. That is when you are ... For me anyway, when I am struggling with whatever circumstances around me, I find it a very soothing or reminder that life is hard and the best way to ... you just sort of have to breathe with it and be with it and let it remind you of how life is hard for everyone and sort of make you a kinder person in the process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:04):\nIs there a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:18:08):\nI loved Alien Romulus. It was great. If you like a scary alien movie, fantastic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):\nI hate scary movies, so that's a new Alien movie. Okay.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:18:18):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:18):\nAnyone know there was a new Alien movie.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:18:19):\nI loved it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:21):\nAwesome. Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love, whether it's an app or even physical product?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:18:27):\nSo I don't know about recent, I'm a big Whoop fan. I got it during the pandemic and it is one of my ... I'm just a weird fan girl for it. I don't know. I just really ... I enjoy it. I use it every day. Maybe it's totally inaccurate, but it seems accurate enough and I just find it a very interesting and cool product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:48):\nI know Whoop product, people listen to this podcast, so I think they'll be happy to hear that. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, find useful and work around life?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:18:59):\nIf you don't challenge yourself, if you don't take risks, you'll never grow. That's a big one. I think you've got to ... challenging yourself, taking risks is how you grow. I think the other one for me is stay curious. The more you can remember that there's more that you don't know than that you do know, and staying open-minded and being willing to be wrong, I think the happier you'll be and the better you'll be as a leader for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:29):\nFinal question, on the topic of working out, you're blocking it with your head generally during the podcast, when we moved ... Behind you is a very significant looking barbell set or dumbbell set, I don't know which one is which. Talk about your workout regimen or anything along the lines of how you work out.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:19:48):\nI have been lifting rates probably for longer than some of your podcast listeners have been alive, which says more about my age than anything else. So I used be ... I now have two kids, so I lift weights as sort of maintenance, but I used to be a very ... I could deadlift than twice my body weight and I was just a very, very strong person. Now of course, everybody is into weightlifting, which makes the gym really annoying. So partly why I have a set in here, a small set with a baby sized bar is ... so when I can't make it to the gym, I can at least lift a little bit at home.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:27):\nWhat's your favorite workout, lifting wise?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:20:29):\nI love really basic deadlift, squat, overhead press, that kind of very simple, the classic lifts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:39):\nAmazing. Camille, this is awesome. As everything, I was hoping it'd be, we covered so much stuff. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, follow up on stuff and check out your books and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:20:51):\nYes, so with the weird state of social media now, that's actually a harder question to answer than it normally is. I am on LinkedIn, so you can always follow me on LinkedIn and I'll probably ... I haven't traditionally put that much there, but I'm expecting I'll probably start putting more there in the coming months. I also still use Medium when I write. I actually like Medium, so medium.com, scamille is my username. Those are two good ways. I have a Twitter/X account that it is currently locked, and I may or may not unlock it at some point, but social media, as I said, has gotten weird. So I think probably LinkedIn is the easiest way for this kind of stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):\nAnd I read somewhere that scamille is rooted in your love of ska music back when you were younger. Is that right?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:21:39):\nIt's true, yes. It was from high school. I was a big ska fan.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:43):\nIt's funny how our usernames just stick from, we were really young and that's the way we're represented online now forever.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:21:49):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:50):\nThat's absurd. And then, you didn't answer my final question, which is how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nCamille Fournier (01:21:55):\nI have a new book coming out. I have another book that I've already written. Obviously, I love it when people buy my books so I love when people share my books with other people. My first book is translated into a bunch of languages, which is super exciting, and I hope that if you read it and enjoy it and learn something from it, you will let me know. Tag me on some social media. I think that's just awesome and stay tuned. Look, if you are looking for people potentially to come talk to your company about platform engineering, I could be interested in that, but I always love to meet interesting people. If you're in New York, reach out, who knows. This has been an amazing, amazing time getting to chat with you, Lenny. Thank you so much for inviting me on the show.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:42):\nI feel the same way. Thank you for agreeing to come on the show, Camille, you're awesome. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nCamille Fournier (01:22:48):\nTake care.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:49):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Monetizing passions, scaling marketplaces, and stories from a creator economy vet | Camille Hearst\n\n## Transcript\n\nCamille Hearst (00:00:00):\n... those Steve Jobs' lore was that if you were in an elevator with him, you better be prepared to talk about what you do at the company because he had a habit of getting in the elevator and looking at you and saying, \"What do you do? What do you do here?\" And there were also rumors that people who had not given him a good answer, that ended up being their last day at Apple.\n\n(00:00:23):\nSo there was someone who I didn't know personally but worked in my department before I got there who got in an elevator and looked up and Steve was approaching him and so he went to press the button to open the door and accidentally pressed the one to close the door. And it was like doing this press... You can't see me if you're listening on podcast but frantically pressing the button, trying to open the door, but accidentally pressing the closed door button and the elevator going to its destination. And apparently he got off and just bolted straight up, ran down the hallway.\n\nLenny (00:01:00):\nHe'll never remember my face.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:01:02):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:01:02):\nI disappeared.\n\n(00:01:07):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard win experiences building and growing today's most successful products.\n\n(00:01:15):\nToday my guest is Camille Hearst.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:04:28):\nThank you so much for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny (00:04:29):\nI first wanted to just give a big thank you to Adam Fishman for introducing us who had just so many nice things to say about you and so I'm really excited to be chatting.\n\n(00:04:38):\nI want to start with talking about your current role at Spotify and I believe your role is head of fan monetization. What does that actually entail and what are you responsible for within Spotify?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:04:49):\nAs head of fan monetization, I have a team of folks who are really passionate about figuring out new ways to help artists and fans connect and also figure out ways to make those connections result in new monetization opportunities for the artists.\n\n(00:05:08):\nSo one of the things that we all know and we've seen is how passionate fans are about the artists that they love. You've been following any of the latest bits about the Taylor Swift tour, the Beyoncé tour that's been happening this summer, and their effect on local economies. It's been pretty impressive.\n\n(00:05:28):\nBut one of the things that we also know is it's not just the big huge superstars who have those rabid and super engaged fan bases. People are really passionate just about supporting the artists that they love in general.\n\n(00:05:40):\nAnd on Spotify, we want to figure out ways we can help that result in more money that goes directly to the artist.\n\nLenny (00:05:48):\nWhat are some of those ways just to give people a sense of what might be happening?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:05:52):\nSo one of the ones that most mature is merch which is funny to say because most people probably don't realize that you can purchase merch on Spotify. That's one that's been around-\n\nLenny (00:06:03):\nI did not realize that.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:06:04):\n... for a bit of time and my team's recently been working on making it more prominent, giving artists more ways to offer that merch in the form of a reward for fans. So things like an exclusive discount or an exclusive design or early access because you're a top listener on Spotify, really thinking about thank yous and rewards for your Spotify listenership and fandom.\n\n(00:06:28):\nAnd then other things we've been looking at have been listening parties. We ran a few of those over the past year. I think I talked about it actually on a Spotify event a few years ago. We were running... Sorry, it wasn't a few years ago, it was last year.\n\n(00:06:45):\nBut listening parties is another way and then we've got some new ideas we're exploring.\n\nLenny (00:06:50):\nI've heard people do listening parties with this podcast actually and I hope that you roll that out to podcast too because that would be very cool.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:06:58):\nYeah. We have all kinds of ideas of really interesting ways we can bring groups of people together and get the monetization going.\n\nLenny (00:07:08):\nAll right.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:08):\nOne day.\n\nLenny (00:07:09):\nMysterious but exciting.\n\n(00:07:11):\nSpeaking of Taylor Swift, I was watching a TikTok the other day and they showed a video of someone inside the concert showing the whole concert and then they panned to the parking lot and there was just tens of thousands of people just standing around in the parking lot listening to the second order music out at the stadium. And I wonder how can you monetize that if there's an opportunity?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:34):\nYeah. I think they often have the merch trucks in those parking lots though one way-\n\nLenny (00:07:38):\nProbably unofficial merch.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:07:40):\nSo you work with artists and I actually wanted to ask this question. What's the best part about working with artists, musical artists, and what's the worst part?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:48):\nI think the best part is working with people who really lean into their creativity and their passion so much so that they do it for a living. And I think a lot of us have creative pursuit and passions and things we love to do and if we made millions of dollars and could retire, what would you do full time? Usually, it's one of these pursuits. But I think it takes an element of bravery, not to mention talent, but you really have to go out on a limb.\n\n(00:08:18):\nAnd so that's this equality that exists in this group of people and it's fun to be around and feel that rub off on you and think, \"Oh, maybe I could take the dive one day and I don't know, go do my calligraphy or learn my ukulele and then do it full time.\" But that's the best part.\n\n(00:08:35):\nAnd the thing I'm really... I grew up in a musical household. My dad's a drummer although his joke when we were growing up was real musicians have day jobs because he had to actually have a job with benefit to support the family and couldn't just be gigging full time.\n\n(00:08:55):\nWhich actually brings me to the flip side of the question which you asked what is the hardest part. I do think we saw this a lot at Patreon and I think you see it especially with musicians and artists, this feeling that you want to give your fans everything that you create and you want to do it for free because you're so enamored with this idea that people really love you and want to support you and they're really responding to your creativity and everything that you're making, you don't want to charge them. But what comes with that is, well, how are you going to make a living.\n\n(00:09:29):\nTo some degree, there has to be a value exchange that happens in order for a creative person to live from their art.\n\n(00:09:37):\nAnd I've found that that's much more pronounced with musicians, this starving artist ethos which makes what I'm trying to do actually quite difficult because a lot of the feedback we get is, \"Oh, that's awesome. I want to have a listening party and have everything be free and just have everyone show up and don't sell anything.\" And we're really looking at it as a way to fans want to support the artists they love, they want to open up their wallets.\n\n(00:10:04):\nYou've see nothing else from a Substack and Patreons that people are actually really happy to be a patron of the arts and they look at it as like a badge of honor.\n\n(00:10:12):\nBut musicians in particular I think tend to shy away from that which makes the kind of thing that I'm working on more difficult.\n\nLenny (00:10:20):\nThis's a great segue to an area I want to spend time on is the creator economy and creators and artists and things like that. And along these lines, I think I have this issue too. I feel bad charging people but there's also... I don't think my stuff is worth enough to charge for and why would anyone ever pay anything for it and so I imagine you see that too. It's just like, \"No one's going to pay for this. It's crazy.\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:10:40):\nYeah. It's funny because we live in a very capitalist and market dictate the price kind of society, but on an individual level, particularly when the commodity so to speak is art, there's so many emotions and feelings involved in that that it's hard for someone who's the creator to disassociate themselves from it and see what the market will bear.\n\n(00:11:05):\nWhich is why I actually think it's great that there's platforms who have stepped in and said, \"Hey, we see an opportunity. Let us insert ourselves in the center, let us aggregate, and let us do the hard work of pricing and payment and tax and finance and actually create value where it would be really hard for an individual person who's a creator to do all of this work and facilitate that connection.\" It's almost like the perfect marketplace solution.\n\n(00:11:38):\nBut again, it's hard because if the supplier doesn't want to actually make money in some cases or shies away from optimizing or making money.\n\n(00:11:47):\nAnd then there's the creative process. Sometimes, you're in a flow mode and you're producing a lot and then other times, you're in a drought spell and these things ebb and flow which is why I think companies like Patreon and Substack are really cool because what they try to do is smooth out that revenue and make it so an artist can actually have a predictable... They're not even artist, a creator can have a predictable sustainable paycheck so that they aren't bouncing around from job to job and losing the ability to have that burst of creativity because they're worried about their bills.\n\nLenny (00:12:22):\nI have that experience myself with Substack which is a subscription newsletter and one of the big downsides people don't think about with this life is once you start charging, people start buying, say, an annual subscription and that means I have to at least go for another year and in reality, I never really want to stop it because the revenue would just stop and that would be really sad. So you get on the treadmill where you don't really have an exit path. And I'm not sure exactly where this all goes, but it's been great. But that's something people don't think a lot about is this never ending, keep creating, keep creating life.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:12:52):\nWe call it internally the hamster wheel of content creation. You get on because you love it and then how do you get off.\n\n(00:12:59):\nSo it's actually an interesting challenge again for platforms to think about where can they add value, are there ways to either make the content creation process that much easier and I don't want to say less of a burden because it's not a burden but sometimes, if you don't have time or you're just at a point in life where you can't do it, are there services or things that can be offered, are there things like financing that makes sense for creators that banks or traditional institutions wouldn't offer because of just the difference in the type of work that's being produced.\n\n(00:13:34):\nOr another potential solution is are there ways that platforms can create content. Maybe it's automated so that the creator can take a break. So maybe they're not AI necessarily, maybe it's more just aggregating data or doing summaries or maybe there's just other ideas that haven't been explored out there. But it's a real problem.\n\nLenny (00:13:56):\nSo I have this lennybot.com site which is an AI chatbot based on all my content including the podcast episodes and actually, an engineer who was listening to this podcast reached out and offered to help me build it and he did and it's awesome. And I'm curious if that becomes my retirement plan as the bot ends up just doing this and learns enough. I highly doubt it, but it's fun to experiment with.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:14:18):\nYeah. Use your own content as your large language model, right?\n\nLenny (00:14:22):\nExactly. That's exactly what it is. And I'm curious where this goes.\n\n(00:14:26):\nI want to follow the thread of the creator economy. It feels like there's this huge wave of the creator economies, the future of work, and all these platforms launched to allow creator to make money. But it feels like over the past couple of years, it feels like it faded away. And these very small number of platforms essentially one YouTube, Spotify, Instagram, TikTok, Patreon, maybe Substack, and there was also the sense that the future of work is freelance, everyone's going to be working for themselves, creating stuff, and it feels like people are still working regular jobs. A lot of these startups haven't done great.\n\n(00:15:01):\nSo I guess I'm just curious what you think happens maybe in the next five or 10 years from a perspective of platforms emerging and also just from creators, what... Do you think things stay the same? Do you think there's another wave? Where do you think things go?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:15:14):\nI think it was probably predictable to some degree that platforms would win because just of the nature of aggregation. Once you have either all of the supply or you've aggregated the demand, it's really a strong network effect. Why investors love to invest in these types of businesses, it's hard to break out.\n\n(00:15:37):\nI wouldn't underestimate the strategic ability either of some the big platforms. They were definitely thinking ahead and building features and thinking about whether or not they saw it as a monetization opportunity. It certainly is a great strategic play to make sure that creators felt like they were on the platform that made the most sense for them and they weren't going to churn or leave or try too many other places out.\n\n(00:16:04):\nSo I think the rush and the funding was to figure out is there room for any other new platforms, are there specific vertical that maybe there's an opportunity to create vertical specific features and tooling.\n\n(00:16:19):\nAnd actually, I think we saw a huge massive creation there in Twitch, right? Twitch did not exist and they're just a juggernaut.\n\n(00:16:26):\nI think TikTok is another one that came out of this era. Maybe they weren't positioned as creator economy type startups but effectively...\n\n(00:16:35):\nDid you see what happened in Union Square here with Kai, the gaming streamer?\n\nLenny (00:16:39):\nNo.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:16:39):\nSo I'm in New York and last week, there was a mob and a riot because a Twitch streamer announced that he was going to be giving away PlayStations and computer gear in Union Square and something like a million teenage boys showed up. I'm not making this up. And they had to shut down the center of New York City to clear what turned into protest, riot, mob-\n\nLenny (00:17:07):\nHoly shit.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:17:08):\n... of teenagers who came for this one creator that probably no one listening to me right now has even heard of.\n\nLenny (00:17:15):\nYeah.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:17:17):\nSo I do think a lot of the predictions have come to bear. There are tons of people making money and making a living from creating content on the internet.\n\n(00:17:28):\nThere have been studies too where they ask young people what they want to do and what they want to be when they grow up, we quote these at, excuse me, Patreon and over 60% want to create content for a living.\n\n(00:17:42):\nSo those trends I don't think are going anywhere. Maybe it'll be supplemental income, maybe it'll be something you do for a period of your life. But I do think that this area continues to be untapped. I just don't see a world where...\n\n(00:17:58):\nI think of Michelle Phan, right? She's basically a mini Disney and when you think of it like that, she's created IP. What can you do with IP? Comic books, movies, TV shows, plushies, merch. How many millions of Michelle fans are we going to have seen?\n\n(00:18:16):\nLook at what's happening in China. There's tons of creators like this.\n\n(00:18:20):\nSo whether or not the VCs have won or the startups have succeeded, there's no way that you can lower the cost of content creation and increase the scale of distribution and not see this emerge, this creator economy I think emerge. But I think that maybe there's still opportunity for more companies to blossom and to grow and certainly for more individuals maybe do this, figure it out on their own, and do it without too many big platforms getting paid off of their creative pursuit.\n\nLenny (00:18:58):\nHave you seen the NPC trend on TikTok/maybe Instagram Reels where people pretend to be NPCs, non-playable characters, from a video game?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:06):\nI have not.\n\nLenny (00:19:07):\nOkay. It's crazy. People just pretend to be a computer character and people pay them little gifts to do a thing.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:15):\nOh. Is this the... Yes. Have seen it. [inaudible 00:19:19] ice cream, ice cream.\n\nLenny (00:19:22):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:22):\nYes. I didn't realize.\n\nLenny (00:19:24):\nYou're making tens of thousands of dollars a day just... So that's one way to make a living.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:24):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:19:30):\nOn the thread of becoming a creator, you've seen a lot of creators try to do this on Patreon, back at Apple even with iTunes, I want to chat about that, at Spotify now, and even your startup. I'm curious what you've seen is important to success in the creator life, especially things that are maybe not obvious to people. What do people need to get right if they want to pursue that path?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:54):\nOne of the things that I've seen that I don't know if people realize is consistency and predictability of content creation which is where this idea that we were talking about earlier of a hamster wheel kind of comes on.\n\n(00:20:08):\nBut there is something to churning out consistent quality work and putting it out there for your audience to consume and respond and react to that goes a long way. It's almost like the 10,000 hours. You have to do 10,000 hours of something in order to truly master it. But I've seen that time and again.\n\n(00:20:30):\nI started at YouTube in, let's see, how old am I? It must have been 2010. And that was when I really think this whole thing was just first getting going. And we used to put together these playbooks of what made a creator successful because a lot of the effort there was trying to support this burgeoning economy. And I remember even back then in 2010 and to this day, that continues to be one of the top pieces of advice.\n\n(00:20:57):\nAnother one is collaboration. So working with other great creators, sharing audience, exposing one another to those audiences, and then this was something we tried to employ at my startup, Kit. We would actually host events for creators to get together to facilitate meeting and cross pollination in the hopes that it would just benefit their careers. If they were doing YouTube videos with someone they met at the party, then it would be great for all parties all around. So those are two things.\n\n(00:21:32):\nAnd then I do think in a world with all of this content, there continues to be a need and a space for the curator. And curators as creator's kind of an interesting concept. But a curator is almost like what the role at book publishing company plays or a record label plays or a radio station plays, right?\n\n(00:21:56):\nThere is a degree of having a brand, having something you stand for, having a vibe or an ethos and that person being almost, not a gatekeeper in a bad way, but like, \"I, Camille, can't consume anywhere near all this content. You, I trust your vibe. Tell me what I should be listening to.\" And so that would be the third thing I would say is figure out who are those curators who you really can associate your content with who are on the same page as you, have an audience who you think would like your stuff and just try and get associated with them.\n\nLenny (00:22:30):\nYeah. The last piece is so... I totally see that all the time. If there's someone I super respect and they recommend something, I'm obviously going to value that recommendation highly. That's like we're influencing emerged from organically, right? People just, \"Here's something you should check out,\" and then, \"Oh, let's pay you to share things so that people try our product.\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:22:48):\nThat was the exact concept behind my startup, Kit. It was all about curating, finding people who are great recommenders for gear, having them curate that gear, and then you could follow the curators you love who wants to go look on Amazon and see reviews from people you've never heard of. Oftentimes, if it's your brother-in-law who's a great cyclist and they say, \"Buy this,\" you just buy it. You don't even care what the reviews say because you trust that person.\n\nLenny (00:23:14):\nWhat happened with the startup and what did you learn from that experience?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:23:17):\nI started working on the startup in 2015. We managed to raise some money, raised over $2 million, which is a huge accomplishment, especially if you know anything about venture capital. They have a horrible track record when it comes to funding people of color, women, people who are non-cisgender white male, just the track record.\n\n(00:23:43):\nAnd we had an amazing experience building this company over several years, grew a bunch of the key metrics up into the right and got to a point where we were trying to figure out what the next move was and should we get a bridge round. We were trying to raise Series A. We were, I think, early on the creator economy trend. Probably about a year and a half later, it would've been, I think, I hope a snap to raise money. But anyway, we were battling a bunch of different choices, different options.\n\n(00:24:19):\nAnd I actually did this startup accelerator called StartX that's run out of Stanford which is my alma mater. And we learned a lot about how to sell a company and what M&A looks like. So we started exploring that path.\n\n(00:24:34):\nAnd in the end, it made the most sense for us to have an exit and join forces with Patreon. And so that's what we ended up doing. Sold the company in 2018, joined Patreon, worked there a couple of years, and that's where I met Adam.\n\nLenny (00:24:49):\nAmazing. And I wanted to ask actually about that experience of selling a company. There's a lot of people listening right now who are thinking about selling their company or maybe you hope to sell their company someday, and I think there's a reality of it and then there's the idea of how it might go. I'm curious what you've taken away from that experience. And I guess specifically is there any advice you could share with folks that are thinking about selling their company someday? What you think maybe could have done earlier or also just share a glimpse of the reality of acquisitions?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:25:20):\nI think it's different for every company for sure. Some companies get souped in and get bought. And other companies actively sell themselves.\n\n(00:25:31):\nWe are definitely in the latter camp which means that we manage a process. It's similar to how you manage a process for fundraising. Not every company just meets the VC and raises money on the first try. They go through a process and meet tons of VCs and put them through the funnel and end up on the other side hopefully with a successful round. So I think that's one takeaway is treat it like a process and manage it like a process if it is something you're interested in. It doesn't really just... For most companies, I would say it doesn't just happen.\n\n(00:26:04):\nAnd then the second piece of advice I would give I think we should have been talking to potential acquirers from the beginning and sharing our vision and what we were trying to accomplish because we started those quite late in our journey as a company and it just meant it took... When I met a potential CPO, who would acquire the company, who would end up being my boss or CEO, it was their first time meeting me whereas if it had been their fifth time, we would've had a relationship established and they would've known more about the vision and what we're trying to do and hopefully, would've had some more time to think about it.\n\n(00:26:42):\nSo those would be my two pieces of advice. Start preparing to sell your company from the moment you found it which is a weird thing because obviously, if you're starting a company, for most founders, they want it to be the next big thing, they're not starting it in order to sell it, but it's a good thing to have on your radar because you never know what the future holds. And then two is to treat it like a process.\n\nLenny (00:27:07):\nYeah. On that piece of knowing people who may acquire you, I found that to be a thousand percent true. We sold our company the Airbnb and that's how it got to Airbnb and what I realized is you just need people who may buy you in the future to have you in their head when they have a problem so that they could be like, \"Oh, Camille and her team could solve this problem for us. Let's go chat with her and-\n\nCamille Hearst (00:27:28):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:27:28):\n... see if they're interested in acquisition.\"\n\n(00:27:31):\nAnd on the process piece too, 1000% resonates. We basically... When we started chatting with a company, we're just like, \"Okay, who else could potentially acquire us? Let's make a big list and who we can talk to at that company as soon as possible and then just explore.\" But it's more challenging there because it's you reaching out to them being like, \"Hey, you want to chat about buying our company,\" versus them reaching out to you. So to your point, always goes better if they reach out to you, but you can't always control that.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:27:54):\nRight. Or if the meeting is not under the context of buying it all, it's like, \"We're working on something cool. We have a great vision. It aligns with what you're doing. Maybe there's a partnership here,\" versus just tell you what we're doing and then when I contact you in 12 months about buying me, you've heard of me before.\n\nLenny (00:28:12):\nI find even when you're starting to chat about acquisitions, you never want to say directly, \"Hey, you want to buy us?\" It's like, \"Hey, you want to have a strategic partnership of some kind? You want to explore partnership?\" So funny.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:28:23):\nLike dating.\n\nLenny (00:28:24):\nYeah, yeah. You can't just be too direct sometimes.\n\n(00:28:28):\nSo when you got to Patreon, I don't know if it was immediate or eventually you ended up leading the creator side of the marketplace, and I find that looking at your background, you basically stayed on the supply side of marketplaces through your career mostly.\n\n(00:28:43):\nAnd I actually did the same thing. All I worked on at Airbnb especially, or mostly, was the host side.\n\n(00:28:48):\nAnd I think it takes a specific mindset in person to be excited about that side of the marketplace versus the consumer side which is where everyone always generally wants to go, to the customer side. So I'm curious what it is that's drawn you to that side of the business across all the places you work and then just what you found to be important to be successful in that role and on that side?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:29:09):\nWhat drew me to that side of the business probably was maybe accidental at the beginning. Just again, coming from this musical family and background, I always had a natural interest in helping artists make a living. So I think that interest was there.\n\n(00:29:29):\nAt Apple, I did... There were only two PMs there. We did everything.\n\n(00:29:34):\nAt YouTube, I accidentally ended up in creator.\n\n(00:29:39):\nBut where I started understanding deeply the dynamics of the marketplace was actually my experience and the one job I've had that not been in the creator or art or these big consumer platforms or creator economy which was at a startup called Hailo based out of London and at the time was a huge competitor to Uber and Lyft in the ride sharing and ride hailing space and I worked on the supply side making sure that there were enough cars to fuel the demand.\n\n(00:30:17):\nAnd in a marketplace like that where it's real time people trying to get a cab to go from uptown to downtown, you see the inexperience firsthand the impact to your business if you don't have suppliers, if your suppliers aren't happy, if they go on strike, if there's regulations that mean you can't use your service. And there I think I was...\n\n(00:30:44):\nSo one of the projects that I worked on that I launched was the U.S. Uber competitor because Hailo in Europe was all about getting taxi cabs and did not play in the livery is what it's called in New York or the private rides. Basically, it's like your uncle or your aunt or your cousin who can switch on Lyft and go pick up whoever. That just was not a thing in Europe.\n\n(00:31:09):\nAnd so we had to figure out how to launch that in the U.S., how to get drivers on how to create this supply and it was like it doesn't matter how nice the user experience is, how great the marketing is, how much demand you can generate if when someone opens that app, there are no cars available.\n\n(00:31:31):\nSo a lot of people talk about marketplaces as chicken and egg. I actually just think they're two-sided and you start with the supply and at the end of the day, you can optimize for the demand side or choose who you're going to prioritize in terms of if there's a conflict, we're going to pick this side or the other.\n\n(00:31:53):\nAnd yes, you won't be successful with one side or the other but I just experienced and lived firsthand the pain of having built this great operations back in that fed into this gray UI and then you open that app and you can't get a ride because there aren't enough cars available.\n\n(00:32:12):\nSo I think that solidified my feeling that with marketplaces, you can't lose sight of the solving real pain points and needs for the supply side in order to make sure the entire business can operate.\n\nLenny (00:32:26):\nI've done a bunch of research into marketplaces and I found basically the same thing, that supply is almost always where you need to focus almost all your time especially at the beginning.\n\n(00:32:34):\nThe way I think about it is that's if you have a store that's stuff on your shelves and you're not going to have a business if you don't have anything on the shelves.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:32:41):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:32:42):\nThere's a few rare cases, I forget exactly which they were, where demand was actually the bigger challenge and supply is really easy.\n\n(00:32:47):\nYou know what? It was Rover. Rover had no problem it turns out with supply because who wouldn't want to make 50 bucks watching a dog for a few hours. It was a really easy sell and a lot of people could do it and wanted to do it so they actually found supply was not an issue.\n\n(00:33:01):\nBut in most cases exactly how you said most 10 times supply is what people are looking for.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:33:05):\nTotally.\n\n(00:33:06):\nI find that the counter example I hear a lot is eBay, how they were so good at aggregating demand, they were basically able to force suppliers to the terms that they like. But I can't imagine... It'd be interesting to talk to some folks who were at eBay in their early days that the whole thing didn't start up without them going out and figuring out who are the key suppliers we need to get on this thing so that we can get aggregating demand.\n\nLenny (00:33:32):\nYeah. You got to have some good stuff on eBay. I wonder if Beanie Babies or whatever they started with.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:33:37):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:33:39):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth.

So you said you were the second PM on iTunes back in the day and I'm curious what you learned from the experience you had working at Apple. I think I read somewhere you worked maybe closely with Steve Jobs and Jony Ive, but I don't know if that's true, but I'm curious just... No? Okay, but you do have a Steve Jobs story?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:34:57):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:34:58):\nOkay.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:35:00):\nYes. So I was very early on in the iTunes days I started interning there when I came out of grad school and my internship was actually in label relation and then I started a full-time job doing product marketing.\n\n(00:35:17):\nAnd at Apple at the time, I think even to this day, they didn't have a product manager title, they had product marketing managers. And so one of my colleagues who remains good friends to this day, Steve was the first also named Steve, not Steve Jobs was the first PMM working on iTunes and he primarily was doing all the client stuff. He launched the store and everything. But I think I was the second person in the iTunes group with that title. So that was really cool.\n\n(00:35:44):\nAnd then as far as the Steve Jobs story, I would think I mentioned to you people like hearing this story, nothing happened, I just went up to him and said, \"Hi, I'll tell the story.\"\n\n(00:35:53):\nBut I think the context of why people find it interesting is because of other stories about Steve. So let me give a little context.\n\n(00:36:01):\nThose Steve Jobs lore was that if you were in an elevator with him, you better be prepared to talk about what you do at the company because he had a habit of getting in the elevator and looking at you and saying, \"What do you do? What do you do here?\" And there were also rumors that people who had not given him a good answer that ended up being their last day at Apple.\n\n(00:36:24):\nSo there was someone who I didn't know personally but worked in my department before I got there who got in an elevator and looked up and Steve was approaching him. And so he went to press the button to open the door and accidentally press the one to close the door and was doing this press... You can't see me if you're listening on podcast but frantically pressing the button, trying to open the door, but accidentally pressing the close door button and the elevator going to its destination. And apparently he got off and just bolted straight up, ran down the hallway.\n\nLenny (00:37:02):\nHe'll never remember my face.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:03):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:37:04):\nI disappeared.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:04):\nSo that's the context.\n\n(00:37:07):\nSo in 2005, it's my first day of my internship at Apple and I had this situation where I attended graduation because I only had one semester left to go back to, so I just decided to attend the graduation. That happened basically the week before. And for those of you who are the job span, this is when he gave his really inspiring and famous Stanford commencement speech and it's an awesome, awesome thing to listen to.\n\nLenny (00:37:41):\nYou were at that speech?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:42):\nI was there, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:37:42):\nWhoa. People love that speech.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:47):\nIt's a good one. It's really-\n\nLenny (00:37:48):\nWhat did you feel being there listening to it in the moment?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:51):\nTotally inspired.\n\n(00:37:54):\nApple was not quite what it is today in terms of brand and influence and just it's at the peak. It's really come a long way. It was still when I met the recruiter at a conference, I was like, \"Apple? What do they do again? My roommate had a Mac, but what's iTunes? Oh, yeah, I think I've heard of that. I think...\"\n\n(00:38:19):\nThe dancing iPod silhouette ads which really sent Apple over the top. Those hadn't even really dropped yet, but it was starting, right? It was starting to percolate and bubble and you heard more and more about it and just the association with music was making Apple more cool.\n\n(00:38:35):\nBut that speech is... Talk about a commencement speech. That is top-notch.\n\n(00:38:41):\nAnd Steve's great at those. He was phenomenal storyteller.\n\n(00:38:44):\nSo graduation is what? Saturday, I go home Sunday. The Monday I started my internship and here we are at Cafe Max with my new coworkers and Steve is sitting literally at the table next to me. And so I was like, \"Oh my gosh, there's Steve. I would love to say hi and introduce myself and everyone at the table.\"\n\n(00:39:09):\nNow mind you, I hadn't heard this story about the elevator button in the full yet because it was my first day, but they're all looking at each other. They're like, \"Yeah, go say hi to him if you want, but you're an intern.\" They say, \"Hopefully, he doesn't fire you on your first day.\"\n\n(00:39:22):\nBut I've always, in my family and in my life, had this encouragement to say hi to people when you see them and let them know that you appreciate what they do and just thank them because it doesn't happen often.\n\n(00:39:39):\nA lot of times, people go and they ask for a picture or an autograph but this idea of just introducing yourself, saying hello, and thanking someone for something that they've done that impacted you to something that's been a way that my parents have encouraged me to behave in the world and something that I saw them do and saw them model because probably, again, coming from my dad being a musician and being fans of other musicians that like a thing in music, the artist culture that talked to one another about how something you created influenced you or whatnot.\n\n(00:40:09):\nSo I went up to him and I got up from my lunch table and walked over and I said, \"Hi, my name's Camille. I'm interning here this summer. It's my first day. I was at graduation at Stanford on Saturday and your speech was amazing. I was really inspired. I'm so excited to be here and so excited to work on this company and I just wanted to say thank you for spending your time doing that speech for us on Saturday.\"\n\n(00:40:38):\nAnd he was like, \"Who are you? What? You're an intern? Well, what are you doing here?\" It was a little... We had a little bit of an exchange. I had to clarify like, \"Yeah, I graduated, but I'm interning and I have another semester left.\" And he was like, \"Oh, okay. Well, welcome to Apple and good luck and I hope you have a really great experience this summer.\" And that was it. I didn't get fired and I said hello to Steve.\n\n(00:41:01):\nAnd after that, I felt like I knew him. Every time, I'd see him around campus I'd wave high and I think he had no idea who I was but he would look at me confused and then wave back hello.\n\nLenny (00:41:12):\n\"She's so friendly. Who's this person?\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:41:14):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:41:15):\nDo you still remember how you would've described what you do? I have a feeling it's seared in your head, but if not, then never mind.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:41:21):\nOh, my statement, if he had asked me where [inaudible 00:41:23].\n\nLenny (00:41:23):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:41:24):\nWell, yeah, I was lucky because one of the things that I did he would actually know exactly what it is which is I would manage press rooms whenever there was an iTunes launch. So this is very much grunt work.\n\n(00:41:38):\nBut when there would be a press event for one of the new iTunes 6 launch or whatever, they would have interviews with Walter Isaacson or I don't know if Kara Swisher was working back then, but whoever the journalist and Steve would have a room set up with an iMac computer with an iTunes library full of track. There would be whatever the new iPod was synced to that computer and all of the track. And after every interview, everything would have to be reset.\n\n(00:42:10):\nAlso, the library was crafted so he would give feedback for months on the content of the library because he would do demos. And so he wanted to know, \"Make sure all my favorite tracks are in there, my favorite Beatles records, my favorite Bob Dylan records, and who's this artist? Let me check them out. Okay, they don't cross the bar. Oh, what's this song? Oh, I love this song. Oh, add this.\" So he was very involved in the entire presentation and someone had to go do all that.\n\n(00:42:38):\nSo who better than the fresh out of masters of engineering in Stanford graduate student to go do all of the grunt work of making library? But those are the kinds of details that he paid attention to. And so I would've just told him that I did product marketing and one of my main responsibilities was fixing the press room for him and he would've been like, \"Oh, okay.\"\n\nLenny (00:43:01):\nYou mentioned that your title is product marketing manager and there was a recent kind of a hubbub on Twitter where Brian Chesky at Airbnb shared that they shifted the role of product manager to essentially the Apple model. And I'm curious what your perspective is on that approach to product, the Apple kind of way versus a traditional product manager?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:43:21):\nThey have done this very intentionally from what I've seen. I know they hired Hiroki actually from Apple-\n\nLenny (00:43:29):\nYeah. A lot of Apple people.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:43:31):\nYeah. And actually one of the new leaders they've hired, I don't know if you know Judson Coplan, dear friend of mine, we interned that same summer at Apple and he worked there for 15 years before heading over to Airbnb.\n\n(00:43:45):\nBut yeah, the Apple construct, it's much more of design and engineering led organizations, craftspeople I would say more so than strategy people. So that was one of the stark differences I saw in my transition from Apple to Google. There are a lot more like people from Coca-Cola and McKinsey and Bain at Google. I don't think any of those people even existed at Apple.\n\n(00:44:15):\nAnd it was very much like, \"Let's 3D chess our way into what our next move is going to be.\" Whereas at Apple it was, \"Let's tinker and let's craft and let's build and let's see what feels right.\" There's different approaches. As a result, the approach to product management was quite different.\n\n(00:44:33):\nSo I think it makes sense. Brian Chesky's background is a designer so it probably resonates a bit more within the Apple way.\n\n(00:44:41):\nAnd then in terms of what it means for product managers on an individual level, so again, there weren't product managers, the closest thing would've been CPMs, technical program managers who help manage the sprints and manage the schedule and listing out what features would happen.\n\n(00:44:59):\nI spent a lot of my time with the incredibly talented design team and if I had ideas of product features or... We would think months ahead of time, like what's the anchor story or what are the three key messages for the launch of iTunes 10 or whatever and we might have ideas for new features that would go in that.\n\n(00:45:19):\nBut because we had that moment in time, we knew well ahead we were planning for and you were working on the messaging and working on the consumer positioning again while in advance of anything actually being live or built. That was what framed what features you wanted to build and what problems you would put on the table to be solved as opposed to as clear cut metric you're trying to drive forward which is how product management has evolved in another capacity.\n\nLenny (00:45:52):\nAnd that's how it works at most companies.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:45:52):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:45:54):\nI want to come back actually to the creator economy stuff. I feel like you've worked in the creator economy longer than most anyone, and so I wanted to use our time to spend a little more time there. What about on the platform side? If someone were thinking about starting a company to cater to creators, to build a new platform maybe for creators to make a living, do you have any advice for them? Where do you think maybe there's opportunity? Where do you think it's like, \"No, probably you don't want to spend time here?\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:46:24):\nI think with any company, solving a real problem is the most important thing. So creators have lots of challenges and things that can be solved. Some painful things are more acutely felt than others.\n\n(00:46:40):\nI think at the core, every creator needs two things. They need to grow an audience and they need to get paid so that they can make a living. And in some ways, I do think that growing an audience is more important because with that audience, it opens up opportunities in ways that you can monetize.\n\n(00:46:59):\nBut there are all kinds of other things like we're talking about financing, health insurance, the list goes on, things we face as human beings, trying to be freelancers in the world often apply equally to people who are creative for a living.\n\n(00:47:14):\nAnd then there are unique things about the creator space like the spurts of energy, the spurts of creative flow that maybe don't apply in a salary job or an hourly job.\n\n(00:47:28):\nSo there are lots of problems out there still to be solved for creators. I don't think that this space is nearly solved, done, stick a fork in it. So my advice would be to look at the problems that exist and pick a real one and go for it.\n\nLenny (00:47:47):\nWise advice.\n\n(00:47:49):\nHave you seen this podcaster, Bobbi, I forget her last name, she rocketed up to the fourth biggest podcast in America with a few episodes of her podcast, she interviews Drake and a few comedians. Have you seen this person?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:05):\nI feel like I should, but as we said at the beginning, I'm such a music head, I don't listen to any podcast.\n\nLenny (00:48:11):\nThe reason I thought of her is I was watching a clip of her on an interview show and she hasn't made any money from this even though she's got the hottest podcast in America right now, and we're going to link to her in the show notes, but she's hilarious.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:25):\nAmazing.\n\nLenny (00:48:25):\nThere's something about her that just is really fun to watch. But okay, no podcast for you right now. We'll get you on a podcast. You're on the podcast.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:32):\nI'm on a podcast now.\n\nLenny (00:48:34):\nThere we go.\n\n(00:48:36):\nYou've mentioned your parents and I was reading your Wikipedia page and the way your parents are described on there is radical Buddhist artists technologists. I'm curious what that means maybe and then also just is there a memory or moment of growing up that highlights that aspect of them?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:56):\nWhat's funny about this is I had no idea how to Wikipedia page until you sent that.\n\nLenny (00:48:56):\nWhat?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:56):\nI don't know where it came from.\n\nLenny (00:48:56):\nOh my God. Who made this?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:56):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:48:56):\nThat's amazing.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:49:08):\nLike, \"What? I'm on Wikipedia?\" So that was funny.\n\nLenny (00:49:08):\nThat's crazy.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:49:13):\nYeah.\n\n(00:49:13):\nSo let's see. I grew up in San Francisco in the eighties and nineties. My parents started practicing Buddhism on the East Coast in the seventies. And my dad was, I mentioned he's a drummer and a musician, and he also had a studio. We had this closet under the stairs that he turned into a production studio and he was an artist.\n\n(00:49:43):\nHe worked for the city. My mom worked for the city, didn't have a ton of money growing up, and so a lot of the computer equipment came from the street. He would find... Somebody put a PC out... He was building PCs before the gamers were doing it. And I remember he would come home with boxes and boards and chips and would literally go get a book from the library or the store and would figure out how to assemble these computers, keyboards that were broken. He would just fix them. Probably should have been a mechanical engineer, super talented at this stuff.\n\n(00:50:15):\nBut basically he had this entire production studio with drum machines and all the equipment. And I was his helper. So I would help him solder stuff together and tinker and actually put these computers together. So that's probably... I don't know where that quote came from. I'll have to go click the link of what the reference is from, but that's some of the background there.\n\n(00:50:42):\nAnd the other thing that happened back in San Francisco in the eighties and nineties, we used to host Buddhist meetings in our house and back then there was a lot of what was called street propagation like the Hare Krishna used to be up and down Haight Street right around the corner for me.\n\n(00:51:01):\nThe Nation of Islam, which my brother joined for a period of time, would be selling Final Calls and bean pie brothers on the corners.\n\nLenny (00:51:09):\nYes.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:51:10):\nSo The Final Call is the newspaper at the time for the Nation of Islam.\n\n(00:51:15):\nAnd so it was just a different era, completely different from today, and us practicing Nichiren Buddhism, we had pamphlet that said, \"Nam myoho renge kyo,\" on them, and I would stand on the steps of our house and... We had a gate. So I would stand behind the gate and I'm probably seven or eight years old, just ask people walking by, \"Hey, if you're a nam myoho renge kyo, here's a pamphlet. Learn a little more. We're having a meeting at our house.\"\n\n(00:51:40):\nI'd laugh with my mom now. She's like, \"I can't believe we're doing that.\" It seems totally crazy now but at the time, it was just, again, coming off of the seventies, it was a very different era.\n\n(00:51:49):\nIf you've ever seen What's Love Got To Do With It, Tina Turner's probably... Who recently passed away, probably one of the more famous, more well-known practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism and she actually started practicing in the same kind of era, seventies and eighties... Or seventies probably.\n\n(00:52:05):\nSo that's what that means. And those are a couple memories that illustrate that moment. But you can see, music, technology, helping creators get paid, it's certainly influenced everything about how I am today.\n\nLenny (00:52:20):\nThat was a perfect description of your parents based on those stories. And it feels inevitable that you would've ended up doing what you're doing now. Product, technology, music, artists, creators. So that's amazing.\n\n(00:52:33):\nI'm going to ask one more question before we get to our very exciting lightning round, and the question is just around frameworks. Is there just a favorite framework or process or system or approach to building product or teams that you come back to and/or to share often that you think might be useful to listeners?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:52:51):\nI have this great manager in my experience at Hailo who turned me on to Marty Cagan who I since befriended and learned a ton from. And I just love the way that-\n\nLenny (00:52:51):\nReally?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:53:03):\nYeah, he's awesome. Actually, I should ask him about early days at eBay because I think he was there probably one of the people who got off the ground.\n\n(00:53:12):\nBut one of the things that I learned and that we really emphasized during that time is this idea of having dual track agile going where you're doing discovery and delivery simultaneously and doing it in a way that's not waterfall.\n\n(00:53:29):\nIt's not like, \"All right, the designers are going to go over here and tinker for months, and then once we've figured it out, we'll lob it over the wall to the coders and cross our fingers and hope everything works.\" But rather having this continuous cycle of essentially de-risking your assumption and getting to a point where you're able to do that with speed so that you can chart your way to new paths and to innovation by constantly figuring out where the errors are in your thinking or where things that you didn't expect to happen were going to happen.\n\n(00:54:04):\nSo I think everyone knows an impact effort or risk reward two by two and can map out different opportunities and things you might do on that two by two.\n\n(00:54:16):\nBut one of my favorite takeaways from that is that from this way of working around this dual track agile de-risking your riskiest ideas first approach is a concept of taking the things in the top, the biggest swing and actually prioritizing those first in terms of product discovery and figuring out what can you do to start de-risking because if you constantly put those off in favor of the lower risk or more predictable smaller swings, how are you ever going to truly innovate and get to the next level.\n\n(00:54:53):\nIt's a less safe choice. So it's someone that as a leader, you are in the hot seat and you can take accountability. So if some of these things don't pan out, it's on you and not on your team and give your team permission to fail and try things and de-risk those risky assumptions and get them to a point where they become low risk and they become predictable and you can just put them in the delivery column and execute them.\n\nLenny (00:55:18):\nIt reminds me of this piece of advice that people call eat the frog which is first thing in the morning eat the frog which essentially is do the hardest thing first and then there's the day becomes easier.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:55:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:55:30):\nI don't know why it's eat a frog, I don't know where that comes from.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:55:34):\nI don't know either. I like draw the owl. That's one of my favorite values, the Twilio ones.\n\nLenny (00:55:39):\nSay more. I would say more. What is that?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:55:44):\nCompanies have their values. One of them is draw the owl. It's really draw the effing owl and the meme is how do you draw an owl and you draw some circles and then you draw a fucking owl. So it's like just do it. At some point, you got to just figure it out and figure out how to do it.\n\n(00:56:10):\nExcuse my language, but it's funnier when you say what the value actually is which is sometimes you got to just go for it. You're not going to know the exact path to get there and maybe you won't have de-risked everything but you start with some circles and then you get it done.\n\nLenny (00:56:27):\nI love it. Cursing is very loud on this podcast, so I'm glad you went there.\n\n(00:56:32):\nAnd with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:56:36):\nI hope so. I didn't prepare this. I thought I'd figured out on the spot.\n\nLenny (00:56:40):\nGreat. Perfect.\n\n(00:56:41):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:56:46):\nThree-Body Problem, A Wrinkle in Time, and Octavia Butler's Kindred.\n\nLenny (00:56:53):\nThree-Body Problem's come up a number of times recently and there's a show coming out actually based on the book.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:56:58):\nI'm excited. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:56:59):\nI'm so excited. I've been watching Foundation which is also another series I've been excited to see, but it's like, I don't know what's going on. It's so complicated.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:07):\nHow is it? I've been waiting...\n\nLenny (00:57:08):\nEh.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:08):\nSo I'm a huge sci-fi head. I watched Battlestar Galactica. Classic. [inaudible 00:57:16] and so I've been waiting to see what happens with Foundation because I just don't have that kind of commitment in me these days.\n\nLenny (00:57:23):\nYeah. I don't know what to think of it. It's beautiful and there's a lot of interesting pieces but it just goes out... I think they're making a lot of stuff up. I don't know if you've read Silo. Have you read Silo?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:33):\nNo. But I saw the preview for the show. Another one I'm going to [inaudible 00:57:36] season two.\n\nLenny (00:57:37):\nThat's a good one to read because in the show... They're just making up stories. I don't know what they're doing. There's... Ninety percent of it, they just totally invent for the show and then there's a little bit that's connected to the story so I don't know what's going on.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:49):\nOkay. Cool. I didn't even know it was a book. I'll read it.\n\nLenny (00:57:51):\nOh, yeah. It's really good. There's three of them, but the first one's the only good one, so I found.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:54):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:57:55):\nAnyway, moving on. Speaking of this topic actually, any favorite recent movies or TV shows that you've really enjoyed?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:58:02):\nI've been watching Hijack over the last week with Idris Elba. So that's been fun. Got a couple episodes left there.\n\n(00:58:10):\nAnd then movies, I'm a huge Chris Nolan fan. So I haven't seen Oppenheimer yet, but can't wait to see it. Most of his movies I'm confused by, but the visuals are just so stunning if you let it go.\n\nLenny (00:58:24):\nYeah. I'm excited to see it too. I've not seen it either. Have a new child and it's harder to see movies [inaudible 00:58:30].\n\nCamille Hearst (00:58:30):\nOh, another good one. Shadow and Bone on Netflix.\n\nLenny (00:58:34):\nShadow and Bone?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:58:35):\nWay better than the book I have to say. Well, I read one series, the Six of Crows. This is my young adult sci-fi fantasy streak. Again, coming to the forth. But the show is incredible. It is so good. So if you're into-\n\nLenny (00:58:35):\nReally? Never heard that.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:58:48):\n... this kind of vibe, go for it.\n\nLenny (00:58:51):\nOkay. I'm going to check that out.\n\n(00:58:52):\nWhat is a favorite interview question that you like to ask people when you're interviewing them?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:58:58):\nI like to ask people to tell me about something they're really proud of that they accomplished and take me through the process and talk to me about why they're proud of it. I find you can learn so much about a person's motivations, about their work ethic, about what they care about, what good looks like to them, and I think those are all really important things to understand about a person if you're going to work closely with them.\n\nLenny (00:59:23):\nWhat is a favorite life motto that you just really like to share or often come back to either in work or in life?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:59:31):\nYeah. So there's one which is actually a Japanese proverb. I took Japanese in high school and college but this phrase is a frog in a well cannot know the ocean. And so the idea is to push yourself to expand your limits and your horizons and get out of the well so that you can experience the ocean.\n\nLenny (00:59:31):\nI love that.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:59:55):\nI got a better one, sorry.\n\nLenny (00:59:57):\nOkay, great. Go.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:59:58):\nAnother one.\n\nLenny (00:59:58):\nSure. Tell me.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:00:00):\nI learned this one from someone at Patreon because someone was posting this around the streets of San Francisco. It's become more known recently. Apparently, it's a Chinese proverb. I don't know if it's true or not but it is that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is now. So this idea that don't delay, maybe you missed the prime opportunity but waiting any longer certainly isn't going to help.\n\nLenny (01:00:28):\nI heard that one actually I was at the park in San Francisco and there was this piano thing, I think it was called, it's a botanical garden and people play piano all throughout once a year. And there's a guy that was just playing incredibly well and I left and he left around the same time and I was standing next to him. I'm like, \"Man, I wish I studied piano when I was younger.\" And he's like, \"The best time to have studied piano is 10 years ago. The second best time is to start now.\"\n\nCamille Hearst (01:00:51):\nYep, he's right.\n\nLenny (01:00:53):\nAnd I couldn't get off the hook there. He is like, \"You're right. And you're still not going to do it I guess.\"\n\n(01:00:59):\nFinal question, who's a favorite artist right now? Who are you liking?\n\nCamille Hearst (01:01:05):\nOoh. So I've been for probably a good three years now really into Afrobeat and right now there's this artist called Rema, R-E-M-A, who I first heard a couple years ago, he's got this track called Dumebi. But he has a song out right now that is, my opinion, song of the summer called Calm Down. I think Ariana Grande, is it, came over and did a verse on it? But I've just been listening to Rema Radio, Calm Down radio on Spotify and tons of Afrobeats artists. So that's the vibe I'm on right now.\n\nLenny (01:01:42):\nI love it. I actually... Once someone suggested some music at the end of a podcast and I was just like, \"Hey, we're going to end the podcast with that tune.\" And it turned out we did that and then YouTube shut us down because it's copyrighted and so I'm not going to offer. Never going to do that again, so we're just ending with regular music but we'll link-\n\nCamille Hearst (01:01:59):\n[inaudible 01:01:59] it's hard.\n\nLenny (01:02:00):\nI know. It's so tough. Come on. It's just like a few seconds. Give us a break.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:06):\nYou should have 30 seconds for your play. Right?\n\nLenny (01:02:06):\nI don't know. Maybe we'll-\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:07):\nDon't ask me, I'm not a lawyer.\n\nLenny (01:02:10):\nWe'll send you the bill.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:02:12):\nCamille, this was amazing. I think we're living the creator economy here. I really appreciate you making time for this.\n\n(01:02:17):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask any additional questions? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:24):\nI used to be real big on Twitter but that ship has sailed. I'm still on there. You can find me-\n\nLenny (01:02:30):\nIt's X now.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:31):\nYes, on X. Camillionz is my handle, C-A-M-I-L-L-I-O-N-Z. Also on Threads these days, trying that out, seeing if that sticks. So probably LinkedIn. You could find me on LinkedIn. I don't think anyone ever promotes that.\n\nLenny (01:02:31):\nThey do. Most people actually.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:48):\nDo they? Yeah?\n\nLenny (01:02:48):\nYeah.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:52):\nOkay.\n\n(01:02:52):\nAnd how can listeners be useful to me? Hey, go support your favorite creator. Find out, go to the show, find out if they have a Patreon. I would love to see more and more people feeling like they are patrons of the arts.\n\nLenny (01:03:08):\nAmazing. Maybe buy some merch.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:03:09):\nBuy some merch. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:03:12):\nCamille, thank you again for being here.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:03:13):\nThanks, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:03:15):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:03:18):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How Notion leveraged community to build a $10B business | Camille Ricketts\n\n## Transcript\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:00:00):\nThe way that you think about product market fit, you have to think about content market fit. So even though content feels like it's running adjacent to the actual product that you're putting out there, you still have to think about who is my audience? Who is the audience that I really want to have? Who is the audience that is going to be drawn to this most? Who are they? What is it that they really need in their lives? Even abstracting content from it at all. What is it that they need to get promoted? What is it that they need to avoid failure? What is it that causes them a great deal of anxiety in the day-to-day of their lives or their work? And can you create some type of content product that is going to address this for them?\n\nLenny (00:00:38):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Camille Ricketts. Camille was the first marketing hire at Notion and longtime head of marketing at Notion. Prior to that, she was head of content and marketing at First Round Capital, where amongst many other things, she launched the First Round Review, which holds a very special place in my heart because a guest post in the First Round Review essentially helped me launch my now career of newsletter and now podcast. Camille also did content marketing at Kiva and also comms and PR at early Tesla where she sat right next to Elon Musk for about a year and she shares some really fun stories about that.\n\n(00:01:26):\nIn this episode, we focus on two areas that Camille was very early in and has tremendous insights around. One, community led growth. What it actually is, when it's something you should invest in, how to do it well. All based on her experience building Notion's early community, which was a huge part of Notion's early success. We also talk about content marketing. When it's worth investing in, how to do it well, and all kinds of tips for building a content marketing machine. It was a total blast chatting with Camille and I am really excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Camille Rickets right after we hear a word from our wonderful sponsors.\n\n(00:02:02):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by ar Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. EPO does all that and more. Delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics, and instead you to North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And EPO supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo, geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10X your experiment velocity. Hey, Ashley, head of marketing at Flatfile. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?\n\nAshley (00:03:21):\nAt least 40%.\n\nLenny (00:03:23):\nAnd how many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?\n\nAshley (00:03:26):\nWell, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common considering customer files are chock full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n\nLenny (00:03:45):\nI am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n\nAshley (00:04:00):\nTotally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.\n\nLenny (00:04:17):\nIf you'd like to learn more or get started, check out Flatfile and flatfile.com/lenny.\n\n(00:04:27):\nCamille, welcome to the podcast.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:04:29):\nHello there. Thank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:32):\nAbsolutely, my pleasure. You have such a fascinating background working at so many world-class companies with so many fascinating people. Could you just take a minute to talk about some of the wonderful things you've done in your career just to set a little context for folks?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:04:47):\nYeah. Well thank you for characterizing them as wonderful.\n\nLenny (00:04:50):\nIt's true.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:04:51):\nI feel like it's been a quite circuitous path, but definitely has taken me to some interesting places. I started off as a journalist at the Wall Street Journal and then found my way into communications and marketing at Tesla Motors where part of my responsibility there was to sit to Elon's right and make sure he had all the data he needed at his fingertips when talking to the press, which was deep end of the pool on the PR learning. And then after that, found my way to First Round Capital where I was really fortunate to be at the ground floor of First Round Review, if anyone out there watching this is familiar with those pieces. Was there for about five years. Loved that team. Really incredible folks. And then they had invested in Notion really early on, and so I was able to meet Ivan Zhao as a result of that and him and Simon, and they gave me the opportunity to join as the first marketing hire at Notion. And that's what I was doing up until recently.\n\nLenny (00:05:44):\nI love that Elon tidbit. I like that it was on his right. His right hand person. What was that like? And is there something that you learned working alongside Elon, sitting next to Elon, about operating, working that maybe you've taken to other places you worked at?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:05:59):\nI mean, it was a long time ago, so I'll caveat that. This was before Model S came out even. So a lot of my work was, and this was a great opportunity, but driving around in the Roadster and talking to journalists and letting reporters ride in the car, which was very seductive and I think maybe just a little unfair from a PR standpoint. But in terms of what I learned, that was really the first job that I had that was necessitating just being incredibly on point with all the information. So making sure that I knew everything that could possibly come up in a conversation, being incredibly well-versed in just the topics at hand, I think that served me really well. I just have to be really, really, really quick and on it. And then the other thing that Elon I think is very talented at or definitely at the time really made an impression on me was painting an emotional picture of the vision that he was really going after and being able to convey the emotional quality of the mission to the people he talked to. So definitely at the time about the electric vehicle revolution and then space travel, I think he just knew how to make people feel about it that really enlisted a lot of hearts and minds and that is something that I've taken with me for sure.\n\nLenny (00:07:09):\nWould you say that was the most stressful place you've worked or have you found more stress post Elon?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:07:15):\nI think that that was the place where you just needed to be so on your game. Game face every single day. Which is a wonderful skill to learn. And then I think there were other moments in my career where just the stakes might have been a little bit higher. Certainly at Notion every day felt like we're building this thing together and we're in this very special moment. So yeah, I think there was a mix there.\n\nLenny (00:07:39):\nSpeaking of Notion, I think you mentioned this and if not, you were the first marketing hire at Notion. Is that right?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:07:44):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:07:45):\nWhat employee number was that?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:07:47):\nI was number 11.\n\nLenny (00:07:48):\nWow.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:07:49):\nYeah. So it was really a small squad of folks at the time.\n\nLenny (00:07:53):\nAnd how big are they now, roughly would you say?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:07:55):\nThe last I heard, I think that they were around 400. Maybe a little over 400.\n\nLenny (00:07:59):\nAmazing. And I think they're worth ... I don't know. Last valuation was like $10 billion. So there's been quite the journey. Must have been quite the adventure being at Notion during this time. What's maybe the most tangible memory of working at Notion in the early days? What was it like early day Notion?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:08:15):\nI think a lot about just what the environment felt like. This was the first very small startup that I had worked for. When I left First Round, I really wanted that experience. And the first office that I worked in was really just like a home. It literally had an apartment on top of this loft space and it just felt like we were a group of people who lived there together during the day, but it had that kind of home spun really warm quality. So we all took our shoes off. There was beautiful furnishings and rugs and we would all just sit around and drink tea and work together on these couches. So it really had that feeling to it. And then there were little quirks. I like to reminisce with my colleagues who were there at the time that we didn't have a great HVAC system.\n\n(00:08:58):\nSo during the summer it was really hot and then in the winter it was really cold and we would have these big industrial fans and at the time we were like, \"Oh, this is really bizarre.\" But now it's one of our favorite memories to talk about. Or for a while we didn't have overhead lighting, so me and my colleagues who were there working really late at night, it would just get darker and darker and darker. And one of my favorite folks there actually had a headlamp that she would switch on at a certain point in the evening. So that's the stuff that really comes up for me. We were all working really hard and in this thing together, but it's that team familial quality that stands out to me.\n\nLenny (00:09:35):\nI love how some of these early moments where it feels like, what the hell are we doing? We have to wear headlamps? It's super hot. When you're in it, you're like, this isn't maybe how our startup should be going. And it feels really painful and hard. But looking back, it's always the best memories, those hardships.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:09:52):\nIt truly is. And the moments that we were there late at night really trying to get something done before a big launch the next day, that's where our hearts lie, I think, to a large extent. That crew that was there.\n\nLenny (00:10:04):\nOn that note, and when you're talking about stress working with Elon, you talked about Notion had a different kind of stress. What's maybe the most stressful memory you have of working at Notion? Whatever you can share.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:10:14):\nThis is something that has long since been rectified, but the first day that we came back from break in 2021 ... We had all been sort of away for the holidays. We reassemble. I think it's January 3rd, 2021 perhaps. Had a massive outage that day that took down, not just us but also a lot of our peer companies. And so it was literally all hands on deck. We're suddenly seeing all of these people on Twitter pop up, on the Reddit pop up being like, \"Oh my gosh. What am I going to do?\" And it really reinforced for us how central Notion had become to so many people. So on one hand it was kind of this amazing moment of realization of how vital this thing we were building was all the time, which adds to the stress in the moment, but also your motivation overall.\n\n(00:11:01):\nAnd then we also saw on Twitter, and this is part of why community is such a core focus of mine, but people being like, \"They're trying really hard to get it back up. Give them a break.\" Or like, \"Sending hugs to the Notion team. We know you've got this.\" And we really appreciated that and that was just a very heartwarming aspect of it. But that day was definitely a scramble and we wanted to be as communicative as possible. So my team was really central to making sure that everybody knew what was going on, what the efforts were being made to fix it, time horizon, all of that. So they've long since hired the best infrastructure people I think in the industry and refactored the database and everything. So it's not an issue anymore, but certainly that was a moment of stress at the time.\n\nLenny (00:11:50):\nIt's interesting looking at those times. When you're in it, you're like, \"We are going to die. We're down. People will stop using Notion. We're in big trouble.\" When really people always come back if it's an awesome product. I think of last things down for a week, JIRA or Confluent, and people come back if it's an awesome product.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:12:07):\nI think that's a good tactical learning and hopefully a takeaway for folks who maybe will experience that moment is that truly there's more resilience built into the system than you might think.\n\nLenny (00:12:16):\nSo speaking of community, you talked about just how important that was during this time and then just in general. I was doing research on you and things that you've done over your career to prep for this podcast and I found there's two areas that you've led the charge on and we're ahead of the curve on and in part help innovate. One is community led growth and two is content marketing in a big way. And so I wanted to focus a lot of our chat on these two areas. Community led growth, it feels like a very buzzy topic on Twitter. Everyone's always talking about how the future of growth is community. You've got to build a community. You got to be community led and all these things. And so I want to try to make this concept concrete and help people understand should they invest in community. How can community help you? When does it make sense to you? When does it not make sense to invest? And so maybe just as a first question, just what is community led growth? What does that actually mean as a concept?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:13:09):\nYeah. I think it has become quite buzzy and it's certainly aspirational for a lot of product led growth companies and even those that are maybe a little bit outside of the product led growth orbit. And we're seeing all of these startups I think also come out that are about community and how to enhance the effects. In terms of how I think about what it actually is, it's when your community helps you achieve such ubiquity and such name recognition that it actually allows you to start moving upmarket into the enterprise. And I know that might be very specific to enterprise oriented companies, but that's how we defined it at Notion was the fact that so many people were talking about this, sharing what they had built about it, honestly starting businesses of their own around it to formalize the relationship with teams that I think it de-risked Notion as a choice for a lot of companies just because they had heard about it through so many channels. They had seen it on social media, they've heard about it on a podcast, their friend told them about it, they saw a billboard. All of that lended itself to larger and larger companies and teams buying more and more seats. So I think that's the power that the community had for us. And I see that also being analogous to what companies like Figma have been able to achieve.\n\nLenny (00:14:21):\nIt sounds like a lot of the way you're describing it is basically awareness. Brand awareness is what you found to be maybe the most useful element of this community that you built around Notion.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:14:31):\nI love using the word discovery because I think that that is even a little bit like a step further than awareness where true discovery is when you have intent to find out more. You've heard about it so many times or you've been intrigued by something that someone has told you to the extent that you're actually going to take the step of now learning about it. And that's where we really wanted to play and to emphasize our work.\n\nLenny (00:14:59):\nGot it. So it sounded like the KPI/OKR of your team was get more people aware and excited to explore Notion.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:15:08):\nYeah. And maybe this is a helpful tactical point. I think when people think about acquisition or discovery or brand awareness or brand in general, they're like what collection of metrics are actually going to give us insight into this? And the one that I found to be the most instructive was net new visitors to the Notion website. So month over month, how many new people who had never been there before were motivated enough to come and actually learn about the product. And that was really the responsibility of the brand team and the folks that worked with me on community and content and all of the awareness campaigns that we were putting out into the field was about getting more new people interested.\n\nLenny (00:15:49):\nSo that begs to the question, did you have any clever ways of attributing that new traffic to stuff your team did versus the SEO team or other teams?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:15:58):\nIn particular I'll call out the influencer marketing efforts that were really being run by this incredible woman, Lexi Barnhorn, where they were incredibly measurable. Where we were like, okay, well we're sponsoring people for this amount, these creators across these platforms and we know that people came from that content directly to the Notion website. So we were able to draw really tight connections. So I think that some types of content lend themselves to that. And then also with community, there's certain things you can do around helping your community members report on how many people are attending, et cetera, to give you that sense.\n\nLenny (00:16:36):\nSo you may be already answering this question, but I'm curious what efforts had the most impact to achieve these goals that you had of creating more awareness and discovery motivation and things like that. What actually worked?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:16:48):\nSo I'd say that the community efforts that were very big for us we're the ambassadors. Also making sure that people were hosting in-person events. This really took off in 2019. Obviously we paused for 2020, 2021, but now I just spent time with Notion's head of community, Ben Lang, who truly is the mastermind and genius behind so much of this and he says that they're back up to 30 in-person events a month around the world. So that really helped on the international scale of spreading ubiquity and ended up lending itself to relationships with Station F in France, which is the biggest startup campus in Paris. So really helping us work our way into those types of networks and then supporting those people to also start their own businesses and derive whatever reward they were looking for themselves. So we really wanted to align our goals with theirs.\n\n(00:17:38):\nA lot of those folks actually started revenue generating businesses as consultants or course makers or influencers. Some of them just wanted to build their own platforms online. So all of our efforts there are around building guides or counseling people one-on-one or making it easier for them to actually achieve those goals for themselves was also a big part of this growth. And then like I said, influencers. This was something that Ben started exploring in 2019 and we were so pleasantly overwhelmed with the amount of traction and traffic that was driven by working with some of these influencers. And now that program has exploded into a multi-channel effort that's huge for Notion.\n\nLenny (00:18:24):\nAwesome. The influencers makes a lot of sense. I want to learn more about this ambassador program and what that was about with events and maybe just broadly, I imagine a lot of founders might be listening and they're like, \"Yeah, this all sounds awesome, but how do you know if it's doing anything?\" Events. That would be great, but how much is it worth investing? How much time and attention does it take? How do we know if this is actually ROI positive? Is there anything you learn there about just ... Is it a founder must believe in this as a thing that is probably going to work sort of thing? Or is there something you found to convince people like, yes, this is how you can know it's working?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:18:58):\nThat's a great question. I think that we were really fortunate that Ivan saw the inherent value in community from the very beginning and was deeply supportive. And actually one of my number one recommendations for anybody who suspects the community could be a big growth driver is to not make metrics the be all end all at the very beginning. So we didn't necessarily start measuring things very concretely until last year with community. Mostly because we had already seen so much organic scale that we saw being tied to our community efforts in some way in terms of where we were geographically expanding, how people were reporting that they had discovered us whenever we surveyed them. So that type of motion. And I think for any company that is seeing this type of just organic fervor, one of the worst things you can do is say, let's cut this off at the knees if it's not generating ROI.\n\nLenny (00:19:52):\nI imagine internally there's just like obviously this is good. We may not be able to measure it, but it feels like this is very good for Notion. It feels like especially for a prosumer product like Notion, it makes a lot of sense because it's driven by people using it and then they bring it into the company, like you said. Maybe it's less ROI positive or just one enterprise product. Do you have any thoughts there? Is this a great strategy for prosumer enterprise products more so than more enterprise-y?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:20:19):\nDefinitely I think if you have a long sales cycle or a high price point where there has to be many, many, many touchpoints in order to get somebody to decide to buy, I'm not sure that community should be the number one thing that you invest in. Certainly for freemium products, I think for a lot of them, especially if they have what I'm going to call the atomic unit of sharing, which I will define out, it becomes a no-brainer. I think that community lends itself particularly well if you have something that your product creates that people want to share because it exhibits something about themselves. So at Notion it was templates or even people just creating their own workspaces and being really excited to show them off. So Notion really benefited from being a creative product, but the same is true of Figma or Canva or any of these where showing people what it is that you've created is an aspirational thing to do. Because you are showing that you are really well versed in how to use the products, extremely organized. You're self expressing in some way. So if your product does have that element to it, I think that community is a great investment.\n\nLenny (00:21:34):\nYou touched on this point, and I don't think people realize this, but you can make a lot of money creating templates on Notion, right? That's a whole ecosystem. Can you talk about that? Because I don't think a lot of people know this.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:21:45):\nYeah. This is one of the reasons that I would advise any of the companies that feel like they fall into this category start early. Because you need to nurture all of these different routes that people in your community can take. Certainly early on I think that the people that we initially recruited in the ambassadors didn't see themselves doing maybe even close to a million dollars in business around helping other teams succeed with the product or selling templates. I remember really early on, probably mid 2021 we heard of one creator who had made $35,000 in four months selling one template and that was a very common story then from that point forward. And helping them do that, actually creating the guide material and the networks and also the connections between the people who are running similar businesses who could help each other, that all became really fundamental. But to your point about, oh is this actually related to the enterprise motion for Notion? So many companies now of many sizes are relying on the consultants that first came up through our community and some of those consultants are now employing dozens of other people.\n\nLenny (00:22:53):\nThat's incredible. There's no better way to motivate someone to evangelize Notion than have their income rely on Notion.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:23:00):\nAnd it's also just inspiring for us, honestly. There's so many people who started off with not very many followers and now they are celebrities within this ecosystem.\n\nLenny (00:23:12):\nSo maybe coming back to the ambassador program, that's separate from this selling Notion templates ecosystem. What is the ambassador program?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:23:19):\nThey're actually quite blended because the folks who are excited about Notion, it takes a lot of forms. Sometimes they want to host events, sometimes they want to build templates. So we would actually have channels inside of our Slack instance for the ambassadors that had these areas of focus based on what people really were passionate about or wanted to do and they were like a force multiplying flywheel for each other. Because a lot of folks would enter the ambassadors program and then I'm happy to talk about champions as well, which is a little bit different, and then discover what it would mean for them to build templates and it became motivating for that reason. So on the champions side of things, and this is maybe speaking a little bit more to the enterprise as well, we wondered if the same DNA that existed among consumers for the most part in the ambassadors could work for folks who were inside of our customer companies. And so we launched another community, another Slack instance for folks who were the most passionate or the most avid users of Notion inside of our customer companies, which has become just a wonderful channel for customer success to be more communicative with those companies, make sure that things are sticking or obstacles are being overcome. And that's been designed very specifically that way and it has been really, really valuable over time.\n\nLenny (00:24:35):\nOkay. So let me try to understand this. Champions are basically the most active users of Notion. You put them in a Slack and help them become even more excited and make sure they're happy. Ambassador. I still don't totally understand what is an ambassador? Is that someone you're paying to help promote Notion? What does that actually mean when you're an ambassador?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:24:52):\nThey're people who are really just passionate about the product. So it's not transactional. They're people who love building with Notion. They love sharing what they've built in order to help others. And they really just want it to be a bigger part of their lives. And I think that one of the points about community is that it's not just a one-to-one conversation with us. The big draw over time, maybe people joined because they would get early access to features. We would get their feedback. That became really important for our product team or because we would offer AMAs with some of our folks internally. But over time it was really because they were forming these bonds with each other and learning so much from each other that most of the time someone would come in and say, I'm struggling with this or I don't quite know how to use this and it would be another member of the community that would help them more immediately. So it really allowed them to form these dense networks of friendships that I think became just a positive part of people's lives.\n\nLenny (00:25:51):\nWhat I'm taking away from this partly is you identify a group of people that are interested in Notion, excited about Notion and then just lean in to support them. There's people that are buying Notion and that are power users, help them be better power users. Influencers that are kind of excited about Notion, pay them to promote Notion. Then the ambassadors that are people just passionate about Notion, help them be more passionate. And then the people making templates, help them be successful. Is that roughly how you think about it? Just identify something that's working and make it more effective?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:26:21):\nI think if it doesn't sound too reductive, yes. I would also say that one of the things that I think Ben was best at is not putting a one size fits all experience on any of this. I think that some communities get built where people are like, okay, well we have this community and it's going to be this and this and this, or these are the types of programs we're going to offer or these are the types of interactions we're going to have. As opposed to I think a lot of listening of the people who are actually participating. Really early on one of the things that Ben did that I thought was really amazing was he'd spend a ton of time just on Zoom having conversations, one-on-one conversations, semi small group conversations just saying, \"Why are you here? Why do you like participating in this? What is it that would make it better?\" And really helping our entire team follow their lead. I would recommend highly not necessarily coming in with preconceived notions about what a community needs to look like.\n\nLenny (00:27:21):\nYou touched on this, that if the founder believes in the power of community, this becomes so much easier. A lot of founders are like, \"Nah. That's a waste of time.\" Do you think founders are convincible that building community and investing in community is worth it? Have you seen that effective where a founder just comes into it being like, \"Nah, I don't think this is worth our time,\" and then they get convinced later? Or is it just like, \"Nah, forget it. Don't even try.\"?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:27:45):\nI mean I've talked to a lot of different people who come at this with different impressions and everybody knows more about their company than I do, but I do think that if ubiquity or just the sheer word of mouth engine is something that is going to be valuable for your company over time, I would really urge people to sit down and really think carefully what is going to be more conducive to our long-term success? Is it going to be that ubiquity or is it going to be revenue now? And I think if we look at a lot of the companies that have been just wildly successful from the start, they're people who have pushed off maybe monetizing every little thing if it's going to really put a damper on that type of enthusiasm and momentum that people have to share it at what it is they're doing. Because there's always opportunity I think later once you have that big tide of people who are not just excited but also legitimizing what it is that you do every single day, that gets mobilized in a lot of different directions and you have a lot more options then.\n\nLenny (00:28:47):\nWhat's interesting about Notion is you have high LTVs when you sell to larger companies, but the initial users are often just regular folks. And so I think it's a unique place where you have cash to spend on making it ubiquitous and getting the word out through all these community efforts because it'll pay off. And a lot of companies probably don't have that advantage. So would it feel right to say that this is really effective for product led, growthy, freemium products most? Is that a good way to think about it?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:29:20):\nYeah. Or I think if organic growth is something that you see being really beneficial or if organic growth happens to be something you really have to crack because you don't always have everything you need for paid growth from either a resourcing standpoint, team standpoint, really figuring out how to get that organic flywheel going can serve you well. It becomes this buttress for any paid growth you explore in the future.\n\nLenny (00:29:47):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta. Helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential, SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months. Less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Get started today.\n\n(00:31:04):\nWhat other companies come to mind when you think about companies that effectively did community led growth, did community well and grew in large part because of community?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:31:14):\nI've mentioned Figma a couple times here so I don't want to beleaguer the point, but they're certainly a team that I've looked up to through my entire experience at Notion. We were kind of sibling companies in a way. Huge kudos to Claire Butler over there who I knew led all of those efforts and we would trade a lot of knowledge back and forth, which was so lovely to have that relationship. But they did an amazing job I think in a similar vein to Notion of saying, okay, people are really excited to create these things and then put them out there on the internet. So how can we just fuel that particular motion out there? The other example I'll give, which is a little bit of a different tack is Stripe. And when Stripe launched Stripe Atlas, not necessarily core to the initial product line that Stripe was known for and what had been foundational for them, but allowed them to build this community among probably their core demographic at the time, which was founders and startups that were growing through the stages to mid-market, they were able to cultivate this huge audience of founders around giving advice and providing them with resources to actually get started and do that zero to one journey.\n\n(00:32:22):\nSo while it was adjacent to maybe what the company's core mission was, it allowed them to actually create community among their customer base because they were like, \"We're knowledgeable. We can share these things with you that we know are core to your journey.\" So I would encourage anyone who's thinking about community that way to be like, \"Oh, maybe it doesn't have to be around our product. So specifically. What other knowledge or resourcing can we offer to the people who we do want using our product that's going to be really instrumental for them and can we convene them around that idea?\"\n\nLenny (00:32:54):\nI'm noticing a strong correlation between legendary generational companies, Figma, Stripe, Notion and community efforts and building community. That's interesting.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:33:05):\nYes. I'm a big proponent. At the same time I don't think that community is right for every company. I think that there is definitely an analysis to run on that. But hopefully this is helpful for those who can identify that those are attributes they have.\n\nLenny (00:33:19):\nTo pull on a thread there, what are maybe thoughts for when it probably doesn't make sense to invest a lot of efforts into building a community around your product? We talked a little bit about high-end enterprise products. Is there anything else that just like, man, it's probably not worth your time?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:33:34):\nLike I said, if it's more of a sales led culture that you have, which is definitely true of products that are a little bit pricier or that require longer contracts, so understanding that. But I do think the community takes on different forms and I think when you hear the word community, you think of a big forum of some type, whether it's a Slack instance or something else where people are chatting away all day long. And I don't think it has to be that. That's not the only representation of it. So if you think about what is going to be right for you at any given time, I actually created this two by two matrix, which maybe I'll share with you after this. And on the axis you have, whether you have hit product market fit or if you're still exploring product market set and then whether you're strongly enterprise or strongly consumer. And based on where you land in that two by two matrix, there's a form of community or a community related initiative that could be right for you.\n\n(00:34:31):\nSo just to give you an example of maybe an extremely different form factor from Notion, let's say that you're still on your way to product market fit and you're a strongly enterprise oriented product. I think that you have the opportunity to do customer advisory boards, which is really convening even smaller circles of ideal fit users and making sure that they are connected to each other as well as you, and then incentivize to provide you with feedback. Understanding that they're really on the ground floor of this journey with you and that they're going to be able to have influence over whatever you do in the future. Those folks can end up growing into your biggest evangelists and I've seen that happen a number of times and I would still consider that community even though maybe that is not what comes to mind for folks.\n\nLenny (00:35:20):\nWell I imagine that becomes the seed of a community that you eventually build. Let's definitely link to this in the show notes. Can you give maybe a couple more examples of this grid? So that was pre-product market fit and then what was the other?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:35:32):\nStrongly enterprise.\n\nLenny (00:35:33):\nEnterprise. Okay, cool. Yeah, what are a couple other of the elements of this grid?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:35:37):\nSo if you're strongly enterprise and you have product market fit, let's say, this is something that Notion has really benefited from, but really emphasizing the champions in the consultants communities. So the folks who, like I said, may be inside of your customers who really get it, really get your value, really are excited to help you land and expand perhaps inside of their companies, making sure that they have a place to gather and a place to feel like they are more connected with your team than the average person gets to be. That they are special and that they have access. And then on the consultant side, like I said, just making it really easy, removing friction, helping promote the folks who want to be out there, helping you succeed with more customers. Like Salesforce. I know that this is a golden oldie of an example, but if you talk to anybody who was really early at Salesforce, they really went into this where they saw people emerging who wanted to help other companies. This layer of people who didn't work at Salesforce but saw the opportunity to help other companies actually succeed with it, implement it, grow with it, and that's become a massive part of Salesforce's model. And so if you're in that quadrant, figuring out how to start moving people in your customer base into those categories.\n\nLenny (00:37:00):\nThis is awesome. Maybe let's do one more of this grid and then we'll leave one for people to click into and check it out.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:37:04):\nI'll talk about Notion's quadrant, which is the one that I would put up and to the right, which is you have product market fit and you're maybe a little bit closer to the consumer side of the spectrum. Obviously Notion runs the full gamut, but I would say especially early on I think that that's where we saw things take root and that's where I think ambassadors and influencers really take off. Individuals who are going to be extremely vocal, extremely excited, and where you're going to see more of this wildfire spread, at least trying the product, using the product, understanding what the product is. So if you can try to fuel that type of motion if you're in that quadrant, that's helpful.\n\nLenny (00:37:43):\nI want to come back to this ambassador program real quick because it feels like something that a lot of people talk about and can do and especially in this quadrant of product market fit and consumer. How does this work? Is it you select, here's 100 ambassadors we're going to pick because we think they're awesome and they're great examples of people using, say, Notion and then we're just going to provide them with all the help they need to be successful with Notion. How do you think about creating an ambassador program?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:38:10):\nI actually think it's pretty analogous to when you're thinking about positioning your company because I think the best first step for any positioning exercise is to think who are our best fit customers? And it's not necessarily who we wish they would be, but it's actually the hard cold reality of who they actually are. Where it's like these are the people that seem to be really getting it. They're paying us more, they're talking about it just organically. So really figuring out everything about who they are and making sure that those are the people that you're actually inviting in early. So the initial base of the ambassadors program which started back in 2019 was just 20 people and they were the 20 people who we happened to see be the most vocal already across Twitter and a couple of other social media platforms because they had that shared quality of wanting to be really vocal and expressive about their experience with the product. So that would be my advice for how to get one of these rolling.\n\nLenny (00:39:13):\nAnd then what do you do for them?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:39:13):\nDefinitely making sure that there's enough incentive built in, right? Because like we said, it's not meant to be a transactional relationship, but we want them to feel like they are having a special experience, that they are connected with the company in a unique way. And it was so interesting to us how giving them the preview of features was so motivating to them and being able to use them and then give us feedback and feel really heard by the product team. So that was a big area of focus and I know that that still is and it's become even more of a robust conversation between the community and the team at Notion itself.\n\n(00:39:52):\nAnd then also we would do these very special experiences where Ivan or Akshay or Simon or MLM who's the head of engineering there would be available for these conversations where they would answer questions and it would feel like a very proprietary space. I think that that was really interesting to people. And then of course the things that you would suspect around subsidizing events. Making sure that people felt that they were actually supported by us to throw these events. And then also promoting their work. So if you look back at the social media channels, so much of the focus is on putting the creations of the people we were working with front and center as opposed to talking about just what the company was up to.\n\nLenny (00:40:36):\nHave you ever written about just how to design an ambassador program or has anyone written about how Notion did this? Because this is really interesting.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:40:42):\nI don't know if anything has been written or went into all of this detail, but it was truly one of the more magical and I think still is one of the more magical parts of this entire endeavor. And now that team is three people. So Ben who's still there doing amazing things, Francisco who joined us in 2021. Or sorry at the end of 2020. And then Emma. And they are just all day every day talking to people around the whole world. The international component of this is also just completely wild to see.\n\nLenny (00:41:18):\nThis could be a future First Round Review post, which we'll talk a bit about.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:41:21):\nYes. Perhaps.\n\nLenny (00:41:24):\nLast question about this segment. Say someone is convinced they want to start investing in community and we talked about this two by two, but maybe just broadly if you had to boil it down to two or three pieces of advice for founders, for teams thinking about investing in community led growth and community in general, what would be some of those pieces of advice?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:41:44):\nI don't know if you want to link to this in the show notes as well, but I actually put together some commandments for community builders.\n\nLenny (00:41:50):\nOoh. Absolutely.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:41:51):\nSome alliteration. So the thing that I think were very defining for us early on, I already mentioned something about this, but not trying to hit a number early on. So don't dilute the impact of what it is that you're trying to do in order to show growth. I think that that's very important to protect yourself early on. So making sure that you are learning what individuals really want out of this and making them feel like they're very seen and very heard. That was a big area of focus and I think it's what kept people really engaged and coming back and feeling like this was a secondary family for them. And then one of the things that was most interesting to us that once we started sharing what was going on in the community with folks at Notion. So we would do this during all Hands meetings or on Slack, Ben would post these really incredible updates of just all of the activities of people in the community and what they were up to every month.\n\n(00:42:46):\nAnd it was just so inspiring for everybody inside the company that I think it all rallied us to do even more, I guess, day to day and really understand who it was we were building for.\n\nLenny (00:43:00):\nIs there any other commandments you would add for if you already have a community going? If you have something bubbling for things you should do to keep it healthy and consistently good and growing?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:43:12):\nYeah. I mean this is going to be a little contrarian perhaps, and I mean this is just one data point for me, but not growing it so big so fast. One thing that we actually thought about pretty carefully was what a rate of healthy growth would be. So there actually is an application process for joining the ambassadors. It's a very light application process and it really is just so that we know how many people are interested in this. And then they're inducted around ... I think at the time it was 20 people at a time every month. So that it wouldn't feel like all of a sudden this had changed in terms of how the interactions were feeling, but rather gave everybody time to welcome the new people in and get to know them. And one of Ben and I's favorite things ever about working at Notion I think was when we would induct new people into the ambassadors and they would introduce themselves and say, \"Hey, I am from Venezuela and here's the ways in which notion has changed my life.\"\n\nLenny (00:43:12):\nThat's awesome.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:44:11):\n\"I'm from Hong Kong and here's how it's changed my life.\" And all of that was just so fulfilling. That would be the number one thing I would say is give your community time to actually grow in what feels like an organic fashion as well. Because I think ironically, and then I'll stop rambling about this, but if you grow to something like, oh we have 5,000 ambassadors, which feels really good to say on a website, the conversation is actually very muted. I think because people feel like they're speaking to an auditorium whenever they say anything. I think it's because you don't really have a sense of who else is there with you. So helping to defray those concerns I think is a good course of action.\n\nLenny (00:44:57):\nI've seen the same thing with the growth rate being really important with my newsletter Slack community. I think most listeners probably know this, but if you're a paid newsletter subscriber, you get access to the Slack community. There's about 10,000 people in there. And I find the filter of people that are willing to pay for content like a newsletter is a really good filter for awesome people. And so it ends up slowing growth in a really healthy way and then just creating this filter of the people that really want to self-improve and value the sort of thing join, and it becomes a really amazing group of people.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:45:31):\nYeah. It feels like such a ... I don't know. There's an emotional quality to it I think when that's the case. And all of those people end up being so incredibly impactful. The last point I'll make about community at Notion is that a lot of those people, and we actually ended up launching I think a channel for folks who wanted to do this in particular, but run communities external to Notion's actual owned communities. So you end up with Facebook groups that have ... I think Notion in Vietnam has like 250,000 members. Or the subreddit, which I now know has 210,000 people in the Notion subreddit. And those are all run and moderated by community members who just love running their own communities.\n\nLenny (00:46:14):\nI feel like you've achieved your OKRs of ubiquity of Notion.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:46:19):\nYes. It was always a value at Notion to make sure that we were reaching as many people as possible.\n\nLenny (00:46:26):\nIt's working. One tactical question. Where does the own community of Notion live? Is it a Slack? Is it an online thing you've built yourself?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:46:34):\nIt is in Slack. And the thinking there, and it still is, was that we really just wanted to be in the course of people's everyday lives. We didn't want to be this other destination that you would have to make a point to going to every day.\n\nLenny (00:46:45):\nThat's exactly how I thought about it with my newsletter Slack community. PMs and founders, they're already in Slack all day. And just that badge, being on the app telling them there's something to check is such a powerful feature versus download a whole new app or go to a whole new website, you're never going to go there. It has to be 10 times better to pull you to a whole new site and change your habits.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:47:05):\nI absolutely agree.\n\nLenny (00:47:07):\nI'm glad we're all on Slack. Slack's so underrated. I feel like people hate on Slack all the time, but it's such a good product.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:47:14):\nWe all love it. It's just becomes something we take for granted in the background there.\n\nLenny (00:47:17):\nYeah, exactly. Okay. This is a good time to shift to our second topic, which is around content and content marketing. So you started the First Round Review at First Round?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:47:26):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:47:27):\nI don't know if you know this, but First Round Review was a big part of my early trajectory with this newsletter life. I did a guest post in the First Round Review and that was-\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:47:37):\nI remember this.\n\nLenny (00:47:38):\nThat was a huge deal for me. That was my first 500 subscribers to my newsletter.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:47:42):\nWow.\n\nLenny (00:47:44):\nThen I did another guest post down the road, but that was not as important. It was a big part of my early path down this life. And so thank you for creating that platform. I was very honored to be involved.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:47:57):\nThat's fantastic to hear and exactly what we wanted to have happen. Just extraordinary operators being given a platform and then using it to do whatever it is that they wanted to do. That was part of the dream always.\n\nLenny (00:48:10):\nIt's working.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:48:11):\nYeah. I'm thrilled because now people are learning so much from you.\n\nLenny (00:48:14):\nYeah. It's an inspiration for where when I started too, just I wish I could be as good as the First Round Review and the stuff just keeps coming and coming. It's amazing. And I know other folks run it now. I don't know if they want to be named. They like to be behind the scenes.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:48:27):\nThey do, but I'm going to shout them out anyway because they do such an extraordinary job. I mean, Jessi Craige Shikman over there has been doing this now for longer than I did and she is absolutely incredible and her team is extraordinary and I don't miss it every single time it comes out.\n\nLenny (00:48:44):\nYeah. I tried to thank her my post. She's like, \"Don't mention that. I'm behind the scenes.\"\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:48:44):\nMaybe I'll ask her.\n\nLenny (00:48:53):\nWe have to give her some cred somehow.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:48:56):\nYeah, absolutely. She deserves it.\n\nLenny (00:48:58):\nSo kind of zooming out, content marketing, maybe just to give some examples of just what are some of the most impactful things you've been a part of that come from creating content? Whether it's Notion, First Round, anywhere else, what are some examples?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:49:11):\nYeah, I'll give a few examples. Obviously First Round is a huge example and so I'd be remiss in not going into some detail there. And truly that was a team effort from the very beginning. I joined in 2013 and again, I was just so fortunate to work with a leader who believed in it from the very beginning. Josh Kopelman, who's the partner there who was just a massive supporter of mine. Phin Barnes on the partnership team. But then particularly Brett Burson who was running the platform team, which is where all of these value added services lived.\n\n(00:49:40):\nSo it was me and an events person and the talent person and Brett just gave us all of the runway and all of the belief and support that we needed. And he was really bullish on content and really helped from the beginning, connecting me with incredible interview subjects. Because this whole thing, the only reason I think it survived and did as well as it did is that we were able to land a few really big names at the very beginning. And then of course that helps you down the road whenever you're trying to convince anyone else to do it because you say so and so and so and so have already been featured. So that was I think just a big point of confidence and also tactically, for anyone out there thinking about it, if they can leverage whatever connections they have in that vein.\n\nLenny (00:50:27):\nI was at dinner with Brett yesterday.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:50:29):\nOh my god. What a guy, right?\n\nLenny (00:50:31):\nFirst Round event. What a guy. That guy's amazing. I'm a huge fan. He's built an incredible platform and program at First Round.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:50:39):\nAnd he's one of the people that I've learned the most from, certainly. But more specific to your question around what the content program was able to do there, certainly discovery of First Round. I think prior to that it was a very successful VC fund, but I think we got in front of all kinds of people, particularly in non-traditional geographies or non-traditional founder types or all of that. People who are inside large companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, whenever we would look at our list of subscribers, we had an disproportionate number of email addresses within those companies that were clearly curious about the startup experience. And I think First Round Review was helpful in moving them more toward that mindset and then them obviously understanding that First Round would be a great first stop for them.\n\nLenny (00:51:23):\nWhat would you say is key to content being valuable? So you're talking about the First Round Review became really effective for people learning about First Round, working with First Round, discovery of First Round, but it's not just with content you just write some stuff and it works. It doesn't work that way. What have you learned about just what do you have to get right? You mentioned have names people recognize. Is there anything else you've learned over the years of just like, here's what we need to get right if you're trying to use content as a way to create discovery and awareness of your stuff?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:51:54):\nThis is something that I think we chatted about briefly, but the way that you think about product market fit, you have to think about content market fit. So even though content feels like it's running adjacent to the actual product that you're putting out there, you still have to think about who is my audience? Who is the audience that I really want to have? Who is the audience that is going to be drawn to this most? Who are they? What is it that they really need in their lives? Even abstracting content from it at all. What is it that they need to get promoted? What is it that they need to avoid failure? What is it that causes them a great deal of anxiety in the day-to-day of their lives or their work? And can you create some type of content product that is going to address this for them and is actually going to have that value?\n\n(00:52:36):\nSo I think approaching content the way that you would a product in a lot of ways is very instructive way to sort of start hashing out your strategy. Starting with your audience, understanding their big needs. You've heard this, I'm sure, and most of your audience has, but there's the vitamin versus painkiller dichotomy. And painkillers always win. So can your content be a painkiller? Can it help people out of situations that are causing them a lot of pain? Can it help people stop being so confused or can it make them even feel less alone in their experience? That was a big one for First Round Review is helping operators share failures or suboptimal situations in the spirit of helping many other people feel like that was normalized and that the experiences they were having weren't as dire as maybe they had thought.\n\nLenny (00:53:27):\nI love that. It connects so much with the way I think about writing. I use the jobs to be done framework a little bit here where I'm just like, what job am I doing when I'm writing a post? And you tell me if this makes sense to you, but I feel like there's four jobs to be done of a newsletter. Either how people make money. There's newsletters, here's how to invest, here's how to buy Bitcoin and win. How people make money. Entertain people. There's a lot of funny things, memes and cartoons and things like that. How people get better at their work or life, which is the category we're in. And then inform people. Like news.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:54:02):\nYes. What they didn't know before. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:54:05):\nAnd it feels like you got to do really well. You got to pick which bucket you're in. And let me know if you can think of any others because these are the four that I always come back to. And then pick your bucket and then it's be the best at that thing in your category. The way I think about it.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:54:18):\nI love that listing out of those and also the acknowledgement that there are emotional jobs to be done. That there are not just utilitarian jobs to be done. It's not just, you didn't know this before and now you do, but it's like you felt this way before and now you don't or you do. And I think that that's underestimated. So I love that you called out entertaining people because we're all working in an industry where it's wonderful to interact with some of that sparkle and levity. So I love that approach.\n\nLenny (00:54:45):\nAnd something else that goes unsaid I think in the way you talked about this is just putting in the time to make it really high quality. If you look at a First Round post, how much time would you say goes into in the typical First Round Review post?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:54:58):\nOh gosh. Here's where I'm going to shout out my writing partner at First Round, Sean Young, who was there with me for most of my time there and he and I would always, always talk about this. But it would take eight hours to just write the thing. And that's after you had done all of the prep work of making sure that your interviewee was feeling really anchored and understanding a topic that you were both really excited about and making sure you were mining all of the tactical gems from that conversation. And then you would start writing and that would be another eight hours. I don't know if that's your experience, but certainly was ours.\n\nLenny (00:55:31):\nYeah, very similar. I don't tie myself, but I feel like the median time to write a post for me is about 10 hours.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:55:37):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:55:37):\nAnd that's I think the key that a lot of people don't think about. One is they don't have the time, and two, they don't realize they should spend this much time because the bar's so high for content on the internet as we all know. There's so much stuff out there. And so to get above that noise you have to really make it really good and that just takes time. And I find this really strong correlation between the time it takes me to write a post and how well it does. It's very highly correlated. And the advantage folks like say the First Round Review have and I have is I do this and there's a team doing this. And so people that are doing this on the side, it's much harder because they don't have that time.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:56:14):\nIt is. I end up admiring those people a lot where I'm like, how are you doing this?\n\nLenny (00:56:18):\nYeah. They're sacrificing something.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:56:19):\nYeah. But truly, it's a very shared experience with you. And I think that a lot of that was making connections between the information that you had available from these interviews. So not just straight here's what this person said, but how can you draw connections between those things, connect the dots, pull out bigger themes. All of that is really where I think a lot of the time went.\n\nLenny (00:56:43):\nSo you said you had this content market fit questionnaire that you talked through. You're going to send me a link that we can point people to check it out, right?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:56:51):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:56:51):\nOkay, awesome.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:56:52):\nAbsolutely. A lot of it is about getting to know your audience to an almost beleaguered degree.\n\nLenny (00:56:57):\nWhich is basically what job will you do for them, like you said. And so that makes sense. Maybe a couple more questions. Something that I've noticed a lot, and this is related to content and just PR and stuff like that. I've noticed a lot of people on Twitter and founders are trying to pitch this idea that you don't need to think about comms and press and PR as much because now you can go direct. You can have a newsletter, you can write, you can tweet, you can LinkedIn. Do you feel like that is where the future is going for founder press and comms and things like that or do you think you still need to have a really strong comms, press, PR org within your company?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:57:36):\nThat's a great question because I think that there's been just a lot of change in this space over the last five years and certainly very strong opinions from all over the ecosystem. I'm a big believer in comms. And I don't just say that because I used to be a journalist or I used to work in comms. But I think that there are very few and far between incredible megaphones for what it is that you or your company is doing where you get to reach such a breadth of people with that stamp of credibility and notice. How do you get somebody to say, \"Hey, this is really something you should pay attention to.\"? Obviously I support all of the owned media efforts that are really working and bubbling up. And like I said, influencer I think is going to be a massive shift in how we discover things, but maintaining a wonderful relationship with the press, being straightforward, being that brand that is going to be accessible, I really think that that pays off.\n\n(00:58:37):\nAnd just to give you one example, David Pierce, who I think is one of the best working journalists in tech today, he's at The Verge now. He was covering personal tech for the Wall Street Journal early on at Notion and published a story that said this is the one work-life productivity app that you'll ever need. And that was Notion's big break. Truly, if you look back at the graphs, that made a demonstrable difference. And I've seen that happen time and time again. And one of my other efforts at First Round was helping companies in the portfolio figure out how to DIY comm strategies. And I saw this again and again that the companies that did get stories that really told their mission, it made a big difference for just discovery awareness. The number of people who wanted to be involved with them as candidates, as investors, as customers.\n\nLenny (00:59:29):\nThis gives me a new post idea of just what are the big breaks of companies? What was the moment where they started taking off? Note to self?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:59:36):\nYes. The other big thing for the Notion was product hunts. I want to give them-\n\nLenny (00:59:40):\nOh, okay. So posting on Product Hunt, that was a big deal for Notion.\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:59:44):\nIt was. And it remains a big deal. If you go on Product Hunt and you type in Notion, you'll see just how many templates have been able to get noted because of Product Hunt.\n\nLenny (00:59:54):\nSo it's the templates being posted, but then also the launch of Notion on Product Hunt?\n\nCamille Ricketts (00:59:58):\nYes. And Notion 2.0. And then whenever we would have a major productized launch.\n\nLenny (01:00:05):\nWow, that's awesome. Man, Product Hunt just keeps kicking.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:00:07):\nNotion AI very recently for them, which couldn't be more exciting.\n\nLenny (01:00:11):\nI have access to that. I've been playing around. It's awesome. Maybe a last question along these lines is thinking about the founders that you've worked with. So on the one hand you have Elon who is very direct on Twitter to his audience, and then Ivan feels much less so and more under the radar and doesn't love tweeting a lot. And then First Round Review somewhere in the middle. Do you have any thoughts on how much a founder should invest in, say, tweeting and going and communicating direct to folk? Or is it more just whatever the founder is, their personality, just go with that?\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:00:41):\nI really do think it's about personality and what feels authentic. I think that so much of a founder's strength comes from leaning into where they know that they love to work, what they know about themselves. And I think that one of the biggest mistakes you can make on social media is giving yourself a quota that you have to hit and say, I have to say X number of scintillating things every week on these platforms. We've just seen so much more traction, even from the main Notion accounts when we're a little bit more reserved and we wait until we have something to say that has value.\n\nLenny (01:01:12):\nAwesome. Any last closing thoughts before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:01:19):\nClosing thoughts. No, this was a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much for letting me share. Truly, I also want to make sure I'm giving a lot of credit away from all the people that I mentioned throughout. It was all just a major team effort and I've gotten very, very lucky to work with the best people.\n\nLenny (01:01:32):\nAwesome. We'll try to link to all of the people you mentioned in our show notes. We try to do that every time. So it'll be a long show notes. And we're not done yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I am going to ask you six questions real quick. Whatever comes to mind, we'll go through it pretty fast. That sound good?\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:01:48):\nYeah. We'll see how it goes.\n\nLenny (01:01:50):\nLet's go. No pressure. What are two to three books that you recommend most, that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:01:57):\nObviously Awesome by April Dunford. If you're looking to position your company, I don't know if you've read it, but it is a step-by-step guide. It's like 100 pages long.\n\nLenny (01:02:05):\nI've read it. She's done a guest post on my newsletter. She's been on the podcast. So all over it.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:02:11):\nOh, fantastic. She's incredible. Yes. Oh gosh. I'm going to have a hard time coming up with two other books that have had that sizable of an impact.\n\nLenny (01:02:19):\nWe can keep it to one too. It's all good.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:02:21):\nCan we keep it to one?\n\nLenny (01:02:22):\nYes. Just the one. All you need. What's a favorite other podcast that you listen to other than the one you're on currently?\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:02:30):\nI mean, I love your podcast.\n\nLenny (01:02:31):\nThank you.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:02:32):\nHarry Stubbings never ceases to amaze me. We've gone on at Notion a couple times and I just really appreciate his approach to mining a lot of incredible information and unexpected stuff.\n\nLenny (01:02:46):\nHarry Stubbings is the godfather of this podcast because I did his podcast and at the end of it privately he's like, \"Lenny, you need to do a podcast, you idiot. Why are you not doing a podcast?\" And that got me over the hump and look at us now. So yeah, huge shout out to Harry.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:03:00):\nI love all of these connections that exists. That's wonderful.\n\nLenny (01:03:02):\nYeah. Next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've loved?\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:03:08):\nOh gosh. Recent. I went to go see Tar, which I know is going to be not everybody's cup of tea, but it was just incredible to watch this performance from Kate Blanchett. She learned German. She learned how to be a credible conductor of a major symphony orchestra. If you want to see a bravura performance, that's the one to see. And then recent television show I'm watching Fleischman is in Trouble. I love the book and I just think that the detail and texture of that show is super well done.\n\nLenny (01:03:37):\nAwesome. My wife and I have been watching that and it's awesome. Last episode was less exciting, so I'm curious where it all goes, but I'm watching.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:03:44):\nAgreeing. But every time Claire Danes is on screen, I'm riveted. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:03:50):\nFavorite interview question that you like to ask folks, either when you're interviewing at a place, hiring, anything that comes to mind.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:03:56):\nYeah. The one thing that was really helpful, because we used to do this thing at First Round Review where we would explore topics and be like, how do we get to a topics that's going to be unique or new knowledge or whatever it was. And it was, what is one thing that you think that led to your success that nobody else in your peer set has done? What was something that you did on a lark or that you were like, this is a big bet, or this isn't probably going to work, or it's a mistake that it even turned out this way, but it ended up being great. What is that one thing that was unusually conceived that you want to share with people?\n\nLenny (01:04:24):\nI love that question. I almost want to answer it, but let's move on. What are five SaaS products that you use or have used other than notion that you found to be really good other than maybe Slack, which everyone always mentions.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:04:39):\nI mean, I'm in love with Notion. The other thing, the other great love of my life right now is Arc, The Browser Company.\n\nLenny (01:04:44):\nOh my God, I love Arc. I just switched to it. I love it.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:04:47):\nYeah. It was something that I tried and within an hour I've made it my default browser and I just think it's beautiful and delightful in one of those intangible ways that a lot of these products are\n\nLenny (01:04:58):\nSame. Yes. Cool. Oh, there's more. Yeah.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:05:00):\nI already talked about Figma. I love Figma. I actually use it in my day to day life, which is one of the best parts of it is that folks who are not necessarily designers or highly technical can also get a lot out of it. Superhuman. Couldn't live my life without Superhuman. Whenever I have to go back into Gmail to set an autoresponder or whatever, I'm like, ugh, my eyes. So couldn't live without that. Gosh, I'm on sabbatical, so I don't know how many other SaaS products I'm actually using day to day so I'm going to keep it at three.\n\nLenny (01:05:29):\nAll right. Yeah. Use less SaaS products during your sabbatical. It's a good philosophy.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:05:33):\nYeah. I don't know if that was your experience, but just is. Oh, the other one I'll shout out, even though this is like a sneaky Notion plug is Kron. So if anybody isn't using the Kron calendar, which is now part of Notion as some folks might know, it is in fact the best calendar product on the market.\n\nLenny (01:05:47):\nSneaky, sneaky. Last question. What's a favorite read or course or just anything you'd recommend for people to level up their community building skills to build a community, run a community? What would you point people to?\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:06:01):\nI'm not aware of any courses that are necessarily offered. Ben Lang has done a number of AMAs or interviews, so if you want to just Google Ben Lang and the word community or Notion, you're going to find just a lot of incredible insight. And his experience has been, I think ... In terms of community people operating in tech, Ben is top level, so find whatever he's said.\n\nLenny (01:06:27):\nAwesome. We will find it. We will link to it. Camille, I just met you an hour ago, but I feel like I've known you forever. This was amazing.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:06:34):\nLikewise. Thank you.\n\nLenny (01:06:35):\nThank you so much for making time for this. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more? You're on sabbatical now, and so maybe share what you're thinking about next and what you could be ... I don't know. And I guess this is the second question. How can listeners be useful to you?\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:06:49):\nThank you for that. You can find me on Twitter. I'm just @CamilleRicketts. Super straightforward. Still sticking with it. And in terms of where I'm at in my life, I'm just interested in meeting as many fascinating new people and learning about things as possible. I've started going to these Founders You Should Know events for anybody who's interested about FYSK, and just meeting as many cool people who are building just incredible concepts. It's inspiring every time, and I just want my whole life to look like that. So get in touch if you're building something and think I could be helpful.\n\nLenny (01:07:21):\nAmazing. Camille, thank you so much for being here.\n\nCamille Ricketts (01:07:24):\nThank you so much. This was wonderful.\n\nLenny (01:07:27):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How to achieve hypergrowth in your business and career | Carilu Dietrich (Atlassian)\n\n## Transcript\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:00:00):\nIn order to get hypergrowth, you have to have organic, inbound, and viral word of mouth. You can't pay enough to grow at those rates and have a viable company. The biggest thing is an amazing product that people love to use, right? I mean ChatGPT is the most hypergrowth product that we've seen in history potentially, because people are so excited to use it and it's working in interesting ways. \n\n(00:00:22):\nAnd then I think the third thing is really riding the lightning, I would call it. Hypergrowth companies go through the stages of growth that would take other companies five years or 10 years, right? They're going from 10 to 50, they're going from 50 to 100, they're going from 100 to 200. They're jumping. And so they really need to keep hiring 2X and 3X leaders who have seen the next stage of growth, because it's going to be here before you know it.\n\nLenny (00:00:55):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard work, experiences building and growing today's most successful products. \n\n(00:01:04):\nToday my guest is Carilu Dietrich. Carilu is a former CMO and has advised the CEOs and CMOs of hypergrowth B2B companies like Segment, Miro, 1Password, Bill.com, Productboard, Sprout Social, Weights & Biases, and most notably was head of marketing at Atlassian through their IPO. \n\n(00:01:22):\nIn today's episode, we cover what hypergrowth companies have in common, how to make big changes to your growth strategy to unlock new channels of growth, why COs don't trust CMOs, and why most CMOs get fired. Also, why most CPOs get fired. Plus, the benefits of waiting a long time to hire your first salesperson, bundling strategy, and a ton of incredibly insightful career advice. A huge thank you to Elena Verna for suggesting Carilu for the podcast. And with that, I bring you Carilu Dietrich after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:56):\nThis episode is brought to you by Rows.com. The world runs on spreadsheets. You probably have a tab open with a spreadsheet right now, but the spreadsheet product you're using today was designed decades ago, and it shows. They live in silos away from your business data. They weren't made to be used on a phone. And if you want to do even the simplest automation, you have to figure out complex scripts that are nightmare to maintain.\n\n(00:02:18):\nRows is different. It combines a modern spreadsheet editor, data integrations with APIs and your business tools, and a slick sharing experience that turns any spreadsheet into a beautiful interactive website that you'll be proud to share. If you're writing a report on a growth experiment, you can use Rows to your analysis on data straight from BigQuery or Snowflake. If you're deep diving on marketing, you can import reports straight from Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, or Twitter. Or if you're working with sales, you can natively plug Stripe, Salesforce, or HubSpot directly into rows. And when you're done, you can share your work as a beautiful spreadsheet that's easy to read, and embed charts, tables, and calculators into Notion, Confluence, or anywhere on the web. I've already moved some of my favorite spreadsheet templates to Rows. Go to rows.com/lenny to check them out. That's rows.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:08):\nThis episode is brought to you by Braintrust, where the world's most innovative companies go to find talent fast so that they can innovate faster. Let's be honest, it's a lot of work to build a company. And if you want to stay ahead of the game, you need to be able to hire the right talent quickly and confidently. Braintrust is the first decentralized talent network where you can find, hire, and manage high quality contractors in engineering, design, and product, for a fraction of the cost of agencies.\n\n(00:03:36):\nBrain Trust charges a flat rate of only 10%, unlike agency fees of up to 70%.

Happy to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:35):\nYou've had this incredible career. You worked at all these incredible companies. I'd love to just dissect what you have found to be most important and effective in building a career long term, just broadly. And then specifically if you're trying to get to an executive role someday, what have you found to be some more important habits, behaviors, tactics, lessons?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:04:55):\nI'll start by saying that everyone has their own calculus about the trade-offs they want to make on pursuing their career and the sacrifices they might need to make versus the other things in their life, their family, their hobbies, their passions. And so I think the executive track isn't for everyone because there are a lot of trade-offs.\n\n(00:05:14):\nBecause I think that some of the most important aspects of getting to the executive suite are working harder, learning more, pushing yourself, taking on more responsibilities and opportunities, maybe even in the white space, that aren't your job or aren't in your regular time. \n\n(00:05:34):\nWhen I was young in my career, I decided I wanted to be a CMO. And at the job where I had decided I wanted to be the CMO, I worked two hours later than everyone else on the team. And I had this thought in my brain that two hours every day for five years would get me how many more years of experience than someone else? And I could do that when I was young, and I didn't have kids, and I was willing to make those sacrifices. \n\n(00:05:59):\nBut you look at a lot of the top CMOs and they have sacrificed a lot of things to read all of the books. And again, if I go back to that first job, I was a PR manager, and we went through a tough phase and we lost a ahead of product right before the major launch of a major product. So I volunteered to moonlight in the product department and run the beta, and do release engineering. And taking on other responsibilities gave me insights into other departments that made me more successful, early in my career and later on.\n\n(00:06:33):\nAnd the same thing happens as you're growing, right? If a department head leaves and you can spend extra time doing your own job and being the interim for this other function, you can really show the top executives that you have the appetite and the skill to take on more responsibility.\n\n(00:06:50):\nSo I think learning as much as you can about your expertise, working really hard, and taking on more responsibilities, and having a great attitude and a strategic mind are probably what I think helps people get to the C-suite on the personal level. And then I have another set of five things that are what specific ways do you need to train your mind?\n\nLenny (00:07:15):\nI know there's this backlash against working really hard that happened for a while, but I'm on the same boat as you have of success will come from working really hard. And sometimes that sucks, but that's usually how it goes.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:07:27):\nI think there's ebbs and flows in your life. You're going to have a baby here soon, congratulations. Thank you. And so maybe you take your foot off the gas for a little bit. But really, there's no shortcuts. There's no shortcuts to knowing a lot.\n\n(00:07:43):\nOne of the people I admire most is Tomasz Tunguz, who was with Redpoint and now started his own VC firm. And I was talking to him about his blog and he was like, \"I'd just wake up 5:00 or 6:00 AM every morning and write three to four blogs a week for 10 years.\" Damn. That is self-discipline and insight and drive. So yeah, no shortcuts. I think. You look at Denise Persson at Snowflake, and she's worked really hard to get there. \n\n(00:08:12):\nSo the five things I think you need to do to get to the C-suite that are not personal side are you need to think about how your responsibilities tie to revenue. You need to think and talk in the terms of the CEO and the board. And that can be tricky when you're junior because you don't have exposure to it. But getting a strong handle on finance, and how the finances of the business work, and how the revenue of the business works.\n\n(00:08:38):\nI went on a tour of the Tesla factory with my daughter's field trip a couple weeks ago. And the guy who was giving us the tour was like, \"So I delivered and stocked all these different parts at the plant and then I would take a list. And after work every night, I'd go to each part of the plant and try to figure out what they were working on and what the challenges and opportunities were. And that's how I moved up.\"\n\n(00:09:00):\nSo it's just understanding how the whole thing works together. Because if you want to be in the C-suite, it's a job about how the system works. So I really encourage tours of duty between different departments. I told you about my tour of duty and product. I thought CMOs had to do every function, so I took a tour of duty in every function in marketing, but really getting a sense for other departments.\n\n(00:09:23):\nThe next thing is the relationships. So building really strong relationships with people by doing good work and helping them. And then the last thing I think is the quality of the companies you work for. So your career and your ability to transcend, which is really moving faster than other people to get bigger jobs, is fairly dependent on the momentum of your company. \n\n(00:09:49):\nSo I was a leader at Oracle for five years, and my team grew from five to seven over five years. And I was a leader at Atlassian for four years, and my team grew from 15 to 100. And so if you pick the right company with the right momentum, you have a better chance of getting higher level experiences and accelerated career growth.\n\n(00:10:14):\nAnd then I guess one little footnote. If you pick great companies, great people work for those companies, and go out and work at other companies and also give you opportunities. So I ended up at Atlassian kind of in a stroke of good luck because I had worked for Jay Simons, the president, at two companies before. So the quality of the first company, Plumtree, really helped propel my whole career.\n\nLenny (00:10:40):\nThere's so many things I want to double click on there. The last piece, it's the advice I always give people when they're early in their career is to go find a company that's going to do super well. That one experience is going to transform your entire career. Having the logo on your resume, the people you meet, the experience you get financially. But that begs the question, how do you find that? How do you pick a company? I think in your advising today, you join later where it's a little more obvious. \"Okay, they're doing great.\" Do you have any advice or lessons about how to identify earlier where to go work and how to be lucky in that pick?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:11:16):\nIsn't that the billion-dollar question? So I worked for-\n\nLenny (00:11:20):\nFor investing too.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:11:20):\nYeah. I worked at Atlassian, which was phenomenal. Then I worked for Classy, which was a company that helped nonprofits raise money. \n\nLenny (00:11:29):\nI've used that product.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:11:31):\nThank you. And we were acquired by GoFundMe. And it was fine, but it was no Atlassian. And then I spent the next five years trying to figure out, how do you pick your next Atlassian? So my advice would be for people earlier in their careers, it's easy to pick the winners if you go work for a big company that's a winner. I would love to work for Tesla, or AWS. Or right this second, I would die kill for a job at OpenAI. You know some of the big companies that are successful... Salesforce has totally been a career maker to so many top executives.\n\n(00:12:04):\nSo early in your career, working for big name high momentum companies. I think you can't wimp out. You've got to want it and go for it. And maybe you apply year after year, and you meet people, and you try for it early in your company.\n\n(00:12:19):\nLater in your career, I think what you just said, picking later stage versus earlier stage gives you a better view of their momentum. I actually have a Post-it note, got it here, about what I look for. 10 parts of what would evaluate to see-\n\nLenny (00:12:35):\nYou just have that Post-it note around?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:12:37):\nI do. It's one of five Post-it notes on my board.\n\nLenny (00:12:37):\nI want to hear what the rest are too. But keep going.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:12:44):\nI have to look at it for advisory. I only take eight to 10 clients. I'm always full. And so it has to be a phenomenal company. So how do I know if it's a phenomenal company? Here's my list. Rule of 40, which is your profitability and your costs together. The quality of the investors. Are they really top tier investors? Are they mid tier or some you've never heard of? Investors do a lot of due diligence, but you also want to look at their most recent rounds, because they could have phenomenal early stage and have slowed down. I think the later the size, the more reliable, because they've just made it farther. \n\n(00:13:23):\nTheir Net Promoter Score or their customer satisfaction. Do people really rapidly love this product or is it like meh? Their net dollar retention, which is, how fast is their revenue growing? And I should have it on my Post-it note, but Snowflake was the benchmark. I think they were growing at 142%.\n\nLenny (00:13:44):\nI think at one point it was 180, whatever.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:13:46):\nYeah. That sounds right. 180, 165. Net dollar retention, if you have a customer and they just renew at the same dollar rate, it would be 100. So 180 is almost doubling just their customers. So they didn't even need new customers, almost doubled their business. A phenomenal net dollar retention means it's a really strong healthy business. \n\n(00:14:09):\nI looked at their growth rate last year, their burn rate, are they going to run out of money? And then ideally, are they number one in their market? Do they have a Forrester or a Gartner Magic Quadrant? People tell you if they're number one. \n\n(00:14:22):\nAnd then the last thing is I look at their Glassdoor. Is it just a bad place to work and where people unhappy? Because they don't actually survive as long as companies where people are happier.\n\nLenny (00:14:34):\nI love this list. You should turn it into a blog post, and there's another idea for you. Can you share what the other Post-its are around you? Even broadly.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:14:41):\nI can. One says, \"More Yoda, less Wonder Woman,\" which basically is ask better questions. The second one was-\n\nLenny (00:14:51):\nAsk them backwards too.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:14:52):\nYeah, right? Ask them backwards. Which is funny, because the other Yoda thing I have up Is... Here wait. \"Do or do not. There is no try.\" Backwards. I have another one that says, \"Hell yes or no.\" When opportunities come to you and you're like, \"Should I do this or should I not do this?\" You only have so much time in your life. And so if it's not something that really excites you and gives you energy, it's tough to be the best at it. And so hell yes or no.\n\n(00:15:26):\nAnd then the last one is, \"Worrying is wasted energy,\" because I think we live in this economic pressure cooker, and there's a lot of fear and uncertainty. But we just need to take that fear and uncertainty and thank it for giving us urgency. And then make the list of what can we control now and what should we do next.\n\nLenny (00:15:50):\nThat's actually a perfect segue to my next question. And by the way, that was amazing. I'm glad that I asked about your Post-its. That's a whole life philosophy right there in Post-its.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:15:59):\nYeah, I should do a BeReal. This is what is looks like at this side. These are all the Post-its.\n\nLenny (00:16:05):\nOkay. So the question is around, I don't know if we're technically in a recession, but maybe we're on the verge of recession. The market's not great. And a lot of people are being laid off, or have been laid off, or are worried about being laid off, or just graduating college and looking for jobs. And I'm curious if you have advice for people trying to find a job in this market or just generally trying to accelerate their career. What is your advice for just how to deal with this environment while also trying to advance your career?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:16:32):\nI'd like to take in two parts. One is if you're unemployed and one is you're in a job. So if you're unemployed, it's tough. It's a tough time. There's a lot of supply. And so I think you just really need endurance and grit. And the sticker worrying is wasted energy, because you will get another job. It's just going to be a little bit more of a bumpy ride than some other years.\n\n(00:16:55):\nAnd the best executives I know have had down periods in their careers, where they were out of work for a while, where they were fired by a CEO, who this or that. And what they have in common is endurance. They're just back in the ring. So I think it's important to not lose endurance. \n\n(00:17:15):\nIt's also important not to settle on a crappy job or a crappy company. Each job you have prepares you for the next job, and each logo you have prepares you for the next job.\n\n(00:17:27):\nSo I'd spent a lot of my career trying to also chase waves. My first job in college, I was in nonprofit, and then I wrote a book on the giving programs of the top 50 tech companies. And I realized that tech companies had a bunch of money in 1999, and were giving it away to charities. And I wanted to go into tech, because that's where the growth and money was. And I thought I could give it back to the world and good, but I could be inside the bubble. \n\n(00:17:55):\nAnd then within tech, I moved my way to B2B. And within B2B, I moved my way to SaaS. And within SaaS, I've moved my way into dev tools, and collaboration, and now AI. \n\n(00:18:05):\nThere's this book called The Millionaire Next Door, which talks about how the very best antique store makes one or 2% profit. And the very worst oil and gas company makes 35% profit. And we know that some of the worst software companies make 65% profit. \n\n(00:18:25):\nSo picking your industry will propel your career, and picking the right company will propel your career, and then doing a good job will propel your career. So I think that there's no magic bullet to getting a job. But working your network, sticking with it, and continuing to grow your skills are the three most important things.\n\nLenny (00:18:43):\nBig part of this conclusion is don't feel like your career needs to slow down in this period.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:18:49):\nAnd I think if you're in a job, some of my greatest career growth came in the economic downturns. In the 2000s, in the 2008. Because other people take their foot off the gas, and you can put your foot down. If you're willing to learn more, hit yourself into new roles or new responsibilities that no one's covering at your company. When they don't hire tons of people for everything, there's lots of open projects where you can raise your hand and grow. You just can't be as focused on title and salary right now. You're kind of building up value that you'll be able to monetize on the other end of this recession or downturn.\n\nLenny (00:19:26):\nLet's segue to chatting about growth. And I thought it'd be fun to start with your story of running some very expensive ad campaigns. I know the founders are always kind of flirting with this idea of buying a bunch of billboards, running TV ads, maybe subway ads and bus ads. And you've done a lot of that and you've spent a lot of money doing that, and particularly non-digital advertising. And so I'm curious what you've learned from your experience and approach to this sort of marketing spend.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:19:53):\nYes. I've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it actually. I ran global awareness advertising for Oracle, and did all of the airports, and the front page of the Wall Street Journal, on the back page of The Economist, and take over in the middle of Salesforce in downtown San Francisco. And we did the Ironman movie sponsorships, and the sports teams and arena sponsorships.\n\nLenny (00:20:16):\nThat sounds very expensive.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:20:17):\nSuper expensive. And then Atlassian to a lesser degree, we spent several million dollars on different awareness campaigns to get chat noticed, or to associate Jira with the Atlassian brand. Advertising is sexy and super expensive for the benefits. It's a multi-year benefit of awareness. People have to see things many times, and it has to really resonate with them. \n\n(00:20:45):\nSo my advice to founders is that the most important thing is the quality of your product. Oracle spent a ton of money, and people still didn't like us in a lot of ways because they had poor experiences with the salespeople, or they didn't like Larry, or the product had kind of languished since it had been acquired by the company. So your product has to really be fantastic. And then also to do good brand advertising, it has to be sustained over a long period of time.\n\n(00:21:14):\nSo Oracle had the front page of the Wall Street Journal, back page of The Economist, this boring advertising template with the red bar, but it made it memorable. We would do market tests, and two or three or 10 times more people would recognize the Oracle brand without the logo, because of the consistency versus SAP or or IBM. \n\n(00:21:35):\nSo you really need to be thoughtful about spending consistently over a longer period of time, and a smaller amount on a fewer number of things can be really effective. So Snowflake, for instance, has always gotten credit for doing a billboard on 101, and people think they do lots of advertising. But for many years, it was only the billboard on 101. It was just sustained and strategic.\n\nLenny (00:21:59):\nSo I guess two things that I take away from that is one, you can spend a lot of money, and if your product's not actually incredible, it's not really going to do much. And correct me if I'm wrong. And then two is sometimes, just one very targeted spend is worth a lot more than just blanketing a bunch of ads.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:22:16):\nAbsolutely. I was telling you a story that at Atlassian, we did a big advertising campaign on our HipChat product, which was head-to-head with Slack, and it was an Office Space spoof with Bill Lumbergh. But the product had some uptime issues, and some feature issues, and Slack pulled ahead, and the advertising wasn't what would've made it or broken the product. It's really the product experience, and the advertising just amplifies.\n\nLenny (00:22:42):\nI think you also shared with me this HipChat ad, that's maybe my favorite billboard ever. And I don't even know why looking back, but it made me laugh so hard. Back in the day, it was this meme of some early meme stick figure guy saying, \"Why you no use HipChat?\" Looking back I'm like, \"Okay. I don't know how funny.\" But I think in the moment that was a really popular meme, and it really stuck with me.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:23:04):\nWell if you think about the best advertising, it's something that has a little twist of humor, or personality, or truth that sticks in your brain. So yes, that was a successful advertising. And kudos to my team, because of course I don't write it myself as the head of marketing. But yeah.\n\n(00:23:22):\nAnd some of my other favorite ads are also others that highlight the customer. So New Relic did an advertising campaign around data nerds. When data nerds were not really popular, they were still nerds. And they had these tattoos that said nerd life, and they featured customers on billboards talking about cool data nerds. And some of those campaigns that really stand out have something that's funny, unexpected, and then true to the product.\n\nLenny (00:23:54):\nI remember those, one of the ads featured, our CTO at Airbnb, Mike Curtis, and everyone was very excited to see his face on the Billboards.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:24:02):\nYeah, Salesforce has done a great job with those over the years too, really highlighting the customers.\n\nLenny (00:24:06):\nSo zooming out a little bit, you specialize working with companies that are going through hypergrowth. And you've worked with companies like Miro, Segment, Bill.com, which I don't know if people know is just a massive, massive business. And also 1Password. \n\n(00:24:21):\nAnd on the topic of 1Password, interestingly I didn't realize how big and how fast 1Password has been growing. And just last week I saw this report from Okta where they have all this interesting data about which products people are using, and they put out this report showing which products you're getting the most new customers. And then on a different axis, which companies are getting the most users per new customer. \n\n(00:24:46):\nAnd there's this six companies in this quadrant. Figma, Miro, Snowflake, Sentry, HubSpot, and 1Password, which blew my mind. And interestingly, you work with two of them. And so all that to say, what have you noticed about what is most in common with companies that are going through hypergrowth? What is most in common in terms of what has contributed to them being that successful?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:25:08):\nThe biggest thing is an amazing product that people love to use. I mean ChatGPT is the most hypergrowth product that we've seen in history potentially, because people are so excited to use it and it's working in interesting ways. So Miro, whiteboards were the number one most uploaded asset in Jira forever. Because people all get together and they write their ideas on a whiteboard, and then they need to remember it and iterate on it. And that bringing that concept to life just hit a cord that people wanted to use. And when one person uses it, another person uses it.\n\n(00:25:42):\n1Password similarly, I've been a 1Password user for more than 10 years. We used it at Atlassian, as a corporate. And then they have the family plan. So I used it at home and then my dad got elderly, so I had a family that I was the administrator for, and then I go into different companies and you bring it with you.\n\n(00:26:02):\nAnd one of the other companies I advise is Productboard. And I became an advisor of Productboard because 1Password's CPO had it in another company, brought it into 1Password, rolled it out company-wide to get alignment and visibility on the product roadmap. \n\n(00:26:18):\nSo in order to get hypergrowth, you have to have organic, inbound, and viral word of mouth. You can't pay enough to grow at those rates and have a viable company, especially in this economic efficiency market. So has to be an amazing product, has to have some viral activity. So we just talked about Miro or Atlassian. You could have an individual person use it and then they say, \"Hey, I'm going to present at this meeting with Miro, come join me on my board. I've got these confluence pages we'd set up as a wiki about these engineering topics, and I want your team to collaborate on them.\" So those natural points where your users are selling to other people is way more efficient than having sales people that have to sell to other people. \n\n(00:27:12):\nAnd then I think the third thing is really riding the lightning, I would call it. So hypergrowth companies go through the stages of growth that would take other companies five years or 10 years. They're going from 10 to 50, they're going from 50 to 100, they're going from 100 to 200, they're jumping. And so they really need to keep hiring 2X and 3X leaders who have seen the next stage of growth. And then the people inside can be homegrown talent, but it's tricky to keep up. \n\n(00:27:46):\nSo my whole business is based on people who are trying to be homegrown leaders, but don't know what the next stage of growth looked like. And so a lot of hypergrowth companies hire ahead, hire advisors. Leaders need to really think about mentors and friendships of people who know what great looks like at the next scale, because it's going to be here before you know it. And so I would say those things. Amazing product, viral movement, and company that can ride the lightning.\n\nLenny (00:28:15):\nI imagine founders listening to this that don't have insane virality or huge word of mouth are like, \"Is there no path to being a really successful company?\" And then I think about companies that did succeed with other channels, like say paid or SEO. And so I guess the question for you is, do you need to grow in this environment, I guess, primarily through word of mouth, organic reality, growth engines? Or do you still see opportunity for companies to grow other ways, say paid, or SEO, or sales eventually?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:28:51):\nFor sure. All of the things are important. I think what I wanted to say first as you were talking was that it's easy to look at a company after they've been viral and be like, \"That's amazing.\" I would like to start a newsletter. I have. It's carilu.com. Lenny has a newsletter. How can I ever grow like Lenny's virality? But Lenny started with one blog, and then another, and the consistency.\n\n(00:29:14):\nAnd when I look back at Atlassian, people would be like, \"It must have been so easy to go from 100 to 500 million.\" And it never felt easy. It was a slog to do exactly what you're talking about. New features, listen to customers, strong SEO. Actually SEO was the number one marketing motion that we used, and SEM. We spent probably between 15 and 25% of our leads from paid search marketing at the time. Now I have a ton of customers that are pretty deep into account-based marketing.\n\n(00:29:49):\nGetting to virality and getting the hypergrowth is not a magic bullet. It's consistency, customer obsession, incremental improvements across all parts of the business. So I think founders just need to double down on having a product that's differentiated and does something that their customers really love. And each incremental step is a step forward.\n\nLenny (00:30:16):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcast, and to coordinate my sponsors. \n\n(00:30:35):\nMore recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team. Including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.\n\n(00:30:53):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of the special limited time offer just for startups. Plan up today at Coda.io/lenny and get a $1,000 startup credit on your first statement. That's Coda.io/lenny to sign up and get a startup credit of $1,000. Coda.io/lenny.\n\n(00:31:32):\nSay that you as a company are seeing word of mouth in some virality, and you want to think about accelerating that, leaning into word of mouth. Obviously you want everyone to be talking about how awesome you are sharing with their friends. Is there anything that you've seen as a good way to lean into word of mouth and accelerate it?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:31:49):\nI think there's two or three things. One is really empowering the people in your company to be thought leaders. So early days, Atlassian's founders were on all the developer boards. And in fact, I remember, we were maybe 150 million or 200 million, and Scott Farquhar the CEO was still participating and going back and forth in different dev forums when I was like, \"I don't know, should we elevate your status? Should we have evangelists and engineers that do this?\"\n\n(00:32:18):\nAnd we did, right? And look, one of my clients now is Weights & Biases, the ML ops company helping lots of different AI companies with their ML models. And they have really thoughtful technical people who know more and write more on the blog and engage with their community. And that creates a word of mouth, because they're providing both a product and concepts and learning. That's one of the HubSpot secrets was all of their really thoughtful, helpful content, certifications for marketers.\n\n(00:32:52):\nSo I think going back to summarize, word of mouth can be driven by thought leadership, which is hiring the right people to really be deeply engaged as super experts. Having a really strong content strategy that's either in communities that already exist, online communities, open source communities.\n\n(00:33:13):\nAnd then third I would say building your own community. So no one sells your product better than your own happy customers. And if I go way back to the very beginning of my career, I worked on a marketing team where I owned demand gen just for net new prospects, and a peer owned demand gen just for existing customer upsell. And we would have different field events.\n\n(00:33:34):\nAnd the existing customer ones were smaller than if we'd invited the prospects and had more buzz. And the prospect ones were very salesy. Whereas if we brought them together and you had customers talking to each other and prospects listening, everyone had a better time.\n\n(00:33:48):\nSo Atlassian, one of our secrets was this amazing user group community where we just paid for beer and a pizza, and we'd facilitate local in-city leaders, and people would meet up and talk about our products, and talk about development generally, and grow their careers and grow their network. So I think those are the three. The right people, the right content, and the right communities.\n\nLenny (00:34:11):\nAs you were talking, I was reminded, I was just chatting with the founder of Gusto about their journey early on. And he said that for the first 200 customers, he sat there with them running payroll, watching how they react every step of the payroll process and how they feel at every moment. And that was a big part of what helped them build the product that people actually continue using, and love, and stick with. And if it wasn't in person, it was on a phone call. And it's like the epitome of doing things don't scale, just like for hundreds of new customers watching them use your product. Pretty wild.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:34:44):\nI mean that's the secret. That's the secret sauce. And I've heard some early stage startup advisors say that you should build processes that don't scale first. Because when you're in the super early stage seed A under 10 million, you've really got to go deep at that stage. \n\n(00:35:04):\nAnd in fact, I see that that's one of the problems that companies experience as they get much bigger, when product managers can't meet with customers, or they get limited customers, or maybe they can only meet with a junior user, only the administrator, and not lots of the users. So that insight into the daily struggles and experience of your customers, it's harder to get as you get bigger I think.\n\nLenny (00:35:28):\nI want to drill into Atlassian. You've brought them up a couple times. You were at Atlassian for a long time. You were there from early days of growth to IPO. And one of the most interesting elements of Atlassian and something that comes up a lot on this podcast is product led growth.\n\n(00:35:44):\nAnd Atlassian I think is one of the most classic examples of a product led growth company. And from what I understand, y'all waited a long time to hire your first salesperson. So my question is what did you learn from that experience about when is the right time to start leaning into sales and hiring sales, and what are the trade-offs of waiting longer or doing it earlier?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:36:04):\nAtlassian was a super unique company at a super unique point in time, because the founders never took outside money except for one late stage financing to buy out some early employees, to give some liquidity. So we never had VCs or private equity that had a voting share that was significant, that could overrule the founders.\n\n(00:36:28):\nSo the founders were going through this experiment that turned out to be really successful, where they took all the money they would've spent on a sales org and plowed it into engineering and product. I'm going to pull up a slide here that tells the Atlassian story about the ratio of the sales and marketing to the product and engineering.\n\nLenny (00:36:46):\nAmazing. And by the way, check this out on YouTube if you're listening to this and check out this slide.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:36:53):\nSo this is a representative sample of what we did in Atlassian's history, and what ratios still exist today, even several years later. Where we spend way less on sales and marketing. Marketing spent less than other marketers. And also we had almost no sales org, or a sales org that was really focused on renewals, or now an assisting sales org that's focused more on enterprise. But relative to other companies, a much smaller, much more efficient sales org. And we took all that money and put it into product. So here we're spending two times, three times as many dollars in R&D as many other companies that we'd benchmark against to make a product that really sold itself.\n\nLenny (00:37:37):\nIt's interesting. So I'm looking at the slide. And again if you're listening, check this on YouTube because it's pretty crazy. This slide of bar chart of spend in sales and marketing and R&D, and Atlassian is the very lowest amount of spend in sales and marketing, and the highest spend in product. And it's interesting that it's from 2020, so it's not even in the early days. It's like still today basically.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:37:59):\nRight. I'm going to close this down and keep telling you a little bit more about it. There's some unique things that people can take now and incorporate. So the real strategy in sales, sales is the most expensive vehicle, right? Expensive people that spend a lot of time. So the Atlassian model was to sell only to people who were already customers really. If several people or a couple groups had purchased, we'd help them with their renewals. And now in the later incarnations of our sales orgs at Atlassian, it helps a lot more with larger enterprise companies who need enterprise deals, or does more cross-sell and upsell, but doesn't really do prospecting. Net new prospecting is a really expensive way to get new customers.\n\n(00:38:51):\nSo we see different trends coming now with companies, because almost no one can do pure product led growth. Because your investors want to see accelerated growth, and most people believe that adding an SDR or adding an AE will add a predictable amount of revenue. And so it's difficult because product led growth and sales have to coexist.\n\n(00:39:16):\nBut the whole transition in marketing that's happening to account-based marketing and intent-based signals is trying to do some of what we were doing at Atlassian, only to engage salespeople with customers that are actually likely to buy. And if you look at other hyper-growth companies, Airtable, Miro, both of those I know from the inside have had strategies where the salespeople really only engage after some threshold has been hit of number of users that have already been paying for the product on their credit card. But sometimes it's a high number of 20, 40 people at an account have to be engaged before a salesperson engages.\n\nLenny (00:39:54):\nBased on that, what is it you recommend to founders these days that maybe are product led and just self-service [inaudible 00:40:00] oriented. Do you kind of take this experience and wait as long as you can to hire your first salesperson? I know it's very specific to the situation, but what kind of advice do you generally give?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:40:12):\nYou and I are both like [inaudible 00:40:14] who was just on your podcast earlier this month. Product led growth depends so much on your product and your buying market. There's some buying markets that are less likely to use salespeople, and you need to go in from the beginning. HR might be one, right? Whereas a lot of the hyper-growth companies in the dev tool space can use product led growth because developers both hate failed people, and really love to research themselves. So you see [inaudible 00:40:47] taking off because people engage and kind of self sell.\n\n(00:40:52):\nSo I would recommend, get closer to their customers and read the signals. If your product is good enough, the people can get time to value in a couple of days instead of weeks or months. You can have a product led growth motion. If your product needs to be put in context, and customized, and assisted, sales teams sometimes are expensive services arms to cover over product issues and help customers buy it until it's fixed. Or if you're in a market where your buyer just really doesn't buy online with research and a demo, then you need to have salespeople. But I would say try not to hire too fast and too far ahead in sales and inside sales, because it seems like it's going to add revenue, but it actually is a huge cost and a huge drain on the business if the product isn't getting that kind of resonance.\n\nLenny (00:41:47):\nI just had a conversation with the founder of Retool for this series that I'm working on, and he basically found the same thing you found where they thought it could be a product led experience where you're building internal tools using their product, but it turned out nobody really understood how to do it themselves and it took a lot of handholding to make it work. So they became sales led from the beginning, even though it feels like a tool that has a lot of potential to be product led and self-service.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:42:11):\nI think the other hybrid I'm starting to see is people who turn their SDR, sales development reps, into sales engineers, researchers. So instead of having a salesperson who's like, \"Would you like to have a meeting with another salesperson?\" The first touch for customers that are maybe kicking the tires or trying a product led growth is a person who can help guide them on the path. And I like this hybrid nature because basically it extends product led growth, but helps people in this case where you're talking, where the product itself isn't so intuitive that you can get all the way to the buy itself.\n\nLenny (00:42:51):\nIt also sounds more fun to talk to a sales engineer than a salesperson.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:42:56):\nI know. I always wanted to be a sales engineer. I was a salesperson, and I crushed on the sales. Engineering team who knew everything and could draw all the architectures.\n\nLenny (00:43:03):\nOh wow, I didn't know that. A couple more questions around this stuff. So you've worked with a lot of different companies. And you kind of come in and help them figure out ways to grow faster, unlock growth opportunities. What do you find often gets most in the way of making big changes to the way they approach growth and approach different growth channels? And maybe on the flip side, what do you find is most essential to making big changes at a company around how they think about growth?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:43:30):\nThe big growth levers are pretty consistent across companies. You start with one product, and you have a couple choices on how the go-to-market works. Product leg growth or sales assisted. You get a little bit bigger and you add an incremental product, or you start to add new segments. You're going to focus on a vertical like finance, or you're going to go global, or you're going to add new sales channels like a partner channel. \n\n(00:43:56):\nAnd what I've seen with the big growth levers is that it can't ever be an individual department's goal without being a cross company strategy goal, if it's really going to make a difference. \n\n(00:44:07):\nSo you've talked about it in your newsletter and on your podcast, but growth isn't just like a person in the engineering team that hacks by themselves. It really has to be funded and thoughtfully constructed so that there's the right content and experience, and product features, and virality features a customer to continue to drive growth.\n\n(00:44:29):\nAnd similarly, lots of companies right now are trying to move upmarket because the economy has created so much pressure in S&B that they're going to try to move to enterprise, or they've trying not to sell as much just to tech companies because tech companies are under pressure and so they want to move to different parts.\n\n(00:44:51):\nSometimes the marketers get blamed or sales gets blamed, we don't have enough leads. But really it's a company strategy problem where the company hasn't decided, \"Hey, we're going to all move in this direction and if we're going to sell the enterprise, marketing's going to bring in leads, products going to have a roadmap, and some meaningful features to enterprise. The customer research is going to start thinking about them. We're going to hire some customer support people who know how enterprises work. We're going to hire some salespeople who sell differently to enterprises than S&B.\" The big growth levers are strategy problems, not individual departmental problems.\n\nLenny (00:45:26):\nAnd what do you find needs to happen for that to change? Is that like CEO needs to be like, \"Here's what we're doing, everyone get on board,\" or something else?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:45:35):\nI think it can come either way in the C-suite, right? So my job, I advise hypergrowth CEOs and CMOs of companies, 30 million to 500 million. Often if I'm advising a 30 to 100 million company, the more junior marketer with a CEO who's often a first time founder, who doesn't necessarily know if the marketer's good or not. Hasn't done run marketing before, doesn't know if they should trust what the marketers saying.\n\n(00:46:04):\nSo often the marketer is saying,\" Hey, we're having problems because the company's not delivering on this promise you want us to sell.\" And sometimes the CEO doesn't know if they can trust it, a judgment. And so in that case, someone like me who's an advisor comes in and is like, \"That's right, it's not a marketing problem, it's company strategy problem. Let's have an offsite and build some OKRs where we all go after enterprise and we win it together.\"\n\n(00:46:30):\nYou'll see at bigger companies or when a new CMO comes in with more senior or seasoned, they'll have the social capital to push back into the executive suite. Or a new head of engineering who will say, \"Look, I know you want to move ahead faster, but we actually have to catch up on this technical debt.\" And they'll push back and get that strategic space that they need. So it can either come from the CEO or it can come from the C-suite really coming together to solve those problems, instead of pushing them under the rug.\n\nLenny (00:47:01):\nYou touched on this nuance that a lot of times, there's not a lot of trust between the marketing head and the CEO. And I'm curious what you find helps build that trust.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:47:13):\nThere's a couple things that are really critical for senior marketers, and I actually have a blog coming up based on a podcast I've recorded about why CMOs mostly get fired. And the issues are generally one, that the CMO isn't focused enough on the revenue. So some CMOs get focused more on the pipeline or the awareness, and the CEO doesn't feel like they really have a partner in driving the revenue. Or they don't feel like the CMO really has a handle on what will drive the revenue.\n\n(00:47:46):\nSo marketing's tough because it's a big spend category, and lots of the spend doesn't convert in quarter. Some of it doesn't convert in year. Advertising campaigns, some take multiple quarters.\n\n(00:47:57):\nSo it's really important for CMOs to have a handle on the metrics, a solid prediction of what growth levers they can use, and to be able to talk in the terms of the CEO and the board.\n\n(00:48:11):\nAnd I think that that's the biggest gap that I generally see. And then of course, there's a whole bunch of table stake stuff. They have to be running their business well. They have to be a good leader that people want to work for. They have to hire a great team that elevates them and the company, they have to be thoughtful and strategic about the market space that the company's in. They're not just working the levers in the factory. They're thinking, \"What new markets should we enter? What new growth areas should we employ?\" Like we just talked about. \"What new companies should we acquire?\" They also need to be thinking ahead. And I think being good on metrics, good on strategy, and good on market helps CMOs spar with CEOs in a way that builds trust.\n\nLenny (00:49:00):\nIt's interesting that you say, that blog post you titled Why Most CMOs Get Fired, and it connects with something. Casey Winters noted, that most CPOs also get fired chief product officers. I forget the quote, but it's something like, \"The most you can help for is a couple swings at the bat before you get fired as a CPO.\" Why do you think this is so common for these chief C-suite roles to startups to not work out?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:49:26):\nThey're incredibly hard jobs. The chief product officer and the chief marketing officer are both strategy jobs with difficult to measure results because some of them are direct and some of them are indirect. And I think both of them get swept up when a company's not performing well too. If company's not performing well, you can kind of swap out the head of product, and the next one will be more strategic and deliver faster.\n\n(00:49:55):\nAnd in fact, I've worked in one of the roles, the CFO was really after my chief product officer, and ultimately got him fired because he wanted to move everything offshore, and develop faster, and he didn't want to re-platform, and he didn't want to deal with the technical debt. And the CFO was sure that it was the CPO's fault, and then they got rid of the CPO, and the CFO tried his plan and it didn't work. And then you bring someone in who's like, \"No, that guy had the right plane.\"\n\n(00:50:21):\nSo both of them are tough jobs. And they require a high bar of excellence, a high connection of trust, and then I think just endurance to keep going and find the next role where you're really a fit and the company really has momentum.\n\nLenny (00:50:36):\nIt also reminds me, I was just talking to, I think it was Canva. Where their first engineering hire is now their CTO still, and their first marketing hire is their CMO still. So it does work out on occasion.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:50:48):\nIt works out on occasion. And in fact, I've been playing around with a 10 part series about those CMOs in the CMO world, because there's about 10 to 15 CMOs who have started when it's really small and grown all the way. And they're the ones we really want to learn from. And I know a lot of them and really admire their work, and have learned so much.\n\nLenny (00:51:09):\nYou should absolutely do that. That sounds very cool. You talked about how you work with companies from 30 million to 500 million. What is it about that stage that's unique, and what happens after 500 million, and what's the difference before say 30 million? I know it's not an exact number, but how do you think about that range?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:51:24):\nNo, it's not an exact number. My bottom number is because there's this early stage of product market fit where the founder and the company are trying to figure out who their real ideal customer profile is, and can they sell to them consistently?\n\n(00:51:39):\nSo I've worked for some early stage startups where we've tried lots of different things, but they're not repeatable. You can't scale it. \"This product works for this. This product works for this too and it works for this,\" but those are all kind of unique cases studies. And so my skill is in helping people scale. \n\n(00:52:00):\nAnd so if they've already found product market fit and they've gotten some funding or they're bootstrapped, but have enough funding to really be trying to build out marketing in a marketing team, that's when I know what each stage looks like. So I know what $30 million great teams look like, and 50 million, and 100, and 150 million, 200 million. My ride at Atlassian was from about 100 to 500.\n\n(00:52:26):\nAnd then over 500, the act of going public, being an early stage public company, I know what that all looks like. And then beyond that, there's public company consultants I think more, that do more specific things. I more help the CMO and CEO structure for the next stage of growth, because they're going through it so fast, they haven't hired someone yet who's already seen.\n\nLenny (00:52:51):\nGot it. One very nuanced question I want to ask you is about bundling. So there's HipChat and Slack kind of ate their lunch, not necessarily through bundling, but there's Slack. And then Slack, I don't know if it's true, but it feels like Microsoft Teams is eating their lunch with bundling. And I'm curious, what do you think of bundling as a strategy to win long-term? And also, how do you compete against say, a Microsoft that may one day bundle your product for free, and you might be in big trouble?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:53:22):\nI think it's two separate questions, so let me take them separately. The first is, what do I think about bundling? So small and medium-sized companies will go from being a single product company to a multi-product company in order to progress. Because you need a diversified financial model, because you need to be able to sell new products into your customer base who should already be friendly to you if they like your products. And because you need to really expand your total addressable market to get to be $1 billion or $2 billion company. But I believe in bundling is a growth strategy.\n\n(00:53:57):\nSpecifically for product led growth companies, bundling is not a great land strategy. So at Atlassian, we had a number of products and experimented with different bundled lands. And it really slowed down the product led growth motion. So we ended up going back to land with a single product, high velocity, single person uses it quickly starts to get value, and then come in with other things.\n\n(00:54:22):\nSo from that perspective, product led growth bundling is not very effective. Bundling for a sales led motion is pretty effective when you're at the right stage of growth. \n\n(00:54:33):\nAnd then as far as the question of competing against Microsoft, there's these two parts of the philosophies. A best of breed and an all in one. An Oracle was an all in one, and Microsoft is an all in one. You can buy all the things and your CFO can get a discount by spending a whole bunch of money on a bunch of things. But in the all-in one, some of the pieces aren't as good as the best of breed.\n\n(00:54:57):\nAnd so Slack for a long time was the best of breed. People were willing to pay more because they thought it was markedly better than the other instant messaging options. \n\n(00:55:07):\nBut there's shifts between best of breed and all in one in economic wins. So right now, CFOs are putting the squeeze. Is Slack really that much better than Microsoft if the Microsoft one is free with all of our other purchases? It's tough. It's tough to go head-to-head with a powerful, big investing, all-in-one competitor. The only way to win is to be the best and have a product that's so much better, that it's worth the extra money.\n\nLenny (00:55:37):\nInteresting. So essentially in a tough environment, bundling is most effective almost. And then this other interesting point about [inaudible 00:55:47], you want to stay focused on one specific pain point. What is it that Atlassian tried to do that they tried to pitch all your planning products in one suite? Is that kind of what we-\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:55:59):\nWell, Jira was the issue tracking. And then we also had Confluence, which was the Wiki page. So let's say there was a business bundle that could have been HipChat, Confluence and Jira. Or there were developer combinations that could have been Jira, Bitbucket, and maybe Confluence too for an engineering team.\n\n(00:56:19):\nBasically, if you have to evaluate multiple products to purchase something, it's not a fast and easy online self-service buy. Because you're like, \"Do I need all three products? Can I break them apart? Do they all work? Are each of them best of breed?\" Whereas if you're like, \"I need issue tracking, I'm going to buy Jira, this looks good. I've tried it out, I'm ready to go.\" That can happen in seven days. Whereas if you add in multiple products, it takes more days and just leads to fewer conversions.\n\nLenny (00:56:52):\nThat makes absolute sense. I can see someone thinking the complete opposite and then now realizing how we see. I see why this isn't working.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:56:58):\nYou should always test it. Right? I mean, the secret to product led growth is can you test it? And so we tested everything. We tried bundles. We didn't try bundles. We tried different things in the bundles. We tried different days. Data led insights are better than anything any pundits would say on a podcast.\n\nLenny (00:57:17):\nAmazing. Well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? \n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:57:22):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (00:57:23):\nOkay. What are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:57:28):\nThe number one book is a life book called Tao Te Ching, the Stephen Mitchell translation. And the Tao Te Ching is a philosophy about the flow of life. And I love it. I've carried the Pocket Guide with me for 25 years. \n\n(00:57:40):\nThe second one is business focused. Never Split the Difference, which is a great book about negotiating written by a former CIA hostage negotiator, which also helps me with negotiations at work and with my children. So that's a great book.\n\nLenny (00:57:58):\nActually, I've been trying to read that book on audio. What's something you've taken away from me? Because the stories are so interesting and I'm always like, \"What should I actually do in my day-to-day life?\" What stuck with you?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:58:08):\nIt's kind of the obvious thing that I wasn't good at. It's that you just really want to put yourself so deeply in the shoes of the other person, that you can figure out what make the win for both of you, right? Basically he says, \"You can't win the negotiation by strong arming what you want. You really get to get to a win-win,\" which is probably every negotiation book ever. But he texturizes it so much. So I just felt like I was really able to... In my last office, we moved last year. I actually had the CliffNotes of his book printed out and posted on my wall because he had a series of questions to help you get deeper and deeper into the mindset behind people. \n\n(00:58:49):\nAnd connected, but not connected the book How To Win Friends and Influence People, that's the 1932 bestseller, is basically that. People don't want to hear about you. They want you to be thinking about them. And then you can make friends with them, or you can negotiate with them, or you can get your hostage back.\n\nLenny (00:59:08):\nI read How to Win Friends and Influence People when I was very young. And specifically, the chapters about there's no better sound in the world to someone than their name. Carilu.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:59:19):\nIt's true. Thank you. You said it correctly.\n\nLenny (00:59:22):\nOkay, moving on. Favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:59:26):\nMy favorite movie is Everything Everywhere All at Once. It's basically a sci-fi about all the different ways your life could turn out if you made different choices. And it was really a mind bender that made me think about all the different ways tiny decisions have changed my life, but then also an appreciation for the life that you have. At the end, it doesn't ruin the story, but she has this love of what she has, even though it's not as good or as different as some of the other options.\n\nLenny (00:59:26):\nI love it.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (00:59:58):\nSo I bought this poster. I don't think you can see it on the bath, but it says, \"Gratitude turns what we have into enough.\"\n\nLenny (01:00:07):\nVery Buddhist. \n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:00:08):\nI like it. Read the Tao Te Ching.\n\nLenny (01:00:10):\nNot a Post-it, but art. Another teaching from Carilu. I think this needs to be a second newsletter of yours. Life advice.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:00:20):\nWhich is funny. I've been thinking about that one. It would be called The Tao of Hypergrowth.\n\nLenny (01:00:25):\nOh my God. I love that.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:00:26):\nAnd actually, I was thinking about doing it and taking actual clips from the Tao Te Ching, and doing textural analysis about how it applies to our. I've been thinking about this actual podcast for a while because I used to want to do the... I mean blog, the Tao of Parenthood. Because basically parenting, you try to control and fix all the things you didn't do right in your life. But actually, it's the act of providing freedom that lets them go out and explore and then come back to your way of being. So, I don't know. The Tao Te Ching, I love it.\n\nLenny (01:00:58):\nI see so many opportunities. You got to stop what you're doing. Just write all these things.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:01:02):\nI know. But I love the hypergrowth customers, clients.\n\nLenny (01:01:06):\nAll right. Next question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:01:11):\nSo this is a little heavy, but it actually is my favorite. It's, \"How many people have you fired? And tell me about each of the experiences.\" So the reason I ask this question is because generally, I'm managing teams of managers. And generally, I need people who have managed many people for a longer period of time. Or even if they're junior managers, how long and how many people they've managed is indicated by how many people they've fired. Because if you've never fired anyone, then you haven't managed very many people for very long, unfortunately.\n\n(01:01:39):\nAnd firing people is the hardest part of a leader's career. So how they talk about it, their compassion, and their need to drive the business, and the circumstances, \"Was it layoffs? How did that work? Did you have to performance manage someone out? How did it work? Did you just have to restructure the team because of business goals? How did it work?\" Gives you a lot of insight into their experience and their humanity in a way that they're not prepared for. So you really get the real story, and get a sense for what they would be like as a leader under a lot of pressure and difficult situations.\n\nLenny (01:02:17):\nI've never heard that one before and I love it. Reminds me of a episode with Matt Mochary where we talk about how to lay people off really successfully and elegantly.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:02:26):\nIt's a hard.\n\nLenny (01:02:27):\nYeah. Next question. What's a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:02:34):\nSo I follow my favorite products to the companies that I advise. I love 1Password. I've got my 85-year-old grandfather and all of my family and friends set up on it. I love the cross-platform nature.\n\n(01:02:45):\nI love Miro and whiteboards. I joined Productboard because of this cross-company alignment and views into what's coming up on the roadmap, which is really the most important thing for the company. Momentum, as we talked about, having a great product and a great product strategy. \n\n(01:03:02):\nAnd then I'm dabbling in all the AI things. I want to be excellent in AI visualization and art. I'm experimenting with Midjourney, but still kind of flailing. I've hired my 13-year old as my strategic advisor. And yeah, I'd love to work for OpenAI and ChatGPT. It's really interesting.\n\nLenny (01:03:23):\nWhat's something relatively minor that you've changed in the way a product is built or just the company operates, that has led to tremendous impact on their ability to execute?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:03:33):\nOn the product side, one of the concepts that I really like is the Amazon concept around writing the press release at the beginning of a product ideation. So one of the issues between marketing and product is the product will work so hard on something, and there'll be lots of different features, that it won't really be a theme that the marketing team can talk about. And then someone hands it to marketing and says, \"Make this marketable.\" One of my mentors had this comment, \"It's a bag of doorknobs.\" What do I do with this bag of doorknobs? Who wants to buy a bag of doorknobs? They want to buy the door and the concept.\n\n(01:04:13):\nSo I like this idea of writing a press release. Start with the end in mind, and then negotiate. Is this good enough? Will this really resonate? Or is this really what we're trying to build? Or is this really the outcome we're trying to get with the product? So I've heard about Amazon do it. We experimented with it at Classy. I haven't done it at mass scale, but I love the concept.\n\nLenny (01:04:31):\nFinal question. I know you're a meditator. We've talked a little bit about your Buddhist nature. What's one tip for people that have been trying to meditate and just can't make it happen? What's your one tip for helping people meditate more often?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:04:44):\nSo I'm a cheater because I was groomed to meditate. I don't remember how early, but I remember that the first meditations my mom had me listen to was a rainbow butterfly as I fell asleep when I was in kindergarten.\n\n(01:04:55):\nSo I've been meditating my whole life, with mixed success. And the real secret is just that there's no right way, that there's no wrong way. That it's just making the time to be present, and breathe, and sense, and be here now. \n\n(01:05:13):\nAnd so I use guided meditations mostly, because I'm not the best at quieting my own mind. I'm thrifty. So I use some free meditations. I use Tara Brach, who's a great meditator, who has short and long concept meditations. \n\n(01:05:30):\nAnd I like this old one called Meditation Oasis, which actually isn't in publishing anymore, but it's still a podcast. And I re-listen to all theirs over and over. So stick with it is the secret to meditation, and any benefits you get from being present in meditation, hopefully carry over to be being present in life.\n\nLenny (01:05:51):\nMy whole body just relaxed as you were talking through all that. So you have a skill. Carilu, this was amazing. We learned how to grow products, how to live better lives, how to become more mindful. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out? And/or how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:06:09):\nFollow me on LinkedIn, or I have a new blog carilu.com on Substack. Thanks to Lenny for the inspiration. And I still have one more advisory slot open, and I'd love to work with more AI companies. I just joined Weights & Biases in the ML op space. But if you know of other great scale up AI companies, I'd love to help junior marketing executives or first time founders see what the next stage of growth looks like and get there.\n\nLenny (01:06:39):\nAmazing. And again, if they are interested in that, how do they reach out to you?\n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:06:43):\nOn LinkedIn or through carilu.com.\n\nLenny (01:06:47):\nAmazing. Carilu, thank you again so much for making time and for being here. \n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:06:50):\nThanks for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:06:51):\nBye everyone.\n\nCarilu Dietrich (01:06:51):\nBye.\n\nLenny (01:06:55):\nThank you so much for listening.
