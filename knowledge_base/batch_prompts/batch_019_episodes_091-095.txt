I've never seen anything like it. I doubt I'll ever feel anything like this in business again where there's unlimited demand. How do you make sure that three months from now, six months, you have no regrets? Get on the plane to go talk to a customer, make the late night push, check the data six times over again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):\nYour company creates new data to continue advancing the intelligence of models. This is a business that you built on top of a business you've already had. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:00:24):\nWe're the largest expert network in the world. We have this massive strategic advantage, which is like no customer acquisition costs. The only moat in human data is access to an audience. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):\nYou guys come in after the model's trained to tweak the weights based on additional data that you you've created. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:00:38):\nThe models have gotten so good that the generalists are no longer needed. What they really need is experts. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):\nThere's this tension between all these students training models to become smarter, and then there's that they will have harder time potentially finding jobs. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:00:52):\nThat's not what we're hearing from our employers, this is just enabling human beings to be even more productive. You used to put a Google Search on a skill on your resume because you grew up with Google. Being AI native, young people are at a huge advantage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:05):\nToday my guest is Garrett Lord. Garrett is the co-founder and CEO of Handshake, which is one of the most interesting and incredible AI success stories that you probably haven't heard of. Handshake has been around for over 10 years, they're essentially LinkedIn for college students, it's a place for students to connect with companies to find a job. They are the platform of choice for every single Fortune 500 company. Over 1,500 colleges, over 20 million students and alumni, and over 1 million companies use them to hire graduates. At the start of this year, Garrett and his team realized that their huge proprietary network of students, including tens of thousands of PhDs and master's students, is extremely valuable to AI labs to help them create and label high quality training data. So, they launched a new business from zero to one in January. Four months later, they hit 50 million ARR. They're now on pace to blow past 100 million ARR within just 12 months. They'll exceed the revenue that they're making with their decade old business in under two years. \n\n(00:02:04):\nThis is a truly incredible and rare story, and one that I think a lot of teams can learn from because AI is creating a lot of opportunity but also a lot of potential disruption, and this is an amazing story where the company basically disrupted themselves. This episode is packed with insights, including a primer on what the heck are people actually doing when they're labeling and creating data to train models? A huge thank you to Garrett for making time for this, his wife just had a baby this week. He's also in the middle of scaling this insane new business. So thank you, Garrett.

A long-time subscriber.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:09):\nI appreciate that. Okay, so before we get into the insane trajectory that your data labeling business is on, which is just an amazing story that I think a lot of founders and product teams that are trying to navigate this AI disruption that's happening will have a lot to learn from. I want to first help people understand what the hell data labeling actually is. Just like, what are people actually doing? Why is this so valuable? Some of the most, I don't know, fastest-growing companies in the world today, including you guys are just, this is what you do. Clearly there's something really important here. I sort of understand it, probably not really. I think a lot of listeners feel the same way. So let me just ask you this, what is data labeling actually? What are people actually doing? And then, just why is this so valuable to frontier AI labs?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:05:55):\nYeah. So, I think it's helpful to take a step back of what does training a model look like? So, there's really two primary functions. There's a pre-training and a post-training process in training a model, and for a long time these AI providers, or LLMs, or Frontier Labs we're focused on basically sucking up more and more information on the pre-training side of the house. And that's basically the entire corpus of written human knowledge. So, that's not just written, but every YouTube video, every book, basically the pursuit of sucking up everything that was on the internet, and that was the pre-training side. And there was a lot of gains from pre-training, like models continue to get better. And about 18 months ago, 24 months ago, we started to really see an asymptoting of gains coming from, because they had essentially sucked up all of the knowledge on the internet. And so, labs really shifted towards most of the gains now coming from the post-training side of the house. \n\n(00:06:50):\nAnd what post-training is, is it's augmenting and improving the data they have across every discipline or capability area that they care about. So take coding, or mathematics, or law or finance, they are focused on collecting high quality data that really improves the state of our capabilities, their models, and you can see a lot of these popular benchmarks on what are called model parts. When Llama IV is released, you'll see the benchmarks across various domains, and each one of the research teams inside of the labs have different use cases. Basically they're running experiments, almost think like the scientific process. They have a hypothesis around how to improve the model. They're trying to collect small pieces of data to see if that hypothesis works out. If that hypothesis is proving true, then they expand the overall collection of the data in that advert. And it could look like reinforcement learning environments, it could look like trajectories, it could be audio and multimodal, it can be text-based like prompt-response pairs. \n\n(00:07:58):\nIt can also be reinforcement learning with human feedback, which is like preference ranking data. And so, that's the state of the art of models. And most of the gains that are happening from models right now are coming from the post-training side of the house. And there's just an incredible amount of demand to stay at the absolute frontier of where models are going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:20):\nSo training, pre-training is feeding it, say the entire internet. Here's like all the data that the humans have ever created, figure out knowledge and facts, and how to reason and all these things. Post-training, is it correct to say there's essentially two buckets of things to do? There's reinforcement learning, human feedback RLHF, and then there's kind of this bucket of fine-tuning?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:08:41):\nI mean, yes and no because take for example trajectories, or you want to be able to do, people use flight search or an accounting end-to-end process, or you want to be able to conduct biological experiments, you need actual trajectory data. There's still very much, a lot of the labs are still, they have points of view on what data collect. It's evolving very quickly. But I think reinforcement learning is really preference ranking, like which question do you like more, question A or question B? SFT data is a prompt and a response, and obviously the labs are very focused on these thinking or reasoning models. So, in order to improve a reasoning model you need to actually have the step-by-step instructions, of which when you interact with a lot of these frontier models they struggle in very advanced domains. And so, I think there's a variety of data that they're working with to improve capabilities in their models.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:39):\nWhat I'm hearing is there's other ways to post-train. Which of these are you guys focused on? Where do you help models most of these three-ish buckets?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:09:48):\nOur real unique proposition as a business is the fact that we have an engaged audience. We have 18 million professionals across, we have 500,000 PhDs, we have 3 million master students, we're a global platform. And so, depending on what you're looking for across any area, academic knowledge, what is the definition of a PhD? How do you get your PhD? You defend your thesis. Defending your thesis means, generally speaking, you have proven that you have extended the world's knowledge in a particular domain. And so, the ability to hyper-target this audience into chemistry, math, physics, biology, coding and really touch parts of human knowledge that have never before made it to the internet is really where we excel. And I would say that when you talk about the labeling market, something to make it more abstract is like it used to be generalists' work. \n\n(00:10:52):\nA lot of the market before the model started to get better was leveraging talented international lower cost labor to do basic generalist tasks. But really what's happened is the models have gotten so good that the generalists are no longer needed. What they really need is experts, experts across every area that the models are focused on. And really, you could think about these model builders as they're focused on the most economically valuable capability areas in the economy. And so that, generally speaking, right now is focused on advanced STEM domains, advanced science and math domains, and then the derivative functions of accounting, law, medicine, finance, where they want to make the models more capable. And then the work that we're doing, I think to come full circle to your question, we're doing work across so many domains. I mean, we have millions of bachelor students that are being used for work in audio, work in customizing a model depending on the voice and tone, where you are geographically in the country, what do women versus men prefer? All the way to the most advanced PhD STEM domains out there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:08):\nOkay. So, is it fair to say essentially all the data that is available has been trained on, and your company creates new data, new knowledge to continue advancing the intelligence of models?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:12:22):\nYep. And I also say we help point out where the models are weak. So, in order to break a model, it's pretty tough for the average person to break a model and get an incorrect response. But if you are a PhD in physics, you can go in multiple subdomains of physics and prove where the model's actually breaking, either breaking in its reasoning steps or it's where it's broken in its ground truth right answer, or we start throwing tools in there or needing to follow some step-by-step process. And I wouldn't say it's easy for them, but the average person cannot break the models and that's where we really come in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):\nSo, essentially it's just catching mistakes that the model has made. Okay. So, what are these people actually doing? I know there's all kinds of different types, you described all the ways that data's generated, what kind of data is useful? So, maybe just the most common examples. Let's say a PhD person is sitting there doing stuff, what are they actually doing?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:13:22):\nA great example is a public paper called GPQA. So, for the engineers out there that want to read about it, essentially the crux of the paper is you break the model, you provide a ground truth, the right answer to the question, you provide the step-by-step a reasoning steps. So, you might imagine because models are non-deterministic, the model can get the answer right once, but it might not get the answer right three out of five times. So, you actually prove where the model's failing. You actually break down into where is it failing? Maybe it can get, it knows the question, it can get the right answer, but the actual steps to get there are wrong and they really focus on the steps to get there. Say there's 10 steps in a math problem, step 6 through 10 is wrong. So, how do you fix the actual steps? \n\n(00:14:11):\nAnd what are they doing? So they're going in, we're really focused on calling this branding the experience and treating people like experts. PhD students expect to be treated different than a lower cost international labor with a different work expectation. And so, these PhDs come into a community, we have a instructional design team and an assessments team that's going through and basically iteratively helping them understand how to use the tools that we built, and how to interact with the latest models. Then they go in and start actually creating data. And that process is, on our side the model builders, they want to know that the data we're producing is high quality. Som we have our own research team, our own post-training team. \n\n(00:14:53):\nI hired a gentleman from Meta that went along on the post-training over there, and I-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:57):\nHope you paid him well. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:14:59):\nYeah. So, war for AI talent is very expensive, but super, super privileged and proud to be working with him. And so, each unit of data, we have to build it an environment for them to actually create the data. Then we have to understand in a unit level we're trying to approximate the actual gain from that piece of data and whether it can improve in a particular capability area. And then, we're also focused on evolving the use cases to also follow what the model builders want, which is they want more more real world tool use and trajectory based data as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:33):\nOkay. There's so much here, and we could go infinitely down here but I think that this is really interesting because just like people hear so much about all of this and they barely understand what the hell it actually is. So, this is for me really interesting. I think it's going to help a lot of people. So essentially a PhD, say a biologist, biology PhD is just their job is find flaws in what, say ChatGPT is producing, and then come up with here's the correct answer. And that is used to fine tune the mode, here's something you are doing incorrectly, here's the correct answer and that improves the model.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:15:33):\nYep. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:03):\nIs that a simple way to think about it? And please correct anything I'm saying that is incorrect because I don't want people to misunderstand it.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:16:08):\nYeah. I mean, a great example, let's take a non-verifiable domain like education. So there's a PhD student, Rachel on the network, she got her PhD from the University of Miami, spent two decades as a teacher teaching students in the eighth grade. And she was an adjunct professor at a local community college in the field of education. And so, she is interacting with the state-of-the-art models in educational design. So, actually trying to understand what is the best way to teach people, and how do you spot incorrect issues in a model in the way that they're training people, and help the models understand the forefront of educational design with the hands-on experience of being an eighth grade teacher for 10 plus years and having a PhD in education? So, that's an example of you can have that all the way down to a verifiable engineering problem that you're seeing the latest models fail on.\n\n(00:17:12):\nYeah, I think that gives you the gamut. You also have, we talk about professional domains like these reinforcement learning environments, there's a bunch of papers out there that basically speak to people narrating over their step-by-step tool use. So, as they go to solve a problem from start to finish, interact with multiple different service areas, interact with multiple different tools, they're like, there's papers that talk about this, talking over what they're doing, actually following and screen recording where their mouse is going, how they're problem solving. When they run into a roadblock, what do they do? So, they really want to understand how humans think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:50):\nYou mentioned this term trajectory. Can you just explain what that actually means? Because it feels like you've mentioned that a few times and that feels important to all this.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:17:56):\nYeah. A trajectory is basically just like the entire environment that is collecting what you're doing. So it's your screen, it's your mouse-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:04):\nOh, I see. Oh, wow. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:18:05):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:06):\nIncluding this voiceover, okay. And then, this might be too technical, but what is the output of all this work? This, say teacher, is it just like a JSON file, an XML file, like a text file?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:18:15):\nYeah, it can be managed JSON data.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:17):\nJSON data? Okay. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:18:18):\nAnd then, we also have multimodal work like audio, like classifying music and understanding ... We're engaging thousands, or not thousands, probably hundreds of top music students at the music schools in the country who are improving models of understanding of music. And you also have the thing called, which we haven't talked about here, a rubrics, and rubric models are, you can put a model in as a judge. What is a good educational design, or what's a good MRI result? In some of these domains, you actually don't have a guaranteed correct right answer. And so, models can sit in the middle as a judge and actually understand what is ... Think back on your school days. How do you get A on your 5,000 word paper? Well, there's a great introductory statement and there's scientific proof. So, you can build a rubric that allows a model to sit in the middle and actually auto-evaluate responses. We're seeing a lot of rubrics work as well. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:28):\nAnd you would think, why would you trust this one teacher's opinion that this is the right way to do it? But what's cool is the market speaks for itself. If these models are being used more and more, and people love them and value them, I imagine steps in between to verify this is good and other people think this is a good idea. It feels like the market dynamics will tell you if the data you're providing is correct at what people want. Is there something more there?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:19:52):\nI didn't get a PhD in AI, or math, or physics, and I haven't trained myself, we have frontier models, but there is a lot to each unit of data whether it's improving. There's a ton of science and research out right now around how do you make sure that the data that you're producing is improving the model? And it's very hard for model builders to understand. They really care about, to zoom out, they care about three things. They care about quality first and foremost. You have to have high quality data. And if you imagine you're training a model, like teaching a student and you're giving it the wrong data, it's extremely challenging to overcome that. So, quality is first and foremost. And then, the other huge problems you have is volume. How do you generate thousands of pieces of data in the most advanced domains of chemistry, and mathematics, and physics, and how do you ensure that it's high quality?\n\n(00:20:48):\nWell for us, say in physics, we just reach out to students at Stanford, and Berkeley, and MIT, and they're at the top GPA at the best physics schools in the country. And so, our ability to get to scale or volumes of data, to produce very high quality data, is something they care deeply about. And then, the other thing I would say model builders care about is speed, because they have all these hypotheses and they're constantly testing different pipelines. And so, you might have three or four bets going at once, and then as soon as one is actually showing a gain, imagine you're a researcher or you're assigned to the processes, once you're running a gain then you're trying to grow that pipeline and grow that piece of data that's actually improving it, and you're maybe ditching two or three other projects you had that weren't showing improvement. \n\n(00:21:31):\nSo, your ability to quickly turn around for them in a period of days, and then get to high volumes of data that are high quality is the number one thing they care about. And so, there's quite a bit of technology we built on our side to assess each unit of data. We have our own post-training teams, we're renting our own GPUs, and we're trying to make sure that we can sit directly with these researchers and help share what we're seeing with the data that we're creating and how it could improve their model, how they could best train with it. So, hopefully that helps.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:03):\nGoing back to the types of post-training, just because I think this might be helpful, at least for me the mental model of there's pre-training, there's post-training, within post-training there's reinforcement learning, human feedback, there's this concept of fine-tuning. There's also evals and stuff like-\n\nGarrett Lord (00:22:03):\nThere's SFT, yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:19):\nSFT, which is supervised fine-tuning? Is that-\n\nGarrett Lord (00:22:22):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):\nYeah. So, the stuff you've been describing, would you mostly describe that as supervised fine-tuning?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:22:29):\nYes, and we're doing all of the above. We don't do the auto eval, we produce rubrics which are used auto evals. But yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:39):\nOkay, awesome. So essentially there's a model, it's trained on all this amazing data. You guys come in after the model's trained to tweak the weights based on additional data that you create. What's interesting is that this is a scalable system. I want to talk about just the supply of amazing people that you have producing this, but it's amazing that humans can do this. You would think it needs to be this infinitely scalable thing, but humans sitting there creating data is working and improving the intelligence of models significantly.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:23:13):\nOh, yeah. I mean, I think maybe a funny joke is all the MBAs think this is all just going to go away. And I think for as long as models are improving, humans will be needed in this process. And when you talk to the lead scientists and researchers at these labs, it's like the data types will evolve and what they're trying to capture and collect, but there will be humans needed in the space for the next decade until we reach full ASI. So yeah, I mean, you think about in a lot of them will struggle to do basic trajectories right now. So, right now people are very focused on academic domains, and I think they'll continue to be focused on academic domains, but there will also be far, far more demand for professional domains as well across basically every trajectory or step-by-step problem that a knowledge worker solves in the workplace, it's the pursuit of these labs to make sure that they're trying to collect the data to help add as much value in that process for humans as possible. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:17):\nSo, let me ask you about this. There's this tension, I imagine, people might feel between all these students training models to become smarter, and smarter, and smarter, and then there's that they will have harder time potentially finding jobs if models are so smart that people at entry level aren't being hired as much. How do you think about just that tension? Do you think this is a real problem or not, or do you think this goes-\n\nGarrett Lord (00:24:42):\nI'm probably in the camp of like GDP growth over universal basic income. I very much believe that this is going to improve and accelerate every human's ability to create an impact in the economy in the world, and that we're hearing from, there's like a million companies that use Handshake. 100% of the Fortune 500 uses Handshake, so we basically power the vast majority of how young people find jobs, and a lot of people are hyperbolic at saying that all young people won't have jobs, and that's not what we're hearing from our employers. What we're hearing is pick social media marketing, before you needed somebody that could do Photoshop, and take pictures, and create the videos. Then you needed somebody that understood marketing analytics platforms to track your posting on different social media forms. It's like now one person, one young, talented, AI native, Iron Man suit enabled young person can get on and they can build their own videos, produce their own creative assets, post across multiple social media platforms, run all of their own analytics. They don't need a data science degree to be able to do that.\n\n(00:25:47):\nOr take an intern in our company, he had his first PR up I think the afternoon he started. You were a PM, you realize how challenging that would've been historically to get your dev environment set up and figure out where to add value. You just took a bug and squashed it. And so, I'm really a believer this is just enabling human beings to be even more productive and create more impact. And yeah, of course, hundreds of millions of jobs, the jobs will evolve. People will become displaced, they'll have to upscale and rescale, and I think Handshake has a huge role to play in helping knowledge workers evolve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:24):\nThis has come up a couple of times this point that I think is really good, that younger people coming out of school are actually going to be much more likely to be successful because they're growing up with these tools, and are much more native to all these advanced tools and so they just come in as beasts just doing so much more.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:26:42):\nWell, do you remember when, this a little bit predates me, but you used to put Google search on as a skill on your resume. You were person, you were good at Googling, because you grew up with Google. It's like I think being AI native and having your Iron Man suit on, and understanding how to leverage these tools is like young people are at a huge advantage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:03):\nYeah. And especially if they're involved in training these models, I imagine there's some other cool advantage there. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:27:08):\nYeah. Well I mean, just to hit on that, what we're hearing from our thousands of fellows is they're in the classroom, they're actually producing research. We're talking about PhDs at the top institutions in the country. They can make 100, 150, $200 an hour in their area, in their field of expertise. It's pretty sweet. You can make 25 bucks an hour being a teacher's assistant, or you can actually make $150 an hour breaking the latest models, and what we're hearing from our fellows is they're bringing a lot of those insights into the classroom to help them be more effective at teaching. More importantly, they're starting to learn how to leverage these tools to actually advance their area of research. So, they believe that these tools can help them advance their area of research by helping them be more effective with their time. And so, it is quite cool to get paid to learn a skill.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:58):\nBefore I get to the story of how this all emerged, because that is an incredible story, is there anything else about this whole field of labeling, of reinforcement learning that you think people just don't fully understand or you think that is really important? There's just so much happening. Like I said, some of the fastest growing companies in the world are in the space, Scale was just acquired for 30, sort of acquired for $30 billion. Just what else is there, if there's anything, that you think people need to understand?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:28:26):\nGenerally speaking, anytime that you're interacting with a model and you're asking it to do really advanced things, and it's not performing your expectations, like somewhere there's probably an expert that is the top mind in that domain working directly for the best researchers in the world at the Frontier Labs trying to understand and go through the scientific iteration process of how to make that better. And that the assumption there is that they already have the entirety of human knowledge that's written and recorded. And so, for as long as there are problems in solving any problem with AI, any human problem, there will need to be humans in the loop helping advance that. And models don't generalize. I mean, obviously the field will advance a lot and the type of data they'll collect will evolve a lot, but it's pretty exciting at the frontier. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:20):\nKevin Wheel was on the podcast, the CBO at OpenAI, and he made this point that really stuck with me that the model of today is the worst model you will ever use. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:29:29):\nI love that line. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:30):\nWill only get better, just boggles the mind, and now we know why things are getting better because all the work you guys are doing. Just one quick question on this whole scale thing, I guess they were, I don't know, the main company doing this, now they're swallowed up and Alex is running superintelligence in Meta. Are they still a big player in this labeling space or are they out of it and that's a big opportunity?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:29:50):\nYeah. I mean, kudos to the whole Scale team, a lot of respect for what they built, just many great companies operating the space. I think to the core of your question, I think if you viewed your research team and your model building team, and the experiments they're running to be really the cornerstone of how you're improving, you probably wouldn't want the latest research of what you're trying to work on being invested in by a peer. I mean, that's just generally what we hear in this space. And so, we have seen an incredible search and demand, and are I think extraordinarily well positioned. We like to say the only moat in human data is access to an audience. Basically, there are many, many small players in this space, some midsize players in the space, and they're basically running TikTok ads, running Instagram ads, paying money for Google Search display ads, YouTube ads, and they will be like, \"Can you get me 200 physics PhDs?\"\n\n(00:30:58):\nWhat do they do? They only can do one thing. They have 100 recruiters on staff, they all get on LinkedIn, they all send messages, they spend a couple million bucks on performance advertising campaigns. Somebody's scrolling their Instagram feed that's a physics PhD of which you can't target them that well and they like see, \"Come train a model.\" It's like, \"I've never heard of this brand before.\" The huge advantage that we've had and why we've resonated so fast in the marketplace is we built a decade of trust with 18 million people, and they trust us, and we built a ton of brand affinity, and they use Handshake, and they have an active profile, and we have a ton of information around their academic performance and what they've done in school. And so, we're able to really target people really effectively, and get to scale and volume of high quality data faster than anyone else. And I think that competitive advantage of access to an audience is really resonating in the marketplace. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:49):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Anthropic, the team behind Claude. I use Claude at least 10 times a day. I use it for researching my podcast guests, for brainstorming title ideas for both my podcast and my newsletter, for getting feedback on my writing and all kinds of stuff. Just last week I was preparing for an interview with a very fancy guest, and I had Claude tell me what are all the questions that other podcast hosts have asked this guest so that I don't ask them these questions? How much time do you spend every week trying to synthesize all of your user research insights, support tickets, sales calls, experiment results and competitive intel? Claude can handle incredibly complex multistep work. You can throw a 100-page strategy document at it and ask it for insights, or you can dump all your user research and ask it to find patterns. With Claude 4 and the new integrations including Claude 4 Opus, the world's best coding model, you get voice conversations, advanced research capabilities, direct Google Workspace integration, and now MCP connections to your custom tools and data sources. Claude just becomes part of your workflow. \n\n(00:32:53):\nIf you want to try it out, get started at Claude.ai/Lenny, and using this link you get an incredible 50% off your first three months of the pro plan. That's Claude.ai/Lenny. \n\n(00:33:06):\nOkay, this is an awesome segue to where I wanted to go, which is just how this business emerged. This is a business that you built on top of a business you've already had. From what I understand, you were at like $150 million in revenue, you've been at this for a long time. You found this opportunity, and now that looking back it's like obviously this is an amazing idea, labs need data, you guys have the supply of incredible experts. What an opportunity. Talk about just how you first realized this was something that you could be doing, and should be doing, and then how you started to execute down this path.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:33:40):\nYeah, I think it's been a pretty natural extension from helping people jumpstart, restart or start their career. Monetizing your skills and this new employment ecosystem is going to look very different in the future, and to zoom into how we discovered it, it's like because we have such a large access to this audience, and as the world shifted from generalists to experts, we're the largest expert network in the world. We have more PhDs, 500,000 of them use Handshake than any other platform. We have three million master students who are in school or alumni. And so, we started to see all what I would call middleman companies reaching out to us saying, \"Can we recruit your PhDs and master's students?\" And like any great marketplace we started sending them to these different platforms, and started to really realize that from hearing from our users that the experience was really frustrating. \n\n(00:34:38):\nTraining was very transactional, it was very amorphous how you could get paid. There was immense amount of drop-off in the process to actual project like completion on these other platforms. So, we started to think the company was making tens of millions of dollars from helping these other platforms, and we started to realize what really kicked it off was hearing also from the Frontier Labs, they started to reach out to us and started to go direct and trying to almost cut out the middleman. And we started to realize, well, we could really serve our fellows, our PhDs, our experts, we could treat them. We just believe there will need to be a platform, an experts first platform in the pursuit of ASI and advancing AI, and there will need to be a place that everyone in the world could go to, to monetize their skills and their knowledge as these labs are focused on improving in all these multidisciplinary. And yeah, we entered the business in, really I started doing it over Christmas and New Year's. That's when I started flying around.\n\n(00:35:48):\nMy family thought it was a little wild that I was on planes trying to chase different leaders, but we built an incredible team of people that came from the human data world, and really started building out our platform in January, and then started really monetizing the relationships about five months ago. Fast-forward to today, we're working with seven of the Frontier Labs, basically every lab that's doing work and building the best large language models, and the team has exploded and revenue's exploded, and it's been really a incredible ride running back new company inside of a company for the second time over again. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):\nAnd just to share some numbers, tell me if this is correct or if you're sharing these, but I heard that you hit 50 million in revenue just four months into this? Today we're at eight months in and you're on track to hit $100 million in revenue in the first year.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:36:43):\nI think we'll blow through that number, but yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:44):\nOkay. Incredible. And I didn't even know there were seven Frontier Labs, that's-\n\nGarrett Lord (00:36:49):\nZero to 50 is pretty good in four months, I think. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:51):\nThink zero to 50 million in four months, that's something. It's like the bar has been shifting constantly. A year ago that'd be legendary. Now it's like, all right, well another one of these. 50 million in four months, no big deal. It's truly insane. Just to zoom out one second, for people that don't know a ton about Handshake, the original business, what was that? What was actually this network that you had, that you sat on top of?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:37:18):\nYeah, that network does about 200 million. This will do about [inaudible 00:37:21]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:18):\n200 million.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:37:18):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:18):\nOkay. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:37:20):\nSo, we have 600-ish super passionate teammates that work on the core business, which I would separate those. These aren't two businesses, I think it's one business, but what is that business? If you're a young person in America that's graduated in the last five, six, seven, eight years, you probably have Handshake on your phone. You definitely know what Handshake is. It's a verb with young people in America, it's a verb with people that are in college in their PhD or master's program, and it is, I call it an unconnected graph, meaning you don't need to ... LinkedIn is very focused on who you know and what your experience is. The first question on LinkedIn is what's your job? And a lot of young people start off, they've never had a job before. They don't have 500 connections to add to their graph. \n\n(00:38:13):\nWhereas on Handshake, you start off trying to discover, and explore, and figure out how to navigate through school and figure out, \"Oh, I'm an engineer. Maybe I want to be a PM, maybe I want to work at a startup, maybe I want to go to a larger company.\" What are the pros and cons you want to learn from your peers and young alumni? And so, Handshake's this I call a very social platform with groups, and messaging, and profiles, and short-form video and feed, all focused on your interests and helping really build your confidence in your early career to find your first job, your second job, and to manage 18 to 30, I would say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:49):\nAnd how long has that business been around? \n\nGarrett Lord (00:38:51):\nIt's been around 10 years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):\n10 years, okay. So it's just again, it just feels like such a holy shit, you guys are in the right place in the right time with the right network that is extremely valuable now. What an interesting story. I feel like it's just another interesting example of you've been doing something for a long time and then all of a sudden AI is just, opens up a whole new way of leveraging something that you have been doing for a long time. It makes me think a little better about Bolt, and StackBlitz, which was building for seven years this browser based OS where you could run an OS in the browser. And they're like, \"I don't know, no one needs this. What are we doing?\" And then, all of a sudden AI and they're like, \"Oh, what if we build AI apps in the browser and just generate products for you with AI?\" And now it's, I don't know, one of the fastest growing companies in the world. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:39:36):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:37):\nSo interesting. And so, I think this is just an interesting time for our people to think about what have we done that may give us a new opportunity to build something huge based on this unfair advantage that we have?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:39:49):\nI think also as your company grows in size and headcount, and maturity, it's also hard to incubate something new inside of a business. It's hard in so many ways. The way that you build zero to one, and find product market fit, and scale a team very quickly and is very different than the way that you run a more mature business that has been around for 10 years with hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people. So, I've really had a ton of fun and found a ton of passion in running it back again for the second time inside the business. And then yeah, we have this massive strategic advantage, which is no cost or acquisition costs, and we have much higher conversion rates and retention than any of the other platforms by a large margin because we have such consumer affinity. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:43):\nThere's actually two threads here I want to follow, I'm going to follow the second one first, this idea of where this data labeling work can come from. This isn't a really clear, simple, understandable one, which is just experts sitting there creating data. Another one that I know a lot of other companies in this space use Scale, I know especially with just like low-cost labor internationally. Are there other methods for doing this that isn't one of those two? How are other companies doing this?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:41:10):\nI think if you care about building a really high quality business, and having good gross margin and high quality growth, the ecosystem here is, one of the leading players, they have 200 recruiters. It's unsustainable. There are like 200 people on LinkedIn sending individual messages to acquire these people, because there's no brand, there's no trust. They're spending tens of millions of dollars a month on performance advertising, Google Ads-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:39):\nTo find experts and to find folks. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:41:41):\nFind experts. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):\nAnd it's experts mostly at this point. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:41:43):\nYeah. And then they put them onto an experience that is treating them like they're drawing boundary boxes around stop signs in the Philippines. The frontier tax accountants don't want to be treated like low cost international labor, and I don't think anyone enjoys that process. And so, the ability to build a experience that's rooted in community, that's rooted in high quality training. If you're getting your PhD at MIT, chances are you're just not being taught well enough on how to use the tools.\n\n(00:42:15):\nIt's not you can't break the models, it's just like the other platforms, they're spending thousands of hours to acquire an individual user and they're put right into a project with no training. So, we just started from day one at building this expert ... We believe there'd be a deep network effect here that's very connected to our core business of starting, jumpstarting or restarting your career. And you come in, you build a profile, you see the community, there's groups and a feed of here's how people are learning. You come into actual individual cohort with peers that look like you and have your similar background. You're being taught on how to interact, and there's a trial and error, and we have an instructional design piece so you can't do it. Then you're put on the projects where building ... There's certain swim lanes where we're actually pre-building data and selling that data to all the labs. \n\n(00:43:03):\nSo, we can do this thing where we produce one unit of data ourselves. We pay for it, almost like a movie production. We pay for a unit of data, and then we make sure it's very high quality. We run our own post-training on it, and then we produce a bunch of specifications of the data, and we actually sell that individual package of data to many different labs. And so, you get put on a project like that. Once you're doing a really, really good job on our projects, oftentimes then we'll put you on customer projects where they only want the best of the best people in machine learning. And then they go from our projects to their projects. And so, there's a huge customer acquisition. You love going deep on your podcast, so just to talk about it, it's like you really have a couple of things that matter.\n\n(00:43:46):\nYou have a cost to customer acquisition, your CAC, and then you have your LTV, like the lifetime value of a user. And an LTV is calculated pretty simply in this business. It is based on the retention of a person, and how many projects they can participate in. So, if you treat people really well, you train them really well, well, A, we have no customer acquisition costs because we partner with 1,600 universities, power 92% of the top 500 schools in the country. We power almost every institution and community college in the country. We have no customer acquisition cost to acquire the people. We have a ton of brand and trust with them built up, so they convert at really, really high rates. And then, if you treat them really well, because what they expect from us, they know Handshake, their school buys Handshake, we care about treating these people well but the universities would not tolerate our partnership with these fellows unless we treated them well. \n\n(00:44:41):\nSo, you put them into this process where our LTVs and repeat engagement rate and retention rate on different projects is really high. And so, these structural advantages are quite significant when you contrast a leading provider that has 200 individual contributing recruiters, and are spending tens of millions of dollars a month on performance marketing. So, that's I think why we've seen so much success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:07):\nThat's extremely interesting. And it feels like, as you said, there used to be a big focus on generalists, which is people anywhere in the world for low-cost can do the work, like draw bounding boxes around things. And essentially the market has shifted from low-cost generalists to experts. And a lot of these companies like Scale, we're optimizing for general work model training data, and you guys are set up to be extremely good at expert based data. And so, you're in the right place at the right time, at the right supply. What a business.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:45:43):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:43):\nNice work.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:45:44):\nI would say it's not been easy building business two inside of business one, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:48):\nYeah. So, let me follow that thread. That's where I wanted to go. What was just that like? So, you started noticing that model companies were coming to your people, that people were having hard times with some of these other companies in this space and you're like, \"Oh, maybe we should be doing this sort of thing\"? How did that just initial inception start, and how did you start to explore that idea and to see if it was a real thing?\n\nGarrett Lord (00:46:09):\nTactically we were working with many of the middleman companies doing work. We started to see the demand, as I talked about earlier. We started to see direct outreach from the Frontier Labs reaching out to us, trying to cut out the middleman in their pursuit of getting higher-quality data. When we started to put together the dots on we could build a way better experience for our fellows, we could serve them directly to the labs and build a direct customer relationship with the labs, and basically cut out the middleman. And provide a better experience to the labs, provide a better experience to our fellows and provide a better experience to our million companies in the network.\n\n(00:46:48):\nAnd you might think about just upskilling and reskilling, what's going to happen there. So, we walked into this space. We started in really December, exploring and learning more about it, like on expert calls and hammering down. I hired three expert firms, AlphaSights and GLG, and started doing a bunch of calls with the latest researchers, because we had resources. One of the cool things about being a larger company is our core business is $200 million ARR, so it's like we had resources to be able to accelerate the learning curve here. And then, we started working with arguably the number one lab about five months ago. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):\nI wonder who that is. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:47:35):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:35):\nYeah, wonder who it is. \n\nGarrett Lord (00:47:39):\n[inaudible 00:47:39] different answers working with the number one lab, and have just now we're working with Devin on the Frontier Labs and the number one thing we're trying to do is just focus on scaling up. And we've gone from four or five people working on this to 75 plus people working on it. I think we had 12 people start last Monday. It's like we are so bottlenecked on just meeting this opportunity, because in this market there's essentially unlimited demand. If you can produce high quality volumes of data, you most likely will be able to sell whatever you produce. And so on our side, it's like we're really focused on making sure that we pick the right longer term strategy, making sure that we don't grow too fast as to erode the trust that we've built up with these Frontier labs. Yeah, but it's been fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:38):\nYou said it's also been really hard to start those business within an existing business. What's been hard? What's been hardest? You touched on a couple of these elements already, but what else? \n\nGarrett Lord (00:48:50):\nI think I just followed a lot more of my intuition around this, doing this. The story of Handshake was we had to sign up 1,600 universities, so I had to learn how to be the best ... We are the fastest growing higher education company in history. So, we signed up six 1,600 schools. Then we had to build an employer business, where we had to figure out how to sell the 100% ... All these Fortune 500 companies use it and 70% of it pay for it, so I had to learn about upmarket sales to Goldman Sachs, and General Motors, and Google and the biggest companies in the world, which is totally different than selling universities. And then we had to learn how to build an incredible student social network. What does the best feed look like? What does group messaging look like? So, I felt a little bit of familiarity in those zero to ones. \n\n(00:49:39):\nOftentimes marketplaces are like many zero to ones. Sometimes I dream that we just, I actually don't dream, but I make a joke that I just wish we were a cybersecurity company and we had one buyer and just one product, and it was just like we had to ... In a marketplace, you have to serve three different sides, you know from your time at Airbnb. And so, one of my learnings in spinning up these three different businesses in starting Handshake was I was pretty hands-on. So, everyone reported directly to me. I really said in a lot of meetings, \"I'm not trying to be the boss, I'm just trying to get another smart guy in the room.\" We've hired an incredible team of people that have spent a lot of time in the space and have been big leaders at a lot of the human data companies in the space.\n\n(00:50:27):\nAnd so, everyone saw very clearly the structural advantages that we had, and a lot of the focus was on making sure that we could deliver high-quality data to one customer before we expand to anyone else. You had to say no to a lot of things. And then, you also had a lot of people in the core part of the business that, rightfully so, there's just checks and balances that there's a lot of people that try to get involved. Everyone wants to say, not everyone, this is a stretch, but it's easy to say no. It's easy to be like, \"I can't prioritize that this week or this month. I have an existing set of priorities.\" So essentially, with the exception of a few things, everyone just came straight into this new org that I built, everyone did not have any responsibilities in the existing part of the business. It was extremely clear who was the directly responsible individual across each area of the new co. And now we've got deeper coupling and integration points across the rest of the business, but we sat in a separate part of the office. \n\n(00:51:35):\nEveryone's in the office five days a week, a lot of weekends. There's a totally different expectation in hiring talent too, where it's like, \"Hey, this is a 24/7 job. This is an early-stage company.\" The compensation was also different too, and based on hurdles in this new business so people felt owners creating the new co. And yeah, it's still extremely nimble, very, very flat. Just because you run one function doesn't mean you're the directly responsible individual on a project. We pick the best person who's most capable of driving an initiative forward, regardless of the function to be the DRI. We're a lot more metrics-oriented. When I built Handshake, we resisted this operating cadence for a long time, this weekly, monthly, quarterly operating cadence. With Handshake AI, we've been way more focused on operating with data, and metrics, and rigor from an early stage. There's a gentleman named Sahil on our team who's been doing an incredible job with that. Shout out Sahil, shout out young, shout out Paco. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:42):\nOkay, this is incredible. So, a few elements of what allowed this to succeed within a decade-old company. And by the way, so you're at 200 million a year in revenue with the traditional business. You're going to, as you said, blow past 100 million in the first year of this new business. So, it's wild that in the first couple years, if things continue to go this way, you'll exceed the run rate of a business that took you 10 years to build. Incredible. To make this successful, a few of the things I noted as you were talking, one is clearly you were just in founder mode. You're the lead of this new business. You weren't delegating it to someone, \"Hey, go start this thing.\" You dedicated people, \"Here, we're going to pick people. You have nothing else going on, this is your new job. You're going to work on this stuff.\" \n\n(00:53:28):\nYou worked in different part of the office. There's a metrics-based cadence. It's just like, let's stay really diligent about here's how it's going, here's where we're going, here's our track, here's our KPIs, things like that. Anything else there that you felt really important to making this work? Because a lot of companies are going to try to do this, I imagine, and so I'm curious what else you found important to make this work.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:53:50):\nYeah. I mean, I just really believe in separate and everything. Separate engineering team, separate design team, separate accounts and operations team, separate finance team. Early on, everything was separate. People only had one job and one job only, and that was making Handshake AI successful. We had a couple integration points more, and I had an incredible executive team and a core part of business, and now there's becoming more and more involvement. But our executives that have built Handshake for a long time ran the core business, and I focused 80 plus percent of my time and attention on just this. And we hired an incredible engineering leader like Avery, who ... We have a lot of entrepreneurs, people that have started companies inside the company. Or pardon me, people that started companies before. That was huge. A lot of familiarity with hiring talent that have only worked at early stage companies so [inaudible 00:54:44] that feels super comfortable with ambiguity. \n\n(00:54:46):\nWe were also way more upfront around this is going to be chaotic. Just owning that narrative in front of all hands at the core company, owning it directly with the team. We have a separate all hands, we have separate onboarding, we have a separate recruiting team. I had some connection points, but mostly separate. And I think that was absolutely critical. We took some of the top people, I mean, we have great people in the core business, we took some great people from the core businesses and basically said, \"Sorry, I know you love your old team. I know you love what you're doing. Will you join us in Handshake AI?\" And they completely forego their historical responsibilities and came over. That became really critical with engineering when things started to scale and topple, and we're growing so quickly we took some of our top senior engineers, who were very entrepreneurial, and principal engineers, staff of engineers, parachute them in. It's been awesome to ask some of the most talented people in the core business like, \"Hey, do you want to come over here and do this?\"\n\n(00:55:49):\nAnd sometimes they say no. They're like, \"I don't want to work most of the weekends.\" The number of 2:00 AM, 3:00 AM nights we done in this business, I mean, it's quite regular. People sometimes don't want to commit to that, but we've been up front, like here are the expectations for this team. It's an insane pace. If you want to be a part of one of the fastest growing businesses in Silicon Valley, you can join it. The ownership too has also been huge, like owning this outcome, and we have this motto to leave nothing to chance. For a while there we drew the number of days in the year on the whiteboard and it was like, there will never be a time like this. I've never seen anything like it, I doubt I'll ever feel anything like this in business again where there's unlimited demand and it's just our ability to execute against it.\n\n(00:56:39):\nAnd so, we had this motto like leave nothing to chance. How do you make sure that three months are not six months? You have no regrets. Get on the plane to go talk to a customer, make the late night push, check the data six times over again, ship the extra feature that helps. And really, a huge celebratory culture too. It's very flat so there really isn't this principle of ... There's so many people putting up points, directly calling out the people that are putting up points and creating a really fun environment around impact I think has been awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:14):\nThe leave nothing to chance piece I imagine speaks partly to the value of trust in what you're doing. You win if they can trust that your data's awesome, and great, and consistent, and I could see why that ends up being such an important part of what you're building. And just listening to you describe this, I understand it's obviously a massive opportunity, obviously a massive advantage you guys have, and just the stress that comes with that burden also imagine is very high of just like we can't screw this up.\n\nGarrett Lord (00:57:44):\nNo. Yes, Handshake should be a ... Business does billions dollars revenue as a public company, we should be able to continue to ... I mean, and it also helps our core business. The longer term opportunity that we see is it's connecting, it's building the best job mashing marketplace on the internet. It's probably one of the largest problems in the world like labor supply mashing. It's where people spend most of their time and energy, just hours of their life they spend it at work. The process of searching for a job, applying to a job is going to be completely reinvented with AI. We've been leading the charge there. An AI interviewer that's collecting skills and actually asking about your experiences, doing work simulation experiences that help employers find the best candidates. I mean, I don't know the last time you've done this, but the hiring manager process, reviewing 200 resumes, are you kidding me? \n\n(00:58:49):\nI'm going to sit there and review 200 resumes? Not a chance five years from now. Students manually making cover ... Not a chance. So, there will need to be a marketplace that wins in connecting supply and demand, and talent with opportunity, and we think and get psyched about the opportunity for impact here. That's my story, I went to community college, I paid my way through school. I went to a no name school in Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I worked at Palantir as an intern, it totally changed my life, and I started Handshake because I wanted to make it easier for anyone regardless of who you knew, what your parents did, what school you went to, to find a great opportunity. And I think AI, totally step function improvement in matching. And I think that our human data business is really serving as the foundation for improving matching. \n\n(00:59:44):\nA lot of things that we're doing in the human data business are being integrated to our core business. I think that's going to improve outcomes for employers, save them in the aggregate like billions of dollars over time. And I think it makes the experience way better for students. So, it's just like we have to meet the moment. We still have the stamina, and the excitement, and the passion internally in our core and in the new business to go charge after this. And that's a lot of the message we've been sharing internally is it's time to amp it up. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be positioned as well, and we are going to make the moment as a team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:19):\nIt really is. This very much feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity. Let me ask a few other questions along these lines that are something I've been thinking about, something that a lot of people think about, just while I have you, there's always this question of will we run out of data? Will model stop advancing? Are we going to hit some plateau and there's not actually going to be some AGI moment, SGI moment? So first of all, do you think we'll run out of data? There's a point at which we just can't produce more knowledge and data to feed these models? And along those lines, what do you think is the biggest bottleneck to advancing models faster and further?\n\nGarrett Lord (01:00:50):\nYeah, I mean, it's just the type of data we're going to need is going to evolve. It's going to be CAD files, it's going to be scientific tool use data as they try to automate scientific discoveries and drug discovery. It's going to be esoteric operating systems that exist on scientific tools. So, I love this trajectory and stitching together step-by-step instruction following. The type of data we're going to need is going to evolve a lot. And we haven't even talked about multimodal, and video, and text and audio. There's a huge demand for audio data right now. So, the type of data's going to evolve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:38):\nYeah, I use voice mode all the time. That's on my default ChatGPT experience, just talking to-\n\nGarrett Lord (01:01:42):\nIt's amazing. It's amazing. I just had a baby on, or my wife had a baby on Sunday, and voice mode's been incredible. I mean, every night, every two hours it's like I have more questions. Voice mode's been huge. So, shot out voice mode. Yeah, so the type of data is going to collect a lot, or change a lot. I think synthetic data has a role to play and in verifiable domains, but what we consistently hear from companies it's like synthetic data is not going to dominate. There's billions, and billions, and billions of dollars of value to extract as a company over the next decade and following the frontier of AI development.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:24):\nLet me first say just huge kudos to you for just having a kid, your wife just having a kid a few days ago, and building this business that is growing bananas and doing this podcast conversation. I really appreciate you. \n\nGarrett Lord (01:02:35):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):\nOf course. Is there anything else that we haven't covered that you think might be helpful for folks to hear, or a part of your story that you think might be helpful for folks to learn from, or something you may want to just double down on that we've talked about before we get to a very exciting lightning round? \n\nGarrett Lord (01:02:52):\nI mean, the thing I always love talking, I'm really passionate about people starting companies and helping them do so. I just think in this moment right now with AI, for young entrepreneurs that listen, that read this podcast, because I've been a reader since 2020. We looked. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:07):\nYeah, we did check. That's incredible. \n\nGarrett Lord (01:03:08):\nYeah, been a long-term reader. I'm just so curious and love sucking up-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:08):\nAppreciate it. \n\nGarrett Lord (01:03:11):\n... your interviews. But it's like you just focus on doing something of meaning that really helps people. And I think with AI, there's going to be so many opportunities to improve the way people learn. I'm just really passionate about trying to make Handshake a platform that is not only an incredible business, but is also something that really helps solve a societal problem that matters. And yeah, that's be my one shout out here. If anyone wants advice on how to do that or wants to reach out, I'm happy to chat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:43):\nOkay, so this is an offer to share advice on starting companies within AI. Is that the offer here? Just so folks-\n\nGarrett Lord (01:03:50):\nYeah, that'd be great. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:50):\nOkay. I don't know how much time you'll have for the hundreds of thousands of people coming your way, but I appreciate the offer. That's very cool. Anything else before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nGarrett Lord (01:04:00):\nNo. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:02):\nWell, with that Garrett, we reached our very exciting lightning round. We've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nGarrett Lord (01:04:06):\nReady.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nGarrett Lord (01:04:11):\nI'm a sucker for Peter Thiel's Zero to One. I read it when I started the company, and watched Peter Thiel's startup school class at Stanford he taught back in the days where there wasn't everything written on the internet about how to start companies, and just think he was the coolest. Love Shoe Dog. I think it's the epitome of starting a company. Hard Things About Hard Things obviously, but these are all quite common books.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:38):\nBut also classics. Ben Horowitz is coming on the podcast, talk about Hard Things About Hard Things. \n\nGarrett Lord (01:04:42):\nSuper cool. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:43):\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things. Yeah. Okay, have you seen a recent movie or TV show you really enjoy it? I imagine you don't have much time for this, but-\n\nGarrett Lord (01:04:49):\nI'm going to get blasted for this, but I did start Game of Thrones with my wife, and I cannot-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:55):\nFor the first time. \n\nGarrett Lord (01:04:56):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):\nOkay, cool. \n\nGarrett Lord (01:04:57):\nSo, I got a lot of catching up to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:59):\nWhy would you get ... No, this is great. It's like people that have watched it-\n\nGarrett Lord (01:04:59):\nI've loved it so far. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:02):\nYou've loved it so far? Okay. It's quite gruesome, that's the only downside of that show. Don't watch it before you go to bed, I don't know how many gruesome scenes you've seen already. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? \n\nGarrett Lord (01:05:14):\nThe SNOO. The baby automated SNOO has really helped us a lot. So love the, shout-out SNOO team. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:24):\nAmazing. I had a SNOO as well. We never actually turned it on, we just ended up using it as a basinet the whole time. \n\nGarrett Lord (01:05:28):\nYeah, most of the time it's not turned on, but a couple of cries it's been turned on, it's been very helpful. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):\nDo you have favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to, sharing with other people?\n\nGarrett Lord (01:05:37):\nI love that leave nothing to chance, leave it all out on the field. Grew up in a really hardworking family, and dad worked really hard to provide, make it happen for us and it's like just give it your all. Leave nothing a chance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):\nOkay. So the last question, I was researching you in prep for this podcast and there's a story that I love about your hustle early on is when you were going from campus to campus pitching schools to join Handshake, and there's a story where you had to shower in the Princeton's pool to save money because you just didn't have a place to stay. Is there something there? Is there a story there you could share?\n\nGarrett Lord (01:06:13):\nYeah, so it was a tough one. I mean, I almost got arrested at Princeton, because I mean, I guess for entrepreneurs that are traveling around all the time, we were sleeping out of our car. We had this Ford focus, we would put 20, 30,000 miles on it, sleep in the back of like McDonald's parking lots because they're well lit and had good wifi back in the day. And instead of staying in a hotel, a way to freshen up ahead of your meeting is every university has a pool and the pool's almost always, it is always open. We never had a situation where it's always open for people to swim in the morning, like fitness. Faculty, students. And every pool, what do they have? They have a shower. \n\n(01:06:49):\nSo, you could go to any pool at any university in the country, and you can get a free shower and freshen up. So, the Princeton campus security did not appreciate me showering as a non-student, but I think it meaningfully helped us because the Princeton campus security called the career service center director we were selling to, being like, \"Who's Garrett Lord? Is he really here to pitch you software for your career center?\" And it made the start of the meeting with the career center really stimulating and exciting, because they were like, \"You showered in our pool, you drove here?\" \"Yeah, we drove here from Michigan.\" And so, I think that showed a level of commitment that was exciting for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:29):\nFast-forward to all these founders now starting to use this growth lever of getting in trouble with the campus police to get better meetings with the school leaders. Incredible. Garrett, this is such an insane, amazing, inspiring story, just like what you're building and the opportunity here, and just how it's fast, it's going, and all the advantages you have. If I was an investor in Handshake, I'd be like, \"All right, 10 years, it's going great.\" And now it's like, \"Whoa, holy shit. Where did this come from?\" Incredible. And it's just also really meaningful. So, I'm really happy that you made time for this in spite of the madness you are in right now. Two final questions, where can folks find you if they want to maybe reach out or maybe if you're hiring, let us know. And then, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nGarrett Lord (01:08:12):\nI mean, sign up for Handshake. If you want to message me on there, it's the easiest way to reach me. Just find me at garrettlord@Handshake, and you find me on Twitter. Love X, huge X guy. You can email me at garrett@joinhandshake.com and double R, double T. And how can you be helpful? We are trying to hire so many people. We have offices in New York and in San Francisco, and London and Berlin. If you have friends that are maybe passionate about this, you let them know, or you're interested in the learning more, please reach out. We'd love to talk to you. Hiring is like the number one problem we have right now to meet the demand. So, if you're talented and interested in learning more about Handshake, if you want to work on our consumer product, if you want to work on our employer products, cool PLG issues or the state-of-the-art consumer social experience, like reach out, or you want to work on the AI business we'd love to talk to you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:06):\nTo make it even more clear for folks, what roles are you most hiring for? Is it every role? Is it engineering? \n\nGarrett Lord (01:09:11):\nEngineers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):\nEngineering, all right. If you're an engineer and want to join one of the fastest growing AI companies in the world right now, here we go. We'll link to your careers page in the show notes. \n\nGarrett Lord (01:09:18):\nThank you. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):\nYeah, of course. Garrett, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible.\n\nGarrett Lord (01:09:22):\nOf course. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:24):\nBye everyone. \n\n(01:09:26):\nThank you so much for listening.

Even like five, seven years ago, it's so hard to start a company. Everything feels like it's done, someone else is working on it. Suddenly, it's a time, right now, which I've never even experienced, where everything you try just works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):\nWith people constantly hearing about all the things happening. Is there any tools or processes or approaches you've figured out to help stay focused?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:00:21):\nOur engineering goal is every engineer should ship a marketable product every week.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):\nI love just how wild that sounds. How do you maintain quality and make it all cohesive?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:00:31):\nI actually think as a startup your job is to take on technical debt because that is how you operate faster than a bigger company. Bigger companies don't take contact technical debt, they pay it usually right away, or they're paying back technical debt from the days when they were a startup.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):\nIs there anything else that in how you operate and the way you build product that you think is really unique and interesting?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:00:50):\nWe have what we think of as the public roadmap. This is basically what people have asked us for. There's all these surface areas where we receive user feedback, but these are all features that every competitor knows about. If a user is asking us for it, they're asking everybody for it.\n\n(00:01:04):\nIt's not going to be a game changer in terms of winning against your competition. So we have a second roadmap which we think of as a secret roadmap.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):\nToday my guest is Gaurav Misra. Gaurav was an early employee at Snap where he led the design engineering team, which he explains in the conversation. He's also an engineer at Microsoft and a couple other companies. Most recently, he's the co-founder and CEO of Captions, one of the most successful and cutting-edge consumer AI products, which lets you generate and edit talking videos with AI. They have over 10 million users and have raised over a hundred million dollars.\n\n(00:01:39):\nIn our conversation, we essentially do an archeology of how a modern AI oriented startup operates, including how every single engineer at their company ships a marketable product or feature every single week. Why they have a secret roadmap, in addition to a regular roadmap. We also get in-depth about how Snap as a product team operated. What he's learned about what it takes to build a successful consumer and social app, why they had no PMs and how designers ran the show, which may or may not have been a great idea. And also what happens in a world where AI video is so good that you have no idea if it's real or not. This episode is for anyone that is building a product on top of AI.

The integration infrastructure for B2B SaaS companies is AI on your 2025 product roadmap. Whether you need to enable RAG with your user's external data like Google Drive files, Gong transcripts, or Jira tickets, or build AI agents that can automate work across your user's other tools, integrations are the foundation. But building all these integrations in-house will cost you years of engineering, time you don't have given the fast pace of AI. That's where Paragon's all-in-one integration platform comes in. Build scalable workflows to ingest all of your user's external data into your RAG pipelines. And leverage, ActionKit, their latest product to instantly give your AI agents access to over 100 integrations and thousands of third-party actions with a single API call.\n\n(00:04:24):\nLeading AI companies like AI21, you.com, 11X, and Copy.ai are already shipping new integrations seven times faster with Paragon keeping their engineers focused on core product development. Ready to accelerate your AI roadmap this year, visit useparagon.com/lenny to get a free MVP of your next product integration.\n\n(00:04:50):\nGaurav, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:04:53):\nThank you. Thanks for having me. Excited.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):\nI very rarely have early stage founders on the podcast, but I wanted to chat with you because you're at the center of so much of what is top of mind for a lot of builders these days, AI and video, and just consumer and social apps.\n\n(00:05:11):\nAlso going viral and finding new marketing channels. So I think there's a lot that people can learn from the way you approach product, the way you've built product and the way you just think about where things are going. So again, thank you for being here.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:05:26):\nAppreciate it. Honestly, it's an exciting time. I got to say like there's rarely a time like this where so much is possible. In normal times, if you think about even five, seven years ago, it's so hard to start a company. It's so hard to come up with an idea. It's just like everything feels like it's done, someone else is working on it. Or it's like, oh it's been tried three times and failed three times. And suddenly, it's a time, right now, which I've never even experienced honestly in my career, where everything you try just works.\n\n(00:05:56):\nThere's so many possibilities. There's not enough people in the world to work on them. Honestly. There's more things that can be done than there's people available to do them. It is just such a rare thing. And honestly, it's not going to last forever. We are going to catch up to this, but just feels lucky to be part of that movement. It's awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:17):\nWhen you said everything is working, I think what's an important distinction there is the building of the tool works. The tech is now there to build all these things that have not been possible before. The thing that is increasingly, difficult, and I want to get your take on this, is getting anyone to pay attention and stick with your thing because it's so easy to build stuff and everything is just awesome and interesting. It's harder to get people to pay attention and stick with your product.\n\n(00:06:42):\nSo I guess is there anything there, you've learned that you've built a number of successful products. We'll talk about Snap and what you're doing now, about just, I don't know, what you need to think about these days to get anyone to pay attention and then stick around.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:06:54):\nYeah, I mean honestly it's a great point and I think there is a lot of hype obviously, and part of it, that's what's driving a lot of this growth for a lot of companies. And I think from a user acquisition/marketing perspective, in a world five or seven years ago, if you were making something novel and you went to users and it was like, \"Oh, we got something better.\" People are going to be like, \"Well, whatever. Everybody says they got something better. I don't care.\" But today, and this is not probably the way you should do it, but you can go and just say, \"We've rethought this thing with AI.\" And a bunch of people will just be like, \"Well, how?\" Or \"Maybe I should check this out.\"\n\n(00:07:33):\nThey'll just try it. Obviously, you have to deliver on the promises. If you don't deliver, people will come in, they'll play around a bunch and then just leave. But if you can truly deliver on the promises, there's great opportunities to require users at scale. So I think that's slightly different. And I don't know how long that lasts, but it is definitely a different time from that perspective. I do think also at the core of building products is solving problems. I think a lot of people sort of get caught up in this, well, it's cool and people will come for the cool right now. People will come in and be like, \"Well, let me check it out. It's cool.\"\n\n(00:08:11):\nBut at the end of the day, if you're just building a playground and people play around in the playground and then they leave after playing around, it's not a business. So I think that is still key. You have to be solving real problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:25):\nAs we were talking, I'm thinking about every day there's something that would maybe a few years ago be news for a year. Holy shit, this is now possible. Now it's like every day something like that happens and then we're like, all right, so what I think about is like, we'll have AGI one of these days or super intelligence and everyone's going to be, \"Oh, amazing.\" And then, \"Okay, what's for dinner?\"\n\nGaurav Misra (00:08:46):\nIsn't that already happening? Think about, in a way, I self-reflect on this sometimes if like, you've seen Iron Man and stuff, they have the J.A.R.V.I.S thing and you've seen Interstellar and they have the TARS machine. They're talking back and forth with these things like bouncing ideas. That is science fiction. That's literally science fiction. Okay, it's not perfect, but it exists in a way that nobody could have imagined. That's science fiction has become reality and I feel like nobody cares.\n\n(00:09:18):\nIn a way, you would've expected the world to be turned upside down, but it feels like almost in a way so slow and people are like, yes, adoption is happening, but I feel like it's almost a shocking development in a way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:31):\nIt feels like you guys have done a good job staying top of mind and continuing to get people excited because to your point, there's so much happening. How do you get people to continue to be like, \"Oh, okay, wow, what their building is actually is interesting and continues to be interesting.\"\n\n(00:09:45):\nAnything you've learned about just what it takes to stay top of mind and continue to pull people back and get people re-excited over and over?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:09:51):\nHundred percent. I mean, I think honestly it just comes down to not just AI for the sake of AI or AI for the sake of excitement or hype or novelty or whatever that is, it's actually effective AI like AI that solves real problems, practical problems. And the fundamentals haven't changed. In a way, there's three steps to building products. You identify a user problem, you apply some technology to solve that problem, but then finally you have some mechanism to find people who have that problem. If you can do all three of those things, then in any environment you can create great products. But I think right now what's different is so much is changing on the technology side that you can create products that could not have been created before and solve problems that could not have been solved before. And that's creating the opportunity.\n\n(00:10:45):\nAnd for us, especially in the video space, it's truly endless. We've just begun, our goal specifically for video is not to build professional tools. We're not building for professionals at all. We're building for the person who could not have created video before. They didn't have the tools, the skills, the means to be able to create video and now they can because they're able to jump over that skill gap or that time gap. Maybe they're business owners, they don't have time, they want results, and honestly a lot to solve there just tons.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:20):\nSolve people's problems. Easier said than done, but it's a good reminder. In the end that's all that matters. Something that I always think about with people in your shoes is just how do you not get overwhelmed and how do you know what to pay attention to? How do you stay focused?\n\n(00:11:36):\nAny tips there for folks that are just reading every day, a new announcement, and then just like I just, how do I? What do I do? There's too much.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:11:44):\nIt is the new problem of product development in a way. There's too many possible paths you can go down. There's too many ideas, there's too many things you could do. And I mean obviously, prioritization is always an important skill set and has always been, but it's become an even more important skill set right now because you have to figure out what not to pay attention to. Our general framework for it is to look for user demand, and actually the easiest way to check for user demand is to just see what has virality.\n\n(00:12:10):\nUsually, what has virality and what people want to share and talk about, there's something at the core of it that actually is interesting. Now, it may not always be interesting in a way that's like maybe it's a one-time use case. Maybe it's not something that people would do repeatedly. Maybe it's not something you could build like a subscription business off of, but oftentimes there's some things, some core element of it that has resonated with people. And if you can identify that core and then mold it into fitting into your business, it's actually a great way to identify what actually works. And we have these tools right now. We don't have to build anything. You can just kind talk about it and people will share it, share the idea.\n\n(00:12:49):\nAnd you can measure how well the product might be received even before you built anything. So it's a great tool we use for prioritization. We spend a lot of time on social media. Obviously, our app is often used for social media, so a lot of our employees will spend a lot of time on social media. We look at what the trends are, what's happening, and based on that we can get a pretty good read of what might resonate well with people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:15):\nSo as a leader of a company with people constantly hearing about all the things happening, is there any tools or processes or approaches you've figured out to help people continue, stay focused, not get excited about every shiny new object and actually ship things? I\n\nGaurav Misra (00:13:30):\nI mean honestly, it's all about incrementality in a way. I think we do aim to ship every week. Our engineering goal is every engineer should ship a marketable product every week. And so what's a marketable product is a product that you can show to users and the user might subscribe or pay for the app just for that or come to the app essentially just for that. And that's why table stakes features, let's say we're talking about word processor or something. If you had auto format or just table stakes stuff like justify alignment or something, no one's going to come to your word processor for justify alignment. You can market that because it's obvious, of course it exists, but if you did something unique that nobody else has done, you can go and show that to people and people will come to your app just for that.\n\n(00:14:22):\nAnd even if your app doesn't have a lot of the obvious stuff, maybe it doesn't have justify alignment, people will jump over that just to use these new tools and new abilities that you might be building and marketing. So we try to do every engineer one marketable feature per week, and a lot of that stuff may not work, but a lot of it does work and we can figure out obviously, where to put in more effort, things that start to work, we double down on those things, build more. People often complain because think about it, in one week where we're shipping, it's not complete, it's MVP, truly.\n\n(00:14:57):\nAnd we slice the hell out of it. We take the design and we cut, cut, cut until we can really say that it's going to be useless if we cut anymore. We get that out and people come in. And if things are going well, people will use it despite all the problems that it might have, and now people will complain and we'll have a list of problems and we know what to do next. That's a starting point essentially. As long as we're shipping one a week, we get a ton of volume of features and products and directions we're releasing, cut a lot of that. What remains expand from there. So it works really well, and it keeps people focused.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:37):\nI love the simplicity of that. I love just how wild that sounds for a lot of companies I imagine. Every engineer ships a marketable feature or product every week.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:15:46):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:48):\nThere's some people listening to this and are just completely stressed out by this idea and there's some people listening who are like, this is exactly how I want to work. This is how every company should build.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:15:56):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:58):\nHow do you maintain quality and make it all cohesive? I imagine that's the big trade-off. Just, any tricks there for folks that want to maybe start operating this way.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:16:06):\nQuality is not something you compromise on most of the time. I think yes, there's strategic compromises in quality, but most of the time what you want to do is have a bar for quality where people should come in and if they're using the feature, it should work, right? Of course. And the way to cut down on time, and I think this is a mistake people make a lot of the time, is when time is being pressured downward, a lot of times engineers, PMS, designers, they will cut on quality rather than cutting on scope. And actually you can cut on scope. It's actually, the method that we use is we look at every element that's going to take any time to build and we just say, what if we remove this? Is the product still useful?\n\n(00:16:48):\nAnd we keep repeating that until we remove whatever's left and we say it's going to be useless at this point. And that becomes the one-week project, right? It actually really works. It narrows down to the core of what you're really trying to ask. So for example, let's say we wanted to build something to add an image on your video or something like that, and this is a really basic idea. I just made it up right now. And you might imagine a design in which you import your image from your camera roll, but before it lands in your video you might want to remove the background. You might want to change the hue and saturation or something like that. And you might expect a designer to design all of those features and you let it design, but you really quickly realize that you can cut all of that stuff.\n\n(00:17:38):\nYou can cut the background or you can cut the hue saturation. All you really need is pick. And then there might be a picker. We need a picker with a library, with a lot of different type. What if you want to pull from the cloud? What if you want to pull from the drive or something like that? Cut all of that, right? And essentially come down to the core, which is just native picker from the camera, lens, straight in the video, no UI. And that is already, that should be useful. If that's not useful, then anything else built on top of that is also useless. So that's how we might go about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:12):\nThat last sentence is so key to this. It's the core idea of ship small iterative features before you invest a lot in something to figure out is there anything there, is this worth spending weeks on?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:18:24):\nTotally. And I think the coolest part of this method is the first thing that the users will come in, they'll use the thing, they'll import images and the first thing they'll complain about is what bothers them the most? Is it human saturation? Is it background removal? Is it picking from the cloud? You'll just get the most complaints about that thing.\n\n(00:18:43):\nPeople will be like, and people will be honest about it or they'll be like, \"This sucks. It doesn't even have background removal. What kind of image thing is this?\" And you have to take that feedback and just next week you can ship in a single week all the things that the user's complaining about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):\nAnd then they're like, wow, this team is shipping like crazy.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:18:59):\nYes. Exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:01):\nSolve all my problems. So responsive. This connects a common sign of product market fit, which is when people are complaining about the thing that means they actually care enough to complain and that's a really good sign if they're complaining about something.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:19:13):\nIt's very true, very true. If nobody complains, it's almost red flag.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:18):\nA lot of this is turning into an archeology of a modern product team and startup. So I want to keep digging. This is not where I was planning to go, but this is awesome. I love that this approach of every engineer shipping something every week that's marketable connects directly to where I started this conversation, which is how do you stay above the noise?\n\n(00:19:36):\nAnd part of the answer is just ship stuff constantly, and just continue to impress people. Like, \"Here's a new amazing video feature.\" \"Look at this thing.\"\n\nGaurav Misra (00:19:43):\nExactly. Yep. I think it's definitely key, right? And there's enough area and enough scope for that to happen. I think truly in normal times it may not be possible to create that much roadmap that quickly, but I think because there's so much innovation underlying all this, there is that scope available. The roadmap almost seems unlimited, just truly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:07):\nOkay. The other question I imagine people would be wondering is how do you work on longer-term projects that take many weeks? There's also infrastructure, I guess, back-end stuff. So maybe answer those questions.\n\n(00:20:17):\nHow do you think about long-term stuff and then how do you deal with back-end stuff that isn't a feature that anyone would care for?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:20:22):\nYep. Usually, we'll dedicate time to that separately. For example, usually Q4 for us is infrastructure quarter. We just go and build all the infrastructure. Q4 is generally, we've already delivered a ton of products and stuff. We're feeling pretty good about the rest of the year. Things are winding down. Obviously, holidays and stuff coming up. And so we spend all that time paying the technical debt.\n\n(00:20:48):\nI actually think there's a unique thing to think here about technical debt in general. And as a startup, your job is to take on technical debt because that is how you operate faster than a bigger company. Bigger companies don't take on technical debt, they pay it usually right away. Or they're paying back technical debt from the days when they were a startup, and they took on a lot of it. I mean Snaps, I used to work at Snap and there was a lot of examples of that over there, and I'm sure it happens at every other company.\n\n(00:21:19):\nAnd we think about it as like, well, is this a problem we need to solve today or is this a problem that the 50th engineer or the hundredth engineer or the 500th engineer can solve? And if it is a problem that a future engineer can solve, we should use that future engineer now. Essentially, that's what we're doing. And we're saying we're going to push this to somebody in the future. And by the way, if the company fails, that engineer will never be hired and all this won't matter anyways. So it's like financial debt in many ways. Financial debt is taken on to create leverage. It can be a good thing like if you're buying a house, you take on debt and you can buy something probably more than you can afford without taking on debt.\n\n(00:22:04):\nAnd it's the same thing. You can create products that you wouldn't be able to build with a small team that you have by taking on strategic technical debt. It's very positive actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:13):\nWow, this is such a cool idea. And where my mind goes is that future engineer may be an AI agent engineer.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:22:19):\nExactly, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:21):\nJust solving problems, just on technical debt in you.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:22:24):\nExactly. Some engineer in the future Five-hundred engineer many years from now will get a promotion because they solve this big problem that those really bad early engineers created.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:36):\nSo obviously, there's a line to this. There's only so much debt you can take on before you become a big problem.\n\n(00:22:43):\nIs there any thoughts on just that balance of just how much is too much and how if it's enough for a net feature engineer or just-\n\nGaurav Misra (00:22:50):\nYeah, I mean I think generally the rule of thumb is every piece of debt that you take on you have to pay interest on. So if there is debt that you've taken on, there's 1% or 2% of your time that is going to be taken away every day in maintaining bugs and issues and restarts and crashes and things that are happening with that. Because you did it the fast way, something's going to go wrong with it. Every day. 1% of your time will be taken away. If you take on enough debt, you'll be paying 80 or 90% interest and you'll not have any time to do anything new. You'll just be paying interest. That's all.\n\n(00:23:23):\nAnd that's when you get into the mode of like, oh, we're just keeping the lights on. We don't have any engineers to do anything. We're just keeping the lights on. That's the failure case for a startup. So in a way, you have a technical debt runway. Once you run out, once you've taken on too much debt. And if you haven't delivered value in that time, enough value to hire the engineers to pay the interest or just pay off the debt, you'll get in trouble.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:46):\nI love that. That's such a nice heuristic of how to think about when to invest in something. I don't want to go down this too far, but just a thought I have is ... because sometimes there's big technical decisions you got to make that impact the way everything builds or is built in the future. I imagine those you spend more time on and take really seriously.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:24:02):\nDefinitely. Yeah, I mean I think as long as it's possible for wherever it's like a two-way door, you can do whatever you want. I mean this is a classic methodology. If it's A one-way door, it's worth thinking about and sort of doing correctly at least as much as the one-way door would matter to you in the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:22):\nHow much do your engineers use Cursor and tools like that to build? How much is AI helping your team move?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:24:28):\nA hundred percent, yeah. I mean everybody's using it. It's super helpful. I mean even I'm using it honestly. Yeah, it's a huge multiplier for the team, no doubt.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):\nAnd is a Cursor specifically. Is there anything else that you guys found useful?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:24:43):\nYeah, we are using Cursor. Yep. We've tried all the different tools. We were using Devin as well, which is another, you know? That's more advanced, I guess. It's solving bugs for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:52):\nYeah, Devin's basically, I think it's 500 bucks a month and it's like an AI engineer that you just chat within Slack.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:24:58):\nExactly, yeah. In a way, these are the types of things that us as a startup can do that bigger companies can't just, you know, they can't just pull in Devin. They have to get 30 lawyers in the room first before that happens.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:11):\nAnd they're all called Devin, these are like agents. Everyone's going to have hundreds of Devins working at their company.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:25:15):\nExactly. You can have multiple Devins. I actually heard you can have a manager of Devins who's managing Devins.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:21):\nI love that managers are all getting layered, like unlayered and then they're going to have AI managers. That's the ultimate bait and switch.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:25:30):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:32):\nOkay. Is there anything else that in how you operate and build the way you build product or set up the way you build product that you think is really unique and interesting that other people might be able to learn from?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:25:42):\nOur process is a bit interesting in that way. We have a design team, we have a PM team. We're very early on those teams right now. And obviously, we have engineering. And we have all the different surface areas. So iOS, Android, web. There's backend team, machine learning team, research team. So generally, when we're developing products, we may start off with a PM first approach where we're finding some sort of overall issue that we want to take on some new area or pillar we want to take on and then creating sort of product specs from there.\n\n(00:26:17):\nBut a lot of times we'll also start the opposite way. We'll first design something without even having any idea of what or why we're doing it, but we'll design a bunch of different things and then we'll sit down with the PMs and look at the designs and just go over one and the next and the next until we find interesting things and ideas that pop out of that.\n\n(00:26:36):\nAnd a lot of times that leads to us discovering things that we wouldn't have discovered if we were just too focused on the metrics and the numbers and things like that. So it's almost reversing the process a little bit and starting with design first, but it can often result in finding unique ideas basically. I also think that we have a unique setup in how we create our roadmap. So normally you have a single roadmap and we actually divide a roadmap into two different roadmaps. So we have what we think of as the public roadmap. This is basically what people have asked us for. So there's all these surface areas where we receive user feedback and we look at all that feedback and people will ask for features. They'll ask for, I want background removal, I want to undo and redo, I want to upload longer videos, whatever it is, a bunch of different features.\n\n(00:27:26):\nAnd we'll just make a list of that. And just like anything else, we'll prioritize it and we'll look at how many people it affects and what the possible markets are and just get it done basically one at a time.\n\n(00:27:37):\nBut these are all features that every competitor knows about. These are public. If a user's asking us for it, they're asking everybody for it. And every team has essentially more or less the same list and everybody's prioritizing it. And yeah, sure you can win a little by extra nicely prioritizing it or winning a little in prioritization or execution or something, but it's not going to be a game changer in terms of winning against your competition. So we have a second roadmap which we think of as a secret roadmap. So this is a roadmap that nobody asked for anything on this like literally, nobody has ever asked for it.\n\n(00:28:13):\nAnd if a user were shown something on it, they might be like, \"I don't need this. I don't know what this is.\" But given our unique vantage point, our unique understanding of the problem set, the user space and the technology, we've come up with some special ideas that we think will completely revolutionize how something is used where we can truly change the behavior of the user. I think that's what at is at the core of. It's like people are doing things one way if we're able to show them another way. And once they try it, they never go back. That's what a product is, that's success. And those are the types of ideas that we put on the secret roadmap. These are things we never talk about publicly, never tell anybody about, and we announce them and just give them to users and see the effects.\n\n(00:29:00):\nA lot of this we come up with through brainstorming. So we do actually do quarterly brainstorming, company-wide, everybody's included like everybody from. It's not just a product team thing, it's like engineering, recruiting, everybody's included in. And we all come up with marketing, obviously, everybody comes up with ideas, we vote on the ideas, rank the ideas, and then the product team takes over from there and thinks about like feasibility and technology and what the different things could be. So this is a way where we can take all that noise that people are getting, everybody's browsing social media, seeing all these different things that are blowing up, these models and advancements and we can get all that information together and provide a unique internal roadmap where how are we going to approach and create value out of all of these different advances that are happening.\n\n(00:29:49):\nSo that's our general methodology. And a lot of times the biggest wins will come from the secret roadmap. That's the game-changing stuff. It's not going to be the user requests usually that are going to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:02):\nI love just how calling it the secret roadmap makes it extra interesting. [inaudible 00:30:07]\n\nGaurav Misra (00:30:06):\nExactly, yeah. It's a secret.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:09):\nIt's a secret. I'm not even going to ask you what's on that secret roadmap. You can't tell me.\n\n(00:30:15):\nWhat's an example of feature that came out of that secret roadmap that's been a big deal for you guys?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:30:18):\nTons. I mean, I'll give you an example from a long time ago. One of the first AI features we added after the app initially took off was this feature called eye contact. So this was a feature where if you're recording something, oftentimes people who are new to recording a video might read from a script or a teleprompter or something like that and they might have that off-screen. So it looks like you're reading and it's not great from the perspective of the video itself or the viewer of the video. So we had this feature where it basically shifts your eyes to look at the camera.\n\n(00:30:52):\nAnd we were actually the first company to build this. We worked with Nvidia on this. It's actually really interesting because when we originally reached out to Nvidia about this. They were not sure why we needed this. And they actually gave it to us pretty openly and were excited about some sort of partnership of how can we get this technology into something that could be useful.\n\n(00:31:19):\nBut we saw this creator use case which was unique, and it was one of the ideas that came out of the brainstorm and we threw it on there, we launched it. It was a huge success. I mean, I'll be honest, the video, the ad that we made, a social media post that demonstrates this was so viral, it was made in basically every language around the world. It still till today gets millions of views. We find reposts and reposts of that thing that other people have created that get millions and millions and millions of views because people are like, \"Wow, this is a great idea.\"\n\n(00:31:59):\nAnd now it's been copied the hell out of, I think it's available basically on every app you can imagine. For good reason of course. But that's one of the ideas that came out of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:10):\nYou talked about how you come up with these secret roadmap ideas. I'm just intrigued by this. I'm going to spend a little more time here.\n\n(00:32:14):\nDoes your team ever work with an AI LLM to help brainstorm? I imagine that's where things will go, where you're actually jamming. The AI agent is brainstorming along with you.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:32:25):\nHonestly, I would like for it to go there. It hasn't gone there yet. We haven't done that exactly, because the problem is context. And I think just the context of understanding the user, the use case, it's so abstract. Even right now, I feel like I understand our users obviously, but I can't exactly verbalize why that is or how that is, a little bit abstract. And I spend a lot of time with RPMs and designers imparting anything that I understand and I've learned over the many years I've been working on this, how do I impart this to them? But then it's a challenge because I can't even verbalize it myself. And so it's an extra hard challenge to figure out how do I put this context? How do I make it available to an LLM when I can't even put it into words exactly. And honestly, this is probably my own feeling but, and I need to work on this, but there is something to it.\n\n(00:33:26):\nI do remember at Snap for example, I think one of the most unique things about Snap and the CEO Evan Spiegel was that he had an unmatched understanding of the user. I think years and years and years of the company's existence past, almost a decade. And nobody understood the user like he did. He would come up with ideas that everybody would disagree with and we would launch them and there would be hits, just hits after hits. And nobody would understand why. Everyone would line up and be like, \"Great.\" Round of applause for everyone, but no one knew why.\n\n(00:34:07):\nA great example of that is a lot of this was figured out in retrospect too. I think there was a point at which Snap declared that they're a camera company and a lot of people laugh at them and said, \"Camera. What are we making digital cameras or something?\" Or, \"Why is it a camera company?\"\n\n(00:34:22):\nBut I think at the core of it was this idea that Snapchat opens to the camera and that was actually the differentiator. That actually that small decision was holding the entire company against all competition because when the moment passes where your friend is doing something funny and you need to capture it, you're not going to open Instagram or anything else because it doesn't open to the camera. You're going to open Snapchat because you can capture it right away. And Instagram can never copy that because all their metrics are going to go down as soon as they do that. So that is a fundamental understanding. And I figured this out much later, actually, but it's such a powerful idea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:08):\nI'm glad you talked about Snap. That's where I definitely wanted to go. This is where I was going to start. So I'm glad we circled back to your experience at Snap. So the reason I am interested in this is if you think about social networks like Snap is basically the last social network to have launched and stuck around other than TikTok, which I don't think is a social network. I think it's just this content platform. I don't think you're really interacting with people really. And that was 2011 when it launched. So it's been like 15 years since the last social network launch that has worked.\n\n(00:35:40):\nAnd I think it's interesting also because there's rarely been a lot of insight into just how Snap operates. You were there really early. You're a big deal at Snap. You built a lot of really important features. So I wanted to spend a little time here, and it feels like a lot of things you learn from Snap you're bringing to your company now. So let me just ask, I think you may have answered this, but I'm curious if there's something else here just broadly maybe other than Ev's brain, what do you think was core to Snap being a successful consumer social product?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:36:12):\nThere were a couple of different things that went well. I do think for a company like Snapchat or Social Network, the core product market fit can be extremely strong. Essentially, the reason that people are downloading it, the way that it's spreading, the way that it's distributing, the way that it's inviting friends or sending Snaps or whatever it is, that product market fit can be so strong sometimes that it can be hard to actually build something because you actually can't tell if what you're building is what's responsible for growing the thing or if it's actually hurting it and it's growing despite what you're doing basically.\n\n(00:36:53):\nAnd I think because of that, it actually sometimes teaches people the wrong things. It teaches people that the contrarian thing that they were doing was right when it was actually just wrong and the company just grew despite it. And I think some of the things that Snap did well and it needed to do really was to continue innovating, right?\n\n(00:37:17):\nBecause for a company like Snap, it has a ton of competition. Social networks are monopolies by nature and there's a lot of reasons for Facebook or any other social network to stop the growth of Snapchat. And they tried, they tried really, really hard. And the way that Snap was avoiding that was by innovating. I think the core of it was the setup that they had, which was very unique. I've never seen anything like it. I've worked at a bunch of different companies, but obviously there's a CEO and the CEO was very product-led, his designer himself, but he surrounded himself with the design team. That was sort of the central team in the company. And the design team was like 10, 12 people. Basically, pretty small, even at 5, 6,000 employees it was that small still.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:02):\nOh wow. At 6 or 6,000 employees. The design team was, you said how many, five or six people?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:38:07):\n10, 12 people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:08):\n10, 12. And to add to that, there's no PMs really for a long time. That was before.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:38:12):\nFor a long time, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:14):\nBig difference.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:38:14):\nInitially, there were no PMs at all. PMs were introduced with monetization. Once monetization was a big sort of element, that's where PMs came in. Today, I think there's a ton of, or there's an adequate number of PMs across the company, but there was a long period of time, especially when the innovation was happening, when there were a much, much smaller number of PMs and it was very designer led. But at the same time, I think that's slightly misleading in the way that these weren't your sort of average designers.\n\n(00:38:43):\nThese were designers who were actually PMs as well. That's what the secret sauce was. They were able to not just design but also do the PM part which is a big responsibility. It's a lot of work, especially for that many employees, but it gave the CEO a way to have granular control over what exactly was being launched in which part of the app at all times.\n\n(00:39:05):\nBecause he could meet with a set of 10 or 12 people and know every change that was happening that was user impacting. A lot of changes were being worked on that were infrastructure and types of things that keep going on in the back end where you're improving ranking and whatever that might be, performance and things like that. And those were not usually his concern. He was concerned with what UI are we adding where? And if you needed to add UI to the app, you needed it designed. And if there's no designers in the company, except for a handful who talk directly to the CEO, you create a very granular control over what's being launched in the company. So everything needed to be approved by Evan. If you hadn't approved it, it's not going out. So the design team actually held a lot of power in that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:50):\nThis is awesome. So what I'm hearing partly is, I don't know if this is true, but it feels true that to make a consumer app that is successful and breaks through, you almost need a singular mind that continues to stay in the weeds on everything. And the way Evan did that is very close to the design team who basically ran product.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:40:10):\nThat's very true. Yeah, it's very true. And he was able to keep the context of the entire app in his head at the same time. He knew the interdependencies and what we're doing and why we're doing it. And so that gave him just very granular control over the company's product roadmap.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:26):\nIt makes me think about Brian Chesky and Airbnb is a consumer product, it's not a social network, but I wonder if that's just an interesting insight just for consumer products. They will generally do better if there's one person with a really ... the right sort of combination of experiences, insights, and just they continue to run and own every detail.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:40:46):\nDefinitely. And also the ability to bring about change, the ability to truly energize an entire organization to do something that's not just incremental but fundamental.\n\n(00:40:58):\n<< Founder mode >>\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:00):\nExactly.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:41:01):\nFounder mode. That's what we're getting to, basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:04):\nYeah, ever heard of it. Okay. And then you said that these designers, so I know it's famous that Snap had no PMs for a long time. Designers were PMs. This point you made about the designers where PME is really important. I think a lot of people look at this, they're like, \"Amazing. We're just going to hire just designers. We don't need all these PMs. Slow everything down. Just tell us what not to build.\" Can you just talk about the level of these designers? What allowed them to be as successful as they were without any PMs?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:41:32):\nYeah, I mean I think what was expected from the designers now was not just the ability to design, the skill set of designing, which all of them were IC designers by the way. And there were no reports, so they weren't allowed to have reports actually. And so they were designing everything themselves, but they also had to have the leadership skills to go figure out the roadmap, write all the documents, work with the different teams, figure out shipping schedules and just know everything, not just the technical and the engineering part, but the UX and the UI and the product needs and why are we doing this.\n\n(00:42:15):\nThe roadmap, there's just a ton to keep in mind. And that means that it was a job that was just highly ... it was very high workload. No doubt, very high workload. These people work really hard and they were paid highly too. For what it's worth, they were paid way higher than you would expect designers or PMs or engineers to be paid with quarterly bonuses and all kinds of things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:43):\nThat's interesting. And it reminds, people always say, \"Why do you need PMs?\" There's like someone has to do the work that a PM does. They're not sitting around doing nothing. And it's important to note the person that will take on the PME work, they have to be good at it and enjoy it. And a lot of designers don't want to be doing writing docs and organizing stakeholders and getting alignment and ...\n\nGaurav Misra (00:43:03):\n100%, 100%. That's why it was so hard to find those people who were able to do two things. I actually think there's an insight in there is innovation between when you're merging craft right between two different functions. And I do think there's something special about one person doing two different functions or at least being able to do. And I think a lot of unique insight and innovation can come from that.\n\n(00:43:31):\nI actually think on my personal side, I eventually joined the design team. I started at Snap on the engineering team. I eventually joined the design team over the last two years that I was at Snap. And a big part of what I did there was create this function called design engineering. And that was actually a different combination. It wasn't the designer PM. It was the designer engineer. The person who can think of the UX design it and also build it and launch it, all of those things.\n\n(00:44:03):\nAnd we saw both the ability to take designers and teach them engineering and take engineers and teach them design as part of that. Obviously, the reason that we created that function was very different. It was actually to continue innovating as the company got bigger. One of the problems that we identified was that as the company got bigger and bigger and there's like 500 engineers, 1,000 engineers, 2,000 engineers, 3,000, suddenly it just becomes very difficult to do everything.\n\n(00:44:32):\nEverything is a six-month project or a one-year project. Every product is a massive investment of 500 engineers and a lot of time. And so you really have to pick your bets. If you get it wrong, if you are innovating and trying to create new products and you spend 500 engineers for a year and it doesn't work, it's a big problem. You're going to be in trouble, especially if we're coming like Snap where everybody was copying what they're doing so they had to constantly innovate, create new stuff and push the bounds.\n\n(00:44:59):\nI think Evan's philosophy was always he didn't fight the things that were getting copied, right? Stories got copied pretty much straight up. A lot of things that Snap created got copied, but he was more of the mindset of like, \"Let's expand the pie, do something new and push the boundaries.\" We'll keep innovating basically. And so to do that with that scale of a company becomes really hard. And so we had this idea of let's create a small team where we can go and pretest a lot of these ideas because we had a lot of ideas and we can't go and build all of these things. So the idea was create a small team of these design engineers, people who are able to do the entire product design engineering process in their head and can put together early versions of the product, which we would actually bake into the Snapchat app itself.\n\n(00:45:46):\nAnd we were able to even test, for example, run a test in Australia, see how it's performing. Run a test in a couple of high schools, just a couple of high schools, see how people behave. And that way we already have data on how this might perform in a real world environment, but we haven't built it to production level. It's a prototype, essentially. It's how a startup might build something.\n\n(00:46:08):\nThe same idea of what we're doing at our company now, build fast, get it out there, get feedback, understand whether it works or not, and then work with the engineering team to build it at a scale. Once we understand the product and the dynamics, then it makes sense to put on 500 engineers for six months to build it.\n\n(00:46:25):\nSo that was a big part of it. I think the nice thing that came out of it that was completely unexpected but actually transformational for me in a way was obviously in big organizations, alignment is a big issue. How do you get everybody on the same page? And a big part of a PM's job is actually to create alignment and it can be a lot of work because you go talk to all these stakeholders and get them on the same page.\n\n(00:46:48):\nBut one of the insights that we had, which was unique was as the company gets bigger, you can actually create alignment by causing internal virality. If there's enough people in the company, it actually starts acting like a consumer base might. If you share something interesting with someone, they will share it with somebody else because they think it's interesting and you can actually create virality inside a company.\n\n(00:47:16):\nSo one thing that we would do is we would create these prototype products. We would just go into an area, redo a bunch of stuff, create these prototype products that didn't exist in Snapchat normally, and then we would just share the build and it would explode. It would just go viral inside the company. Day after day we would hear from engineers, then managers, then VPs, then eventually from Evan being like, \"Oh my God, everyone's talking about this. Why am I the last one to hear about it?\"\n\n(00:47:47):\nSo it would create instant alignment across the company of this is exciting, this is something that we want to get behind. And everyone would be asking, \"When are we doing this? When is this happening? I see someone's already working on it.\" So it was a great way to do that. And once we really understood that the product actually had good dynamics and we had tested it, it was a great way to get it out in front of everybody and create this idea of, \"Hey, we're all working on this. This is the future.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:17):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I put my community resources. It's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you.\n\n(00:48:35):\nImagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear. You know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs to documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy to organize tab.\n\n(00:49:04):\nLike I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day. And more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time. To try it for yourself, go to coda.io/lenny today and get six months free of the team plan for startups. That's coda.io/lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan. coda.io/lenny.\n\n(00:49:34):\nAnother thread I want to follow up on is prototyping. It feels like that is where a lot of PM work is going is getting straight to a prototype versus design or versus PRDs. And it feels like that's something that you did and worked super well. Basically, it's a team to prototype ideas that in theory now you can just build really quickly with AI. So I think that's really interesting, seeing where the feature's going, just ...\n\nGaurav Misra (00:50:00):\n100%. Getting things in people's hands, trying it out. Oftentimes, unless you truly try it out, in design, it can, in theory, look good with all the perfect conditions, but when you actually use it, you realize it's actually not that useful, for example. Or when you give it to users. And some of this is intuition, honestly, just like anything else, but there's nothing like getting something in the hands of users at the end of the day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:23):\nI love how many of these things you brought over to your current company, and I'm trying to think about, one is this idea of just constantly innovating feels like that's informed and tell me what I'm missing, but that feels like that's informed. The ship market will feature every single week. This idea of getting design, starting almost with design versus PM a lot of times. I'm curious why you don't even go straight to prototype in those cases. Is it just the tools aren't there yet or?\n\nGaurav Misra (00:50:47):\nI mean, I think our shipping process is fast enough that within a week we can get it out anyways. So that way we just get user feedback, which is even better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:55):\nAnd then the other really interesting thing, I'm trying to visualize that triangle of a product team, the triad of PM, engineer, design. Feels like you guys at Snap took the corners, not the corners, the line of that triangle. And you have design engineers. You have design PMs. I imagine engineers were PME already. They're very product oriented PMs. Did you have a function called design PMs? Probably not.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:51:20):\nI mean honestly, it's interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:21):\nSorry, engineer PMs.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:51:23):\nYeah, engineer PMs should be a thing, I feel like, or every engineer should strive to understand the product, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:29):\nYeah. A lot of companies operate that way. Like Stripe, I think they had hundreds of engineers before they hired the first PM because I think the engineers were doing what they did at Snap to do the PM work. So it feels like at your company you don't operate that way. It feels like you have PMs, engineers, designers. Talk about why you decided not to approach things that way.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:51:48):\nI do think PM is a very valuable function. I think it may be actually, and maybe I'll get roasted for this, but I think at the end of the day, not hiring PMs at Snap might've been one of those decisions where it actually succeeded despite that and because someone needs to do that work. If you don't have enough people to do it, then nobody truly owns it and then it doesn't really happen. Or if it doesn't happen, no one's responsible, which is not the right structure you want in an organization. So I think though, that being said, there was something unique to be said about what if a designer had the PM mindset.\n\n(00:52:29):\nIt's actually the same idea as what if an engineer had the PM mindset and then you get even crazier. What if the PM had a design and engineering mindset? I think all we're talking about is everybody truly understanding all the functions that they're working with. Having a fundamental, broad understanding of the functions they're working with.\n\n(00:52:48):\nAt Captions, we're actually going even one step further than that. Why shouldn't the PM understand marketing? I think that's actually the biggest opportunity for PMs to understand is how do we actually find the users who have this problem? I think that's a big part of solving the problem. I have a unique take on this in terms of I actually think PMs should own all the way to marketing in a way. And the reason is that if you think about marketing, it's expanding the surface area of the product, right? It's like search marketing is just placing a button to your product in Google.\n\n(00:53:28):\nFacebook ads is just placing a button to your app in Facebook. It's almost like you work at Facebook. You work at Facebook, you have a button in the app somewhere, you make a specific thing and people show up. The funnel begins there and you have all the metrics all the way from the beginning, all the way from when the user tapped on the button in Facebook and then they went down all the steps and then they landed on some onboarding screen and they did the thing, they used the application.\n\n(00:53:56):\nThat's where the journey begins. And all of that is, in a way, it's a product. It's the same skillset. Understanding users from that point on is I think that's fundamental. How do we not do that today? We should be. So that's how we think about stuff. But I think the core idea is that every function should understand every other function deeply as much as possible and maybe even to the level where they can operate in that function. And that just increases the likelihood that all decisions being made in the company at the micro level will be optimized for all possible parts of the funnel that different people are essentially looking after. That's something we think about quite a bit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:44):\nI completely agree with that take. It's interesting that at Airbnb, Brian was famous for changing the titles of all product managers to product marketing manager for exactly this point because he's like-\n\nGaurav Misra (00:54:56):\nMakes sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:57):\n... you should be doing the marketing, you shouldn't just be building the thing. And to me, I've always assumed as a PM, your job is for this thing to grow and to get adopted and be loved.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:55:07):\nOf course.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:07):\nSo it's interesting people don't already think of it that way.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:55:10):\nI agree.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:11):\nBut obviously, it's hard to learn the skills of being awesome and paid growth and SEO and product marketing, messaging, positioning, but I completely agree. That's such an important element of building a product. You're not just building a thing, hope it works. Goodbye. So I love that that's how you think about it. And so I guess when you hire PMs, it sounds like you look for marketing instinct and some experiences.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:55:31):\n100%. And at least the ability and instinct to be able to learn it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:38):\nYeah. Okay, so I'm going to share one other thing that I thought as you were talking that I think is really interesting and it comes up a bunch on this podcast and this connects back to Ev and what we can learn from his success. So Patrick Olson once tweeted this tweet that has really stuck with me, which is it was around user research and the way he described it is user research isn't go to user research that informs what you build and then you build that. It's instead you do user research, it informs the mental model you have as a leader, a product builder of what your customers need and what pains they have, and you adjust that model in your head and then that's how you decide what to build. And it feels like Ev is very much that. His head was learning what people need, teens in particular, and it just worked.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:56:28):\nYeah, I think it's very spot on. I would say though Snap didn't like user research as a function for the longest time. I think there was one user researcher in the company until, again, 5,000 employees, the post IPO basically. But I think the people that were making a lot of the product decisions and the CEO himself, of course, were very steeped in how the user behaves and how they operate. They understood that.\n\n(00:56:56):\nI do think Snap also had a unique way of thinking about how to determine if a product is within scope or out of scope of what their mission was. And I think a lot of companies use the cyber framework and we try to as well, but essentially, the idea at the core was that they want to enable private sharing in a safe way. So I think that makes it clear that certain things just are out of scope for Snap.\n\n(00:57:28):\nIt's actually one of the reasons why Snap wasn't the company to discover \"short form video,\" TikTok style stuff because it was just against the nature of the company to even try something. It was against the mission of the company. Public sharing means possibly bullying and bad behaviors, which is exactly what Snap was trying to avoid. We don't want those behaviors to develop on the app. So for example, on Instagram stories, you can share somebody else's stories to your followers. I can take your story and share it to my followers. You can't do that on Snap.\n\n(00:58:02):\nAnd there was a discussion about should we do this? No, because it can enable bullying. Essentially, you're not consenting to your thing being shared to my followers and that's essentially bad. So a lot of it was done based on this type of pillar-based thinking of this is our mission, this is what we're trying to do, does it fit within or is it outside? If it's outside, we don't do it no matter what the cost of it is, no matter how exciting it is.\n\n(00:58:30):\nAnd even on Spotlight, the big challenge was like how do you take something like that and put that inside the Snap mission? So that was something we worked on quite a bit. Yeah, I mean I think there's tons of stories about earlier versions. I mean Snap almost had essentially what is TikTok earlier than TikTok existed and it died out because it didn't align with the mission essentially, but happy to get into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:56):\nYeah, that actually would be really interesting, because interesting that these things are important. It's important to have these clear values in the mission of the company and to not focus on things that are outside that. And then you hear these stories of they had TikTok potentially. So yeah, whatever you can share there, that'd be awesome.\n\nGaurav Misra (00:59:12):\nYeah, I mean, I don't know if you remember this, but there was this product called Our Stories, and essentially it was MyStory, but it was a public story. And it started off with this idea of campus stories where you can post to your campus and other people can see it. And that actually started creating a lot of virality because essentially people would post. There was viral moments truly where people would post stuff like, \"Oh, I think two people fell in love on it or something like that.\" Those types of things really went viral and it had really good engagement.\n\n(00:59:47):\nBut at the end of the day, the problem was that we were against algorithmic essentially ranking of those types of things. So there was a curation team that was looking through every single one so that there's no negative behaviors happening essentially on the app. That was just not scalable. Even though it had really high engagement and was doing well, it just wasn't feasible to have a person looking at every single thing posted to determine whether it's appropriate or not.\n\n(01:00:15):\nIt ended up dying out, but it looked like what was an early version of TikTok before it had launched. So I think in a way though it was a good thing because I think Snap does have a mission and I think it is solving a problem. I do think there is a bifurcation of social media at this point. There is what you traditionally think of as social networking where you share things with your friends. And by the way, remember the days where that used to be the way that apps would go viral. You would share things with your friends and then they would share with their friends and everybody was worried about friend sharing and how do you send to a friend and can I text message my friend or whatever.\n\n(01:00:59):\nThat time is over. Virality now happens through a completely different mechanism. It happens through essentially algorithms that are deciding whether your piece of content is worth showing to an arbitrary number of people, and this is the new age of social media. It's TikTok, it's YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels and so on. And I think actually it's changing the fundamental nature of how people interact, fundamental nature of how things go viral. And I actually think from a regulatory perspective, we should be thinking these as differently.\n\n(01:01:37):\nOn one side, you have something where you're deciding who sees something and then on the other side, you have something where the company is deciding which means that it's semi curated, right? It's actually the company's voice. So yeah, I don't know, should Section 230 apply to that? I have no idea. Or maybe not. Maybe we're thinking about this the wrong way, so it should be interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:03):\nWow. All right. Well, I'm out of my depth on the legality decision, so I'm going to not follow that thread, but I imagine there's something really interesting there actually. So you've been talking about just how much things are changing and I just wanted to follow that thread and specifically, you guys are at the cutting edge of what is possible with AI video.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:02:25):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:25):\nIt feels like we're approaching and maybe we're there. This world where you have no idea if it's real or AI. I'm curious, first of all, just how far you think we are from that and second of all, the implications on the world where you can just generate any video you want.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:02:40):\nIt's fundamental. At the end of the day, a time where video images, audio can't be trusted actually hasn't existed for a while. If you think about ... I mean there was a world in the 1800s where there was no video or audio or images and everything was proven by he said, she said for the most part. And it's possible that if everything can be generated and anything can be created and it looks just as real as if it were real and there's no way to tell, then we might actually return to that world where there's no way to prove anything besides physical evidence or he said, she said.\n\n(01:03:20):\nAnd I think that's scary, but also possibly opens a bunch of new opportunity for someone to figure out how to solve this problem. I think it's going to be a big problem. I do think today, we are almost there in terms of creating absolutely photorealistic video. I mean the very recent models, a very cutting edge is just about ... It feels like a few centimeters away from achieving it, but I do think to fully get there to the point where it cannot be differentiated at all, it's still a couple of years away.\n\n(01:03:52):\nI also think that it is use case driven in a way. I think thinking about Captions for a second, we take a unique view on what type of video we want to focus on. Video generation and text to video generation. If you look at it today, it's all silent video. There's no audio and it's often what you think of as stop video or B-roll, right? You can actually make a movie with B-roll. And a lot of a movie or a TV show or a social media post or an ad actually is dialogue or monologue. That's actually what it is is people talking to each other, to the camera, interacting. That's actually what makes true story.\n\n(01:04:35):\nB-roll is supportive elements that are showing up to set the scene or something like maybe before the scene opens, you see a few shots of New York City or LA or something, and then you jump into the room and now two people are talking. So our goal is to solve the talking video problem. How do we create video where people are delivering dialogue or monologue or things like that? And that's what we focus on purely. And there actually isn't a lot of work happening in that area today and it's not a solved problem. We're getting there, we're getting closer and closer, but today's models actually bifurcate a little bit.\n\n(01:05:15):\nSo there's a set of companies today that are able to create these types of what we're talking about is avatar videos. They're using this technology called neural rendering. It's actually not a technology that's affected by the transformer and diffusion model revolution or the large model revolution, essentially. This is a technology that existed separately and it doesn't have anything to do with the AI growth happening right now. It just happens to produce semi-realistic outputs, but it actually stops at some point because it's not clear how it becomes generalizable in every situation.\n\n(01:05:55):\nIt has to be trained on people individually. So you might ingest a little bit of video of you and then you can generate you. And so it's a different technology and a different outcome, essentially. And a bunch of companies using this type of model, a bunch of companies are doing general text to video with no audio today. These are large generative models and they have the capability to do more, but that frontier just hasn't been reached yet. I think there's no doubt in anybody's mind on the research side that it is 100% solvable. It's just like somebody has to go do it and we haven't gotten there yet. Nobody has had the time to go and do that yet. So that's where we're at, essentially.\n\n(01:06:35):\nWe're working purely on large generative models for talking videos. So that's our core focus. I do think though, from a safety perspective, we have a unique framework or how we think about it. So generally videos divide into two categories. So for us, we think on one side of what is documentation, so this is the type of video that it could be a personal video where you're taking a video with your friends and you're hanging out, you're at a restaurant. It's documenting what happened. You had fun, whatever it was, it's for your memories. And there's a non-personal version of this which is like, oh, it's like a reporter documenting a crime or something that happened or whatever it is and who was involved, where was it? Maybe it was a natural disaster or something, and this is for history. We want to see what happened.\n\n(01:07:27):\nAnd there's actually no benefit to AI-generated video in any of this. Actually, all of this, it's just negative. It's all negative. If we are generating fake versions of reality to fool people, there's just nothing good about that. And we want to stay away from that, essentially. We want to design products and build products that make it difficult to use for that particular use case, for anything that falls within that. And on the other side, you have what we think of as storytelling.\n\n(01:07:56):\nNow this could be ads, it could be social media posts, it could be TV, movies. All of these things are storytelling. They're designed for entertainment, they're designed for fun. And nobody believes if you watch a Geico commercial, you're not thinking that the gecko is real selling insurance somewhere out there. You know that this is fabricated and it's for entertainment. And same with reality TV even, right? It's called reality TV. It's definitely not reality and social media, ads, all this stuff falls in the category.\n\n(01:08:28):\nAnd if we can enable more people to tell stories and entertain other people and get their message out there, that is pure positive. This is where we want to focus. And a lot of our effort in the product and design process goes into how do we design products and build products that specifically make it really hard to use on one side and really easy to use on the other side. And that's the real challenge.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:53):\nThat's really helpful. Something that I'm really curious about as you're chatting is ByteDance just released a really amazing model. I was actually just looking at it where you put a photo in, I think, and it just creates a video of this person talking in all these different ways. Where does that fall amongst the buckets you just described?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:09:09):\nI think that falls exactly in the area that we're in, which is talking people and that's what they're going after as well there. So that's actually one of the first examples of a large model that a larger company has released where it's able to do these dialogue or monologue videos. And I mean you yourself, you've seen it, so I'm not going to describe it too much, but as you know, it's highly expressive. It doesn't look like an avatar video. It looks like ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:37):\nYeah, it's wild.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:09:38):\nAnd that's because of the technology that's used is fundamentally different. It's just like this is using a true large diffusion model is what they use. Whereas most companies that are working on avatar technology are actually using something pretty basic in comparison.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:53):\nHow long has it been since that Will Smith spaghetti video? Just to give us a reference of how fast things are moving?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:09:58):\nOh my god, it's been so fast, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):\nI think it's a year.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:09:59):\nAmazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):\nOr is it like two years?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:10:03):\nI think it's probably about a year and a half, two years. Right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:04):\nWow. We'll link to that video and then you could tell basically that video is the state of the art of AI video one to two years ago. And then we'll link to this other Omni something. I forget what it's called. I'm just showing what it's like today.\n\n(01:10:18):\nGeez, Louise. Okay, final question and this is around something that I know you have a really interesting insight on, which is that you see marketing using AI video basically as the final frontier of how people will experience AI is marketing, is seeing it in marketing channels. Talk about why you think that's the case and just what that looks like.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:10:42):\nIt comes back to what we were talking about before where the reality is that no matter how interesting, advanced and amazing a technology is, science fiction has become reality. We were talking about this. What was literally science fiction on TV is real now and most people still don't even know about it, to be honest.\n\n(01:11:01):\nMy parents live in India and they are the only ones in the neighborhood that know about ChatGPT and they write these amazing notes to the community just with all these words. And people are just like, \"How did you get so good at writing?\" And they're not telling anybody, but there's still a ton of people who don't even know that these advancements have happened. And so adaption is actually much slower, even for the most exciting things. Of course, in tech circles, everybody's talking about it, but the reality is it takes a while to get out there.\n\n(01:11:33):\nAnd I think for companies that are going to succeed, they're going to have to figure out how to market these products so that they can be the ones to reach all these people that have the problems that they're now able to solve. And we think about that every day. So on that note, as a consumer product, we spend a bunch of time and money on marketing our products, and we often use performance channels and all kinds of things, but about a year ago, we would run AI video in ads and things like that, and we would get all these comments of people being like, \"Oh my God, this is so fake. Don't show me this.\"\n\n(01:12:08):\nAnd around that time, the technology got just about good enough that suddenly, those comments stopped happening and suddenly, you could get performance that was even better than actually recording with a person because you could just try more things. You could just generate 30, 40 possibilities and one of them would win and it would win more than the one creative you can get from a person. And more interestingly, when you think about localization, you're going to go do that in every language. Once you discover winning creative, now you have to go localize that in every market and rebuild it from scratch.\n\n(01:12:51):\nIt's just a ton. And oftentimes it doesn't perform as well because it's been rethought essentially. But we found that just translating it with AI was able to get performance almost as good as the original, in the original language. So this is going to fly to the entire market. I think wherever there's dollars to be made, saved, it is inevitable. It will be consumed and it will very quickly be a lot of social media.\n\n(01:13:21):\nI mean, you could imagine a social network of the future where, and this is dystopian by the way, so watch out. You could imagine a social network of the future where all content is generated. None of the people are real. I mean, the algorithm isn't tailoring whose content to show you, but it's purely generating content that is completely catered to you, with people and everything completely catered to you. I don't think it's out of the question. It almost seems inevitable in a way, but that's not too far away, I think. That's actually very possibly real in five years or something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:00):\nWhat I'm imagining, because it's hard to imagine a social network where it's people because usually we want to know who these people are. I don't care random sharing status updates, but I can see a TikTok that is all AI.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:14:11):\nExactly, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:13):\nWow, just content tuned to your loves and interests.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:14:17):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:17):\nAnd just random videos. Wow.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:14:21):\nYep. Because do you know, you see a TikTok feed, you don't even know who's real or not today, right? It's not like we-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:27):\nRight. That's how I would approach it. I would just join TikTok and start uploading videos that are AI generated.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:14:32):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:33):\nAnd then build a whole network of that. Oh my god, the future is wild.\n\n(01:14:37):\nLet's go to failure corner. Something that I try to do with this podcast is share moments where things didn't go well. There's all these stories of everything's going great all the time. All this foundries killing it, building a billion-dollar company. Oh, so awesome. But they don't know all the things that go wrong. So let me ask you, is there a story you can share of when things didn't work out? When you failed?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:14:59):\nAt the beginning of the company, we actually had a bunch of time where we spent figuring out what we wanted to do, and I think it's an unconventional story almost in a way because we started off the company, the first thing we did was build the Captions app. We launched the app. That was the first thing we did. Took two days to build it. We put it out there and it immediately took off. It was absolutely shocking because I built it on a weekend. We put it out there, I called my co-founder on Monday. I'm like, \"It's at the top of the app store. We're getting like 600 videos a day.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:31):\nTop of the app store, holy shit.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:15:33):\nAnd we didn't do anything to enable that. It just happened on its own. It was almost anti-climactic in a way because we thought it would be a lot more time spent figuring out the product before that would happen. And so it felt like, \"Wait, this can't be it, right? It can't be this fast. How did this happen?\" So we got distracted because of that, because we were like, \"Oh, okay. Well, maybe ... This is cool. It'll work. That's great, but we got to figure out what the product is.\"\n\n(01:16:07):\nAnd so we spent at least a year, year and a half thinking about building social networks and all kinds of things when we should have been working on Captions because there was product market fit there. And how we figured that out is Captions was sitting on my personal account, so I wasn't checking that a lot. About a year and a half into the company, as we were working on other projects and stuff, I went back to my personal account, just opened it, and I saw that there was $500,000 in there.\n\n(01:16:38):\nI looked at a chart and it was just growing. The revenue was just growing completely on its own. No employees, no releases, no bug fixes, no customer support. There was like 2,000 open support tickets that were unanswered for a year and a half, and great reviews. It's just going completely on its own. And so that was a clear sign to me. It was like, \"Oh my God, you should have been working on that. That product works.\"\n\n(01:17:05):\nAnd so we immediately had a meeting. I mean, it was tough to figure out what the right path was at that point because we'd invested so much time in other things as well, but reset, and we got back on the track with Captions, and literally as soon as we started releasing the first features into it, it blew up. What looked like a vertical line at that time became a horizontal line, and the new vertical line was so vertical that the old vertical line became a horizontal line, essentially. And it's continued since then, which is crazy. So we basically wasted about a year and a half.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:42):\nI love that new way of thinking about a hockey stick moment where not only is it going vertical, but the rest of the chart is now just flat along the bottom of the axis.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:17:49):\nExactly. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:51):\nFor people that may not know what Captions is, I try to describe it at the beginning and we'll link to it and stuff, but basically, the reason you thought it was nothing is it just adds captions to a video that you record.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:18:01):\nIt does.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:01):\nAdded captions.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:18:02):\nExactly, yep. So I think we wanted ... Our thought was we're going to build a social network, but first we got to build a creation tool for the social network. And we knew that we wanted to use AI to create video, and it seemed obvious that, \"Oh, speech to text, a solved problem, we should start with that.\" So that's why we decided to start with Captions because it was a solved problem at the time. What was funny is that once GPT and stuff started coming out, a lot of the things that were unsolved became solved very quickly. So timing was almost perfect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:37):\nAnd that aligns to something you shared earlier. Just so many of these problems that were not yet solved are now possible, and the companies that are in the right place at the right time benefit greatly who've been just waiting for this part.\n\n(01:18:50):\nThe other thing that I think is interesting about that story is you try to build a social network. I think it was around high schools and things like that. As we've seen, it's very difficult to build a new social network. So let me just get your sense. Do you think it's possible for somebody to come around and build a new, the next Facebook, the next Snap, the next whatever?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:19:09):\nI think it's definitely possible. I do think ... Let me tell you something crazy, actually. The social network that we had at the time, we actually remove it from the app store, so it's not available anymore. But til today, there are people, there are thousands of people that are using it, posting on it, and all the different things, which actually speaks to the power of the social network in a way. It is hard to create and hard to kill. I mean, I think X is actually a great example of that too. A lot of movement happened there and it continues to work, I guess somehow. So testament to that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:49):\nThe power of network effects, especially someone once described this so well, they're like Twitter/X. They changed the brand, they changed the team building it. They changed the URL. Like everything changed about it except the network effect of the people in it.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:20:07):\nIt's true. It's true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:09):\nI just saw a story that they're making billions of dollars. He's actually turned it around. It's actually becoming a really profitable company.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:20:16):\nWow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:17):\nYeah. It just came out the other day. So Elon did it. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:20:25):\nI'm ready. Let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:27):\nWhat are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:20:32):\nI have to say here that I actually don't read books. It's actually something that I decided on purpose where I decided I don't want to build my skill in reading, and I want to build it in listening and watching instead, because I think that's the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:49):\nI love how intentional that is, and I love how it's a really cool way of saying, I don't read books. The future isn't reading, but I love that you have books behind you, so [inaudible 01:20:58].\n\nGaurav Misra (01:20:58):\nI do. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:59):\n[inaudible 01:20:59]\n\nGaurav Misra (01:21:00):\n[inaudible 01:21:00] didn't read, they're back there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:03):\nThat's funny. Okay, cool. I want to ask more questions, but I'm going to keep going. Lightning around. Speaking of watching and listening, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:21:12):\nI like Silo and Severance. I mean, obviously, I think everyone's watching these. There's a book around Silo too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:18):\nI read that. I read all of them. There's three of them.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:21:20):\nThere are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:20):\nIt sucks to watch the show because you know all the tricks that are about to happen, and I'm just like, \"Why am I watching this? I know where this will go.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:21:27):\nYeah. I mean, for what it's worth, it does seem like the show is going on a slightly different path.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:31):\nIt is. That was also what annoyed me. Just like, \"What the heck? This is made up. All is made up shit.\" I don't like that when I watch the show. So two reasons I'm not watching it but [inaudible 01:21:40].\n\nGaurav Misra (01:21:39):\nDon't worry about it. I didn't actually read the book. My wife read the book and then she told me the story.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:44):\nOkay, okay. I was worried. I was worried. Okay, cool, and Severance. Okay, great. I love Severance.\n\n(01:21:51):\nNext question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:21:55):\nMy favorite product, honestly, is Linear. I'm not going to lie, just because it's so well-designed and it's so easy to use. I also like Superhuman. I mean, these are obvious answers, but I do use these things every day and it's hard to create products that you use every day and don't hate. So props for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:13):\nCool. I haven't announced this on the podcast yet, but this is a good time, whoever's listening right now, is I just launched a bundle where if you become a paid subscriber to my newsletter, you get, listen to this, a year free of Linear and Superhuman and Notion and Granola, which is incredible AI app for note-taking and Perplexity, Perplexity Pro.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:22:35):\nOoh. Nice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:36):\n$2,000 in value for the price of my newsletter, 200 bucks, going to that.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:22:40):\nDamn, that's real value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:43):\nIt's an unbelievable deal, and it's a no-brainer at this point to buy a subscription, but this isn't an ad for my newsletter. I'll keep going.\n\n(01:22:50):\nNext question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to, sharing with friends and family in work or in life?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:22:57):\nI actually learned this because someone else told me that I keep repeating this thing, but I have this framework of how I want to operate at work, basically. Right? I think I love to compete and to win at the end of the day. And I think that to win, you have to be the best. But I also think the easiest way to be the best is to be the first, and that actually is key.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:25):\nAnd so is the motto the easiest way? Is that the-\n\nGaurav Misra (01:23:27):\nThat's it. The easiest way to be the best is to be first.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):\nBe the first. Interesting. Okay. I have to resist following threads here because I want to make this lightning round.\n\n(01:23:37):\nOkay. Final question, just for fun. What's the coolest, most wild AI video you've seen recently? Is there one that comes to mind of like, \"Wow, that was something\"?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:23:47):\nI mean, honestly, I got to say the OmniHuman stuff was pretty cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):\nThe ByteDance video that we talked about.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:23:52):\nYeah, exactly. I mean, the broccoli talking. I don't know if you saw that one. There was a little broccoli delivering a little speech.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:01):\nInteresting.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:24:03):\nYeah, it looked like it was animated by an animator.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:08):\nJust imagine being a kid these days and just seeing stuff like that.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:24:11):\nI think you're probably just used to it, right? You're just like, this is just normal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:13):\nMm-hmm. It's just like we were saying, AGI is just going to come around.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:24:17):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:17):\nAll right. Cool. What's for dinner? Cool. That's great.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:24:20):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:20):\nAmazing. Gaurav, this was incredible. It was so insightful on so many levels. Two final questions. Where can folks find you and what you're building if they want to learn more? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nGaurav Misra (01:24:30):\nAwesome. Yeah, I mean, definitely find me on LinkedIn. That's where I live most of the time. My DMs are open, et cetera, et cetera. So feel free to send me a message. And I think what'll be useful, I mean, we're building out our early product and design team, so if AI video is interesting, if consumer apps are interesting, now's the time to join. We're really small, early, we work together across the team, so there's going to be no better time to join, basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:01):\nAnd you get to ship a marketable feature every week.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:25:03):\nExactly. I mean, that's the PM's dream. Think about it. Right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:06):\nThe PM's dream. Yeah, I like that that's a filter. The people that get excited about that, great fit. The people that are stressed out by that, not the place to be.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:25:15):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:17):\nSo awesome. All right. Gaurav, thank you so much for being here.\n\nGaurav Misra (01:25:20):\nNo, thank you. Appreciate it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:22):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:25:25):\nThank you so much for listening.

Six months after that, we built a competitor to Expensify, both publicly traded companies. We hit a hundred million in annual revenue. I think we were under at that point, 50 total in the R&D department, less than four engineers and three PMs. And then we started expanding into accounts payable. It was three engineers, one designer, one PM three months, and they hit out of the park. And that product is moving in billions of dollars a year. I think the recipe for all this is ...\n\nLenny (00:00:32):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Geoff Charles, who is VP of Product at Ramp. This episode is a unique glimpse into a startup and an approach to product that optimizes for moving quickly, thinking from first principles, and empowering individual team members. If you're not familiar with Ramp, they're the fastest growing SaaS business in history, getting to over $100 million in annual run rate in two years, which is just wild. And as you'll hear in this episode, they did this with 50 people. In our conversation, Geoff shares how they operationalize a culture of velocity, how they do a lot with few people, how they organize planning, how they define strategy, how they interview product managers and keep a very high bar for talent, plus also avoid burnout in a very fast moving culture and so much more.\n\n(00:01:25):\nMy advice is to seriously study how Ramp operates because there's a lot to learn from their success and their approach to product. Enjoy this episode with Geoff Charles after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:38):\nThis episode is brought to you by Ezra, the leading full-body cancer screening company. I actually used Ezra earlier this year unrelated to this podcast, completely on my own dime because my wife did one and loved it. And I was super curious to see if there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes, and then about a week later, you get this detailed report sharing what they found in your body.\n\n(00:02:14):\nLuckily, I had what they called an unremarkable screening, which means they didn't find anything cancerous, but they did find some issues in my back, which I'm getting checked out at a physical next month probably because I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer. Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will one-third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late. According to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80% survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The Ezra team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer early and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such as aneurysms, disc herniations, which may be is what I have, or fatty liver disease. Ezra scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs using a full-body MRI powered by AI and just launched the world's only 30-minute full-body scan, which is also their most affordable. Their scans are non-invasive and radiation free. And Ezra is offering listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your scan at ezra.com/lenny. That's E-Z-R-A.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:30):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it together and how can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.\n\n(00:04:08):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited-time offer just for startups.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:04:53):\nThanks, Lenny, it's great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:54):\nSo you are head of product at Ramp. For people not familiar with Ramp, could you just give us a brief overview of what it is that Ramp does?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:05:04):\nYeah, Ramp is a finance automation platform and corporate card solution for small and medium-sized businesses. So we help businesses essentially automate most things across expense management, card payments, bill payments, and accounting. And we've helped 15,000 of such businesses automate a lot of their back office to focus on what truly matters, which is growing their company and providing value to their customers.\n\nLenny (00:05:26):\nOkay. So what you didn't mention is some of the most interesting stats about Ramp and the business and the growth story of Ramp. So could you just also share some stats about just the success of Ramp and a sense of just how rare the story of Ramp has been?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:05:42):\nYeah. I mean, we were one of the fastest growing FinTech and B2B SaaS companies of all time. I think we've hit a hundred million in annual revenue for the first two years and we've continued to grow significantly since then. I think every day, about a thousand users join our platform. And this year, we've grown and hit 600 million in savings, 8.5 million in hours saved for our customers by controlling spend and automating a lot of the manual tasks. So we're continuing to grow fast, and in terms of just raw transaction volume, we have crossed 10 billion in [inaudible 00:06:17] spending on the platform and just getting started.\n\nLenny (00:06:20):\nYou've glossed over that stat of just Ramp is essentially known as the fastest growing SaaS business in history and also FinTech business. In two categories, the fastest Ramp to $200 million in run rate.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:06:34):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:06:34):\nOkay. So for that reason and many other reasons, there's a lot of interest in just how Ramp operates and how you all approach product and we actually previously collaborated on a newsletter post on how Ramp builds product. And that newsletter post is now the eighth most popular post on my newsletter across hundreds of posts that are ever written and even more than how Figma builds product and how Snowflake builds product and all these other incredible companies. And so, clearly, there's a lot of interest in how you operate. So I'm really excited to get into the meat of how you all work. And if anyone read this post and has any sense of just how you all operate, there's this one word that immediately comes to mind when people think of how Ramp operates and that word is velocity. So I want to start there. Can you just talk about how important velocity is to how you work and where that came from and how that actually looks day to day working at Ramp?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:07:27):\nYeah, absolutely. So you mentioned it, you nailed it. Velocity is everything at Ramp. It's how we design our product development process. It's how we incentivize teams, it's who we want to hire, it's who we want to promote, and it's everything around how we make decisions and how we organize the organization.\n\n(00:07:43):\nI think it came from the fact that during the pandemic, we started with a very small team and there was a huge market opportunity ahead of us and it wasn't so much which path we wanted to pick, but rather how fast we were able to execute on that path. And so velocity was ingrained from the early days on just building, shipping, and iterating. And I think it's a decent metric for how companies and teams perform. You might say, \"Well, what's the impact of that velocity?\" But realistically, teams that have high velocity are able to actually get to that impact over time by iterating. It's also a great way to have positive selection in terms of talent because talent wants to join companies that ship fast. And a lot of people who join Ramp, I ask them, \"Why are you interested in joining the company?\" And they often say, \"Well, it's because you guys are actually building things and shipping things and I want to know what that feels like.\" And it's also a great way just de-risk decisions and decision making. If the cost of that decision is really low, then you're able to essentially simplify a lot of decisions.\n\nLenny (00:08:44):\nTo build on that, there's a lot of companies that say they move fast, that talk about moving fast, that say velocity is really important, moving fast is really important to us, but I feel like Ramp is very different from that, where it's actually incredibly, incredibly fast and it's actually something you come back to again and again, this idea of, how do we move faster? Can you just share an example or two of what velocity actually looks like at Ramp and what the reality of that is?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:09:12):\nYeah. So when I joined, we were about 10-ish folks, about eight engineers, and in three months, we built a competitor to Amex. Six months after that, we built a competitor to Expensify, both publicly traded companies. We hit a hundred million in annual revenue. I think we were under at that point 50 total in the R&D department, less than four engineers and three PMs. And then we started expanding into accounts payable. We basically gave a team goal of building a competitor, Bill.com. It was three engineers, one designer, one PM three months, and they hit out of the park. And that product is moving in billions of dollars a year.\n\n(00:09:49):\nAnd I think the recipe for all this is constantly small teams have a single-threaded focus, give them the resources they need to execute big lofty goals, very tight timelines, and then shield them from the chaos that is the rest of the organization. So basically don't bother them and don't even tell the rest of the company that you're doing these things until they find product market fit, until they actually find that early traction and then they can bring in more resources. So it's like gravity and you need gravitational pull to this thing.\n\nLenny (00:10:25):\nOkay. I want to double click on some of these points you just made. So what you find is important to help teams and people move fast within Ramp is you talked about single-threaded teams, shielding them from other people, trying to pull them in different directions, lofty goals. There's a couple more things. Let's talk about the single-threaded piece a little bit. What does actually mean? What does that look like?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:10:47):\nThere are very few people who are able to execute extremely well in more than one thing, and it's especially true for individual contributors. And so what I mean by single threaded is there's only one goal, one thread, that they're waking up in the morning to focus on. And in order to remove that, you basically need to remove anything else that they're being asked to do to just focus on that thing, whether it's any type of research or any type of production engineering or any type of process that's outside of that single goal. And it almost goes as far as just saving a room in the office just for them and they are just in that room all day every day just working on that one thing.\n\nLenny (00:11:30):\nWhat's an example of that? Either maybe someone's working on it now or in the past that's a good example of a single-threaded goal or team.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:11:37):\nYeah. So, for example, we launched a flex product over the last summer, that was a single-threaded team just focused on eCommerce companies and their needs with more cash flow conversion and cash flow smoothing. And so we kept that team again just purely focused on just shipping that product and hitting that goal. And if they were ever distracted by something else, I don't think we would've hit it.\n\nLenny (00:12:02):\nHow do you, as a leader, avoid distracting them knowing there's so many things you need to do and there's constantly this like, \"Oh, if we just fix this one bug, this one customer is going to be so happy,\" and, \"Okay, if I just ask this one PM to work on this for a day?\" I know there's not going to be like, \"Here's the rule of step one, two, three, but how do you actually approach shielding teams from things that just are constantly on fire?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:12:25):\nSo, for example, on bugs or issues like that, we have individuals that are protecting those teams from those issues. So we have a rotational program on production engineering, for example, where engineers are protecting the core team from escalations, from bugs, from issues. We have product operators that are protecting the PM from the chaos that is documentation and escalations and release management and enablement customer requests. So we have layers of protective tissue to core teams, but I would say for any of these big bets, you basically have to pull folks from different teams and reorganize a sub-team. And that team typically doesn't have responsibility on any existing product because these are all fairly new products. I think it gets more challenging when you go from one to two rather than zero to one.\n\nLenny (00:13:15):\nYou also mentioned this idea of lofty goals and that's something I've seen a lot. At Airbnb, there was a ... It is very known for lofty goals. Brian was famous for going to meetings where people present their goals and their plans and he's like, \"How do we 10X that? What do you need in order to 10X that goal?\" And then that ends up being your goal and often works shockingly, sometimes burnt a lot of people out. How do you think about for just finding that balance and, I don't know, is there an example of just like, \"Here's a really ambitious goal?\" Or maybe the question is just, how do you find the balance of ambitious but not just impossible?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:13:46):\nYeah. So the first thing is we have market comparables, which is very exciting for us. So when you look at Bill.com, they're a publicly traded company, Expensify, publicly traded, or Concur or Coupa, these are all large players that are actually very motivating and largely de-risk some of the business decisions you're making. That's existing markets. We've also been able to create markets. Spend management was an actual market before we and other competitors jump into it.\n\n(00:14:18):\nSo that's motivating. Go attack that market and go drive that revenue is very motivating. We also use designs as a way to motivate teams. So we spend a lot of time with designers crafting out what the future of this thing could look like and that's also extremely motivating. So we constantly go back to these cornerstone, Loom walkthroughs of Figma prototypes that the design spend a lot of time talking through and I think that's a big part of the motivation. And so both of those things combined, I think, helps us stay motivated. I think there's a constant pushback to like, \"Okay, what can we actually achieve?\" But you're able to move super, super fast if you have those two things in mind, the market and the revenue goal, because very revenue driven as a company and the designs that can really keep you anchored on what this could look like.\n\nLenny (00:15:11):\nI know another important ingredient to how you all operate is you really like to empower product teams and give them a lot of control over how they operate and what they build and how they set goals and things like that versus micromanaging them. I think you have this concept of context over control. I'm curious how you actually operationalize that. A lot of people love the idea of empowering their teams and then they do that and then they do the wrong thing or they take too long or they set the wrong goals. So how do you actually make that work and create empowerment within your teams?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:15:43):\nYeah, it was one of the biggest cultural differences, I think, in Ramp versus other companies that were as a part of where my boss, the CTO, Karim, was extremely hands-off in terms of the actual pride decisions because we were extremely aligned on the goals themselves. And so that's where you really just start alignment is, what is the goal that you're going after? What is the hypothesis that you have to reach that goal? What is the data by which you're coming up with that hypothesis? And then what is the potential solution to test that hypothesis? And oftentimes, more junior leaders, and I was certainly in that camp earlier on, kept focusing on the solutions and debating the right solution when in fact you should really be debating upstream of that. You should be debating the interpretation of data, you should be debating the hypotheses and the different ideas that you have there as to what's really going on or you should be debating the goals themselves.\n\n(00:16:39):\nAnd so whenever things went wrong at Ramp, it was when I was being prescriptive with regards to the solution without actually explaining and aligning upstream on the goal, the hypothesis, and the data. And if you do that, you realize that the solutions actually can come much better from teams that are much closer to the ground. I think that's the biggest goal that I have now in my role is to continue giving context so that teams focus on the right goals, come up with the right hypotheses and focus on the right data points. And I spent most of my time just repeating myself, most of my time just sharing the context that I think they might be missing, especially given that I'm in certain meetings or certain groups in certain forms that they're not a part of and my responsibility to represent them and then share back the context for them to make better decisions over time.\n\nLenny (00:17:27):\nThat touches on a phrase that's come up a couple times on this podcast that a leader's job, you're essentially the repeater in chief, reminding people of strategy, vision, things like that. It feels like to move fast, you need to do what you're talking about, which is empower your teams to just move, otherwise, it's not scalable. And I'm curious just to make it even more real. Either ... Is there an version of something you did at your previous work versus at Ramp that just shows what that looks like when you're empowering your team and not in the weeds? What's most different there? Is it the product reviews, you're not as involved in design iterations? Where do you come in to actually give feedback? How does that actually look like working at a Ramp versus another company?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:18:12):\nI think that the contract between me and the team is really their strategy and their roadmap. And as long as we are aligned on the strategy, and we can get into that, and aligned on the roadmap and the timing, that's their contract. And so then at that point, my goal is to continue to give them context to execute on that and to coach them through that by getting firsthand data on how things are going that they might be missing. And their role is to highlight risks and highlight one-way decisions that they need my input on. And, again, it didn't use to start that way. I mean, when we first started, it was just me and another PM. I was fairly micromanaging in some areas. I think you build trust over time and you start having these contracts. And so as, I suppose, good more senior, they're basically publishing out the API by which they interact with me and we basically align on what's most important on each one on one.\n\n(00:19:09):\nSo I basically have teams ... All my directs post their goals every week first thing Monday. The goal there is to also have them review each other's goals. I have a one-on-one template that I basically use to keep on track of how progress is being made, but I certainly don't spend the time in the one on one going into that. I spend the one on one just focusing on what they need from me. And then on a biweekly basis, I have a team-wide meeting where I share context that everyone is missing and we go deep on the most important topics of the day.\n\nLenny (00:19:44):\nWhat about the product experience itself? Is there design review that happens? How do you stay on top of just like, \"I'm proud of this product that we're shipping as a team?\"\n\nGeoff Charles (00:19:52):\nI'd say we're iterating. I think when the first couple of years, it was more asynchronous and ad hoc process. And once you hit 10, 15 PMs and 20 or 30 different mini pods shipping constantly, I think you need a bit more of a process by which you have high-risk decisions that are being surfaced. So we're iterating. I think we're relating now is any large rock that we have on the roadmap needs to be brought into the product review process, where myself and the head of design are present and giving feedback, but it needs to be structured in a way where you are asking specifically for what type of feedback you need and you're highlighting the key risks and tradeoffs that you're making implicitly in that review.\n\n(00:20:38):\nSo that's one way we're able to scale, but I would say largely people ship and it's the difference between a beta and the GA, that's where we really get plugged in. When we make the decision to go live to the rest of the customer base and asking sales to start selling, that's where I'll really come in and stress test the hypotheses and the decisions. It's further downstream so it's more risky, but because we move so fast, you don't waste that much time if you have to pull it back.\n\nLenny (00:21:07):\nYeah, that came up actually. I just had a chat with Nicole Forsgren, who's world expert on developer productivity and developer experience, and they've done all this research on quality and speed of engineering and the engineering team. And they find that quality goes up as your product velocity goes up. You'd think it'd be the opposite. The faster you move, the lower quality ends up being. But exactly to your point, because you can fix things really quickly and you can get things out the door and there's not this huge chunk you have to wait for people to review and release and break things, ends up being higher quality. So it's very much aligned with our experience.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:21:45):\nYeah. And you have to create a system by which those folks are getting that feedback. And so we've really focused on what are the control mechanisms that ensure that your high velocity doesn't tank the business. And so examples of that is we have a voice of customer processes where every single negative review that is shared to our products is shared back to the tech lead, the PM and the designer on a monthly basis. We report back NPS and CSAT. We report back operational overhead, meaning the percentage of tickets that come from your product area normalized by the number of users that are using that product. And that's a core contract that the team has to maintain a low or lower part of operational burden. We also have bugs and issues being directly assigned to the engineer that's on call. So they feel that pain and then they can continue, to your point, leveraging velocity to solve those problems. Velocity is just a magnitude, it's not necessarily a specific direction.\n\nLenny (00:22:55):\nWith these bugs that are coming in and quality issues versus a team's goal and their KPIs that they're trying to hit, how do you recommend teams balance those two things?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:23:06):\nWe don't have a bug backlog. We fix every bug once they're surfaced almost.\n\nLenny (00:23:13):\nOkay.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:23:13):\nSo it's part of the production engineer's job really just to fix those things. I think where we get to nuances, like user experience improvements, the metric there that I really look at is how many support tickets come in that were due to a customer being confused. So we track that. And if that number is slightly elevated, we're basically saying, \"You can't ship any new features, you need to fix these things.\" And so, yeah, there's just these types of controls, but basically trying to standardize across the teams. This is your percentage of operational burden, this is your CSAT, this is your NPS, and this is the number of customers that are confused. As long as you maintain those metrics, you can do whatever you want. But the moment that these things are under the red, you can't ship new features and you need to revert back to the [inaudible 00:24:03].\n\nLenny (00:24:03):\nSomething funny that happened after our post on how Ramp builds product came out, someone on LinkedIn, a product manager, posted half-jokingly that her CEO came to her and every PM CEO came to them after that post. And they're just like, \"How do we prioritize velocity? How do we move faster? Look at this, this culture of velocity that Ramp's got, why don't we have that? What do we need to create this culture of velocity?\" And I worried a little bit because it creates this additional pressure on product managers that already have a really hard job with already a lot of pressure. So I was like, \"Oh, man, we're creating this new pressure that this one company is doing things really well and now everyone has to do it this way.\" So I guess my question is just, what's your advice to product managers who are getting this push from leaders to move faster as a result of how you guys operate?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:24:49):\nYeah. Well, one, I'm sorry. It goes without saying. PMs, we can't do anything by ourselves. We're very useless. We're force multiplier. So the one thing that I'll highlight is behind Ramp's velocity is a lot less the culture that I try to amplify, but a lot more the quality of the engineering and design talent candidly. And so I'm just standing really on their shoulders here. And so advice number one is ensure that from the top down there's an investment in R7D as a first-class citizen that you're paying upmarket, that you're hiring the best, that you're focusing on your engineering and tech brand, that you're bringing people who want to work there because they want to be empowered. And then you have a culture of empowerment. And what that means is ... And it's hard to get right. What that means is the CEO has less say in the product that is built and the engineers have a lot more say into it.\n\n(00:25:48):\nAnd so it's something that I've seen done really, really well at Ramp where the CEO sets the vision but is much less opinionated about the specific sequence by which we get there and trusts a tech organization that is radically empowered. The second thing that I would say is the biggest waste of time is meetings and status updates. And I think that oftentimes CEOs would say, or leaders would say, \"Hey, we've got increased velocity, therefore let's just add these status meetings and let's add all this process and all these documents and all these ways to hold teams accountable.\" And that's just a huge way to demotivate people. And so I've never had a status meeting. I've never scheduled a status meeting. Statuses are done async. They are done in the systems by which they operate and largely they should be in real time. And meetings should be all about collaboration, ideation, decision-making, et cetera. So just look at your calendar and just kill as many things as possible and kill just unimportant process.\n\n(00:26:56):\nAnd the last thing that I would say is oftentimes leaders say, \"I want to move super fast,\" but they'll say, \"I want everything under the sun. I want this and that and that.\" An example of that at Ramp is always like the debate between adding more products to one segment or going to a different segment, SME versus mid-market versus enterprise. And you ask the CEO, \"Hey, which one should we do?\" And they would say, \"All of it,\" because they think that the more goals you have, the faster you'll be able to execute. And I think there's just a limitation to that.\n\n(00:27:29):\nSo the thing I would amplify is be very clear with the tradeoffs that you need to make and present those tradeoffs back to your leadership team. So here's what we're doing and here's what we're not doing and why and which one would you pick? Give them a menu of items. And you'll see that you're able to execute much, much faster on four things rather than eight at the same time. That's your job. Your job is to basically communicate those tradeoffs that oftentimes are not well communicated to executives out of fear of looking like you're pushing back. You're actually not pushing back, you're increasing velocity.\n\nLenny (00:28:02):\nWhat I'm hearing from a meta point you're making is use that ask as leverage to change the way things are operating. Is that right?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:28:09):\n100%. You can't ask for velocity and not have empowerment and not trust and not eliminate process and not increase the focus. And that requires some serious tradeoffs that oftentimes leaders, especially those coming from more traditional industries, are not comfortable with. And it was the biggest breath of fresh air when I joined Ramp was how committed the team was.\n\n(00:28:33):\nThe last thing I'll say is there's nothing more motivating than a leader just commenting, \"This is awesome,\" on a random project channel at a random design crit. I know that our founders are just reading the projects that they actually care a lot about and the engineers know that. And so there's just a general excitement on just building great cool shit. And engineers just feel that and they're also highly motivated by that. So that's another piece of advice is just being able to stay plugged in to give engineers the opportunity to present to those leaders present in the all hands. That's also a great way to amplify the culture.\n\nLenny (00:29:17):\nIt's a good segue to this idea of burnout. Hearing a team operate incredibly fast and velocity, velocity, velocity makes you think about, are people burning out? Are they enjoying their work? How are they sustainably going to last at Ramp? I'm curious just what that's like and how you think about avoiding burnout for folks that are just constantly shipping, shipping, shipping.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:29:38):\nI think the debate around working hard and burnout misses a key point, which is all about how much impact and how good you feel about the work that you're doing. And I think that for me, when I felt burnout, it was actually at the time where I had the lowest amount of velocity. But it was when I felt like I was putting a lot of effort into things that weren't actually moving. And so I actually think velocity is a way to potentially avoid burnout. I'm not asking people to work endless hours a week. I'm asking people to get out of their own way and to focus on what truly matters, which is building great products for our customers. And I think you do that if you get into a flow state, if you get into a cadence where everything becomes easier, where work can really become thrilling.\n\n(00:30:28):\nAnd I think sometimes organizations, especially as they grow, make that really hard. They make it really hard to just be in that flow state with a ton of distractions, a ton of meetings, a ton of cross-functional teams that are all asking for your attention and grabbing for attention. Another parallel of this is running. The best runners are the ones that love running and they feel like running isn't a chore, work isn't a chore. And I think as a runner, I try to evaluate that whenever we're doing something hard, that's challenging, that's exhausting. If you love what you do, you feel much better about the amount of effort you're putting into it. And work doesn't feel like work.\n\nLenny (00:31:08):\nI find the same thing. I find that when I think back to the times that had the best experience, the most fulfilling work that I've done, it's often I was working insane hours. It was just like this very long stressful project but ends up ... Looking back, you're always like, \"Wow, that was so much, that was so cool. I learned so much. We shipped so much interesting stuff, made so much impact.\" I think the key is what you said is that you have to actually be proud of it and it has to be something that's meaningful to you because you could work long hours on something that you have no interest in and that does not help and that does lead to burnout. So that's the key.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:31:42):\nAnd you said something there, which is meaningful to you. So not meaningful to your boss or your boss's boss's boss, but meaningful to you. And I think that that's the role of management is to make everyone on your team feel like it's their goal. And the way to do that is to, again, align on that goal and give it to them and to problems to solve. If everyone feels like it's their team, it's their company, their mini company, then they will radically avoid burnout. But if they feel like the work is being pushed onto them, they feel like they're not aligned on the goal or they don't feel empowered with the solution, then the burnout will absolutely happen.\n\nLenny (00:32:22):\nOne of my favorite quotes that you have shared is, any second you spend planning is a second you don't spend doing. And on the one hand, I love that because the more you do, the more things happen, the more you get done, everything's happening. On the other hand, it also feels a bit chaotic and I'm curious how you find that balance between, \"Okay, we're not going to spend all this time planning, we're just going to go, go, go, go, go.\" And just how you think about that balance and how it actually ends up working out at Ramp sounds like not spending a ton of time planning.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:32:54):\nYeah. I would say when new joiners come at Ramp, I intro myself and I talk about our product strategy. And in the meeting with an apology, I say, \"You signed an implicit contract joining Ramp. It's one where we prioritize velocity over almost everything else. What that means is it'll be somewhat chaotic. We'll ship things that don't work. We will change our products without necessarily fully enabling you and you'll have to constantly be on your toes whenever you load up a demo instance.\" And I think that it's an expectation and people are welcoming of that because they understand that the tradeoff is that we don't move forward, that we don't actually innovate, that we don't continue to provide value for our customers.\n\n(00:33:41):\nI think there's certain things that we plan for. And so the question really is because accuracy has cost, make sure that you're only increasing the accuracy of planning for the things that have high value of that accuracy.\n\n(00:33:56):\nAnd so those things for us are large market moments where we have products, marketing, and sales all coordinating these big moments. And those typically happen maybe once a quarter, once every six months. It's basically your marketing calendar. We need a plan for that, for sure, but it's oftentimes a low percentage of our total R&D focus. And so it's totally fine for each team to be somewhat autonomous, somewhat chaotic within their pod. They're extremely clear, but for the outside in, it might be very chaotic. But be very accurate on the things that truly, truly matter. The rest actually doesn't matter. You don't need a lot of accuracy and confidence on when specifically certain features will be live. It's much better to spend whatever time you would spend trying to create accuracy and creating velocity.\n\nLenny (00:34:48):\nI love that you set expectations very clearly upfront. That seems really important to be successful at a company like that. It also just makes me remember every successful startup is extremely chaotic. As much as it may not feel like that on the outside, it's insanely chaotic. Things are constantly changing. I was at a fireside chat with Sheryl Sandberg once at Airbnb and somebody asked her just like, \"How do you deal with change? Things are just ... We're reorging every six months. People are leaving and coming and teams are shifting and priorities are always adjusting.\" And she's just like, \"This is the problem you want, you want to be going through this because that means you're growing and you're going through hypergrowth because the alternative is much worse where you're not growing and that's much more painful.\" So I think it's just a good reminder that if you're working at a place that's chaotic, it's often a good thing.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:35:37):\nI would say so. I mean, oftentimes, people use that excuse to not have a very strong strategy. And I think that for us, we've always been, from the start, the spend management platform that helps you spend less. Our strategy ... I share an annual newsletter around what we did and what we're going to do next year. And it's oftentimes pretty spot on in terms of the goals. Again, the goals and the value and the problem and the vision, that's consistent. The specifics, the timing, the quarterly scopes, all these things, yes, it changes, but what you want to avoid is the thrash of people waking up and feeling like they're working at a different company or that leaders are constantly changing their minds. We've been extremely consistent from the start and I think most of the products that we build, most of the code that we written, is in the customer's hands and hasn't been ripped away. And I think that speaks a lot to velocity, too.\n\nLenny (00:36:33):\nAwesome. That was a good addition. I didn't mean to say if your place is chaotic, it's no problem. It's that side effect of growth and hypergrowth as things are going to be pretty chaotic.\n\n(00:36:45):\nThis episode is brought to you by Attio, a new type of CRM that's powerful, flexible, and built around your data.

One is you talked about this contract you create with teams of a strategy. So maybe let's just go there. What does that actually look like? What's part of this contract? And is there a document you put together to lay this out?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:37:58):\nStrategy means a lot of different things. In my mind, strategy is about how do we get to our goals? And it's not a roadmap and it's not a vision, it's something right in between that. So the first thing you need to do is align on what are the goals, what do you want to see in the world? Then the hypothesis, why do you think this will work? Figure out why we're uniquely positioned as a company to get after that goal. Figure out the metrics by which you would measure whether we reach that goal and then talk about the initiatives, talk about the risks, and talk about the long-term outcomes.\n\nLenny (00:38:31):\nSo these are the bullet points of the contract essentially of a strategy document?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:38:35):\nCorrect. And now every pod basically spends time writing that doc for themselves. So the pods are basically organized against outcomes, so they should be very clear on their goals and they publish these things out. And then what I typically do is take all these documents and make sure that they're aligned with our high-level product strategy, which is a bit more long-term thinking than the individual pods, and that they are also aligned with our financial strategy, which we can get into. But that's a little bit of how you also create a culture of empowerment where each team is thinking about these things thinking like you. And the more that, as a leader, you make teams think like you, the more leverage you get over time and the more you can start thinking ahead on other ways of operating.\n\nLenny (00:39:25):\nHow long does planning roughly take and how often do you do this strategy rethink?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:39:30):\nWe've gone through iterations, good and bad, I think. For a period of time at Ramp, we created OKRs with financial goals and quotas to some extent for different teams. And that led to just taking a long time to plan because people were trying to make sure there was the right metric, trying to make sure that it was achievable. And it became very political, very annoying. And largely, our entire R&D team was like, \"Look, we're just going to execute on the roadmap, screw the OKRs.\" And so we moved from quarterly, very expensive quarterly planning, which took one month every three months, so basically 33% of the time was planning, to a biannual one-pager on, these are the company priorities and it's much more smooth and much faster. Related to that, though, we have a strong financial plan that we execute on and each row or lever of that financial plan has an owner. Oftentimes it's marketing and sales. For anything that's product led, it's product. So that's one contract. And then we have our roadmap, that's the second contract.\n\nLenny (00:40:43):\nOne of the bullet points you mentioned is this idea of being, what are we uniquely positioned to do? Can you talk a bit more about that and maybe what's an example of something you worked on, how you described why you're uniquely positioned to win at that?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:40:55):\nOne of the biggest values, I think, of software is how do you reuse the components that you've built to increase, again, velocity and impact. So why we were interested in bill payments as an expansion of our corporate card platform was we saw a bill as just an invoice to the company. And an expense was an invoice to the employee. And so there was a lot of parallels between these two things. It was all about having a liability. It was all about processing that liability in terms of the financial event and moving the money, moving the money either between the company, between the company and the employee or between two companies.\n\n(00:41:38):\nSo we believed that we were uniquely positioned to get after that space because we already had money movement. We already had some type of liability. We already integrated with accounting systems and we had a pretty strong risk process that can govern all that. And the employees that were requesting to pay these bills were already on the platform. So that's an example of a right to win. And I think that if you continue to focus on where you're uniquely positioned to win, you'll increase velocity because you already have a lot of the components of the expertise.\n\nLenny (00:42:12):\nI love that. It's not something you really see in teams' docs of just why we have the right to win this. So I think that's a really interesting element. By the way, I should mention we'll link to a template of your planning approach in the show notes, which we also had in the post that we worked on. So folks are trying to write down notes of all these little bullet points. We'll link to a doc that has all these things.\n\n(00:42:34):\nWhat do you think of OKRs and how do you approach OKRs as a part of this planning?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:42:39):\nI largely stay away from OKRs from a product perspective.\n\nLenny (00:42:39):\nGo on.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:42:44):\nI think that, again, strategy, financial plan, roadmap. I think where we landed on with OKRs were really around more cross-functional things in nature. So, for example, we'll have an OKR around winning a specific market and we'll have OKRs that are cross-functional across different teams. But, again, an OKR is just a method to measure an objective with metrics and you can use them at various levels of granularity. I stay away from them from a product perspective because, again, I want to focus on velocity, which is just output, which is your roadmap, but they're pretty strong at more of the cross-functional side of things as well as the financial side of things.\n\nLenny (00:43:30):\nI don't even know what separates an OKR from not an OKR. I feel like OKRs are just a goal with some high-level statements of things we're trying to accomplish. I don't even understand when people say they use OKRs or don't, what that even means anymore. There's a recurring point on this podcast and other posts of just people are weary of just being obsessed with, \"Here's the metric that we're going to hit and that's all that matters.\" And there's a fear they lose sight of the bigger picture, what they're trying to accomplish. But I think in the end, it's just like, \"Here's what we're trying to do. Here's some goals, we're going to hit it,\" because I don't know care, I don't know.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:44:02):\nI think that's right. I think that's right. And at the end of the day, again, the contract is your product roadmap and that's the contract you have, the sales organization. Marketing can take that product roadmap and create market moments. And ultimately, if your product roadmap doesn't actually hit the goals of the company, then I'm accountable because I've created a system by which I've aligned with each team on why the roadmap is going to hit the goals. And so you essentially need to point back to the leader in that regard. But I can't ask every team to try to manipulate OKRs to fit their roadmaps. That's just completely exhausting. We've aligned on what we need to do, let's get it done.\n\nLenny (00:44:41):\nSomething that comes across pretty clearly in the way you think and the way Ramp operates is this idea of thinking from first principles. And it's a cliche term, feels like everyone's always trying to talk about how they're thinking from first principles and it's important to their culture to think from first principles, but it feels like you guys actually do it. And so I am curious just where that emerged for you or for Ramp. And is there an example of something that emerged within Ramp, a new product or an idea, that was very clearly from first principles?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:45:10):\nThe most important thing to talk about here is that Ramp is a very unique business. I mean, we're a credit card company, which is all about risk management and underwriting. We're also a payments company because we move money between businesses. We're also a software company because we deal with spend management and expense management, accounting. We're building for SMEs. So we have PLG, but we're also building for enterprise. So we are sales driven, we're everything.\n\n(00:45:40):\nAnd so it's really important when you're dealing with something that hasn't been done before to think from first principles. And what I mean by that is you don't pattern match from your past experience, but you go back to the fundamentals of what we're trying to do and you think through them very, very deeply. And that means you need to hire people who can think from first principles and be okay putting aside their experience. And that's a tough pill to swallow for some folks who will come in and will say, \"I'm the subject matter expert on X, Y, Z and I know what's best.\" And they come in and they get a reality check about the complexity of our business. And how also you can't influence teams by saying, \"I've seen this before.\" That's just like an anti-pattern. You can't say, \"My past company, X, Y, Z.\"\n\nLenny (00:45:40):\nNo one wants to hear that.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:46:32):\nNo one wants to hear that. And surely, I thought I was coming into Ramp and I was going to apply the best product [inaudible 00:46:39] process, and I had to shift that process entirely because the process was predicated on a B-plus engineering team, and I was faced with an A-plus engineering team. And so my entire ... I had to go back to first principles around how products should be developed and built. So, again, all the advice I'm sharing here, don't just take it and map it and copy paste. Start from the first principles that we're sharing.\n\n(00:47:00):\nAn example of that is our support team. So support reports into me. And the first principle there was saying, \"Well, every support ticket is a failure of our product.\" We literally have that as a quote just posted on all those channels. It's a failure. And if the product works perfectly, no one should ever have to contact our support team. And what better way of holding the product team accountable for support other than having support report into product.\n\n(00:47:30):\nAnd the second piece was that we believe that a lot of our value to our customers were because it was going to come from deeply understanding them, deeply listening to them, and moving on that feedback. And so instead of hiring people who were focused just on resolving the ticket, we incentivized people to actually decrease number of tickets over time and decrease deflection or increase deflection. And that required hiring a different breed of people that then became leaders in different parts of the organization as well.\n\n(00:48:03):\nSo, again, we could have easily just pattern matched, look at comparables, hired people who've scaled large support teams, and just used benchmarks in the industry, but we've started from first principles. And the outcome of that is we have an extremely low contact rate. We have over 400,000 users on our platform and a team of agents that's under 30. And it's a pretty crazy ratio to think about.\n\nLenny (00:48:30):\nThat's wild. I missed this nuance. So the support team reports into you and the product team?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:48:37):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:48:38):\nWow, I've never heard of that. That's cool. Okay.\n\n(00:48:42):\nSo I'm going to change course a little bit and I'm going to talk about writing. So we worked on this post together on how Ramp operates. And I was just incredibly impressed with your attention to detail, your ability to articulate, your approach to product. And as we were working on this, you mentioned that writing is really important to you as a way of figuring out what you think and to solve and crystallize problems, which is exactly how it works for me. And that's how this whole newsletter started. It was just trying to crystallize what I remembered and did so that I can remember it and share with people. So I'd love to just hear your insights and take on just what writing does for you and maybe what you'd recommend listeners do with this approach of writing, helping them think.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:49:25):\nThroughout the years at Ramp, I was often faced with a problem or a question that I couldn't answer off the bat, and I had to go back to first principles. And the best way of doing that is to shut down your laptop, take out a piece of paper, write the question as simply as possible at the top of the paper, and just spend time just thinking about how to answer that question. And there were a ton of questions over time. For example, how do we ... And it was all scalability problems that few companies have actually done successfully. And so you have to start with your own thinking, how do we scale decision making? How do we incentivize teams to work together? How do we do headcount planning? How do we allocate headcount in a fair way? How do we avoid politics as firsthand data goes away? How do we make decisions on doubling down versus pivoting?\n\n(00:50:24):\nAll these things are really tough. And I found myself ... You could read things and that's helpful, but I don't think that reading makes you necessarily think better. It makes you more wise, but the best way to increase your capacity to think is to actually do the thinking. And so that's where I see writing. If you're able to write things clearly, you're able to think through things clearly. It was also a way for me to effectively communicate, especially during COVID, where we largely grew up during COVID, where everything was written, and it was also a way for me to get content out there to increase my brand and Ramp's brand in terms of the space that then led us to hire better people over time. So all these things worked out, but it does require you to block out time and to, again, focus on how you think about problems rather than try to Google the answer. After you thought through it, then go out and read and you'll fine-tune your thinking and you'll identify new questions to ask yourself afterwards.\n\nLenny (00:51:34):\nI love this advice. You mentioned earlier that PMs can't really do much on their own, but I think this is the thing PMs can do is PMs have the time to think and to plan and think ahead because they're not required to build code all day and design. This is the advantage you have as a PM. I always think that PMs often don't really have any special unique skills. They just have the time to do the things that nobody else wants to do or doesn't have the time to do or doesn't want to do. And just this really important point of just spending the time to think and not just constantly try to discuss things in meetings or, like you said, just Google around for answers. That ends up being incredibly important. And I just love this framework of just starting a doc with a little question at the top and just sit there and try to answer the question on your own before doing anything. I think that's a really good approach.\n\n(00:52:26):\nI want to ask how you actually do that. How do you actually create these blocks of time? There's this concept of deep work and how valuable that is to creative work and knowledge work. How do you do that for yourself? How do you block out time and not get bugged all day?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:52:39):\nBecause we're really anti-meeting at Ramp, I had time in my calendar. And so what I would basically do is the Friday before I clocked out, I would look at the next week, I would look at the top questions that I needed to spend time thinking about, and I would block out that time. I also work on one day of the weekend in terms of deep work. I find that hanging out outside and doodling on my piece of paper, some thoughts is actually really refreshing because it doesn't feel like work. It feels like just me just philosophizing about something. And so, yeah, blocking out that time, finding a space where things are less busy, where you're not in a critical path either early mornings or later afternoons or a day on the weekend is the best path for it.\n\nLenny (00:53:34):\nWhat do you do if someone wants to actually schedule a meeting with you or reach out or put someone on your calendar? Do you have a policy there to protect that time?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:53:41):\nI think that I should never really be in the critical path of anything. So largely, I'm not available, but if they really need to get to me, they have my phone number.\n\nLenny (00:53:53):\nCool. The thing that I found really valuable is just on Wednesday mornings and Friday mornings, I just have this huge block called deep work time. If you book a time during this time, I'll slap you. And I don't know if I'm allowed to put that into meeting calendar invites anymore, but that actually worked really well. Nobody really booked meetings in that slot.\n\nGeoff Charles (00:54:11):\nI didn't know Zoom had a slot feature that's coming handy.\n\nLenny (00:54:15):\nIt was a Google, it was in the calendar. It was like the calendar invite. And I also worked usually at least one day a week and I found that to be really effective and I know a lot of people don't want to be doing that, but I found that really important to have great success.\n\n(00:54:30):\nOne other question along these lines around just optimizing for processing and getting stuff done and deep work time, do you have any other best practices for just being organized and staying on top of stuff, knowing there's just stuff coming at you all day every day?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:54:46):\nIf you're a manager and, like me, you're in back-to-back meetings from 10:00 to 6:00, it's very easy to be completely overwhelmed with a sheer amount of stuff you need to do. And so I've invested over time in just a very robust but fairly simple task management process, which is, at the end of every meeting, I would write down the tasks that I owe and the tasks that someone else owes and I would write them down to as clearly as possible, not some vague thing, but a very clear thing and just when I need to get this done by. I don't spend time just grooming. So at the end of the day, I use notes. I have just a page-long thing of all the things I need to get done, all the things people need to get done for me. And then I spend time grooming, which is basically just trying to group things together in logical chunks, grouping the tactical versus the strategic, the important versus the less important.\n\n(00:55:40):\nI group also what other people owe me and I Slack them what they owe me and I put a reminder on Slack for when they owe it to me by. And that way, it's just out of sight, out of mind. I think that the high-level theme is I try to create or free up headspace for processing, not memory. And so I just basically spend very little time memorizing anything and I write everything down. That is hard when you're trying to remember a specific date or remember something that someone said, but you have a system by which you can pull these things up very, very quickly. In the Google Space, you can pull up any document and search a bunch of documents very, very quickly. So that's what I would do is just spend a lot more time on the processing, be extremely good at just task management, and then grouping things, and then the next day, creating your calendar aligned to the goals that you've set for yourself the day before in terms of the tactical, where you group those tactical tasks together and then the more strategic deep thinking, walking out that additional space.\n\nLenny (00:56:40):\nI feel like you and I are very aligned on a lot of things. That's exactly how I approach priorities. Have you read Getting Things Done by David Allen?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:56:47):\nI don't read a lot of nonfiction actually.\n\nLenny (00:56:50):\nOkay, because what you're describing is very aligned with this approach to processing and taking to-dos, and it's what I built my approach on. And so you naturally merged out of your head. I love it.\n\n(00:57:03):\nLet's move on to talking a little bit about your team and hiring and things like that. And there's just going to be a grab bag set of questions. What is your current PM team look like, either number wise or just ratio and just a PM wise?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:57:17):\nWe have about 13 PMs at Ramp and probably over a hundred engineers. So I try to keep basically one to eight to one to 15 depending on the team. Obviously, B2B is slightly more complex because you're dealing with pretty strong marketing team and pretty strong sales team and pretty demanding customers that you have relationships with. So I've seen ratios be a bit lower than the B2C space. But, yeah, that's a little bit of the team today. And they're organized by those teams, by those customer pain points.\n\nLenny (00:57:47):\nAnd I have this note from before, you said that you reached a hundred million ARR, and that's a run rate, not recurring revenue at that point, I imagine, right?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:57:55):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:57:56):\nWith 50 people, which is incredible. And so just on that point, how do you do so much with so few PMs, especially? Do you have anything that you figured out that ends up being really important there?\n\nGeoff Charles (00:58:06):\nI think that by eliminating or reducing the size of the team, we've forced other people in the company to think like PMs and I think it's been a huge value add to our culture. When I say product, often people think about product management, but I actually think product is anyone that actually reports into our CTO, and that's product engineering, product design, product managers, product data scientists. So making everyone feel like a PM is a great way to get leverage as a PM, and that means basically empowering the designer to think about the actual specs and priorities and scopes more than you or empower the engineer to take something that's fairly lightweight in terms of a spec or direction and actually think through it deeply and come back with some great questions that the PM hasn't thought through. So that's one thing.\n\n(00:58:58):\nThe second is that we invested early on in product operations, which was a team that also reports to me that basically focuses on the operational functions of product that's everything around whether it's project management or issue management or release management or enablement and content beta and customer research. They basically are tasked with a lot of the work that needs to get done to continue shipping products and scaling product development.\n\n(00:59:29):\nAnd then lastly, just cutting as much of the low-leverage work that PMs often get sucked into. So, for example, we never write a ticket. We don't spend much time in linear, which is our ticket management system. Basically, our contract is the vision and the priority and a very high-level spec and everything else is pushed on the engineering teams. And I think that's when engineers actually are also able to move even faster because they can create whatever tickets they want, they can break down the work that they want, they are accountable for the projects that they're driving, and that increases trust and moves things faster as well.\n\nLenny (01:00:09):\nThat makes a ton of sense. Basically, you distribute the PM job that other companies put on the PM across other team members. So if you had to think about just what is the core product manager job at Ramp at this point, I imagine from what I've been hearing, it's strategy, vision, aligning the team. What else plays into that, just bullet point wise? A few things that come to mind.\n\nGeoff Charles (01:00:32):\nTeam building. So building a culture within the pod because oftentimes your managers are no longer in your team, right? Engineers might report to different people, designers might report to different people. PMs might report to different people. So actually building a team culture within the pod is really, really important. And oftentimes it falls on the PM to create those offsites or to create those ideation sessions or to find ways to have fun as a team.\n\n(01:01:00):\nThe second is making sure that the team is humming in terms of the actual focus areas and then protecting the team from stakeholders that might want to have an opinion or want to have an update or want to schedule certain meetings. So protecting that core team from that chaos and then being the central point of contact if someone has a question or needs something, and then being able to bring in the right person at the right time. So those are the different things that is also really important to mention.\n\nLenny (01:01:34):\nComing back to a note that I made earlier, you talked about how a lot of this advice you're sharing in the approach to product at Ramp is assuming that the team is A plus, the engineers are A plus, the designers A plus. For somebody listening to this that may be wondering, \"Are my engineers A plus or not?\", what comes to mind as ways that you could get a sense of this is a team that can operate in this way versus, no, we're never going to work in this way and maybe we should shift the way we work or I should get work somewhere else?\n\nGeoff Charles (01:02:06):\nGreat question. Yeah, it's very hard to identify. A few things. One is, does the engineer want to win in the market? Does the engineer really care about winning against competitors, winning the hearts and minds of the customer? Do they understand the business context in which they operate by which they need to do that? Are they curious about how the company makes money, about what customers love and don't love, about what the most important project is and why it's important? They're asking you questions about the business outside of just the engineering domains. Are they able to execute on what they said they were going to execute without your help or do you actually feel like you need to be behind them? Are they the one actually setting the pace, asking you to keep up with your specs, keep up with your decisions, respond more quickly to the things that are blocking them, bringing more PMs or more designers to do more things?\n\n(01:03:14):\nAre they being proactive in different channels where you think it's actually your job, but actually they'll jump in anyways? For example, we have different Slack channels with a bunch of people sometimes asking questions or raising issues or having blockers. And you have engineers who are just jumping in and explaining how a feature works, getting the feedback and fixing a bug proactively. And you may think, \"Well, that's not the priority. I need to control what the engineers are doing.\" That's not your job actually, that's not your job. Your job is to make sure that they're aligned with the long-term vision and that they can deliver what they've committed to, but on top of that, they can do whatever the hell they want. And if they're taking on something that puts the things that they committed to at risk, they'll communicate that. So, again, that proactiveness, that desire to help, that desire to improve that accountability on their product.\n\n(01:04:03):\nIf their product isn't performing, if their product has feedback, are they doing it themselves or they need you to push them? So those are all mentality and culture aspects. I'm not even getting into the technical rigor and the quality of their systems and the velocity of code because I'm not a good judge of that. That's not really my role. But those are the things that I would immediately look at that, I think, is just fundamentally different in the engineering team that we built at Ramp versus others. And it's just a big part of the culture shift and the culture that we've been able to build.\n\nLenny (01:04:36):\nThat was an awesome answer. And I think as a PM, you often don't want your engineers and designers to have such strong opinions and to be so on top of everything because there's just like, \"Oh, no. Okay, here's what I think we should actually do,\" but engineers have all these opinions. And what you're saying is that's what you want to lean into, assuming you trust that they know what they're doing and can actually get things done. And so it's like a catchment to you a little bit, but I think that's a really unique culture and approach. And so that's an awesome answer.\n\nGeoff Charles (01:05:05):\nAnd, look, there's drawbacks to that culture where you get to a radically empowered engineering team that thinks that they know the product better than the designer or the PM and they push back on the designs or they disagree with the PM, but I'll take that culture any day compared to a culture where they're just taking things at face value and not challenging the thinking and not actually thinking from their own perspectives. And it is like I'll take someone on my team any day that challenges what I tell them to do or what I think is important and is maybe a bit harder to manage, but it'll make me think way deeper about what I'm asking them and what I think is important. And I'll grow as a manager much faster because of that.\n\nLenny (01:05:45):\nI love it. Two final questions, one around hiring. When you're interviewing people, what do you look for and what does Ramp look for that maybe other companies don't value as much as they should or maybe overvalue? What do you look for that you think is unique that helps you hire this A-plus team?\n\nGeoff Charles (01:06:02):\nWe look for people who have a very strong desire to have impact. And the best way to assess that is the impact that they've had or the reason why they are switching jobs. So, again, it goes back to what I was mentioning earlier in the chat, which was velocity leads to people wanting to join because they want to have velocity. And the best signal that is, I'm leaving because things got too slow, things got too bureaucratic. I missed the old days where we were just building and shipping and launching. I look for people who can think deeply, so I'll go super deep into a decision, a tradeoff that they had to make. And I'll really just scratch at that until I get to a deep understanding of how they make decisions and how deep they think about things.\n\n(01:06:57):\nAnd in general, we tend to overemphasize those two skills rather than necessarily experience because experience ... Again, to the point around Ramp is a unique business, it matters a lot less. You can have a lot less impact than your ability to be hungry and your ability to think deeply.\n\nLenny (01:07:20):\nFinal question. A lot of people listening to this want to get into product management. What's your advice? I'm sure you get asked this a lot. How do you break into product management? What do you tell people?\n\nGeoff Charles (01:07:30):\nYeah. So for me, I went from college to consulting to my four into tech was really into more like solutions analyst, I think that was my title. I was basically trying to implement a large B2B software in national banks. And how I got into product management was really around understanding deeply the customer and understanding deeply the product and being able to show impact on the combination of these two things. Typically, the folks that join product teams are the highest performers outside of product that either understand the customer really well and can advise product or understand the product very well and can serve customers.\n\n(01:08:12):\nAnd so my advice is for folks that want to break into that is to find a role that is adjacent to product that enables you to have those experiences and to prove yourself. So, for example, product operations is a good one. Business operations is a good one. More consulting sales engineering or solution engineering is a good one. There are designers and engineers that can become PMs as well. Typically, it's folks that can do the job as well as the PM. And what we typically do is we give those PMs a shot or those folks a shot. So we'd give them like six months to go into a new area and try it out. And then we basically have the engineers they work with and designers they work with actually make the call as to whether or not they would want this PM versus another PM on the team.\n\nLenny (01:09:05):\nIs there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nGeoff Charles (01:09:09):\nYeah. I mean, first, think from first principles, don't take everything I'm saying at face value. And second is back to talent, that a huge part of our success was the early team that Karim built on the tech side. And so I can write blogs all day on how we increased velocity, but if there's one thing to take away from this is that empowered and talented engineers and designers are the biggest reason why Ramp was so successful and it's something that requires a ton of focus. I mean, early on for the first year at Ramp, Karim, our CTO, was only focused on that. It was hiring the best talent. He was a lot less interested or focused on our product strategy, our product market fit, or even our revenue. It was all about bringing in the best engineers and the best designers and that has had compounding effects on the company and the team.\n\nLenny (01:10:09):\nAnd I think an important element there is the initial people you hire end up impacting the next batch and the next set because they see, \"Wow, this person is working at Ramp. That's incredible. I got to look at that.\" So there's an early compounding effect, too, that happens.\n\nGeoff Charles (01:10:24):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (01:10:25):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nGeoff Charles (01:10:32):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:10:34):\nWhat are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nGeoff Charles (01:10:40):\nBecause I work a lot, I try to read things that are completely outside of work. I don't think I can get through any fiction or nonfiction book that's often recommended. So anything that will pull on your heartstrings and try to make you more human. When Breath Becomes Air is a really good one that I often recommend.\n\nLenny (01:10:59):\nAmazing. Love that one. Favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nGeoff Charles (01:11:03):\nI started watching The Bear a few weeks ago. I think it's a great show around leadership around how a different industry operates, the restaurant industry. My dad owned a restaurant so I got a little bit into that and all about teamwork and quality versus velocity [inaudible 01:11:24] of personal and professional stress. So I thought it was a really good learning.\n\nLenny (01:11:29):\nWow, that show makes me really think of Ramp. That makes a lot of sense. It feels very ... Everything's just crazy moving fast. I'm just so stressed watching that show. I haven't watched the second season yet.\n\nGeoff Charles (01:11:41):\nYou should come to our office, probably very similar.\n\nLenny (01:11:44):\nJust delicious food, sandwiches and the velocity. Favorite interview question you'd like to ask candidates?\n\nGeoff Charles (01:11:52):\nI ask, what's the hardest thing you've ever done? And I ask that because working at Ramp is hard. I want to understand what hard means for them. I want to understand why it was hard. I want to understand how they overcame that difficulty, how they worked with other people to overcome that difficulty, and how much agency they had in overcoming that. So it's a really good sign around what is difficult to them and how much work they put into overcoming that.\n\nLenny (01:12:23):\nWhat is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nGeoff Charles (01:12:28):\nSo my partner bought me this WHOOP recently. Wearing it now. It gives you this real-time stress signal. [inaudible 01:12:36] that's pretty helpful. But I think it's a great product in terms of just actual insights. It's very data-driven, so it'll tell you ... You have a daily journal of all the things you did that day and it'll correlate what you did that day to your recovery score or how healthy you are for that day.\n\n(01:12:55):\nAnd so it'll give you insights around how certain actions you take will have impact on your next day's health, which is all about heart rate variability. I thought it was just a great way to continue to focus on your health. I think running a team has a huge impact on your physical health, on your mental health, and I think you are an athlete at a high growth startup or even a small business or a large company. And focusing on that health is really, really important. So any tools like the WHOOP to invest into that is great.\n\nLenny (01:13:30):\nThat was a really good pitch for the WHOOP. I have never wanted one, but now I do. Okay, next question. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute?\n\nGeoff Charles (01:13:42):\nIt's not something I've changed, it's more something that our head of design, Diego, has changed. Basically having designers spend more time creating more visionary prototypes and then sharing those out in videos. It just has just huge impact on how exciting work is and how excited the team are. And so just providing that clarity is massive. And I think just, again, Figma and Loom and prototypes that actually are interactive so people can actually play around with it is a huge way to unlock velocity.\n\nLenny (01:14:18):\nFinal question. I've already asked you about this a couple of times, but I'm curious if there's any other productivity tip or tool that you'd recommend to listeners that you haven't mentioned yet.\n\nGeoff Charles (01:14:29):\nTurn off notifications. Quit Slack when you're doing deep work. Check your emails once a day and just literally go through them in five minutes. Oftentimes, most of them use lists. Check Slack only at the top of the hour. Use Slack snooze or reminders. I mean, there's a whole other podcast we can talk about over Slack channels and how to organize that, but just get really good at the tools you're using. I think the first year of consulting, we just got really good at Excel and Excel shortcuts, and it was a big part of our training. And so just train yourself and train your teams on how to use their tools, how to use your calendar, how to use Slack, how to use email, whatever the tool you've designed as the right tool for you. Be dogmatic. I mean, what Ramp is, is a tool at the end of the day and we're helping finance teams more efficient, so let's dock through that and do that with our own tools.\n\nLenny (01:15:27):\nI think we've had just enough velocity in our chat. I think we're going to hit a hundred million downloads. I think we built an A-plus team here. Geoff, thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to ask you any other questions? And second question, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nGeoff Charles (01:15:44):\nYou can find me on Twitter and LinkedIn. Twitter is geoffintech. How can they be useful? Honestly, your attention is a gift. If you're interested in joining us here at Ramp, we're obviously hiring incredible people. So if anything that I shared resonates with you and if you want to join the team, and we're hiring across product engineering design, but most importantly, be kind to yourself. I think I've been a huge listener to this podcast. It's an honor to be here. I know very little. Hopefully some of what I shared was meaningful to you. But keep the growth mindset. Keep thinking from first principles. Keep investing in that growth and be patient. It takes a lot of time.\n\nLenny (01:16:24):\nWhat a beautiful way to end it. Geoff, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nGeoff Charles (01:16:28):\nThanks a lot, Lenny. This was a lot of fun.\n\nLenny (01:16:30):\nSame. Bye, everyone.\n\n(01:16:34):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Leaving big tech to build the #1 technology newsletter | Gergely Orosz (The Pragmatic Engineer)\n\n## Transcript\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:00:00):\nThe tendency when you're in the chasm is, \"I just need more customers. I should take any customer I could find,\" because we need revenue. It's like taking a match and running it back and forth under a log. It's not going to light the log. So how do you start a fire? Well, you start it by putting a little kindling, little crumpled up paper, and you hold the match in one place until the fire starts. That's why adjacency is so important. If you light the fire, the piece of kindling is here, but the log is in the other room. That doesn't work.\n\nLenny (00:00:32):\nToday, my guest is Geoffrey Moore. Geoffrey is the author of maybe the most influential and important book on go-to-market ever written, Crossing the Chasm. Even though it's sold over a million copies, it still feels like people continue to reinvent many of the lessons that Geoffrey uncovered and shared in a seminal book. In our conversation, we discuss why it's so important to get very narrow with your initial audience, how the bowling pin strategy helps you get past early adopters, what the specific go-to-market playbook is for every stage of the adoption lifecycle, why using the wrong playbook during the wrong phase will slow you down. Also, the seven deadly sins of trying to cross the chasm incorrectly. Also, how to sell your product at different personas, why you don't need to focus on the problem and the pain when you're selling to early adopters, plus some real good life advice that I didn't expect.\n\n(00:01:22):\nGeoffrey has so much wisdom to share if you're building a B2B company, and I'm really excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Geoffrey Moore after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:34):\nLet me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product pop-ups really annoying. Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature, and these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day, and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product, growth, marketing, and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them.\n\n(00:02:08):\nThey use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words, and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions. They do popups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps, and websites, and they work with industry leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny, and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny.\n\n(00:02:56):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features, and hundreds of other companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently launched AuthKit, a complete authentication and user management service. It's essentially a modern alternative to Auth0, but with better pricing and more flexible APIs.\n\n(00:03:38):\nAuthKit's design is stunning out of the box, and you can also fully customize it to fit your app's brand. It's an effortless experience from your first user all the way to your largest enterprise customer. Best of all, AuthKit is free for any developer up to 1 million users. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.\n\n(00:04:03):\nGeoffrey Moore, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:04:07):\nWell, it's nice to be here, Lenny, and thank you for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:09):\nIt's incredibly cool to have you on. You've been at the top of my wishlist of guests to have on this podcast ever since I launched it, so it's surreal to be chatting with you. It almost feels like maybe this podcast has crossed the chasm now that you're on.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:04:22):\nIf you'd called me earlier, I probably would've been on it with you. But anyway, we're together now.\n\nLenny (00:04:27):\nI thought it'd be fun to start with this question of just what frustrates you most about what people still don't get about the things that you teach, particularly Crossing the Chasm. You wrote that, I think, 33 years ago at this point. You have a lot of follow-up books around the topic. What do you think people still don't really understand or often get wrong?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:04:45):\nAll the books I write are about frameworks. They're conceptual models about what patterns should you be looking for as something evolves? Because in disruptive innovation, there's no history. You're always projecting a possible history, and then seeing if you can make it come true. So that implies there's a lot of freedom to exercise the framework however you choose to. People sometimes do that in ways that are just... They actually end up being very misleading about what's possible. I can remember one person early on saying, \"Yeah, we're Crossing the Chasm. Our beachhead segments the Fortune 500,\" and you went, \"Well, I don't think maybe you're as clear on this as you could be.\"\n\n(00:05:32):\nTo be fair, that's what the function of any third party advisor is, is to say, \"Look, time out. You might be looking at this through an inside-out lens. Maybe you should be looking at it from an outside-in lens.\" That's probably number one. Gosh, after that, I'm just empathetic with the fact that their world's more important than my world, so I try to work with their world.\n\nLenny (00:05:59):\nThat's exactly where I actually wanted to go next is this idea of starting very focused with your initial target audience. I think people conceptually know this. They're like, \"Yeah, we should be really focused with our initial target market. We should stay very small, and expand this beachhead idea.\" But I think they still don't quite actually do this because it's like, \"Why not go wider?\" So could you just talk about why that is so important, and how to actually think about how to do that correctly?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:06:23):\nIf you're essentially in a business where the category is emerging, then the most important thing for you to do is to be able to create enough power around your company that you can navigate your future on your own power. Where does power come from in an early adopting technology world? First of all, it'll come from can you get a lighthouse customer? So one of the things we try to do even before you try to cross the chasm is can you get one or more customers who put you on the map? And they go, \"Whoa, did you know that the CIA used AWS?\" Like, \"Holy smoke.\" Okay, that's great. It doesn't make a company, but it makes a story, and it lets people know, \"Oh, here are the guys that did the CIA project,\" that kind of thing.\n\n(00:07:09):\nThe Crossing the Chasm model is, \"Can you create a viable repeatable business?\" And in order to do that, you need to have an ecosystem of partners work with you in order to consolidate your position. Well, why would an ecosystem work with some startup that nobody's ever heard of? The answer would be if you had consolidated a market segment where you were number one. So one of the things we've learned about company power is that basically it's the company power plus the ecosystem together. So ecosystems form around market leaders, and they do not form around the rest of us. If you're a category leader, if you're like Oracle and Databases, you're 40 years in. You're still the leader, because the ecosystem organized around you.\n\n(00:07:51):\nBut when you're little, the only way you can get an ecosystem to organize around you is to go after a segment where you're a big fish in that pond. We talk a lot about fish to pond ratio. You want to be... Your first pond, your target segment should be something that in the next two years, if you hit your really high growth rates, you could be 30, 40, 50% of the market share in that segment. That would cause partners to go, \"Whoa, if we're going to serve that segment, we got to work with these guys.\" So that's the key. The concept there is, \"Well, why wouldn't you also do two or three or four segments at the same time?\" It's sort of the same reason, \"Why wouldn't you run in three or four primaries at the same time if you want the presidential nomination?\" Although why you would want that nomination, I have no idea.\n\n(00:08:39):\nBut if you did, you realize if you're running in New Hampshire, votes in Vermont do not count. It's the same thing with Crossing the Chasm. You need to get three or four or five or six reputable companies in a segment to all pick you, for then the rest of the segment to go, \"Well, it's pretty obvious who the standard is.\" I'll just close with one last comment. And the reason, the mechanism behind all that logic, is that pragmatic people buy what they see their peers are buying. So if peer one is buying product A, and peer two is B and C and D, there's no market leader, and the category goes sideways. But if A, B and C, if three out of four people are using the iPhone, it's like, \"Oh, I guess I'm supposed to get an iPhone,\" that kind of thing.\n\nLenny (00:09:29):\nAwesome. I'm glad you went there, because that's essentially the root of this Crossing the Chasm idea that people after the chasm, the pragmatists, wait for references and social proof, and they're waiting for someone to tell them, \"This is worth using,\" versus visionaries right before the chasm. They're like, \"I just want to use the future. I need to be there before anyone else.\"\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:09:49):\nYou're right. One of the ways we try to capture that in a thought bubble is before the chasm, the customers you work with are people who say, \"We believe what you believe.\" So in other words, they're on the same side. After the chasm, they say, \"I'm not sure about that, but we need what you have.\" So transitioning from, \"We believe what you believe,\" which is how you sell to visionaries to, \"We need what you have,\" which is how you sell to pragmatists. That's the shift.\n\nLenny (00:10:17):\nLet's actually spend some more time there on what it is that each of these segments needs, and how you convince them to use it, because this is really useful. So in these pragmatists group, you're saying the pitch there is you have a pain. I will solve this pain, and it's important pain. I think people always assume that's the pitch. But interestingly, your point is earlier in the two segments and maybe share what those two are, they use your product for a different reason.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:10:41):\nIn fact, if there's a total in the model of the technology adoption lifecycle that we organize this all around, there's actually four, I call them, inflection points. The first one we call the early market. That's the one we were talking... That's the visionaries and the technology enthusiasts. They are as excited about you as you are. I mean, they want the demo. They want to see the vision. They're exciting. And the key to that market is to have an executive sponsor who has enough clout to essentially fund this thing, because there's no budget for you. So they've got to create the funding, and then drive the organization to go all the way to bright.\n\n(00:11:21):\nThey're not that many visionary customers, but there's always one or two. The reason why it's so important to work with a marquee customer then is you... Look, nobody's ever heard of you, and if they've never heard of your customer, I don't care how amazing the win is. Nobody's going to hear about it. So it's really important you did it with Apple, or you did it with Verizon, or you did it with Mercedes, somebody that people have heard. So that's number one, and that's a project model. Even if what you sell is a product, those early mark... Every one of them is kind of a snowflake. It needs a ton of special services. There's no ecosystem of partners to support you, so you throw a bunch of extra labor at it. You do whatever, because you got to make them successful. So you'll do whatever it takes.\n\n(00:12:13):\nOkay, very cool. Got my marquee client, not scalable business, I mean, obviously. So then the second one is the Crossing the Chasm playbook. That's the one that organizes around the problem. The good news is those customers are open to hearing from someone new, because they've already talked to everybody they already know, and the problem is still... It's not that it's unsolved. It's being solved in a crummy way and, by the way, in a deteriorating crummy way. So it's getting actually worse. So there's pressure for them to act. This is where you go from the project model to the solution model, and as a vendor, you over commit to their problem.\n\n(00:12:54):\nFrom the very beginning, you talk to them. They don't want to talk to you about you. They want to talk to you about them, and you need to ask them probing questions about them. Just like going to a doctor, you don't want the doctor to come and say, \"Hey, can I show you a movie of the operation I just did? I want to give you a demo. You mind if I give you a demo?\" It's like, \"No. What I would like to do is talk to you about this pain I have in my side.\" And then when the doctor asks you good questions about it, you go, \"Ah, this is a good doctor. I'm going to trust this.\" So that's the whole point about that. Again, that scales a lot more than a project business, but it only scales up to the limit of the target segment.\n\n(00:13:31):\nSo we had this bowling alley model of extending. You could go to a second segment, a third segment if it was adjacent. Adjacent means either it's the same customer with a different use case, or it's the same use case in a different customer base, because the one case, you use your customer references. The other case, you use your partners, because the partners who built the one use case will say, \"Well, we got another segment that we work with. Let's bring you into that segment too.\" So that can take a company from, I don't know, tens of millions of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars in the bowling alley. And in specialized industries like computer-rated design or things like that, you can actually go to a billion dollars or higher.\n\n(00:14:13):\nBut with most other categories, at some point, you have this third inflection point, which is it's when people go, \"Well, wait a minute, wifi isn't just for financial analysts, or isn't just for... Wifi is for everybody.\" So instead of saying, \"We believe what you believe,\" which we're not there anymore. And these people aren't even really saying, \"We need what you have.\" What they're saying is, \"We want what they have. This is really cool. I want what they have,\" and that creates what we call the tornado. That's when people... This is when you do want sales coverage, and you do want to go broad, and you do want to have a standard product. Basically, you want to capture as much market share as you can. There's a whole playbook around doing that, which was in a book called Inside the Tornado.\n\n(00:15:02):\nAnd then the last one, which is actually becoming much more important in this century is called Main Street, but Main Street where products have become commoditized, services become the new place of innovation. We've had taxis for 100 years, but Uber is an incredibly valuable thing. You convert the product to the service, and how do you revolutionize services? That's a situation where now people are saying, \"Look, I don't want to own the product. I don't want to own it.\" Well, kids, \"I don't want to own a car. I just want to call Uber. It's convenient.\" So anyway, those are the four models, and Crossing the Chasm was about that second one.\n\nLenny (00:15:45):\nAmazing. You touched on so many things that I want to talk about. I definitely want to dive into the bowling alley metaphor and strategy there. But to close the loop on this target audience to start with initially. First of all, you have this awesome bonfire analogy that I think might be useful to share. Then along that, is there any example or an example or two you could share of just someone that did that really well of picking a really good initial target?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:16:08):\nSure. Well, the bonfire analogy is just the tendency when you're in the chasm is, \"I just need more customers. I should take any customer I could find.\" Because we need revenue, but the analogy I have is it's like taking a match, and running it back and forth under a log. It's not going to light the log. So how do you start a fire? Well, you start it by putting a little kindling, a little crumpled up paper, and you hold the match one place until the fire starts. Then you want to build... The bowling alley metaphor is a little bit about, first of all, how could you win your first segment, but then increasingly, how would you go forward to win it? That's why adjacency is so important. If you like the fire and the piece of kindling is here, but the log is in the other room, that doesn't work. So I think those are the key ideas.\n\n(00:16:59):\nThere's a lot of people that have made Crossing the Chasm successful. The one that we wrote about first was this company called Documentum, and it's a good example. So it was a document management database back in the day that was not... that nobody had any, \"Why would you need this?\" It started with the pharmaceutical industry, because pharma said, \"Well, new drug approvals are 500,000 page documents, and they really, really, really are hard to manage, and we're screwing it up. And every day we screw it up, we lose a day of patent life of our drug, and the day of patent life's worth about a million or $2 million a day. This is a bad situation. We need to do something.\"\n\n(00:17:37):\nSo \"Okay, pharma, you got pharma.\" Great. Well, then what happened was the guys in petrochemicals said, \"Well, we're in the chemical industry. We're not in the pharmaceutical industry, but we have these standard operating manuals, and we have all these regulatory demands on us too. Not quite like the FDA, but this looks like this could be pretty useful to us too.\" And then after the petrochemicals guys got... Well, the chemical guys got it, then the petrochemical guys got it. Of course, they're oil and gas, and they say, \"Well, in addition, we have all these leases. The lease holds them. It's brilliant. This property is critical to our future plan, so we need a document database for the leases.\"\n\n(00:18:20):\nSo the guys on Wall Street who are financing these guys are going, \"Well, wait a minute. Hell, I mean, we're paper from wall to wall here. Why don't we...\" So what happens is you have this thing of this expansion, but in each case, it was into a new segment, but the use cases were close enough.\n\nLenny (00:18:36):\nSo if a startup founder is listening and trying to decide is their initial target audience, their ICP too wide, do you have any advice for how to know if this is still too wide, and you should try to get more and more narrow? I know you talk about a single use case. What else should people be thinking about there?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:18:53):\nWell, so first of all, before you try to cross the chasm, do you have a marquee? Have you won a marquee customer that puts you on the map? Because if you're not... You need to make yourself visible before you can make the Crossing the Chasm play. Let's assume you've done that. So then when we first saw, \"Well, why don't I just use that industry?\" Turns out that the visionary person you work with... First of all, they did some very weird things because they're visionaries and second of all, they don't want to help their industry. The whole point of this was they wanted to get ahead of their competitors. They didn't want to help. So normally you can't use the visionary project as your beachhead. You'd love to from a point of view of reusing the work. You just can't. So then the question becomes, \"Okay, where am I going to go?\"\n\n(00:19:41):\nSo the key formula, and this is the formula... If there's one sort of takeaway from founders listening at this point, you want to have a target segment that is big enough to matter, small enough to lead and a good fit with your crown jewels. That's the formula. So big enough to matter means do I have enough room to double or... Often venture capitalists talk about a triple double followed by a double triple. So if you said, \"Okay, let's just, I'm going to make you a million dollars.\" Put that visionary, but just to give you a number. Okay, so a double triple would be I went from one to four and from four to 12, and then I did a triple double. So that would be 12 to 24, 24 to 48, 48 to 90. Okay, so how would you get from one to a hundred million dollars?\n\n(00:20:31):\nSo you want to have a segment that says that I could get to a hundred million dollars in a five year... That was a five-year window. So you say, \"Okay, but what it can't be is a billion dollar segment.\" Because if it's a billion dollar segment, you might be able to get there, but you would not be a big fish. So that's a fish to pond ratio thing. So you want to think about, particularly as you're starting out... This is a B2B model predominantly. If I could take the top 20 customers in this segment, meaning... What do I mean by a segment? It's in the same geography. People in Japan don't talk to people in America. People in America don't talk to people in Germany, they even speak different languages. I don't know why everybody doesn't speak English, but apparently they don't. So they have to be same geography, same industry, because dentists do not talk to software designers, who don't talk to advertising people and in the same profession.\n\n(00:21:23):\nSo salespeople don't talk to finance people and finance people don't talk to the guys in the warehouse. So same industry, same geography, same profession. And then the compelling use case, which is the thing... That's the thing that starts the fire. There's segments everywhere and by the way, they all have that... They all do... Every segment works the same way. If I have to make a high risk buying decision, I'm going to talk to my peers about it. And I don't want to be first. I want to be able to do whatever the herd's doing. But what a compelling reason to buy does is it goes well, but I have to act faster than I want to. And that's what you need as an entrepreneur. You need the customer to be coming toward you even though you're new and you're unproven, and frankly you scare the crap out of them, but they're even more afraid of the problem that they're saddled with. So that's why you can build a relationship with them.\n\nLenny (00:22:19):\nAmazing. And this phase comes... You kind of imply it comes after, say you're at a million dollars AR, you don't do this sort of work of trying to cross the chasm at that point, until you reach something like that?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:22:31):\nI'm not sure AR is going to be the right reference. Here's what you need. You need a major account who's gone all in with you on the new technology and who is willing in some way to talk about it. The good news about visionaries is they tend to have fairly big egos and they tend to like to talk, unlike pragmatists who will not want to talk. Pragmatists, they'll have to go to legal and get permission and blah, blah, blah. But once you've got that, whatever your revenue is at that point, you should be starting to think about, \"Well, what is my beachhead segment?\" And the good news about Crossing the Chasm, it's not expensive.\n\n(00:23:12):\nThink about it, once you've said, I'm going to stay in one geography, in one industry, one profession, think about your marketing budget. You're not buying Super Bowl ads here. There's no sock puppets. That's not what we're doing. We want to get to maybe 200 people with a message. And then do you have the domain expertise to really understand the problem? And if it's a really compelling problem, they'll take the meeting and getting that meeting is... Because if you're an entrepreneurial founder, you're probably fairly charismatic. First of all, you've convinced your spouse that you're willing to work for no money with no benefits, and maybe you pitched a venture capitalist and you fooled them, so why can't you fool these guys? Anyway, that would be the way I would go.\n\nLenny (00:24:02):\nEssentially, the advice here is if you're a new early stage startup, one of the biggest milestones you want to aim for is a big marquee customer. When I think about this and look at a startup deck, if I see something like Figma is using this product or notion or Salesforce. Clearly, I'll be like, \"Wow, okay, these really sophisticated people decided this was useful to them.\" And so I will innately trust that. There's also often advice of don't work with big companies because they'll push you around, they'll take a long time, they'll force you to build a thing just for them and it won't apply to other people. What's your advice to avoid that downside?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:24:37):\nIt has to do with the persona of the executive sponsor. Nine out of 10 executive sponsors are going to be the negative because they're going to be a company person working with company processes. They're going to send you to purchasing, nobody's going to be happy. You're looking for the 10th one. The 10th one is one who says, \"I'm so tired of the status quo. I'm looking for people that are visionary like me. I like talking to you better than I like talking to my peers because you're different and I want to be different. I want to leapfrog the world, and these people just want to stay on the escalator. So they're staying on the escalator. God bless them, but I want to jump over the top.\" So it's a persona based choice is the key thing there.\n\nLenny (00:25:20):\nThat is really interesting. And then say that you are an early stage startup again, how soon do you think it makes sense to invest in finding that big marquee customer versus finding some smaller... I imagine you start with some startups to see how people... You don't go straight there.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:25:36):\nYes, and so initially, I think... And of course you and I are both playing, let's be clear, we're playing a software game. For example, I was trying to apply this framework to Intel, and Intel said to me, \"Geoffrey, you do understand that a prototype product in our industry costs about $500 million.\" Okay, okay, okay, okay. Maybe that's not the same model. I think in our world right now with digital transformation, most entrepreneurs are doing some software led play, which means you can work with a small team. So I think what I would advise is I would do projects. Even though I have a product vision, I would start with trying to make as much projects, which would be very customer led. And frankly, initially, even if I have a roadmap, the customer's probably going to take me off my roadmap a bit.\n\n(00:26:31):\nI'd have to be willing to say, \"I'm going to open the aperture enough.\" Because I just need to get enough experience with the technology. I need to put in people's hands. If it's a freemium play, you can do it for free. But that tends to be more of a consumer play. There are exceptions. There are B2B companies like Atlassian and things that did start as a freemium play, but that's not as normal. I would think more of the consultative play to do that. But what I would try to do, so I would try to get to cashflow break even on my own money with no venture capital. The only reason you need venture capital is if... Well, two things. Either A, the technology is too expensive and you cannot self-fund it, GPUs a bunch of that, training large language modules, those kinds of things. Or this thing is going to catch fire too soon and I don't have time to dither around for two or three years. So those are two reasons to go to venture capital, but just because you want to do a startup doesn't mean you need venture capital.\n\nLenny (00:27:35):\nWe had Jason Fried on recently the CO of Basecamp, and he made that point in many different ways. The benefits of not raising and how most VC funded companies do not work out, and even though they do, you often don't make as much as you could if you tried it to bootstrap it. So I think there's a lot of resonance there. And you have this quote that essentially kind of what you just said, that with a single round of funding, you should be able to cross the chasm and dominate a single use case in a single market within 18 to 24 months.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:28:03):\nYeah. This is like an English major doing math, so be careful because I am an English major. But in general, because again, I said it's not expensive, and by the way, you're not discounting. In other words, you're actually using value pricing because the problem you're solving is severe enough, the customer doesn't want a discount, the customer wants you to... It is like if you have to have heart surgery, you don't want a coupon that says, \"Heart surgery 9.99 this Saturday only.\" You want to go to the Mayo Clinic or you want to go to wherever, so you don't have to discount.\n\n(00:28:44):\nWhat you do have to do is you have to make almost like a guaranteed commitment to the problem to solve. We're going to take this problem off the table and we're not leaving until you're satisfied. That's the key to the game. That's a little bit weird because if you've invented ChatGPT, and now you're saying, \"But I am going to solve the third grade math problem,\" which is a real problem. But ChatGPT can do anything. I know, but we're going to solve the third grade math problem. That's hard for a lot of entrepreneurs to get their head around.\n\nLenny (00:29:23):\nIt reminds me of the way Figma started, even though it took them a long time to find product market fit and started scaling, they ended up working very closely with Coda. I don't know if you know the story where they just wanted to make sure the Coda team, and it was called Krypton back then was very happy with Figma. So they went to the office, they set them all up, they started using Figma. And then on the drive home they called him like, \"It doesn't work anymore. Something's broken.\" And they were already home. And Dylan basically, and this team drove all the way back, I think it was an hour or two, and got there and turned out the Wi-Fi was down and there was some internet issue and fixed it and just was obsessed with making sure they were using it. And they're also just fixing the most ridiculous bugs that were not important because they just wanted to make sure they were really happy with it.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:30:11):\n[inaudible 00:30:11] a larger company would say, \"Look, we'll put you in our queue and you'll be on our... We'll get to you.\" I think this is... And by the way, this is part of the fun, frankly, of being in a startup because you're so close to the action, because there's nothing between you and the action. So why wouldn't you do that?\n\nLenny (00:30:29):\nYeah, and I think one of the takeaways I've had for my own research into this is that you need to find one company that just loves you. It's not like \"[inaudible 00:30:37], this is cool.\" It's like, \"I love this product. I would never want to give it up.\"\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:30:40):\nThat's kind of what I meant by that marquee ref... We sometimes we call it a radiating reference. It's just somebody really, we talk about you when you're not even in the room. Yeah, very cool.\n\nLenny (00:30:52):\nWe've talked about this idea of the chasm and Crossing the Chasm, but it might be helpful just to explain what is the idea, what is this chasm? What is it that people fall into and why is this important?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:31:01):\nAnd this was funny, because I was working at Regis McKenna, which was this marketing agency that was sort of the premier high-tech marketing agency in the eighties. And we had all these really successful launches, and then covers of front page articles on Fortune magazine and Wall Street Journal. And then a couple of years later it's like, \"Well, what happened to these guys?\" So that's where the chasm was like... That's what caused the investigation. What we learned was visionaries make their own buying decisions, and they do not consult their peers. In fact, if their peers are doing it, they're probably not going to do it because they want to be different. So basically these companies were having success capturing the imagination of the visionary, and they thought, \"Well, I'll use the visionaries as a reference to get the pragmatist.\"\n\n(00:31:53):\nThe pragmatist looks at the visionary and goes, \"That's not my guy. First of all, he thinks I'm dumb. He thinks he's smarter than I am. Second of all, he does stuff that I would never do, and he makes decisions in a way that I would never make them. So that's not... No. So but I am interested in talking to my peers, but the problem now is, well, which of the peers are going to go first?\" And it was kind of like the junior high dance problem. How do you get the party started? So that was the chasm. That was what created the chasm. The pragmatists need references and they will not accept a visionary as a reference, and they don't have any peers that have tried it yet. So that was what was happening.\n\nLenny (00:32:35):\nI think that's such an important point that I think people don't quite always get that that reference, marques customer needs to be a pragmatist. It can't be one of these early adopters that are just trying stuff. And these other pragmatists need to feel that this is my person, this is just like me. And they love it.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:32:53):\nBy the way, one of the reasons that pragmatists have a certain... It's not contempt for visionaries, but it's definitely wariness, it's because often they have to clean up the messes that these guys leave behind because when you're a visionary, you leave a lot of messes in your wake. And then the pragmatist has to come in and clean it up. So they're going, \"Oh, that's another mark against these people.\"\n\nLenny (00:33:14):\nI saw a deck of yours where you actually represent each of these stages of the lifecycle and the visionary Steve Jobs is the way you represented it, and the pragmatists are just like business people in suits sitting at a conference table.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:33:24):\nExactly. And there's six of them. And the key idea behind that is none of us... By the way, I don't think any of these people are a guru and they don't think I'm a guru. We're using the antelope strategy, it's a herd strategy. But at some point... And by the way, we do this all the time, every one of... Airbnb, I want to get an Airbnb in Portland. Have you ever stayed [inaudible 00:33:53]? Is this a good hotel? Is this a good restaurant? Is this a good dentist? Is this a good lawyer? That's how we do it.\n\nLenny (00:33:58):\nI think Uber and Airbnb is the best example of this in action where I would not ride in a random car, especially I think women were most like, \"I will never get into a car, into an Uber.\" This is insane until all of their friends are doing it. And then, \"Okay, let's give it a shot.\"\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:34:13):\nI guess it's okay, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:34:15):\nYeah. So essentially most people were pragmatists and I guess that makes sense. And pragmatists make up the biggest chunk for it.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:34:21):\nAnd by the way, you can be a visionary with some things, a pragmatist with other things, and a conservative with other things. So the way to really think about them is, what is my persona in relation to this decision?\n\nLenny (00:34:34):\nI love this example of the junior high dance problem where nobody wants to go ask the person. It's like, \"I'm going to wait for them to come to me. I want to see how this plays out.\" It's such a good metaphor. In terms of how much of your product needs to be built at each of these stages. What advice do you share? How much do you need for these visionaries versus the next?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:34:52):\nSo with a visionary, you have to have the magic ingredient working. You don't have the whole product. And in fact, your product may be buggy, but it does something... Andy Grove used to call it the 10 x effect. You need to do something that is an order of magnitude better than anything because that's why the visionary is talking to you. They're going, \"Oh my gosh, you have this fusion.\" \"Fusion, really?\" \"Yeah, we got fusion energy.\" So that's number one. Then what would still cause you to not cross the chasm yet? If there's not enough product there, pragmatists cannot put up with a product that doesn't work. So you may need to do some additional work to say, \"Look, we get some more customers. I'm still living hand to mouth. It's mostly project work, but until the product has got enough stability and can be productized, I really can't afford to cross the chasm.\" So once you have a product that works, then you've got to say, \"Okay, now I've got to find a market where it can be the dominant solution.\" That's the time to cross the chasm.\n\nLenny (00:36:05):\nAnd a big part of that is obviously they have bosses, they have checklists, they have compliance people, they have IT people, they have people that need to buy into this or this meeting room with six people. They all have to be like, \"All right, this is the best choice.\"\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:36:18):\nAnd by the way, normally those people are designed to keep you out, and that decision process will take forever and you'll be in the welfare lines before they make their choice. So that's why it's so important to have what we call the compelling reason to buy. You need to have a group of people in a room where the leader, the guy who's going to actually sponsor make this decision is saying, \"Look, I already gave this problem to everybody in the room, and our answer sucks.\" He wouldn't say it that way, but that's the truth. And therefore, we're kind of at the... I mean, I'm getting the message. First of all, my boss's boss's boss knows my name. That's a very bad thing. Secondly, I'm getting the message, you're either going to fix this problem, Geoffrey, or we're going to find somebody who can. So that's what gives them the energy to go against the inertial momentum of the decision-making process in their company.\n\nLenny (00:37:15):\nLet me tell you about a product called arcade. Arcade is an interactive demo platform that enables teams to create polished on-brand demos in minutes, telling the story of your product is hard, and customers want you to show them your product, not just talk about it or gate it. That's why product four teams such as Atlassian, Carta, and Retool use Arcade to tell better stories within their homepages, product change logs, emails, and documentation. But don't just take my word for it. Quantum Metric, the leading digital analytics platform created an interactive product tour our library to drive more prospects. With Arcade, they achieved a two x higher conversion rate for demos and saw five times more engagement than videos.\n\n(00:37:57):\nOn top of that, they built the demo 10 times faster than before. Creating a product demo has never been easier. With browser-based recording Arcade is the no-code solution for building personalized demos at scale. Arcade offers product customization options, designer approved editing tools and rich insights about how your viewers engage every step of the way. Ready to tell more engaging product stories that drive results? Head to arcade.software/lenny and get 50% off your first three months. That's arcade.software/lenny.\n\n(00:38:30):\nSo April Dunford was on this podcast and she has this book that she put out recently called Sales Pitch. And she make this point that buying software, SaaS software is harder than selling it these days because you can get fired for buying the wrong thing. It's so stressful. There's all these options. Your boss has to be happy with it. So often people end up just not going with anything. We're just going to keep what we have. It's fine, simpler, safer. Salesforce is fine. And it sounds like that's kind of what you're describing. It's so hard-\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:38:58):\nSo if you're a pragmatist, the first thing is if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Which makes you totally different than a visionary. A visionary's like, \"Yeah, no, come on, break it. Come on, let's move on.\" It ain't broke, don't fix it. If it is broke, who has fixed it? Is there fix in production? Does the fix work? I want that. In other words, basically to April's point, it is a risk reduction buying strategy. And by the way, you go as slowly as you can normally, but when you're under duress, you have to go faster. So the compelling reason to buy is putting you under duress.\n\nLenny (00:39:41):\nAre there any examples of these compelling reasons to buy that come to mind that give people a sense of here's a really good compelling reason to buy? I don't know if it's a pitch.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:39:48):\nWell, there's a ton. Well, how about ransomware? I mean, all of a sudden the cybersecurity thing is like holy smoke because it used to be, \"Well, they wouldn't attack my company. Or if they did, I mean, I have no assets.\" Yeah, well, actually... Because it used to be what they did is they would only attack companies that had data that they could resell in the dark web. Then God bless cryptocurrency, people are saying, \"Is it cross the chasm yet? Well, their first use case is criminals.\" It's not a very good use case, I'm sorry to say. But the point is, now ransomware with cryptocurrency can be a monetization, so that means everybody is vulnerable. So that's one kind of compelling reason to buy. But if you look around kids who are struggling with school, the parent has a compelling reason. Anything with healthcare, compelling reason to buy. Anything if you're in a legal problem, you have a compelling risk to buy.\n\n(00:40:48):\nSo I mean, there's always these situations where you say, \"Okay, that's on a personal basis.\" On a company-wide basis, it may be things like, \"Well, what am I supposed to do my office space? Can I get my company to come back to the office or do I have to dump the space? What am I supposed to do? And by the way, I know I'm going to have some kind of space, but do I want to design it the way we used? I'm getting into some space by the way, I got a great deal if it was a fire sale, right? Cool space, what do I put in it? Is it supposed to have offices? Do they have doors, do they not have doors do?\" So in other words, there's a bunch of stuff where you get people going, \"Okay, how can we help? How can we help?\" \"I need help. And I've gone to my standard solutions and no, I don't believe that, so I need help.\"\n\nLenny (00:41:37):\nOkay, so it's interesting that I even misunderstood what you're saying and I think this is a really important point. The compelling reason to buy is not a compelling reason to sell, which people often think about as the pitch you're making. The buy is basically the pain point. They need a really big pain.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:41:51):\nYeah, because that's what's going to... So therefore the key to the bowling alley that's different from the tornado, and it's also different from the early market. In the early market it's about you. You tell the story about you and the visionary wants to hear about you. In the tornado it's also about you, because we now have budget to buy this stuff, and you're a candidate. In the bowling alley, it's never about you. And that is so hard for a series of entrepreneurs because they want to give a demo, they want to tell the story, they want to share their vision. The answer is, \"We don't care. We don't want to hear your story. We hate demos, and I don't know who you are and I don't care. I'm in trouble. We need to talk about me. We don't want to talk about you.\"\n\n(00:42:35):\nSo we have this saying in the Crossing the Chasm playbook. First of all, \"Shut the God damn laptop. Just don't open it and start with...\" And the way you start the conversation is always the same. \"We're here because we've been working with some people in your industry and we understand there's this really serious problem around document management or around Wi-Fi access or whatever it is, and we believe that your company might have it, is that true?\" And what's interesting about it is you'll get one of two responses either, \"Oh, are you kidding me? Okay, we have that.\" Or often they'll say, \"Well, not exactly.\" And you go, \"Oh,\" but then before you can say anything else they'll say, \"What our real problem is...\" So people will talk about their... They want therapy, they'll talk about their problems. So if you're willing to... But as an entrepreneur, you got to realize the gold at this point is problem domain knowledge. That's the thing you really want to collect.\n\nLenny (00:43:45):\nAmazing. So you've sort of answered this question, but I want to make it even more complete. You have this amazing LinkedIn post of these four go-to-market playbooks based on the stage you're in. And you've touched on this already, but it might be helpful just to go through it one by one. And even more helpful would be like, what does it look like when you're in the early market? How do you know if you're in the early market versus in the bowling alley versus in the tornado?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:44:08):\nOkay, so in the early market, you know you're there because first of all, the story is the technology, and it's specifically the disruptive technology. By the way, you could start a business with a non-disruptive thing, but then you don't need these playbooks, then you're on Main Street. So the assumption is you've got something that nobody's ever done before or seen before. So in that playbook, the first thing is just you hear the responsibilities. And a venture capitalist would say the same thing to you. \"Do you have a technology expert who's a wizard? Because we're not going to fund just any two guys and a PowerPoint tech, even though we like your dog.\"\n\n(00:44:50):\nSo that's number one. Number two, \"Can you demo the technology?\" You have to be able to demo thing. And then three, \"Can you create a vision which says what forces are going to release?\" And the concept that we use in venture, I call it trapped value. And with the idea is where's the trap value that this innovation would release? Because when you release trapped value, the world will give you a portion of the gain, typically 10%. It's easy an number to do math with. As I said, I'm an English major. So if you want a billion-dollar company, you better find $10 billion worth of trapped value that your technology could- [inaudible 00:45:30]\n\nLenny (00:45:30):\nAirbnb is an amazing example of that, right? Where they unlocked people's homes, basically 10%-\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:45:36):\nYeah. Uber unlocked their backseat of the car. By the way, the free labor force, it was like, \"Whoa.\" Okay, so really cool idea early market fund. For the bowling alley one then the playbook is, \"No, where's the problem?\" And then you got to take it down to in what geography, what industry, what profession, what use case. And that takes... That's not just... I mean, you want to spend some time in doing that. And then what you want to really do is just maintain intellectual curiosity about the problem as opposed to jumping to the solution. So why is this a hard problem to do? What is going on? Where is the trapped value? By the way, how expensive? What is the cost of not solving this problem?\n\n(00:46:24):\nOften it's a risk exposure, or it could be just a gating item on your growth or potentially a churn problem. By the way, if you wanted to pick a compelling reason to buy, how about if you help SaaS companies deal with churn? Do you think they would care about that? I think they might. So the point being... And you're going to say, \"Okay, I'm going to learn more about churn and I'm going to really understand... And by the way, I'm going to understand your churn,\" which is different maybe from somebody else's churn. So it's the problem domain thing. And then you build your go-to market around... The lead gen is, \"Hey, do you have any of these seven symptoms of fatal churn?\" And the people that respond to that ad are pre-qualified. And then the BDR, if you're at Salesforce, a BDR would call you and say, \"Just confirming you have these problems.\" \"Oh yeah, RBI.\" \"And your role at the company is... And are you responsible for doing this?\" \"Well, actually no, it's Harry, not Mary.\" \"Maybe we should talk to Harry.\" \"Yeah, you probably should talk to Harry.\"\n\n(00:47:32):\nThen you call Harry and you get the appointment with Harry because Harry's got the problem. And then the next thing is you do a diagnostic with them. \"So we understand we're talking to your colleagues, here's the problem, here's what we think we're doing. But before we tell you about how great our solution is, let's make sure that we understand what your challenges are.\" And your goal in that call is to get them to talk as much as possible and for you to take notes. And by the way, this is a place where you probably still want to remember to use a pen because you actually want them to see you writing down their words, because that means, \"Okay, he's listening. He's listening.\"\n\nLenny (00:48:14):\nOh, interesting. That's a good tip. Like on Zoom, would your advice there be just make sure the camera shows your hands?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:48:19):\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:48:22):\nOkay. Lean in. Yeah, yeah.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:48:23):\nOr sometimes... I mean, no, you couldn't do this. I was going to say we record it, but they don't want to record it because they're going to say some things during the call that they won't be necessarily complimentary to all their colleagues and they don't want you to record it.\n\nLenny (00:48:38):\nGot it. So in this bowling alley phase, how do you know you... I know it's not like this binary switch, but that you're ready to move into that versus the early market playbook.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:48:50):\nWell, I think you get to a point where you realize, \"I can't scale my business doing what I've been doing. I mean, I just can't.\" And if you've taken venture capital, the thing you want to do is, \"I don't want to have to raise another...\" Well, so understand how venture capital funding works for a second. This is important. A venture capitalist gives you money, and what they're buying from you with this money is, \"I want you to use this money to change the state of your company such that when we raise the next round, the next investor will value your company two to three times higher than we're valuing it today.\"\n\n(00:49:30):\nSo basically the purpose of this money is to change the value state of your company. If you do anything else with that money, you could have done brilliant things, created amazing demos, hired great people, but if at the end of the day you haven't changed the value state of the company and we have to raise more money, we're going to raise it at the old valuation and I as an investor lose, or even worse, we have a down round and I lose even more.\n\n(00:49:58):\nSo once you start thinking about that, so we're then Crossing the Chasm. The Crossing the Chasm play is I need to change the state of my company from a cool possibility to what accountants call a going concern. So what is a going concern? A going concern is a company that two years from now you would expect still to be in existence. Why would you do that? Because they have a customer base that's loyal and they have a ecosystem of partners that bring them into new deals and they have established their CAC and LTV, and they've kind of figured out their operating model. And it's not the biggest company in the world.\n\n(00:50:38):\nIt's somewhere we're now probably in the 10, $20 million, but it's a real company. It's a real company. And that's who you're trying to create when you cross the chasm. And you know you've crossed the chasm when you say, \"I don't have to raise any more venture capital. Now, I may want to because I have ambitions to be globally dominant.\" But you get to raise it on your nickel and on your timeline, not on, \"Oh my God, I'm running out of money.\" So the sooner you can get off with the, \"I'm running out...\" And particularly last year was fatal to a huge number of companies because that was not how they were thinking about raising funds. They always thought, \"Well, there'll be another round, another round, another round.\" And they were not thinking about changing their valuation state and they're not here.\n\nLenny (00:51:26):\nThat's a really interesting insight. This idea that you know you've crossed the chasm if you can survive without more venture funding, how do you think about that, the profit element of that? Because it feels like that's the core to being able to survive without venture funding. Is it about making enough money that you can cut and make a profit, or is there some other reason?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:51:47):\nAll you really care about is cashflow positive. I just want to be able to keep doing what I'm doing. So you don't care about the actual GAAP accounting at all.\n\nLenny (00:52:01):\nI see. So you could cut back and you can get to profitability if you need, but the idea is your cashflow positive?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:52:08):\nAnd you'd like to grow and you might want to raise money. But the point is, if you do go out to raise money, you get to raise money at a different valuation. So the way in which venture capitalists categorize you is they say, \"What risk is my money going to take off the table?\" So an angel investor says, \"Well, my money is going to take off the table, the risk of whether you can even create anything, I'm going to give you enough money to get into trouble.\" That's basically it. And then the Crossing the Chasm money says, \"I'm going to take company existence viability off the table. I don't know if you're going to grow, I don't know if you're going to become a venture return, but I'm going to take you going out of business off the table.\"\n\n(00:52:48):\nAnd then the bowling alley stuff is, \"Okay, now I'm buying probably a journey from 10 million to a hundred million dollars,\" something like that. \"And I'm expecting a growth rate,\" and this is probably where the rule of 40 starts to kick in. If you're playing the rule of 40, we want to raise more money later on, you're going to have a different valuation than we had before. And then the tornado thing by that point, now you say, \"You're in Gen AI? You have a large language module? Whoa, okay. You're worth a lot more than we thought,\" because now the category's in the tornado and that's a different game.\n\nLenny (00:53:29):\nYeah. I was going to say AI is clearly an example of being in tornado. So maybe just talk a little bit about what that is, the tornado phase and then there's the Main Street playbook.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:53:39):\nSo how do you know the difference between the bowling alley and the tornado? Prior to the tornado, when your sales team calls on the customer, they do not have a budget for you. In the early market, there's no budget for anything. In the bowling alley there's budget, but it's budget for a solution that's not you. It's for the old way of trying to bandaid the problem. So we say in the early market, you have to create budget. In the bowling alley, you have to redirect budget, but that takes sales cycles. It takes time. And if it's a small market... This is why entrepreneurs can win these market segments, because if you're a big established company, this is just a pain in the ass. It's too small a market, it's too much work, it's too hard. Redirecting the... I want my salespeople to go where the budget's already established.\n\n(00:54:28):\nWell, when does budget get established? When a category goes horizontal and people go, \"Well, yeah, we all want Wi-Fi, we all want mobile apps, we all want cloud computing, we all want whatever it is.\" And now what happens is... And by the way the pragmatist heard is they went from, \"You're not doing that, are you?\" \"No, me neither.\" \"Okay, good.\" To, \"You are, you are, you are. Oh, we're behind. We better do it.\" So these budgets come into the market and kind of all at the same time, which is what creates the tornado. Because if you give a department a budget, they will spend it and when they spend it, they're going to spend it with a vendor and whoever vendor they select they're probably going to stay with. So now the market share battle is now on, and whoever gets the most customers early on, the ecosystem starts to form around them.\n\n(00:55:23):\nSo in the nineties, we saw a lot of tornado, gorilla play. Cisco, Intel, Oracle, obviously Microsoft. I mean these companies, [inaudible 00:55:36], they were all incredibly competitive companies. They were all tornado plays. Between client server and the internet, it just created this massive tornado effect. And that game plan is very competitive sales to grab market share. And then at some point, if you're not number one, then you have to kind of do a defensive maneuver and retreat into a niche and say, \"Okay, if I can't be a gorilla, I at least need to be a chimp.\" And a chimp is like a local gorilla. \"I'm not the gorilla, but...\" \"I'm not Cisco, I'm Juniper.\" But for telcos, Juniper was the Cisco of telcos at that time. So anyway, I don't know if you saw in the paper today, but at the other end of that lifecycle, HPE has bought Juniper.\n\nLenny (00:56:28):\n[inaudible 00:56:28] is happening. I like that. That's good news. So one of the most interesting lessons you teach is also that these playbooks don't work together well. Basically if you use one in the wrong phase, it's the opposite. It has the opposite effect. So before we get there, let me just summarize maybe quickly the playbook in each of these four. I have some notes here and then maybe just talk about why is it that they fail if you pick the wrong one. So in the early market, you're looking for a visionary customer that just wants to use something new and cool and stay ahead of the curve. In the bowling alley phase, you want to engage with a pragmatic business person who has a huge problem and they need a fix and you're there for them. In the tornado, there's just this land grab, something is just going crazy, AI and everyone's just spend, spend, I need AI in my product. And then Main Street is just, it's kind of the sustaining tech that everyone just needs to make sure continues working and doesn't deteriorate.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:57:23):\nBy the way, the way I would [inaudible 00:57:25] the last two is think of tornado as kind of the land and Main Street as the expand. I mean, that's not a bad way to think about the two as well. Yeah, you got it. You got it.\n\nLenny (00:57:35):\nOkay, great. So why is it that these undercut each other if you're trying to use either the one in the wrong phase or use both?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:57:42):\nWell, so let's start with classic sales 101 from the nineties. Qualify the customer on budget before you make a sales call. That absolutely is critical on Main Street. I mean it's critical on the tornado, it's dumb on Main Street because obviously they have budget, they've got budgets that even has your name on it if you can go get it. But it's a big mistake in the early market or in the bowling alley because they don't have budget. So you're not going to get it. And the way you win in the early market is with a project model and the way you win in the bowling alley is with a solution model.\n\n(00:58:17):\nAnd the problem is if you bring a project model to the bowling alley, the problem is you won't scale because it won't be repeatable. The ecosystem won't form around you. And if you bring a solution model to the early market, it's like you're over investing in one thing. The visionary's saying, \"Well, yeah, but I have so many other things I want to do.\" So they're going to want to take you way off your solution roadmap. So each one of these things, the market dynamics call for a very clear response. It's not hard to see the response. What people struggle with is, I have been successful with this playbook, the market has moved to the next phase, but I'm really good at the old playbook, so I want to stay with the playbook I'm good at. So that's when they get in trouble.\n\nLenny (00:59:05):\nSo I think that's extra reason to pay close attention to which phase you're in and that you're practicing the correct playbook. We've talked about AI a little bit, and I don't want to get too far down this road, but I guess is there any advice you would share for an AI startup in being in this tornado or a company looking to integrate AI? Is there anything that you've seen of just make sure you're doing this right?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:59:26):\nWell, it's interesting about... And particularly right now, I mean the thing that's caught everybody's imagination is generative AI. So we should be thinking about things like open AI with Microsoft and Co-pilot and those kinds of things. Well, maybe not. It depends on what... So from a customer's point of view, there's AI in the early market, there's AI in the bowling alley, there's AI in the chasm, there's AI in the tornado, and there's AI on Main Street. So I mean, I would argue if you go to Microsoft Copilot, you're on Main Street, you're not taking any risk, you're experimenting with a new thing. It's kind of cool, makes you more productive. God bless. It's kind of like just an add-on to Teams or to your whole Office 365 suite. Stuff that's in the tornado right now, I don't know. I'm trying to think about what is the use case for Gen AI? I'm not sure there is one in the tornado, but the closest I would say is Salesforce is probably close enough.\n\n(01:00:23):\nThey have a sales co-pilot. They have a services copilot, right? I'm sure there marketing co-pilot. So you're going, but we're going to change our sales motion and we're going to use generative AI in line, in our performance on a very widespread, across our entire base. So all our salespeople are going to use this new tool. That would be okay. And that makes sense because the new tool... First of all, Salesforce has their own large language module. So it's not like you're going out to the open AI world and having all those issues. So you can do it and there's a very high productivity return at a modest risk, I think, and modest disruption. For the bowling alley you'd say, I don't know if this is bowling alley or early market, I'll say it's bowling alley.\n\n(01:01:18):\nSo if you're Sal Khan and you have the Khan Academy and you're saying, \"Look, we want to provide educational resources for the world for young people.\" The problem with education right now is that particularly after the pandemic, you're a teacher you used to have... When you were a teacher in say K through 12, K through eight, you have a class of 30 kids and probably 10 to 15 of them are middle of the road and some number are actually significantly ahead and some number are behind. And your job as a teacher is to kind of work with that. Well, after the pandemic, you might have five different grade levels in the same classroom, not three or six even. That's an impossible problem. But if you said, \"Look, we can use Gen AI tutoring and we can tune it to each one of those sixth grade levels.\"\n\n(01:02:09):\nNow that's a teacher co-pilot, but that's a really specialized idea. So you go, \"Well, that's amazing.\" And then if you wanted to go to the other side, \"You say all these ad agencies say they do this really cool advertising, but I think I can do it myself with Gen AI and I'm going to sell it to other people.\" I mean, you can imagine a whole businesses that say we write legal opinions and we always start with Gen AI. We don't ship Gen AI, there's a human in the loop. We're going to do amazing or more images, maybe. We're going to design visual images with all the really cool stuff you could do. We're going to invent a new agency or a new kind of agency we're going to charge to...\" I don't know what it would be, but the point is Gen AI I think can be absorbed by the marketplace at multiple places.\n\nLenny (01:03:02):\nAs you were talking about that lawyer example, I was thinking part of the pitch would be... And it's also a lot cheaper, but that reminds me of this other post that you wrote, The Seven Deadly Sins of Crossing the Chasm. And I wanted to chat about some of these, and one of them is discounting before you cross the chasm. Can you talk about why that's something you want to avoid?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:03:20):\nBack to that issue about, \"Heart surgery 9.99, this Saturday only bring a coupon.\" I mean, the discounting model makes sense when something's commoditized or the let's even do the freemium model. The freemium model makes sense if there is no risk in adopting the offer. But chasms are based on risk bearing decisions. Basically that's the problem that creates the chasm. I have to make a risk bearing buying decision. So discounting does not reduce risk. In fact, it might even increase risk because this vendor might say, \"Well, yeah, I'll give you a better price, but now I'm not going to give you the extra support or we'll have a change of scope.\" We'll say, \"Yes, but now, that wasn't in the contract. So you have to add more.\" And all of that is fair game on Main Street, but it's not for crossing the chasm.\n\nLenny (01:04:21):\nI'm going to pick on a couple of these other sims that you mentioned. One is you call the target customer mix up. Can you talk about that?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:04:29):\nThe key to this whole Crossing the Chasm playbook is start with the world. Don't start with... Well, the question we're trying to answer is where is a small pool of trapped value that we can become our pool? So that's why we have geography, profession, use case. We're just trying to get big enough to matter, but small enough to lead is one. And then once you find that pool, the question you have to say is, \"Who controls access to that? Who's going to sponsor my deal in order for me to solve that, to release that trapped value for that company?\" That's your target customer. And you may not know them. Typically, my experience is you probably have worked with at least one company in the industry at some point along the line. It's kind of odd if you just had never heard of the industry and you picked that one.\n\n(01:05:24):\nUsually that's why I said, \"Well, maybe I should have added that to how do you know you're ready to cross the chasm?\" You should at least have a hunch. You should at least, \"We've done this work, and I think this is the one.\" Now, you still have to go validate it and make it happen. But basically the way you would validate it is rather than try to go to a research or do something, that won't work. You say, \"Well, we're going to run a marketing campaign, a modest one. I'm going to see if I can't get two more of the same use case. I'm willing to bet the next three months of my company by saying in this three months, all we're going to do is try to get two more deals that have this pattern.\" And that would be kind of the way you might go after it.\n\nLenny (01:06:10):\nSo I think this is worth spending a little more time on this idea of how you know you're ready to cross the chasm. So one is you find one very excited marquee customer, then you're sharing, maybe find a couple more and see if it's actually starting to roll and tip.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:06:26):\nNo. Well, I said it wrong. So the marquee customer is probably not in your beachhead market. The marquee customer is a famous company that you have the visionary sponsor. That's the thing, because that's the company that the business press wanted to write about, or the tech press wanted to write about. People went, \"Oh, you were the guys who...\" You're like Hans Solo. You did whatever that run was in 15 parsecs. I can't even remember what it was. But that's your claim to fame. It's your claim to fame. But the Crossing the Chasm one is, \"Oh...\" And by the way the press is not interested in the crossing chasm, but the local, if there was a local press, they'd be all over it.\n\nLenny (01:07:08):\nThe Kessel Run.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:07:11):\nThe Kessel Run. Thank you. The Kessel Run in 15 parsecs. Thank you.\n\nLenny (01:07:13):\nThat's right.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:07:14):\nExactly. That was his visionary thing.\n\nLenny (01:07:16):\nSo I think the important takeaway there is there's always this advice of talk to customers, make sure they're happy, build what... Not necessarily build what they want, but make sure you're understanding what they need. But I think when your most important insights here is make sure you're talking to the right people. Which are essentially people in the next stage, essentially of the adoption life cycle. The more pragmatists.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:07:35):\nYes. And they have to be the... I think you need to talk to the economic buyer as opposed to the end user, because the end user will be saying, \"Oh, yeah, you're right. Oh, it's just terrible and we're oppressed.\" But if their boss doesn't want to sponsor it, it doesn't work.\n\nLenny (01:07:51):\nWhich is hard, hard often when you're building B2B software, you just don't make it great. And then it's like, \"Oh, these people don't actually care what they're buying it. They just have all these check boxes.\" And then another deadly sin, which you've touched on, but I think it might be worth sharing again, is just this idea, you call it the compelling reason, confusion, where instead of thinking about your compelling reason to sell, you think about what is the pain point you're solving, compelling reason to buy.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:08:16):\nObviously as an entrepreneur, you have a compelling reason to sell. But what they tend to do is in trying to cross the chasm, if they're not using this approach, they think, \"Well, I haven't made my product attractive enough.\" So then they'd say, \"Well, I'm going to make a sexier demo, or I'm going to change my deck. I'm going to write a new...\" And the sales guy comes back, says, \"I had a great presentation. This is the deck that we ought to be using.\" And that's all about compelling ways to sell, not compelling reasons to buy. And the pragmatist, by the way... And by the way, the practice will take the meeting. One of the problems with the chasm is they don't say no. They just never say yes. And they actually encourage you... \"You should come back again with this too. This is really interesting.\" Yeah, it is really interesting.\n\nLenny (01:09:09):\nKind of along those lines, positioning, how important is that, and any advice on figuring out your positioning when you're doing this? I know you talk a lot about making sure you focus on their pain point, but at some point you're like, \"Here's what we're doing for you.\"\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:09:22):\nOne of the nice things about Crossing the Chasm is the positioning formula is absolutely the same every time. It's really cool. So basically when you're thinking about positioning, you're saying, \"Look, I'm going with this use case in this particular segment.\" So they have an incumbent vendor. The advantage of the incumbent vendor is they understand the business, but they don't have the new technology. Conversely, you have technology competitors who have as good technology, maybe a better technology than you have, but they're not committed to this domain expertise of this thing.\n\n(01:09:56):\nSo your positioning is, \"We are the technology leaders who have specialized and committed to solve this problem. And by the way, we have huge respect for your incumbent vendor. We're not asking you to kick them out. They just can't solve this problem. We also have respect for our peers, but frankly, they wouldn't know your problem if they wouldn't recognize it in a lineup. We are here, and by the way, if anybody comes into our quadrant, we're going to kick their ass. We are going to be beyond compare. Nobody is going to handle this problem with this kind of technology the way we will, and that's our claim of fame. That's what we're going to do, and that's our positioning.\"\n\nLenny (01:10:36):\nI love that. Say you're building a product led growth company, a bottom up oriented B2B SaaS company. Is there anything that changes in your advice?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:10:46):\nYeah, if you're going to use a volume ups approach like Atlassian or anything grows up from the bottom up, you're playing a different game. First of all, you're playing... Because you attract the end user before you attract the economic buyer. So you have some version of a freemium strategy, that's what you're going to do. And Yammer did this, right? And eventually got bought by Microsoft. So the way you play that game is, first of all, you probably do need some funding, not necessarily, maybe you can do this all on AWS and a credit card. But the game that is going to be, how do I create that moment of criticality? What you would do is you'd say... First of all, you need telemetry. So you need to figure out what are the people really doing with our product? And then you need to find a way to communicate with them to see if you can ferret out, is there a compelling reason to buy thing in their environment? So it'd be a different way of doing early market.\n\n(01:11:52):\nYou would not have a marquee client, but to cross the chasm... You cannot cross the chasm of product-led growth, you can't because it is like saying, \"Well, yeah, I'm going to cure Covid by just putting vaccines out in public places.\" It's like, \"No, people need to learn more. No.\" So you'd have to do that. Where product-led growth plays really interestingly, is in the land and expand phases of the market. If you can land with a hot product, but more importantly, product-led growth, which is really good at is expand because it prompts the user to get more involved. And that's classically a Main Street play. But there's got to be no risk. That product-led growth works when basically the extended the next purchase has very low risk, and therefore you're not really dealing with chasms.\n\nLenny (01:12:53):\nThat is incredibly interesting. Interestingly, every product led growth company ends up building a sales team, 100% of them, including Atlassian, which had product led growth for a long time. And I don't know if anyone's heard this perspective on it, that if you really want to cross the gap... I imagine it happens in some form of-\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:13:12):\nWell, and here's the thing. The reason they build a sales team eventually is they need to get enterprise deals. And obviously you need a sales team to get enterprise deals. And one of the mistakes you could make is hiring an enterprise salesperson when you're trying to cross the chasm. Enterprise salespeople are not good chasm crossers because they're used to doing horizontal coverage model. This is like no, domain expert narrow model. You want somebody that looks more like a sales engineer than a salesperson. You want somebody very diagnostic, very committed to the integrity of the problem solution framework. So it's just different.\n\nLenny (01:13:54):\nOkay. Just a couple more questions. You had this very public exchange with Martin Casado, he's a partner at Andreessen Horowitz. And just to summarize briefly, essentially he was arguing that I think some people believe once you've crossed the chasm, life's good. It's all downhill. People are going to start pulling your product out of you. It's going to be so easy. And his argument is he doesn't see that, it's endless pain and suffering and hardships. And I know you went back and forth trying to correct this, but what's a way to think about what happens?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:14:25):\nSo actually, Martin and I had a couple of this... By the way, his biggest point... I'll come back to your point in a second, but his biggest point is, \"Jeff...\" The venture community at least, and certainly Andreessen Horowitz doesn't deal with the level of granularity of Crossing the Chasm anymore. There's too much money that wants to be put to work. By the way, there's so much software already out there that the notion that your software is going to be that disruptive is increasingly improbable because you're not standing on the shoulders of giants, you're standing on the shoulders of people standing on the shoulders of people standing on the shoulders of people standing on the shoulders of giants. So he was making a bunch of those points, which I thought were pretty interesting. But his other point about, does life ever become easy? No, life never becomes easy. The problems change.\n\n(01:15:17):\nThe challenge with software is... Well, there's a lot of challenges with it, but software that people use, the application software, we all have different minds. We all have different contexts. To make a product that would work, that would solve what I want and solve what you want and solve what the listener wants. I mean, the margin, no. We're going to have different expectations. So there's always... And then of course there's competition, and then there's funding, and then there's technological shifts, and just about the time it really works well, they say, \"No, we got to put it... No, no, no. You put it in the data center. We got to put it in the cloud.\" \"Oh, no, no, you got in the cloud, you got to put it in Kubernetes.\" \"Oh, no, no, no. You don't understand. It's edge AI, it's not cloud.\" It just goes on and on and on. So I think if you're going to play this game, you got to be up for... Yeah, there's going to be a new headache every week.\n\nLenny (01:16:17):\nThat's exactly how I see it. I always tell founders, you shouldn't start a company unless you can't not start a company.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:16:23):\nYes. By the way, why did I leave? [inaudible 01:16:28] County was a great place to be, but I had to do my own thing.\n\nLenny (01:16:32):\nAnd that's a real pull. Kind of along the lines of something you just shared, maybe a final question. Is there something you've changed your mind about or something you've evolved your thinking on recently? Either from the beginning of the book or just even more recent?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:16:47):\nI think what I realized over time increasingly was this is a model that's really optimized for B2B markets, because it implies federated decision making around high risk buying decisions. I would say for the 20th century, that was 95% of tech. But what was so interesting about the change in the century... Because remember right at the change of the century, B2B tech went in the tank, the tech bubble just... Because everybody was afraid of the Y2K problem. So they did a whole bunch of buying up of software, and then there was a year where they think, \"Well, we ate more than we could at Thanksgiving dinner. We're not interested in eating another burger here. \"So the market went in the tank. By the way at that point, venture started saying, \"Well, maybe we should be investing in biotech, or maybe we should doing clean tech.\" Venture stepped back from the table too.\n\n(01:17:46):\nBut out of this, consumer computing came out of nowhere. And for my generation, it was unimaginable. The first time I heard about Google and they said, \"We're going to save every search argument.\" I thought, \"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. They're not going to be able to afford it.\" But their model was, \"We are rethinking this thing from the ground up. Geoffrey, you have no idea what we're doing.\" And boy were they right. So the point was when that came in, then consumer computing and then the iPhone hits, and then we have mobile apps. You have a world now where the B2C play can actually be the core of innovation. It used to be B2C was an afterthought. Now it's like, \"No, no, no, no, B2B might be the afterthought.\" So it's completely different... And the whole digital transformation of the universe, and we're still living through the digital transformation 20 years in, and I don't think Crossing the Chasm is designed for that problem. So that's a different problem.\n\nLenny (01:18:48):\nSo basically, if you're building a consumer app, don't spend time studying Crossing the Chasm.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:18:53):\nYeah, if you're doing B2B, this is the most reliable playbook. It's still on... People are still into this playbook 30 years in. So it's obviously... The playbook kind of works.\n\nLenny (01:19:05):\nI said this earlier, I feel like people are just reinventing many of the things you uncovered 30 years ago. Everyone's like, \"Oh yeah, target audience, really important, or finding a marque customer.\" So I'm really happy that we spent this time digging into many of your theories.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:19:22):\nWell, Lenny, thank you for being... You've been a really great prompter and questioner, so thank you very, very much.\n\nLenny (01:19:28):\nI really, really appreciate that. Is there anything you want to leave listeners with as a final thought or piece of advice or just anything?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:19:35):\nLook, I don't know if anybody's reading the paper recently, but the world's not exactly nailing it right now. There's a lot of stuff going on that we could do a lot better, and software enabled technology is almost certainly at the core of any solution that scales to any world problem that matters. I think it's more important to be an entrepreneur now than maybe ever. I wouldn't make becoming a billionaire my goal. Frankly, I don't even know what a billionaire would even do with their money. I don't even how to even imagine their money. That's a thousand million dollars. It doesn't make any sense, but what does make sense? But what does make sense is to... I'm happy to get two... Do I know what to do with 10 million? Yeah. Could I do 20? Probably. Could I use a hundred? Probably not. But at some point, I want people to make yourself a great living, make yourself... But after that, have an impact. If you're gifted enough to be able to start a software company and do something original, you're a scarce resource, so don't waste it.\n\nLenny (01:20:42):\nAmazing. I'm going to sneak it one more question along these same lines actually. Your last book is very unlike all your other books. It's called The Infinite Staircase, which is essentially a guide to living a good life and a meaningful life. Is there maybe one piece of advice you could share with folks of just how to live a better life, a more meaningful life, happier life?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:21:00):\nThe purpose of that book was twofold. One was... So I was looking around... And this is an American sort of experience between social media and the politicians or whatever. Our ability to defend traditional values is becoming increasingly challenging. And historically, you say, \"Well, religion was sort of the place where the foundation for solidifying traditional values.\" But in my lifetime, the counter explanation of how we got here, other than being created by a creator, this whole the Big Bang and the Darwinian model, it's becoming increasingly credible and I'm fascinated by it. So the question I had in the back of my mind is how could you take that model and still support traditional ethics?\n\n(01:21:53):\nSo the first part was, well, what's the model? It turns out to explain getting from the Big Bang to Lenny and Geoffrey talking on this podcast, there's a lot of steps you've got to go through. But there's a whole thing about complexity and how complexity emerges in layers and the staircase is a series of layers, and the first two thirds of the book takes 11 stairs. That gets you from physics to theory. And it's like, really? Yeah, yeah. From a cloud of atoms to us talking about Crossing the Chasm, 11 steps, we can get you there. It's kind of fun. It's assembling the last 25 years of my reading. It's fascinating stuff. All these different topics, and I was just trying to knit it together. No original research. I was just literally just trying to get the story together.\n\n(01:22:41):\nBut then the last third was, okay, that's a very reasonable narrative. It's maybe even more reasonable than religious narratives, but now how do you validate ethical action and where does it come from? So the last part was about, okay, how do you do that? How does it derive from that creation story? The secular creation stories were. So that was what was important. At the end of the day, I think the message of that book is just, you really do need to do good, but it's not because you're obeying... In this framework, it's not because you're a bang a divine creator. It's because we're mammals and mammals nurture their young, and we were gifted with unconditional love when we were born because otherwise, you and I could not be here. I mean, a 1-year-old cannot... If somebody doesn't love the hell out of a 1-year-old, they're not going to be two. So we know where we started. So come on, those values were built into us. They don't have to come from above. They can come from below, and therefore, how can you integrate them into your life? And that was where the book... Anyway.\n\nLenny (01:23:53):\nThat is a beautiful message to end on. I promised I'd get you out of here in one minute. Just to let people know, you do speaking, you do consulting, where can people find you online if they want to reach out and- [inaudible 01:24:05]\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:24:05):\nLinkedIn. Yeah, I'm on LinkedIn and I have a blog on LinkedIn. And if these topics are interesting to you, you'd probably be interested in the blog.\n\nLenny (01:24:13):\nAnd then message you on LinkedIn would be the idea?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:24:15):\nExactly. Absolutely.\n\nLenny (01:24:16):\nEasy. Geoffrey, thank you so much for being here.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:24:19):\nWell, thank you, Lenny. It was a pleasure.\n\nLenny (01:24:22):\nIt was my pleasure.

  "transcript": "# Leaving big tech to build the #1 technology newsletter | Gergely Orosz (The Pragmatic Engineer)\n\n## Transcript\n\nGergely Orosz (00:00:00):\nIn my best year at Uber, I made about 320 or $330,000 in total compensation. And when I quit my job, I was actually thinking, am I crazy? Because I am leaving... Especially in Europe, this is a lot of money [inaudible 00:00:14] this will be similar to something... Someone in a similar position would've made five or 600K in total in the U.S. But now I am making more in compensation that I made at Uber. And the difference is that now my compensation... Well, my earnings keep going up as long as the newsletter is growing, so there's no theoretical cap on this. Of course there's an actual cap, there's churn, growth is slowing over time. But it's very, very strange, because I felt that I was in a really privileged position, just honestly making tons of money, doing a job that I loved. And this was at Uber or as a software engineer. And I'm now doing stuff that I love, and in some strange way, I guess it even pays better.\n\nLenny (00:00:59):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Gergely Orosz. In a sense, Gergely is the me of engineering. He's got the top engineering newsletter on Substack, it's growing really fast, and like me, he does this full time. In this episode, we talk about the life of newslettering full time, like we both do. We get into Gergely's decision to leave his cushy tech job at Uber, to go into this life full-time, what the day-to-day life of a newsletter person is, the pros and cons of this life, what it takes to be successful, and a bunch of advice for how to get started if you're curious about going down this route. This is a pretty unique episode, and it was really fun to do. If you ever thought about writing or going down this creator route, you'll love this episode. With that, I bring you Gergely Orosz.\n\nLenny (00:02:06):\nThis episode is brought to you by lemon.io. You've achieved product market fit. You're able to activate, engage, and retain your customers.

Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify and Tenfold and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by [inaudible 00:03:56]. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics, and instead use your North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. And Eppo supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com, and 10x your experiment velocity.\n\nLenny (00:04:28):\nGergely, welcome to the podcast.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:04:35):\nIt's awesome. Great to be here, Lenny.\n\nLenny (00:04:36):\nSo I think this is going to be a pretty special and unique podcast. Your newsletter is the number one technology newsletter on Substack, called the Pragmatic Engineer, by the way. My newsletter is the number one business newsletter on Substack, and so we're connected in this really special, weird way, and I thought it would be pretty fun to just explore this weird path that we're on doing this newsletter thing, and in that, help listeners understand the pros and cons of this life, how to go down this route, what it takes to be successful, all that stuff. But before we get into all that, I'd love for you to spend maybe a minute just giving us a little overview of your career, and how you got to where you are today doing this newsletter, and what you spend your time on now.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:05:19):\nMy career started out as what you might consider a pretty typical software engineer career. I graduated from university, I did a computer science degree for a five year program, so I did bachelor's and master's. I worked on the side, I hacked around, built small websites here and there, and during university I worked at a small web agency. And then I worked my way up in the industry. So I started off at a consulting company, we were just building for other companies. I'm originally from Hungary, in Europe. I then moved to UK, which was a big step up for me in terms of just getting access to, I guess, more modern software development. I was at a consulting company there as well. And I moved up to London, which in Europe, I feel it's like the New York of Europe, or even the Silicon Valley, back in the day. Back before Brexit, it was the biggest tech hub.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:06:11):\nI worked at an investment bank there, and then on the side I was always building mobile apps, and I got into Skype. I like to say Skype, but it was Microsoft. They just bought Skype at that point, and it was a lot more startup-y environment, a lot more fast moving. I then moved to another startup where I was a founding engineer of a acquisition. It's a startup called Skyscanner. And then I ended up at Uber at Amsterdam, where I joined as a senior software engineer, and I became a manager, and then a manager of managers, and it was just... I feel, looking back at that part of my career, I just felt really growing all the time, just taking each step one step at a time, which gave me a lot of appreciation for all these levels.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:06:51):\nAnd then, just as I was on this really good career path, I was on the path to being a senior engineering manager, or who knows, one day I might have had a shot of being their director of engineering as well, I decided to leave Uber. And we'll talk about it a little later in the podcast, but I didn't plan like this, but I started writing a newsletter. And now here I am writing a newsletter where a bunch of people are reading it, and it's a really unexpected turn and a really cool life as well.\n\nLenny (00:07:19):\nAwesome. On the newsletter, just to give people a little bit of context of how big this has gotten, can you share just a couple stats about the growth of the newsletter, the size, and anything else you want to share there?\n\nGergely Orosz (00:07:30):\nJust today I checked and it said 189,000 subscribers. I think the past 90 days has been growing with 80,000 subscribers, so it's almost a thousand people per day, which is incredible. Because these numbers are huge. If you're listening, you're probably thinking, \"Wow.\" And that's how I feel every day as well. But I've been writing a blog for many, many years, and these are numbers I never thought it would be. And the growth just seems to be accelerating. There was a tipping point in April where the newsletter was growing... In the first about nine months of the newsletter, it got to 50,000 subscribers, and then the next five months, or six or seven months, it went up by another a hundred and something thousand subscribers. This was when Substack introduced recommendations, which has been a massive growth engine, and I guess being one of the top publications, I benefited from it. But those numbers are again...\n\nGergely Orosz (00:08:26):\nSo this is a paid newsletter as well. So there's a free version and a paid version, and there's thousands of people paying for the newsletter. It's a single digit percentage, but it's a very, very healthy one. And again, it just beat all my expectations. And I guess we're in similar boats, because our newsletter setup, yours and mine, is somewhat similar. We have plenty of differences as well, but I make most of my revenue from subscriptions, and I don't do sponsorships or ads in the newsletter. So if people sign up for the free one, they get articles every now and then, and for the paid one, they get it a lot more and in more depth.\n\nLenny (00:08:59):\nCan you give listeners a sense of just the order of magnitude income you make from this, versus your cushy tech job at Uber? You don't have to share numbers or anything like that.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:09:09):\nYeah. I'll share a little numbers of my cushy tech job at Uber. I was in Europe, and European tech salaries, or I'll say total compensation, will be lower than for example the U.S., but it'll be higher than let's say regions like India or Indonesia. There's regional differences, and this is true for big tech as well. Uber was a good example on this. But in my best year at Uber, I made about 320 or $330,000 in total compensation. This was after Uber went public, so it includes the stock, the base salary, the bonus, which was very, very good in Europe. And when I quit my job, I was actually thinking, \"Am I crazy? Because I'm leaving...\" Especially in Europe, this is a lot of money [inaudible 00:09:53] this will be similar to something... Someone in a similar position would've made five or 600 K in total in the U.S.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:10:00):\nSo I walked away from that, and I was pretty sure that I'll just [inaudible 00:10:04] a lot less, but I'll enjoy what I'm doing, or I'll have... I'll just give it a go. But now I am making more in compensation that I made at Uber. And the difference is that now my compensation, my earnings, keep going up as long as the newsletter is growing, so there's no theoretical cap on this. Of course there is an actual cap, there's churn, growth is slowing over time, but it's very, very strange, because I felt that I was in a really privileged position, just honestly making tons of money, doing a job that I loved. And this was at Uber or as a software engineer. And I'm now doing stuff that I love, and in some strange way, I guess it even pays better. Part of it is just luck, part of this is situational. I think we're going to talk a bit more about this. But this was very, very surprising and very unexpected for me.\n\nLenny (00:10:55):\nAwesome. That's a great segue to the first thing I want to talk about, but just to frame what I want to spend our time on today, there's these four areas I want to explore. One is your decision to leave and start this life of writing, which is a very non-traditional life. Two is what the life of a paid newsletter person is like. What do you do all day? How do you find time to do this? How do you produce so much content? Three, what it takes to be successful at this. A lot of people... I always say it's easy to start a newsletter, hard to keep it going, and I'm curious what you find is important to be successful. And then four, how do you get started if you want to start your own newsletter?\n\nLenny (00:11:30):\nBut before I get into that, I just wanted to add a thought that I had. The way I think about this life in terms of comparing to the old job is, one, it feels instead of one boss, I have thousands of micro bosses, and one of them can fire me and many do every day, but it feels safer than at a tech job where one person can decide. And then the other piece is, assuming it keeps growing, you're getting a raise almost every day, every week, depending on the growth rate, and that's cool.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:11:57):\nThat is really cool. I had a spreadsheet that I maintained for the first year of the publication, where I listed, for every article, how much did my annual revenue go up a week later. So tracking what was the impact. And the crazy thing was that, when I wrote a really good article that resonated with people, sometimes it was an article that I thought was mediocre and people still loved it [inaudible 00:12:20] it was a really good article that I put tons of work in, I saw myself getting a raise. And this is just something you just don't get in corporate. I mean, it's by design, and there's a lot of good stuff about it, but I feel that this life, and we'll touch more on this, but there's a lot of surprising things, both good and bad, but this is a really good one. So for doing something awesome, you can just give yourself a raise, especially because this is just like you, mine is also a one person business right now.\n\nLenny (00:12:49):\nYeah. Okay. So you're at Uber, you're making hundreds of thousands of dollars writing code, it's pretty sweet. Uber's growing. You probably got all these RSUs that are going to keep accumulating. It's pretty good. And you decide, \"I'm going to try to make money on the internet writing,\" which is an obvious way to make a lot of money. Not. And so I'm curious, what got you to leave that job and explore writing and get to this writing path?\n\nGergely Orosz (00:13:20):\nThe short of it is, it was a promise to myself, and COVID, and Uber doing layoffs. And the longer version is that, when I joined Uber, before Uber I was... Now we're talking numbers on my old job, but I was working in London as a principal engineer at Skyscanner. Skyscanner was a unicorn, one of the few unicorns in the UK, UK headquartered and all that, and I was making like 90-something thousand pounds in base salary, which is maybe a 120, 130, or $140,000, depends on how the pound is doing, or sometimes these days it's almost just the same. But back then that was a really good... And this was most of it. I got some stock as well. And I thought I was close to the top of the market in London. I knew people, and it seemed this was a really good compensation package.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:14:05):\nAnd then Uber called me up saying, \"Do you want to interview?\" I interviewed with them, they gave me an offer, and I negotiated, and they basically doubled my compensation. I was like, wow, this is [inaudible 00:14:16] I knew about Silicon Valley compensation, but I assumed that [inaudible 00:14:20] you're not going to get this, but Uber was getting something closer to that. So I told myself, all right, so I'm getting a really good deal, and most of it is stock, which is... Uber [inaudible 00:14:32] 2016, no-one knew if Uber will go public, although I suspected, because they contacted me to build a payments team so do a SOX compliant payment system. And you need a SOX compliant payment system if you want to go IPO.\n\nLenny (00:14:44):\nThat's funny. It reminds me at Airbnb, there's all these people trying to figure out, when are we going to go public? And then there's the team working on SOX stuff and Sarbanes-Oxley, this is good.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:14:55):\nYeah. So anyway, I said, all right, this is a massive lottery ticket. If it goes in, every year I make two years of salary, pretty much. That's how I was thinking. But if not, again, don't forget I'm in Europe where we're used to not seeing any returns on stock. So European software engineers will not value stock as much, because they just haven't seen success stories. So I told myself, if four years later Uber exits and I make a bunch of money, I owe it to myself to take a risk, because then I'll have four years of savings in my bank, which... Back then I had maybe six months of savings or something. So this was the promise to myself.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:15:32):\nAnd then I probably would've forgotten about this, but four years later, almost on the dot, COVID starts, and it really hit super hard. We're laying off people, we had to lay off 20% of the engineers. I was already managing a group of about 30 people, I had managers under me, and 20% of the people or 15% had to be let go. And I was thinking to myself, what am I doing here? I looked ahead, Uber was going to have a really bad year, I'm going to have to manage morale. Up to then, I'd helped put together this team, and we had a really good charter, and we had to throw that charter out the window, because it made no sense with the economic reality. So I thought back, and I told myself, if I'll be here, I'll take a risk, and I'll try to do something else. So I was like, all right, let me pull this trigger.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:16:18):\nAnd my plan was very simple. Leave Uber and start a startup, raise venture capital, because I haven't done that before but it kind of runs in the family. My brother's on his second startup, and he sold his first one to Skyscanner, and now he's building this startup called Craft Docs. It's a really slick document editing system, they just raised their series B. So through him I know [inaudible 00:16:42] startup life is, and I felt I never did that, I always worked at big companies.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:16:45):\nSo my plan was [inaudible 00:16:47] leave Uber, raise money, and do something on platform engineering. A classic way that Uber alumni start businesses is, Uber has invested silly amounts of money to build everything custom internally. Everything that you can think of. Our [inaudible 00:17:02] system was custom, our experimentation system, our container, the way we automatically set that up, a lot of the engineering stuff. So a lot of Uber alumni just leave, and whatever they saw there, they just build it for the world to use, because no other company really does what Uber does, because it makes no sense, but a lot of them will pay for.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:17:20):\nThat was the plan. But before [inaudible 00:17:22] I wanted to finish a book. I'd been writing this book for, it was coming up to a year, called the Software Engineer's Guidebook, which is just my advice for people to grow professionally in the field. And I figured, all right, let me leave the company, in six months I'll write the book, I'll just use my savings to take a break, and then I'll raise the venture capital. And what happened was, I started to write this book, but I got sidetracked, I started to have fun online in terms of... I was writing on Twitter, on my blog. I accidentally published a book called Building Mobile Apps at Scale. I just did it for a few months.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:17:58):\nAnd the weird thing was that my plan was that I'm going to just not make any money, and this book, Building Mobile Apps at Scale, and another book that I published about tech resumes, I just wrote these in a few months, they started making money. They made about $100,000 in the first year. And I was like, \"That's interesting. People are buying my books.\" And I self-published it through Gumroad or places where I get to keep I think 90% of the revenue, but still, this was really interesting. And I got to the point where, all right, I should now start a startup. I should do fundraising and do all that. And then I asked myself, why do I really want to do that?\n\nGergely Orosz (00:18:34):\nAnd the answer was two reasons. One is, I love working in small teams at Uber. I'll be honest, I didn't really enjoy being a manager of managers. It felt a bit too abstract. I didn't like being in the meetings, not doing the work. What I really liked is when we had a small team, and we had this really big vision, and it was us against the world. We were like ten of us, and we were just getting stuff done, we were putting out fires, it was so much fun. So that was one of the reasons I wanted to do startup. I was hoping to recreate this feeling.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:19:05):\nAnd the other thing, honestly, was money. This was in 2021 before the market crashed. Just doing the maths, if you found a company, and I'll be a CEO and the founder, maybe I'll have a co-founder, this becomes a unicorn, by that time we will have raised five rounds of funding or six, I'll be diluted as hell, but I'll still have let's say 5%. 5% of the billion is still $50 million, after you pay taxes [inaudible 00:19:30] I can buy a bunch of stuff that I don't need. And I was asking myself, all right, and then what? And I was like, after I've bought everything that I don't need, I probably want to share what I know with people, do YouTube videos and write books.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:19:43):\nAnd I was thinking to myself, so hold on. I would go off and do this for like ten years, because that's how much you need to plan to do it. I need to stop doing what I'm doing right now, because I would owe it to my investors and my team to not spend all day on the internet writing about stuff. And then I want to do it again. So it's reminding me of the story of this fisherman. There's one that goes [inaudible 00:20:08] there's the same thing of, you work really hard to do what you're doing right now. So I decided, let me just try giving this a go. [inaudible 00:20:14]\n\nLenny (00:20:14):\nWait, what's the story of the fisherman? I think I know what you're talking about, but... [inaudible 00:20:18]\n\nGergely Orosz (00:20:17):\nThe story of the fisherman is that, in Mexico, an American businessman sees a fisherman who's just chilling, fishing. And he asks him, \"What are you doing all day?\" He's like, \"I fish for three hours, I hang out with my family, I [inaudible 00:20:32] chill and I sleep in every Saturday and Sunday.\" He says, \"All right, here's what you should be doing. You should fish not three hours, but you should fish five days a week, eight hours a day, sell that fish, turn over a profit, hire more people to do it, then start to be head of all those people, then sell your fishing company.\" He's like, \"Okay. And then what?\" \"And then you can actually buy an island, and you can just fish for three hours, you can sleep in on Saturdays and sleep on Sundays.\"\n\nGergely Orosz (00:21:00):\nSo I was thinking, look, I have savings. I don't have huge, but I have it for... I can still take a risk. So let me take a risk on writing. And I was thinking originally of just spending more time to finish my book. But what I didn't like about books, even though I was making money, is they're really... It's hard to predict if you're going to be making a living, or there's some people who actually like this excitement, but I didn't like it. I didn't know if today I'm going to be making like 50 bucks or 10 bucks or 300 bucks. So I was like, interesting. There's these paid newsletters which I've been thinking about, and you were one of the few people who shared some of your early numbers, and I figured this could be interesting, because it's recurring revenue.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:21:41):\nAnd the only reason I was really hesitant to start a paid newsletter, I was thinking about doing so for at least 6 to 12 months, is I was worried about writing every single week something really, really worthwhile reading, and it's a lot of work. But then I looked back and I saw that I wrote three books. [inaudible 00:21:58] I told you I wrote two books, but there was a third one that I also published in a year, and I was like, I'm pretty sure I can write. So for two weeks I collected ideas of what I would write about, and I had this super long list. So I was like, okay, ideas also check.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:22:10):\nAnd then I just said, screw it, I'm going to take a risk. It's a bit of a more professional risk, and maybe a financial one as well. I'll announce that I'm going to start a paid newsletter. Every week, I'm going to write something really in depth about software engineering. It's going to start next week. And I told myself that I'll... I told my wife as well that I'll do this for six months, and I'll see what happens. If there's traction, it's great. I might have found myself a new job, basically. If not, I'll just refund people. Everyone who bought an annual subscription... I didn't tell this to people, obviously, but for six months I'm going to give it my all. It's basically like a startup. So I told her and my family that it's going to be a lot of work and I might not be around as much, and they supported me, and I took a plunge. I took a big breath and started off. And that's how it went from leaving Uber to starting a venture funded startup to starting to write full time.\n\nLenny (00:23:05):\nAwesome. And we're going to talk about what advice you have for folks that are thinking about starting something like this at the end. What was the period between leaving Uber and starting the newsletter?\n\nGergely Orosz (00:23:14):\nIt was pretty much a year, a little bit less than a year. Might have been like ten months or so, but it was a year from when I decided to leave Uber. So Uber did layoffs in April, and it was really stressful. It was the first time I... I didn't lay anyone off, but people on my team were laid off. I wasn't told who's going to be laid off. It was just really stressful. It's weird, in the sense that the people who were let go, obviously worse for them, but I still felt terrible, and I just didn't feel very good about it. I think this was the breaking point. This was the point where I realized that it's not a family, which is weird because it never was, but it kind of felt family-like, but it's just a corporate, and I'm just a number, and this could happen to me, I guess. So I think I lost my sense of the trust in the system, that it'll take care of me, because I saw some of my colleagues who were really good professionals, I'd argue they were better software engineers and managers than me, they got let go because they were in the wrong team.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:24:08):\nSo this was April, and in July I went to a holiday, and two weeks in, I just realized I need to leave. And I really had the urge to do somewhere where I'm in charge. And if you're a manager listening to this, you might relate to this. If you're an engineer listening to this, maybe just shut your ears or you'll figure it out eventually. But when I was promoted into management... It wasn't promoting into it, because it was a side step, I didn't get [inaudible 00:24:34] or anything, but it still feels a promotion. They only promote the people who are... Only let people transition who are considered pretty good. I felt this would be a big deal. I'm now a manager. What no one told me is, yes I was a manager, but I was a middle manager. I didn't have too much authority. I didn't even have budget for my team. Someone was underpaid and I couldn't do anything except complain for HR for six months and hope that they'd do something.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:24:58):\nSo it was pretty frustrating, because I didn't feel in charge in the sense that I didn't have decision making [inaudible 00:25:02]. And the reason I wanted to do a startup is, I decided I liked being a manager, but I did not how I was not in charge and I couldn't take corporate [inaudible 00:25:12] telling us to do stuff, and then we were telling them no [inaudible 00:25:16] I don't want to do that with my people. So I decided for next job, I could be doing this, but instead I'd like to be in charge. So I'd like to be a founder or someone who's high up, so that I can actually take full responsibility for the things that I want to do or I don't want to do. The short of it is, I decided to leave in July. We have longer notice periods in Europe, so I served a longer notice period, and then left. But it was a year after the decision.\n\nLenny (00:25:41):\nLet's talk about what your life is like these days, writing a newsletter full time. People might be listening and be like, \"Man, $300,000 for writing an email a couple times a week, that's pretty sweet.\" So I want to talk about the good and the bad of this life. So maybe to start, how many posts are you putting out a week?\n\nGergely Orosz (00:25:59):\nI started the newsletter saying I'm going to post once a week. You'll have one pinned up post. And I started to do that, but interesting enough, eventually I upped it to two, so I now promise people two posts a week. There's more in depth and more timeless posts about some software engineering topic on Tuesdays, and there's something that's called the scoop, something a bit more timely, where I reflect or analyze what's going on in the market, interesting stuff I'm hearing. And every now and then there's a bonus post. So I'll say two on average, but the second one came a lot later. But initially in the first few months I was like, I have this one post per week, and it needs to be good.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:26:37):\nAnd it was interesting, because you would think writing a post a week is not a big deal. It's easy. As you said, let's say you're making 300K just writing one post a week. But it actually was pretty stressful in the beginning, because it turns out to write that post, it takes at least a few days or sometimes even longer. Sometimes it takes a week or two for me to research in terms of talking with people. I chose topics that are not covered, because why would people pay for something that is out there already or well known? Then I need to write [inaudible 00:27:10] a first draft. I get some feedback from people who I trust often, not always, but I often do. And then there's an editing phase where I work with an editor who helps make sure that it's just correct. And all these things add up. Even if I only spend a day researching the stuff, it's a day researching, then I have a draft on day two. Day three I get feedback, on day four it's editing, it's almost a whole week.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:27:32):\nSo I was working on parallel things at the same time, and I was often running against the deadline, I was barely finishing it, which is not what I was expecting initially. The first few months I feel was a bit more stressed, but again, the good thing is I cleared my calendar, so I said I'm not talking with anyone, I'm just doing this. So in that sense it was good. But the one thing I realized, if you look at any journalists who's doing stuff full time, and they're writing, not these clickbait articles, but actually in depth. You look at the Washington Post or New York Times, search for their name, and look up the articles that they write, and they're going to be longer articles. They have like one a month. Seriously. You look at the investigative journalist, they might even have less. And they have a bit of a different level, they have to check with legal and all those things, but my editor is a journalist, so he was actually telling me, even back then, \"You actually write a lot of original stuff,\" because a lot of my emails are about five, 6,000 words, which is considered very long.\n\nLenny (00:28:32):\nYeah. When you said that people listening might be like, one post a week is easy, I think most people are the opposite. They're just like, I can't write anything. I don't have time for any writing. How can you ever write one good thing a week? So I think there's both sides to it. And it's cool that you shared the process. Do you have a specific cadence per post? It's like Monday draft, Tuesday review, Wednesday editor. Is that how you work?\n\nGergely Orosz (00:28:58):\nI write every post over multiple weeks, most of them. Some of them I might be able to write faster, but what I now have is, nowadays I actually write two articles. So I have the Thursday that is the scoop, which actually is a lot easier for me to write, interestingly enough. And my cadence is, on Monday I finish up the last of the post that goes out on Tuesday. It's just small edits, but it's already done pretty much, so it's just a few small tweaks, and maybe I have some feedback coming in. On Tuesday, I publish this post, and I do some free writing. I write about some other ideas that I have that's going to be future posts. On Wednesday, it's my free day in between, where I... It's interesting, because what I feel is, when I don't have pressure, I tend to not do much stuff, which might just... My mind's saying, \"You just need to chill.\" Maybe that's it.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:29:49):\nBut one thing I miss from the corporate world... And if you're listening and you're in a job and you're thinking, \"Gergely's job is so amazing,\" one thing that I liked and I really miss about working at Uber is, I actually had a schedule. This is weird, I hated it back then, but I needed to do these things, and whenever you have a pressure, you do it. And this works with my newsletter. I put in the second newsletter I think to have a bit more pressure. Because the second part of Wednesday, I'm already starting to write my Thursday newsletter. On Thursday, I write that Thursday newsletter, and on Friday I'm now writing the next newsletter for Tuesday. So almost every day except for Wednesday, I have a strong pressure to write. Which when people ask, \"Gergely, how do you write so much?\" Because I did the maths, and I wrote four or five books' worth of content just last year. It's because I have these deadlines, and as you said, I also know that thousands of people are paying me, they have expectations of me.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:30:46):\nAnd so this is how it's done. If you want to write a book, the easiest way is go to a publisher and sign a contract, not because of the money. In software engineering, you're not going to get much [inaudible 00:30:57] $5,000 or something like that. That's what I was offered initially. But it's the pressure. You absolutely should go to a publisher or have some external... Someone to hold you accountable, and then you'll get it done. And I'll let you in on another secret, or not so secret.\n\nLenny (00:31:16):\nDo tell.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:31:16):\nIn my mind, when I started newsletter a year ago in this crossroads, I want to write this book, which I think will be a great book, the Software Engineer's Guidebook, I feel it'll be my summary of my last ten years of what I have to share as advice, but I was worried that it's just a big project that's just going to take months, and I'll lose motivation midway.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:31:37):\nAnd partially, I went down the newsletter route because I liked how every week I would have to write something, and I had this sneaky idea of, what if I wrote this book where I write some posts that will be part of the book, and then the book will just come together partially. And I've kind of been doing that. I haven't been telling people, but some of the posts are going to be... Not exactly, but the idea is that I have this chapter, and I have this list, have I written about this topic in the newsletter? And you know where I got this idea from? There's the book The Three Musketeers, from Alexander Dumas [inaudible 00:32:12]. And do you know how it was written?\n\nLenny (00:32:15):\nI don't.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:32:16):\nSo he wrote the book for a magazine. He was apparently just low on money, and he started to write for this magazine who told them, \"All right, we need you to write something that our readers will want, so that they will buy the magazine.\" I think he was getting a cut of some sales or something. So he needs to write in a way that was interesting, and then cut it off in a way that people would come back and buy the next one. And he wrote a whole book, and that book, when I read it, it's really long, and I was like, hold on, if he could do this, then this is a good strategy. He was writing it because he just needed the money. That's all. And then he wrote a really good book on the way.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:32:52):\nSo one big learning for me from newsletters then... I would argue that you can use this not just for newsletters, but any business that you do. If you're going to go out and start a new business, you'll probably have some ideas. And it's not just going to be a newsletter, it's going to be a bunch of other things. If you put in ways that you have to do certain things, put in constraints for the things that you need to do, and then you're going to do that.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:33:16):\nWithout that, when you're on your own, when you're entrepreneur, I was a great... I think I was a really diligent employee. I always tried to get my work done, show up on time, I tried to meet all expectations. But what I noticed is, when I started to work for myself, it just went out the window. Almost 15 years of being this star employee who really wants to do well, I found myself upset at myself for not... Just wasting my day. But I fixed it by telling people, \"You're going to get this every week,\" and now I have to do it. I just have no choice.\n\nLenny (00:33:51):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive.\n\nLenny (00:34:37):\nEnter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Get started today.\n\nLenny (00:35:08):\nI definitely wanted to dig into that a little bit deeper, this issue that folks in our line of work run into, which is unstructured time and having to create your own structure. I had the same exact problem when I started this thing, before I even started the newsletter. How do I use my time well? How do I create some kind of deadline for myself? So I'm curious what other tricks you found to help you stay productive and focus, because there's Twitter, there's Instagram, TikTok, there's all these things that pull my attention. And I've learned a couple things I'll share that have been helpful, but I'm curious, what have you found to help you focus and get things out the door? Two posts a week, which is a lot of work.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:35:49):\nSo a problem that I have, and this might be unique to newsletters, I'm not sure. I use Twitter for a lot of research. And unfortunately what that means is when I start to write something, it can really pull my attention, because I have Twitter open and then I get a message from someone. It's a little bit like Slack, but I'd argue it can be worse, because also Twitter for me is also something that is very useful in generating people [inaudible 00:36:16] raising awareness. So whenever I tweet, it helps my business. So that's a good thing. But it also justifies for me spending more time on, for example, Twitter than I would want to. So I find that I come up with a method, and it works for a few months, and then I need to change it because my brain just learns to work around it. So I'll tell you a few things that I did, and I'll tell you where I'm at right now, but I use for example apps. I use this app Centered, but I know you're also there.\n\nLenny (00:36:45):\nYeah. I love that app. Also an investor [inaudible 00:36:49] disclaimer, but I love it.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:36:51):\nYeah. And I found that helpful, the idea of focused time and [inaudible 00:36:56] turned on, but it might just be me, but after a while I get used to these things, and I find it not as efficient. I found the Pomodoro method for a few months useful, when you have the 25 minute intervals. And the one thing that has never failed me, but I just find it hard to do, is I find it hard to start. I have this benefit that I have all this time... Sorry, there's two things that always work. One is, it's almost time for me to go home, and then I'm super focused. So when I have this external thing, and I know that there's no way [inaudible 00:37:30] I need to focus on basically the deadline. So if you have deadlines, that works.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:37:36):\nThe other thing is, if I start to spend three or four minutes doing something focused, and I get the flow of it. So a trick I sometimes do when I'm just, I just don't feel doing anything, is I set a timer of 20 minutes, and then I say, \"All right, no distractions.\" I have a script where I just kill... I use a [inaudible 00:37:57] host file, I just kill all LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, whatever sites. So I just cannot reach it. It's just a very simple Python script that I wrote for myself. And then in the first few minutes I'm grumbling, I'm like, \"I wish I could do this, I wish I could just look at Twitter to research,\" but about five minutes in, there's a switch, and I'm now actually heads down and doing it. And this has been the thing that has consistently worked.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:38:21):\nThe interesting thing is that I feel guilty a lot of times that I'm not working as hard as I could. And I do wonder if it's guilt, or if it's my mind or body telling me that it just wants a break or it wants to do something else. I still haven't figured it out, but I'm on the way there.\n\nLenny (00:38:39):\nAwesome. That's a really cool trick, the host file trick. So that's [inaudible 00:38:43] something that you have to be technical to do. I imagine there's some chrome extensions that could do that to some extent for folks. But the whole idea there is, force your brain not to have any way to look at something that'll be distracting, by blocking your computer from even being able to go to the site. That's awesome.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:38:59):\nYeah. So there is definitely going to be extensions that you can use, and on this podcast we'll have a variety of people. If you're a software engineer, it's pretty simple, and even if you're not, you can look it up [inaudible 00:39:10] when you override your host file, you can actually block [inaudible 00:39:13] what you do. And I did this because I wrote a script where I need to run the script, and I need to run the script again to unblock it. And it's kind of cool, because I put it together for myself. So I usually find that the tools that other people use, maybe this is just me or maybe this is software engineers, I don't like them because I feel they're either too opinionated or they're not opinionated enough. So I don't know if this is just the fact that I used to like to build my own tools and my own scripts, because I can, so I found that my scripts worked the best for me.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:39:44):\nBut as you said, there's a bunch of really good tools. So my advice to people would be, look up all [inaudible 00:39:50] let's try them out. You won't know until you try them. And again, I had stuff that worked really well for a certain amount of time. I don't know why, maybe I just get bored easily or something, that I just need to rotate. But for example, when I went back to Centered... I have no affiliation by the way, so I'm just telling this. But I really liked how they keep evolving as well to do cooler things. They have a community element where you're competing with people on uninterrupted time and closing stuff. So that to me is a... I'll do one last [inaudible 00:40:23] Centered again. I have no affiliation. What I really liked about Centered is, it allows you to turn on your video camera, and I felt really forced to do work, because I knew that people on the other side of the world might be watching me, even if it was not true.\n\nLenny (00:40:37):\nYeah. I love that feature. It's centered.app, by the way, if folks want to check it out. So to summarize some of your tips, which I love, Centered, deadlines, totally work for me too. Blocking sites so that you can't get distracted by Twitter and LinkedIn and TikTok and all the things. And I guess that's the three that work best for you.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:40:55):\nYeah. And the simple thing, start a 20 minute timer, and you say, \"For 20 minutes, I need to focus on this thing,\" on your iPhone or somewhere else. It's just 20 minutes, but during that time you cannot do anything else. And just try it. It works for me, like a charm, once I decide to actually do it.\n\nLenny (00:41:13):\nIt's cool Centered does that for you, and it has music and all the things. So I that a lot. Awesome. What do you love most about this life that you lead now, versus what you used to do? And then I'm going to ask you the opposite, but let's start there.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:41:27):\nI really like that it forces me to have my calendar empty, because for so many years my calendar was this giant mess of meetings on top of meetings, and I would barely have any time to actually have focus time. Now I actually have the opposite. I usually have a lot of focus time, and I have very, very few meetings or things. And even now I get a little bit cagey [inaudible 00:41:51] I have this one meeting in the whole day. So I like how it's [inaudible 00:41:55] manage your time [inaudible 00:41:58] so that's the best part.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:41:59):\nAnd I also like how much in charge I am. Initially it freaked me out, in the sense of how much creative freedom I have. I can write about whatever. I can change a format, I can do this, I can do that. It can be a little bit overwhelming, because I also know that people are going to be reading this, and what are they going to think about it? But I do like that it's very entrepreneurial, so I get to experiment a lot as well, which reminds me a little bit of my old job, because at Uber we also experimented a lot, and obviously more in a corporate setting. But I guess that's just gotten extended. So these are the two favorite things, is the open calendar or very few meetings, and experimenting, trying out stuff and being able to decide what I want to try out.\n\nLenny (00:42:46):\nPlus one on both those. I have a rule of no meetings before 3:00 PM, and it generally works 99% of the time. And the reason I do that is, to your point, if there's a meeting at 11:00, I just can't do anything really deep until that point, and then afterwards I have to get back on track. And having that deep focus time is so important for this work, even though half the time I'm on Twitter and distracted, as long as I get enough time to focus, good things happen. Okay. Opposite. What are some of the most surprising downsides and sucky parts of this path that you've taken?\n\nGergely Orosz (00:43:24):\nOne is obviously it's lonely. I do miss... I had a really good team at Uber, and it wasn't just a team, it was the people. I liked... Everyone has different views on remote work. I actually didn't enjoy remote work as much, because I just liked hanging out with people. I guess I'm that more outgoing type, and I really like walking up to the coffee station and having a chat with people, or at lunch sitting next to someone and talking about it. And obviously in some sense it was annoying, because I wanted to get work done, but for the most part I miss it more than I have. And so I miss not having that. I compensate for that by working in a shared workspace, a shared office, which is a techy workspace. So everyone needs to work in tech. So I actually get to say hi to people and have a little small talk.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:44:08):\nThe structure is weird, because I felt really guilty for the first few months, because I felt that at Uber I was more productive, because I had to be. I was doing so many things. In a day, I would start my day let's say at 9:00 or at 8:30, and I'd finish it up at, I don't know, 6:00 or 5:30, it depends. I would probably have, on an average day, I would have a good eight meetings, I would finish two or three documents, I would send over this, send over that. I actually have... Looking at my output, now I write a lot, but I wrote a lot. I think I wrote almost as much in terms of emails, chat messages, et cetera. So the downside is, I felt very guilty and a little bit frustrated for myself, for feeling that I'm slacking off. That's one.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:44:55):\nAnd the other thing, it is surprisingly stressful. So when you start off, it's kind of lonely. Not many people do this, what we do. That's also one of the reasons that we connected, because it's a very small community. And even within the community, I feel, in the newsletter community, it's different. You're all running your own business, and there is some level of competition. So you might not... Because it's a little bit of attention economy as well. People are not going to subscribe or pay for ten newsletters on the same topic, so that makes it a little bit more... It's not the same as when you work in tech, and you just share exactly everything that you do, because you can only win.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:45:35):\nSo there's that part, but there's a lot of external validation, so whenever looking at your subscriber numbers, which brings a bunch of stress that I didn't expect. And I'm a successful newsletter [inaudible 00:45:47] I think my success is quite rare. There will be one or two or a handful of people who have similar success, but I'm an outlier. So that's another thing that I think is just good [inaudible 00:45:58] putting out there. And the downside is, you don't really know how well you're doing. External goals are kind of meaningless. Internal goals, either you smash them or you don't reach them. So there's this constant sense of, where am I? How am I, and how do I judge myself? Did I make a mistake for leaving my job? I actually asked myself for several months actually, after I started. Or did I make a good one? And I think for a lot of these questions and doubts, having past professional experience working at a company is really useful to set yourself grounded.\n\nLenny (00:46:33):\nI actually want to ask you about that, but I'll add a couple things that I also find are major downsides of this life, because it's not all rainbows and butterflies. One is, with a paid newsletter especially, but even with a sponsored newsletter, you basically have to get something awesome out every week, in theory for the rest of your life. People are buying an annual plan every day, so that means at least a year you have to write something awesome, if you want to stop. But it's hard to stop, because as you pointed out, the income is very meaningful, and that's a hard thing to give up. And so I'm not sure exactly the exit path that exists for us, where we might have to keep writing something awesome for the rest of our life, but I imagine something will emerge and we'll think of something else that we could do.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:47:19):\nYeah. And it's a really good example, because for a lot of companies, and I assume a lot of listeners are working in tech, typical thing is you work hard, you build equity at a company or you build the value of the company, and then you can sell that company, and then you can have an exit and you can do whatever. For what we're doing, it's really tied to us. So however much or little my newsletter will make, it'll have a value let's say four or five times the annual revenue as a business, but you cannot really sell it like that and you cannot really walk away.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:47:49):\nSo that makes it unique, it makes it harder to compete with, which is cool, but it does not create that much of an exit path unless you start to build a company around it, build an organization that can run without you, for example. This is what a lot of book publishing companies... So basically you build a publishing company where you start to hire people, who start to write some of the articles initially, and then later more of them, but it's not a one-person newsletter any more. Or you keep doing this, until you either stop and then the revenue stops, or you might be able to sell it, but at really under value.\n\nLenny (00:48:24):\nYeah. I really don't want to manage people. I don't want to have employees. And so building a media company with writers, that doesn't sound too fun, but maybe that's where this goes. That is one route, for sure. The other downside I'll just add is the fact that you have to write something awesome every week, it's hard to take meaningful time off, because if you stop producing great stuff, people leave. And I invented this PTO policy for myself where I take four weeks a year off, where I don't do a newsletter, but that means I can't take more than a week off usually [inaudible 00:48:58] weeks in a row, I don't know, people probably won't care, but it feels like things start to not go great if I just don't keep producing great stuff. So that's another downside, just [inaudible 00:49:08] topic.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:49:09):\nYeah. But a lot [inaudible 00:49:11] very early. So I think the whole concept of paying users is new, so I think we're going to do a lot of experimentation. And also a lot of it, I think you need to figure out what your needs are. So in the first year, I did not take a holiday in terms of... Or even when I [inaudible 00:49:25] I was writing, and it caused a bit of friction with my family. And now I'm solving it in a different way, so I am planning to take more time off now, and I'm doing it by working ahead with some of the less time sensitive things. But it is tough.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:49:43):\nSo a downside we haven't mentioned, but I'm just going to call it out, is holiday. The great thing at... I never felt... Well, I felt a little guilty sometimes taking holiday, but when I want a holiday, I took it off. When I had my son born, at Uber, they gave me a four month paid holiday. I took the whole four months, I just logged off. It was great. It wasn't my company. I was still getting stock. The stock price was independent of mostly what I was doing, just being honest. And that was really, really good. So this might be true, by the way, if you start any business, especially while it's just yourself, it's hard to turn off. And I think most people don't mind, I don't mind, but it gets to you. We should be conscious about burnout as a whole. So you need to solve for that, and I'm starting to solve for that as well.\n\nLenny (00:50:30):\nYeah. Okay. Enough about the downsides. Overall, it's pretty amazing making hundreds of thousands of dollars writing an email once a week/twice a week. So just to wrap up on that, I'm curious, where do you think this goes long term for you? And then I want to talk about just what it takes to be successful, but before there, do you think this goes long term?\n\nGergely Orosz (00:50:50):\nI stopped making long term plans, because three years ago you would've asked me what I wanted to do, and I was like, \"I want to be, I don't know, a manager of managers.\" And then I became one. And then [inaudible 00:51:01] what is my dream? I would've been like, \"It's a stretch, but maybe I want to be a site lead.\" And I didn't become one per se, but I never thought of writing a newsletter, or now writing a successful newsletter. So I'm going with the flow. I'm seeing this less, by the way, as a newsletter or creator, or creator economy as people like to see it. I see this as a business, and I'm trying to put on that business hat. I'm building a one-person business. I want to make it sustainable, I want to make it successful, and I find that this thinking really helps me detach as well. I can actually enjoy my weekends as opposed to thinking, \"I need to write this, or I need to write that.\" So I also want to make it work for me.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:51:40):\nAnd I'm not married to the idea of, it always needs to be a newsletter, et cetera. Right now it is, but where I see us going is, I'll keep building the business, I'll keep playing to my strength, which is I love talking with people, I love writing [inaudible 00:51:56] I love software engineering. So this is a great format, but over time it might shift. So I'm keeping my options open. And what I've learned from this journey is, you need to create time for that spark to come. So one of my goals for next few years is to not spend 50 hours a week on a newsletter, which I'm doing right now, but spend 20, and then maybe take a few weeks off and have that spark come. Because the reality is, this newsletter only came because I gave myself six months of unpaid... I'm not going for work, I didn't ask for any LinkedIn emails. And the idea came and the inspiration came and the motivation came.\n\nLenny (00:52:36):\nThere's a lot of similarities with my approach. I don't think too far long term. I have no idea what's going to happen. I just take it to... I see where pull is coming from, and if it feels like an interesting opportunity and something that I'd be excited to work on, I explore it, like the podcast for example. And on that point, I will say, once you find that you can spend maybe 20 hours on a newsletter, I guarantee you'll find more work to fill that gap, because that's what I've been doing.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:53:00):\nYeah. And one last thing to touch on, you said something really important [inaudible 00:53:06] pull, and I want to double down on that. One of the biggest, best things about doing what we do when you're in charge of your time is, you can double down on pulls. So [inaudible 00:53:18] Uber, like I said, my plan was, I'll write this book for six months. Two months in, I just put a draft [inaudible 00:53:24] a really long blog post about mobile engineering, and I got a ton of messages, a lot. I usually used to get like three or four messages on Twitter per day. I got 20 in an hour, people saying, \"Can I read the draft?\" And I was like, that's interesting. I just felt this pull, of this huge interest of people caring about this. It was this really long blog post about mobile engineering at scale, and someone suggested on a private message, \"You could probably turn this into a ebook.\" And I was like, that's a good idea, because it's a really long blog post. So I said, \"It's going to be an ebook, and it'll be pay what you want.\" And then people started to buy it. And I was like, that's interesting.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:53:57):\nSo I didn't have much else to do, so I was able to double down. I said, for the next two months, I'm going to write this book, because it seems there's an interest in it. And [inaudible 00:54:07] I turned it into a book that was free for two months, but I got sponsorship. The point was, I was able to double down on this pull. And same thing with the newsletter. So we're going to talk about how I got the first few thousand subscribers, but the point was, I was able to double down on something that I felt like, this is super interesting, I never expected that people would care about building a large mobile app, more than a few hundred people. Turns out they do. Thousands do.\n\nLenny (00:54:30):\nLet's actually jump to that. Let's talk about just how to get started, for folks that are like, \"This is cool. I want to do a newsletter.\" Let's talk about just how you got started briefly, and then what you think it takes to be successful in the life of a newsletter person. So how'd you actually get your first thousand subscribers?\n\nGergely Orosz (00:54:51):\nI'll tell the story that is kind of true, and people will think it's amazing, and also the real deal behind it.\n\nLenny (00:54:57):\nOkay, great.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:54:58):\nI announced my newsletter, I told people, \"I'm going to go full time on this.\" I had maybe 10,000 Twitter followers and, I don't know, maybe 1,000 on LinkedIn or something that. And people started signing up the next day. I had 100 subscribers in the first day before I published anything. And within six weeks, when I published my [inaudible 00:55:15] I had 1,000 paid subscribers. And this sounds like a fairytale. And if you do this, I guarantee you're not going to get the same results. In fact, you'll probably see way smaller numbers.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:55:25):\nWhat I didn't tell is that there was at least six years of accidental work behind this. I started a blog six years before... Actually, I've always been blogging since I graduated. I had this personal blog where I just published all sorts of random things about software engineering, but it was really... Sometimes it was about an app that I published, sometimes it was a problem that I came across. It was is all over the place. And I got fed up with this, the blog wasn't going anywhere, and I was just writing for myself, by the way, but I didn't how it was just all over the place.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:55:56):\nAnd I said, \"I'm going to start a blog, it'll be about software engineering and I'll call it The Pragmatic Engineer.\" I bought the domain, and I read this blog post from Jeff Atwood, who's the founder of Stack Overflow, and back in 2010, or I think in 2007 when I was still in college, he had the most popular blog on the internet for software engineers. It was called Coding Horror, and all the software engineers I knew read it and were drinking it. It was next level wisdom every single week, twice [inaudible 00:56:26] a week. You read it as well?\n\nLenny (00:56:29):\n[inaudible 00:56:29] Yeah. I used to be an engineer, and I was all up in that. And I think Coding Horror came from a... I forget the book, but there's a book with that graphic.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:56:36):\nThere's a book, and there's a graphic. Yeah. And he wrote a post which really stuck with me for years. He said, how to be famous on the internet. He said, there's three simple steps. One, write a blog post. Two, do this three times a week. Three, do it for two years. And I guarantee, if you do this, you're going to be famous. And I always thought it's kind of ironic, but the more I read it, the more I thought he actually means something with it. And when I started this blog, The Pragmatic Engineer, I said, \"I'm tired of my old blog being all over the place, and there's no focus, and no-one really cares about it. I'm going to do what Jeff Atwood said. I'm going to publish... Okay, it's not going to be twice a week, but every two weeks I'm going to publish an article, and I'll do it for a year.\" So I started to do this. I published six blog posts about software engineering, going into topics that I [inaudible 00:57:25] research and all that, and then I gave up.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:57:27):\nAnd I'm saying this because I kind of gave up, and I left it for a few months, but then something interesting happened. I had a huge traffic spike, and it crashed my shared hosting at the time. And it came from a site called Hacker News that I [inaudible 00:57:41] heard about, and people were discussing my posts, and they were adding a lot of things. And I was like, that's interesting. People care about what I wrote six months ago.\n\nLenny (00:57:49):\nWhat was that post, by the way?\n\nGergely Orosz (00:57:50):\nIt was called, \"A comment is an invitation for refactoring.\" I wrote my view that if there's a comment in a code, that means that comment should be deleted and you should just refactor the whole thing. And it exploded on Hacker News. Some people called me an idiot, some people called me absolute wisdom, and it was these two crowds battling it out. And I was like, wow, I actually made software engineers in Silicon Valley argue about my stuff. I saw some of the [inaudible 00:58:17] people, some really high [inaudible 00:58:18] people were really going for [inaudible 00:58:21]. So that's when I thought [inaudible 00:58:23] my writings, some people might read it, it's not guaranteed.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:58:26):\nAnd I started to write on that blog once every few months, depending on my mood, but I never stopped doing it. And I partially did it [inaudible 00:58:35] always hoped that it would get onto this site called Hacker News. But by the way, for a while, I didn't even know you could submit it, so I never submitted my own things. But the other thing was, I just kind of liked it, and I had this habit, and over years... I had this blog from 2015. For six years I was writing that blog, and in the last year... When I worked at Uber, on the side I wrote about my work, in terms of the things that I could write about, not about the details that we did, but some of the learnings [inaudible 00:59:02] for example, distributed systems. And more and more of these posts just started to just pop up on Hacker News. People would either submit it, or sometimes when I submitted it, it would just do well. And I was thinking, so people... I started to get this validation, people care about what I write.\n\nGergely Orosz (00:59:16):\nAnd to question of the success of the newsletter, by the time I launched a newsletter, I had a lot of posts that a lot of software engineers read, and there was a very famous post about performance management, how to do performance reviews. I wrote one about the tri-modal nature of software engineering salaries, where I observed that there's three different tiers that are... There's big tech and there's local companies. And I think what happened is, when I announced that I'm going to write this newsletter, I also put it on the blog. A lot of people realize that they... \"I've been reading this Pragmatic Engineer, I don't know who is behind it, but I like it. Let me sign up. I do want to get an email every week, instead of the things that were every now and then.\"\n\nGergely Orosz (00:59:56):\nSo there was years of work, and I wish I could tell you how to build a successful newsletter, but the best advice I have is still what Jeff Atwood does, except I have less conviction. But if you start writing, and you do it regularly, two things will happen. First of all, you're going to [inaudible 01:00:11] you write for yourself and you keep improving, you'll be a better writer. That's for sure. If you're lucky or if you're right about stuff, you might start to attract people who think similarly. So step one is get started. Step two is keep it up. And my suggestion is [inaudible 01:00:26] for yourself. The weird thing is, until I started my newsletter, I never thought I would turn this ever into a business, but it always felt rewarding. So I never... If you're starting out writing a newsletter to do what I'm doing one day, it might work out. But interesting enough, I never even thought that this was an opportunity.\n\nLenny (01:00:48):\nSo people listening to this that are thinking about, should I explore this life? If you think about your story, you wrote a book, you blogged for a while before this, you worked at Uber for a number of years. In a sense, it comes across a little bit like, there's no way I can be successful if that's the background I need to have. I have to have written things and worked at an awesome tech company. What advice do you give folks that are coming to you being like, \"Gergely, should I start a newsletter? Does it make sense for me?\" Do you need the background that you have, do you think?\n\nGergely Orosz (01:01:21):\nDon't forget that when I started my blog, I didn't have any of this.\n\nLenny (01:01:24):\nAnd this is while you were at Uber. This is before you started the newsletter.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:01:28):\nIt was before I was at Uber. So I was maybe at Skyscanner, or maybe at Skype, but I was even blogging before. I was talking to conferences before. So my advice really would be, if you're thinking of a newsletter or something similar, start teaching and sharing what you know and what you're observing. This could be a newsletter, this could be a YouTube video, this could be going to meetup. Actually, ten years ago I went to a lot of meetups where I presented all sorts [inaudible 01:01:54] I met a lot of cool people. I would say, share your knowledge one way or the other. And as you're doing it, you're going to learn a lot more.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:02:01):\nSo what I find... This is true, when I was a manager, we had to set goals, and I told people there's two types of goals you can set. One is [inaudible 01:02:12] people set this goal, I want to be promoted the next thing, or I want to lead this big project. And those are bad goals, because it's not in your control. So setting a goal that I want to have a successful newsletter with, I don't know, 20,000 subscribers, that's a goal where you're not in charge. A good goal is what you can do. So a good goal for example is, I want to learn this new language in the next year, which I'm going to spend time on, or I want to leave work at 5:00 PM on Fridays to be home with family. So set those goals that you can control.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:02:41):\nAnd this is how actually my blog started initially. My goal was, I want to write once a month. And I did that for a while, and I was proud about that. Or whenever I learn something, I actually want to share it every now and then. So I would say set those goals, and the rest will come, probably. Again, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to talk people out of doing it. But for me, a lot of this was luck. And the other thing that I would suggest is be curious, and look at your professional career as well. One thing that definitely helped me is getting pedigree. I come from a small country, from a really good university which no-one knows about, but I didn't grow up in let's say Silicon Valley, so I actually made a subconscious point to try to work my way up. And after I got to let's say JPMorgan in London, I was pretty picky of where I would go next. So that's why, when Skype came along [inaudible 01:03:36] this is great. Everyone knows Skype, I love Skype. And it was same thing with Uber.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:03:40):\nSo especially these days, people would not pay nearly as much attention to me if I worked at Small Parts Limited. So there's that part as well. So you need to manage some of these things, figure out what you want to do. For a long time, I pretty much thought that I just want to climb the corporate ladder and prove that I'm good enough at all these companies. I was just doing all this stuff on the side. It's interesting how it's now flipped, and now doing these things, this is my main thing, which used to be my side project.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:04:07):\nAnd I guess one last advice is, do some side projects. All of this starts as a side project. At work, no-one's really going to appreciate that you're doing a newsletter or this or that. Try stuff on the side, assuming that you have time. Or if you don't have time, try to make time. Because I feel a lot of what we're doing is pretty entrepreneurial, and the only way you're going to get these muscles, if you start some small things.\n\nLenny (01:04:31):\nYou talk about the pedigree being important. I think there's also an even deeper point, that you actually need real experience doing real things that scaled and worked and mattered and worked with amazing people, to actually build a foundation to write about, share wisdom from. And that's really important. There's a lot of people starting newsletters and tweeting who haven't done much and don't have a lot of real life experience to share. And I think that's the core of a lot of what we do, is it needs to be based on real things that worked and that you've learned, or that you have access to other people who have learned these things.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:05:06):\nI would say that, but one thing that I'll double down [inaudible 01:05:09] that's a really good observation is, if you're serious, like one day I will want to write a book or a newsletter, it's kind of the same thing, or teach people about stuff, look at the people that you look up to that you actually trust. Maybe it's me a bit or maybe it's you, but it's more likely people like Kent Beck, for example. He's the creator of TDD, and he's written a lot of books. He's one of my favorite people, I think he's coming up 50 or 60 [inaudible 01:05:36] if he listens to this, sorry if... I don't want [inaudible 01:05:38] seem old, but what I love about Kent Beck, is he's been in the middle of it. He has always worked in the industry, and that he wrote about it. But for example, I think he invented or he was a co-inventor of... Was it TDD or extreme program... Anyway, one of these methodologies.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:05:58):\nAnd then [inaudible 01:05:58] went to work at Facebook. He took a title cut to be a software engineer, and then he hosts the TDD workshop, the test driven development workshop, and no-one showed up at Facebook. And Facebook did no testing, which went against all commercial wisdom. And he took that risk joining this company where he could have been... People would've knelt down to him anywhere else, but he went to this company where he just wanted to learn. He's this lifelong learner. He's right now writing a book. But what I think [inaudible 01:06:26] if you want to be someone who people listen to, yes, do cool and interesting stuff, push yourself to get into places that do these interesting things.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:06:33):\nThat's how, when I went to Uber in 2016, it was one of the highest regarded places back in 2016, and in 2017 it was the other way around. But back in 2016, people were turning down Facebook and Google offers to go at Uber, which we all thought would change the world. So you do need to get into those teams that are doing interesting stuff, prove that you can do that, and you'll have a lot more interesting stories to share, that's for sure.\n\nLenny (01:06:59):\nIf you had to boil down advice for how to be successful in this life of a newsletter, you had to boil it down to just one or two key pieces of advice, what would you say?\n\nGergely Orosz (01:07:10):\nOne is habit of depth in the field, whatever field you do. So this might mean that I think... I don't want to say that if you don't have experience, don't start one, but it's kind of true. So become an expert somewhere, somehow, before you start, because you'll be a lot more credible. I think there's no shortage of reporters and journalists who don't know about stuff, but they can interview people, but that doesn't give anything extra, and I think people feel that.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:07:38):\nSo I would say choose a field that you're going to be good at. And you can start on the side, doing this. Assuming you have something, you're someone with experience in the industry or you have insights, wisdom, observations to share, start doing so, in whatever format. I do newsletters. There's actually YouTube, a lot of people are becoming pretty successful on YouTube sharing their thing. Three, have a cadence and stick to it, to some extent, because you do need to keep repeating it. And then four, don't be afraid to try out new things. A good example of a person who did these is Steve Yegge. Steve Yegge is... Have you heard of Steve Yegge?\n\nLenny (01:08:17):\nYeah. He wrote some epic long...\n\nGergely Orosz (01:08:19):\nHe used to work at Amazon, and then at Google he wrote this internal email about platforms, about how Amazon is great at platforms and Google is terrible. And he was really well known at Google, because he wrote stuff inside Google. So he's experienced, knows a lot of stuff, and then he quit Google and he started to do a podcast that's on YouTube. You could check it out, it's called Stevey's Podcast. And what he did is, every week he recorded an episode and he talked about a bunch of his learnings, a lot of stuff, and he was pretty clear up front when he started the first one, he said, \"What I'm doing is, I'm going to do this for six months and I'll see if it sticks, see if people care about it or people watch it.\"\n\nGergely Orosz (01:08:55):\nNow, this guy had a lot of experience, really fun [inaudible 01:08:59] I think it's really fun to listen to. And in the end, it was I think successful. It got a couple thousand or maybe even 10,000 subscribers, but it wasn't this rocket ship. And I think what he did, he just stopped after six months, and he actually started head of engineering at Sourcegraph, he actually went back [inaudible 01:09:15] industry. But what I love about this, it shows that you cannot guarantee having success, but you can do what he did, which is start something, do a cadence, see if it sticks. If not, either pivot or do something else. I feel the world is kind of about that as well.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:09:30):\nIf you think about... Take a step back of, what is a successful newsletter? What is a successful podcast? What is a successful YouTube channel? And it's stuff that's interesting. It's either entertaining or educational. But all of these things, you can't really put a finger on. If you watch YouTube, Mr. Beast is someone who you probably came across, I actually like watching his videos and [inaudible 01:09:56] how good he does it, but it's not something you can [inaudible 01:09:59] anyone would have written in a book. So there is a sense of trying to understand what people care about, and a good way to understand is either experiment or observe or just try out stuff.\n\nLenny (01:10:12):\nThis is great. I feel like I can boil this down even further from everything you just said, which is, build depth in an area, then write a blog post twice a week for two years, and good things will happen.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:10:25):\nI'm pretty sure. And here's an interesting thought as well, just for closure. I was talking with someone on why my newsletter is so successful. It's really successful, and I honestly don't know why. And this person told me something interesting. This is a person who had a really successful YouTube channel with about 200,000 subscribers, so more than my newsletter. And he said this. He's like, \"What I noticed is, you started your blog in 2015, 2016, and I started my YouTube channel in 2019 or something like that. And on YouTube, there's so much quality, there's super high great productions, everyone is doing YouTube.\" And he said, \"You know what I don't see? I don't see many blogs that are writing in depth stuff regularly. I feel everyone went over to YouTube or TikTok. So there is the other angle of the medium.\" And I'm saying this, not [inaudible 01:11:16] but it might be an advantage. These days, fewer people write, because I think a lot of people find it hard and more people will do videos. And you can take advantage of some of these shifts, which might be good or bad.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:11:27):\nSo if you're going to be a really well known person on YouTube, you might get more people watching you, but you'll have a lot more competition. And the last thing is that for me, writing, especially with software engineers, it's really efficient, because I can scan through it. I don't like YouTube videos, especially for learning about stuff, because I can't even scan through the whole thing. It's just really time consuming.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:11:47):\nSo I think, decide if you want to do entertainment, which for these podcast listeners, I don't think that's in the question, you're competing with the likes of Spotify and Netflix. Education, which is a little bit more dry, but it's really useful. Or edutainment, which is entertaining education. And once you figure that out, either if it's education or edutainment, you can figure out what format might work both for the medium and for you. And at end of the day, you need to enjoy it. I personally have learned over time to love writing. I love being in the zone. So for me it's not really work, but it's fun. And once you find that thing, whatever that might be, it just makes it easier.\n\nLenny (01:12:27):\nGergely, it's always so fun talking about newsletter stuff. I don't have many people to talk about this life with. I hope this was useful to people who are exploring this path, thinking about it, or even the different creator path. Just two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nGergely Orosz (01:12:45):\nYou can find me at pragmaticengineer.com. There is a bunch of stuff listed there from the Twitter, LinkedIn, my talent collective, some of the companies that I invest in, et cetera. Everything's there. And you can also sign up to my newsletter. Listeners being useful to me... If you work in tech, consider signing up to my newsletter. I always tell people we're a complimentary newsletter. If you work in product or have an interest in product [inaudible 01:13:11] newsletter is an awesome choice. With software engineering management, it goes the other way. And it's not just... People are telling me when they're data scientists or even product folks, sometimes they get some value out of it.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:13:23):\nI write this column called the scoop every Thursday. If you hear of any interesting scoop happening, especially relevant for techies, this might be some change in the workplace, like your company is just rolling out agile [inaudible 01:13:36] team at Twitter did, feel free to ping me, just a short search for sending scoop to the Pragmatic Engineer. I treat everything as anonymous, so you can tell me interesting stuff. I'm typically interested in the stuff that you might not read about in the traditional media, but us techies really care about.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:13:51):\nAnd finally, if you work at Google and you want anonymity to talk to me, just ping me, because one of my next articles will be Google's engineering culture. I wrote one about Facebook, one about Amazon, and I tried to talk with mostly software engineers to get a sense of how these companies work from a software engineer and engineer manager perspective.\n\nLenny (01:14:11):\nAwesome. I hope this comes out before that post comes out, but if not, then enjoy that post. Gergely, thank you so much for being here. This was awesome. And maybe we'll do a V2 as things continue to grow.\n\nGergely Orosz (01:14:23):\nAwesome. It was great being here, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:14:27):\nThank you so much for listening.
