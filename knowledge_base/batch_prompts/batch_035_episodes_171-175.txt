One of the most legendary launch events in startup history. Just looking back at that, any lessons from what you did right to get people to pay attention?\n\nMarc Benioff (00:09):\nI'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17):\nYour stock is at an all-time high. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow.\n\nMarc Benioff (00:24):\nI actually never look at the stock. I find the stock to be very distracting. The stock isn't the goal. That's not why we're doing this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30):\nAI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime. When was the moment for you where you started to realize this?\n\nMarc Benioff (00:38):\nI keep having these existential freakout moments about AI. This is really moving fast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44):\nAs a founder, you're just like, \"Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?\"\n\nMarc Benioff (00:50):\nNo, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. You want the mindset of, \"Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01):\nToday, my guest is Marc Benioff. He's co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, which is the second largest B2B SaaS company in the world worth around $350 billion at the time of this recording, making $35 billion a year in revenue, and 25 years later, is still growing like crazy and dominating the market. In our conversation, we talk about leadership, AI, domain names, beginner's mind, marketing, product, sales, the hardest moment in Marc's journey of building Salesforce. Also, what exactly is an agent and so much more. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nMarc Benioff (04:00):\nExcited to finally get connected with you and excited to do this podcast with you too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:04):\nI'm even more excited, and I actually want to start with something that I think most people don't know about you, but to me, it's almost like a microcosm of how far ahead you look and almost how... basically, how visionary you are, and that's that you've owned a number of epic domain names. For example, bill.com, you.com-\n\nMarc Benioff (04:26):\nYou.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:26):\n... code.com, appstore.com. First of all, are there others I don't know about?\n\nMarc Benioff (04:28):\nThere's a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:29):\nOkay.\n\nMarc Benioff (04:30):\nSalesforce.com.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:30):\nSalesforce.com.\n\nMarc Benioff (04:32):\nThat all came from... I'll tell you. It's a good story actually because what happened was I was working at Oracle for 10 years from 1986, and 1996 rolled around like it was a snap of the fingers. All of a sudden, I realized, \"Whoa, what has just happened to the last decade?\" The decade just flew by. It was crazy. It was a big moment for me in my career, and I had a... It was a huge acceleration. I went from being a kid right out of college to working for Larry Ellison. But after 10 years, I was pretty trashed, and so I said to Larry, \"Hey, I need to go and take some time off.\"\n\n(05:13):\nSo I went to Hawaii and rented a little house on the beach. I had done some angel investing, and it was a cool moment where some of my companies started to go public, including Siebel Systems and others, and Saba Software, and people I had met at Oracle like Tom Siebel and Bobby Yazdani. Then, I was just fascinated at that point with the internet. I had been working on it at Oracle for a couple years, so I started buying a bunch of domain names of companies that I thought companies. They weren't companies yet. Now, they are companies. But ideas that I thought the names would be great companies one day and reflected where I thought things were going. Yeah. It's a long time ago now. It's a really long, long time ago. I think almost 30 years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (06:00):\nSo one of the domain names you owned was appstore.com, which I know you gifted to Steve Jobs, I read in your book. Is there a story there that you could share because that's an epic domain just to gift?\n\nMarc Benioff (06:09):\nIt's a great story, but it's really a story about my relationship with Steve Jobs. When I was in college in 1984, I had the opportunity to be an intern at Apple. I wrote the first native assembly language on the Macintosh. It's a crazy thing to be able to say, but it's true that I was writing these example programs for this Macintosh 68000 Development System on these Apple headquarter buildings in Bandley, Bandley Road in Cupertino and started to have a relationship with Steve Jobs in that... Not that I was actually talking to him. I was like this snot-nosed 19-year-old kid, but he's running around the building. We have this refrigerator over here with all these fruit juices. There's a masseuse over here doing shots and massages. There's a motorcycle in the lobby. There's a pirate flag on the roof, and there's Steve Jobs running around, yelling at everybody, and it was freaking cool.\n\n(07:10):\nOkay. So you can just imagine like you're like, \"Whoa, this is like I'm in a movie.\" There's a lot of other cool parts of a movie too that were going on, and it started my relationship with him, and then I actually got to know him then as I eventually got to Oracle. Then, eventually, I started Salesforce, and I had this moment at Salesforce. It was, I think, 2000, 2001. I cannot remember exactly what it was, and we were at the opening of one of his movies for Pixar, and we're having dinner. There's a lot of details around the dinner. It'll be a hugely long story if I go forever.\n\n(07:56):\nHe says to me, \"Well, Marc, now, listen to me. You're doing so great. You've got your company, Salesforce. If you need any help, you make sure you call me, okay?\" I'm like, \"Yes, sir. I will do that.\" He took out his... He had just introduced the iPod, and he's like, \"I got a thousand songs in my pocket here. Look at this, and that, and all that.\" It's this cool device. I'm like, \"That's such a cool screen. Steve.\" He goes, \"Oh, thanks so much.\" I go, \"Steve, you could do movies on there too, not just... or photos. You didn't have to do songs.\" \"No, Marc. I will never do a device like that. Absolutely not.\"\n\n(08:34):\nThat's a little insight into his personality that he would never ever exactly say, \"Oh, yeah, I'm going to do the movie device that have the photo, the phone, the this.\" So, anyway. Things were moving along at Salesforce, and so I was like, \"I'm stuck, and I need to get through my block, writer's block, entrepreneur's block. I'm going to reach out to him.\" He's like, \"Come down here right away.\"\n\n(09:03):\nSo, literally, I got in my car, brought a few of my team with me, and we go down, and he's like, \"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're blocked. There's three things you need to do right now.\" I'm like, \"Okay. What are they?\" He go, \"Your company, it better get 10 times larger than it is now in 24 months or it's over.\" \"Oh, okay. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\" \"Number two, you better sign a huge customer for this Salesforce automation product like Avon. They're a great salesforce.\" The CEO of Avon was on his board at the time, so that was on his mind. \"And one last thing I'm going to tell you you must do.\" I'm like, \"Yes, sir. What is it?\" \"You better go build an application economy.\" \"An application economy?\" \"Yes.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"I don't know, but you're going to go figure it out.\"\n\n(09:55):\nIt was like meeting with your guru and getting a Zencon or something where you're... Now, you have a puzzle I have to solve. I literally went away, and I had all the notes from the meeting. I went through it over and over again. Then, finally, I'm like, \"I think he wants me to build an app store.\" At that moment, I went to the domain registry, and I bought appstore.com. Then, I started working on it at Salesforce so that we would have the ability with our platform to build apps, and then sell them, and that you could do all these things.\n\n(10:34):\nSo I did all that and launched AppExchange in 2005 or 2006. We didn't call it App Store because when we tested the App Store name in focus groups, customers are like, \"This is not an app store. This is an app exchange. We're all going to exchange apps and capabilities with each other.\" Anyway, it rolled out, iPhone rolled out, and then he basically said to me one day, \"Hey, come down and see me.\" This is maybe a year after iPhone. I'm like, \"I'll be right down.\"\n\n(11:08):\nI get down there, and I have some team members with me. They'd heard this story before, et cetera, and then we're sitting there like this in the Apple Auditorium. It's not like in a hotel or anything. I remember it very clearly like it was yesterday. He said, \"I brought you all down here today.\" It's very good theatrical performance. I could never do what he does. It's incredible. He's got the thing, and then he says, \"And I'm here to reveal to you the App Store.\" All of our people go, \"Huh.\" They're doing break breath, and they're all like... go white because they're like, \"Oh, Marc has been talking about App Store for years. How could Steve even...\"\n\n(11:51):\nThen, at the end of it... It's all over. Everyone leaves the auditorium. They're all going out to play with the App Store and all these things. I walked down. He's sitting down there by himself working on something. He's in the corner of the stage. I go, \"Hey, Steve. Can I talk to you for a second?\" He goes, \"Of course.\" Very generous with me. Very kind with me. I go, \"Steve, I'm going to give you a gift.\" \"Wow, but Marc, what are you are going to give me?\" \"Steve, I'm going to give you something you don't have, but maybe you'll need, which is the appstore.com URL, appstore.com, and the trademark for App Store because after that meeting we had six years ago, I ended up trademarking these things and buying this URL.\" He's like, \"Oh, it's very nice, but you know this App Store thing isn't going to be very big. Whatever, but thank you very much.\" That was the story of App Store. It's amazing. It was a very amazing relationship that I had with him. Very grateful to have that relationship and dramatically influenced me in my career and my whole life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (12:59):\nThere's one thread that I love about everything you shared. Here is how generosity was at the center of so much of this, him helping you, you helping him, just wanting to help each other.\n\nMarc Benioff (13:08):\nHe is a very generous person, and I'll tell you that he never turned down anything that I asked him to do. I have so many stories, but one story was I was thinking about buying this house, and I wasn't sure should I buy this house, Should I not buy this house, whatever, and so he went... He said, \"I'll go look at it for you.\" So he went, he is looking at this house, and then he calls me, and he goes, \"Well, I don't know if you should do this or that, but this might be good. Maybe it is good. Maybe it is a good idea.\"\n\n(13:41):\nThen, I'm emailing with him after that, and he's very sick, and it's all very sad. Then, he sends me an email, and the last email he sent to me was he said... I said, \"Wow. Well, this has worked out better than I thought.\" He goes, \"Marc, everything has worked out so much better than we could have ever imagined.\" It was just a beautiful thought and incredibly sad all at the same moment, and that was my last correspondence with him.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:14):\nI feel like we could do Steve Jobs stories all day.\n\nMarc Benioff (14:16):\nYeah. Oh, no, I have hours.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:19):\nYes, you can.\n\nMarc Benioff (14:20):\nI have a lot of Steve Jobs stories, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:21):\nOh, man.\n\nMarc Benioff (14:22):\nYeah. Anyway, those are a couple of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:24):\nBy the way, I also love that he had B2B SaaS advice here like, \"You need a big customer. You need to hire ACVs, build the marketplace.\"\n\nMarc Benioff (14:30):\nOh, he hated those. He hated SaaS, and he hated that I was doing enterprise software.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:31):\nYeah, he did.\n\nMarc Benioff (14:35):\nHe's trying to talk me out of being an enterprise software executive. He's like, \"Now, Marc, what are you going to do? You're going to go home and tell your kids that you're working on enterprise software? Who do you sell to, CIOs? Have you had met them? How can you be doing this? I can't imagine a more horrible career.\" I'm like, \"I love it, Steve.\" \"No, Marc, you cannot love this. This is not great.\" It was really a funny thing. He really disliked that, but yet, he was incredibly supportive of me. He would call me all the time. It was really amazing, actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:06):\nYeah. It feels like a place he was wrong in the end here, which is cool, cool to know. I want to go in a different direction.\n\nMarc Benioff (15:12):\nHe was rarely wrong, by the way, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:14):\nHe was rarely wrong with B2B SaaS. $350 billion of value. Who would've known it existed? Speaking of that, so I want to zoom back to the beginning of Salesforce and when you launched Salesforce. It's crazy to think back to that when basically, you were trying to convince people the future of software was not desktop software, it was going to be in the cloud, it was SaaS. You had all these end of software logos. You had mascots walking around with this no software thing. You hired fake protesters at... I think it was Siebel's conference. It was very hard.\n\nMarc Benioff (15:44):\nI think you read one of my books, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:46):\nI know the history of a lot of these things.\n\nMarc Benioff (15:48):\nOh, okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:49):\nIt's one of the most legendary launch events in startup history, so I've heard of it many times at this point.\n\nMarc Benioff (15:54):\nIt was a crazy moment. I mean, Siebel, who was really the enterprise software company doing CRM, was doing a user conference. I was looking for an opportunity to launch our product, so we hired a bunch of actors. They were doing this event in San Francisco, and San Francisco is very woke, so people expect a good protest. So we got some picket signs at Home Depot and made some signs that said, \"The end of software is near,\" and all kinds of other... \"No software,\" and all these things. We had a lot of funny things on signs. We were running a protest outside of Siebel that they were in the software business, but we were like, \"Oh, no, we've got to get out of software. We've got to create the end of software.\" So we have picketers outside of the streets.\n\n(16:50):\nAnyway, he comes out himself out of the building and really gets super upset. Right then, we hit a button, and we have other actors in a van who come out, and they are staging themselves as news crew. So they are like KNMS, K No More Software, and we're like... They're interviewing the protesters. So now he thinks that it's a media thing. He calls the police. He got very upset. He's a great guy. By the way, I love Tom Siebel. I think he's also one of the great entrepreneurs of our generation. He's just fuming, and he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't exactly know it's us, and we're just having the best time. That night, we had our huge launch event at one of the top theaters in San Francisco. We hired a great band, and it was really... We just had so much fun. It was just a really great time. That was all happened. I remember very well. It was February 22nd of 2001 or 2000, 2000, February 22nd, 2000.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:06):\nI love this. I haven't heard that interview, the reporter part of that story before.\n\nMarc Benioff (18:10):\nIt was crazy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:12):\nI love it, and it sounds frivolous potentially, but I think the genius of this that I want to touch on is-\n\nMarc Benioff (18:18):\n\"Frivolous\" is a good word. It probably was frivolous.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:21):\nSo what I imagine is you're trying to get people to even know Salesforce exists, to differentiate, to get the name out, and I feel like that's something a lot of founders struggle with. They don't really know how to get their name out, how to get people to pay attention. Just looking back at that success, I guess, just any lessons from what you did right to get the word \"Salesforce\" out to get people to pay attention at all to what you were doing?\n\nMarc Benioff (18:42):\nWell, it's a noisy world, Lenny, and you can see that. You can get on Twitter. It's like... I mean, there's a lot of noise, and how do you break through? We have that challenge today. We're introducing a huge new product called Agentforce. I've only been working on it for a couple months now. I introduced it at our Dreamforce Conference, and that was one way to break through, which was I took our conference and said, \"It's just going to be about Agentforce.\" I'm trying to think about, \"What are all the things I need to do to get my company 100% on Agentforce, my customers, everyone?\" because I know I have a window of opportunity here.\n\n(19:25):\nWe're first, we're ahead. We have hundreds of customers on this now. We're on it, which is amazing. We've moved our whole help infrastructure to Agentforce. We're seeing incredible results. We've cut our human escalation from our support infrastructure down by 50%. We're resolving 83% of all of our inquiries robotically. It's incredible. So, now, how do I get that message out? How do I do it globally? How do I find my KNMS moment where I can come up with something that's viral and exciting?\n\n(20:04):\nI'm trying lots of different things. I have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson who are two friends of mine helping me. So they said, \"We'll cut ads for you.\" They have not been together in an ad ever, and they haven't done anything together since True Detective. They're friends of mine. Again, very generous people to agree to do this. We've shot three ads so far. I put them out on Twitter to get feedback from folks. Is this a good idea?\n\n(20:35):\nI am running this help.salesforce.com to show what we can do with it. Is that a good idea? I'm training all my salespeople in how to sell it. Is that a good idea? I'm running aggressive marketing against Microsoft because they have really a terrible product, Copilot, that I have to position against and market against. Is that a good idea? Should I be marketing and positioning against them?\n\n(20:58):\nI'm trying lots of things, and what I'm trying to do, Lenny, is what I recommend to all entrepreneurs. The message is really in the medium here, which is that I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy. I don't know actually which one of those things is going to be the most important thing in launching this product, so I'm trying a lot of things with that old expression. I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. Then, once I find that thing, I will then grow that as my strategy, and that is what I'm trying to do.\n\n(21:33):\nI'm even expanding my distribution organization. I'm trying to hire an additional one to 2,000 account executives just to focus on Agentforce. So I'm trying to do everything I can to get that light switch to go on where I can show customers this is an incredible opportunity to lower your cost, to make things better, and to show that for the first time, we can have digital labor, that Salesforce isn't just managing your data, but we're a digital labor provider. So this is that moment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (22:03):\nThere's so much there that I love, this idea of trying a bunch of things, looking for the tactic that becomes your strategy. It feels like also there's this focus of just go all in and focus on this one thing, and then try a bunch of different ways for this one thing that you're focused on to win. There's also an element of... I just had Seth Godin on the podcast, and one of his big lessons is be remarkable. Create something people remark about. So this celeb-oriented ad that you're working on, I think, is a really good example of that.\n\nMarc Benioff (22:31):\nWell, that is a key thought though that he's saying, which is you got to find it, but finding that is the hard part, so you got to be like... One of my friends is Chris Rock, the comedian. So what he'll do is he just doesn't go out and do a Netflix special with all of his jokes. He's out there testing his jokes in clubs and doing all kinds of crazy things. I won't go through all the crazy stuff he does to test his jokes, but by the time it gets to the big Netflix special, he knows what works and what doesn't work. So that is something that we all have to do as entrepreneurs. We need to be testing lots of things. We need a lot of experimentation, and we can't be too arrogant.\n\n(23:15):\nI think another thing that's extremely important is... I have a pretty deep meditation practice for three, four decades which is we have to be cultivating our beginner's mind. We have to use our mindfulness in a way to clear everything out and then get back to, \"What is my beginner's mind?\" In the beginner's mind, I have every possibility, but in the expert's mind, I have few, and in some cases, maybe none. So I've been doing this a long time. I've been writing software since I'm 15. I'm now 60. That's 45 years. I don't want to have an expert's mind. I want to have a beginner's mind, and how do I have that beginner's mind? Because those ideas will come at me if I can go, \"What could work?\" rather than saying, \"Oh, I know what is going to work,\" or, \"This is the one thing that is going to definitely work,\" or, \"We have to do this.\"\n\n(24:10):\nAs soon as you start using words like that, you know that you're going to completely implode and fail. You have to say, \"Here, we have to do all these things.\" Like in my company right now, we just did this all-hands call. I was like, \"There's six things I really want to get done,\" but one thing is I didn't get everybody focused on Agentforce and really watch the energy. Number two is I need to find more fuel in the company to fuel this idea because this is clearly a breakthrough product, so how do I get everyone focused on it? Number three, where I think it's really important, we need more distribution capability. We don't sell through franchises. We're not selling through dealers, resellers. We sell direct, so I know I need more account executives.\n\n(24:56):\nNumber four is I need to be telling lots of customer stories. So, number one, customer zero, me, and number two is I need to tell you all the stories. Like, you can see the story of Disney. I'm doing a huge amount of AI work for them and Agentforce work. Let me tell you the story about Disney. I need to tell you that story, and then we have this whole ecosystem of people around the company called Trailblazers, millions of them, who know our platform. They all have to become agentblazers.\n\n(25:23):\nThe last thing is I just shipped the product into all 135,000 Salesforce customers. So it's their nascent, and they need to flick it on. I need to motivate them to turn it on. These are the six things I'm thinking about all the time. So it's not just one thing. I'm trying to figure out what it is, and I need a beginner's mind to assess how do I move forward, how do I evolve, how do I inspire, how do I motivate, how do I energize.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (25:51):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. I use Coda every day to coordinate my podcasting and newsletter workflows from collecting questions for guests to storing all my research to managing my newsletter content calendar.

Coda.io/lenny.\n\n(26:57):\nI love this idea of beginner's mind. I imagine it's very difficult to operationalize, especially for a company at 25 years old at this point. Obviously, you meditate. You put a lot of effort and focus into building this. It's hard to do that within a company. Is there anything you do with meetings, with leadership, with the way you operate that spreads this way of thinking within the org?\n\nMarc Benioff (27:18):\nWell, Salesforce is now the second largest software company in the world, but also the second largest software company in Japan, and that's a country where I put a lot of time and energy into. I love going there. I love going to Kyoto. When I go to Kyoto, I like to go to some of these amazing Zen temples. By the way, that's one of the things that Steve Jobs love to do, and he used to go to these great sushi restaurants. There's a great one in Kyoto named Sushiiwa. If you go in there, you'll see he's signed something for them. It says, \"All good things. Steve Jobs.\" I said, \"What did he do over here?\" He would go to this great sushi restaurant, and then he would go to Ryōan-ji, the Rock Garden Temple. Incredible metaphysical temple.\n\n(28:04):\nI've gone there. I've gone there for decades. I've brought a lot of friends of mine there. Yeah. You got to clear your mind and let it come in. You got to receive it. You need to listen. I remember I even brought Neil Young there, the musician. He's one of my favorite people in the world, and obviously, I love his music. His soundtrack is the soundtrack of my entire life. We were sitting there, and he was so deep in meditation, and then he started walking around. The temple was closing, and then he was in the zone, and I didn't want to bother him, but I'm like, \"You know, I think we got to go.\"\n\n(28:38):\nAnyway, it turned out he had written a whole album while we were there in his head, and he was basically transcribing it all. This incredible creative process. Look, we're all writing an album in our head. What album are you writing? What music are you writing? How are you getting into that zone yourself? You want to be a great entrepreneur. You want to be a great CEO. You got to clear your mind, and you got to be ready to write that music.\n\n(29:06):\nThat music could be your business plan, your product plan, your product launch plan like we're talking about for my Agentforce product. That's what we're all trying to do, and I use a place like Kyoto as a place to do that also because geography is important. Where you are matters. I know you're in Marin, so Marin County. Maybe you can go out to the top of Mount Tam. Maybe you go to Spirit Rock with Jack Kornfield and go clear your mind there, but you got to find the place to do that and create the location. It may not be in the office. It may be somewhere else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:41):\nBy the way, you have the most amazing friends list. All these folks you mentioned, I've met.\n\nMarc Benioff (29:41):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:49):\nI don't know how long this goes. [inaudible 00:29:49].\n\nMarc Benioff (29:48):\nThey are cool. I am lucky that I've met a lot of cool people. Yeah. I don't know how I got so lucky to meet some of these people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:53):\nI want to zoom out a little bit and talk about... Every month or so, I hear about a startup, I do a bunch of angel investing, that's trying to basically disrupt Salesforce, come after Salesforce. They bash your... don't kill me for saying this, your user experience. They're like, \"Oh, so complicated. It's been around three to five years.\"\n\nMarc Benioff (30:11):\nWe are too complicated. I agree.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:12):\nOkay. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow. We're recording this today, and your stock is at an all-time high basically even now.\n\nMarc Benioff (30:25):\nWow, I didn't even know that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:27):\nRoughly.\n\nMarc Benioff (30:29):\nI actually never look at the stock.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:29):\nOkay.\n\nMarc Benioff (30:31):\nI find the stock to be very distracting, and I encourage my employees also don't look at the stock because the stock is just a reflection. Money isn't the goal, right? The stock isn't the goal. It's coming at the end of the journey. It's like that's not why we're doing this. The journey is the reward. That's also something Steve Jobs would say all the time. Another bow to Steve Jobs here. I think that this is really important, and I look at myself as a startup.\n\n(31:05):\nI am a startup CEO. I'm a startup entrepreneur. I'm still at the beginning of Salesforce. No matter what I'm doing at Salesforce, whether I'm the CEO, I'm sometimes the chair of the board. Like, last week, we had a board meeting. Sometimes I'm a product manager. This is a startup, and we're a 25-year-old, 75,000-person, $38 billion, $300 something billion market cap startup, but we're a startup nonetheless. We have some great products, but we are just starting. As an example, Lenny, we are just starting the digital labor industry, and we have a product called Agentforce, and we are just starting. We are just at the beginning.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (31:47):\nI want to bounce around a little bit, but let's talk about Agentforce. I know this is, as you've said, the thing you're most focused on right now. It's a big bet you all are taking. When people hear this word \"agent,\" I think a lot of people are embarrassed to even ask like, \"What does that even look like? What is an agent beyond what LLMs are today?\" Is there an example you could give of something you've seen that maybe blew your mind of what an agent can do?\n\nMarc Benioff (32:09):\nYeah. I saw it in the movies. I saw it in Minority Report, which was a movie that was co-written by our futurist, Peter Schwartz. Tom Cruise runs into the Gap store, and all of a sudden, it says, \"Hey. Hey, Tom. Have you thought about this new shirt? Look at these jeans. You bought this last time. Now, you could try this. You could try that. What about this? What about that?\" It knew his history. It understood him. It knew what was going on. This is 20 years ago. This whole store changes digitally to reflect his interest, his ideas, and it's starting to talk to him and work with him.\n\n(32:51):\nThat is an agent. It isn't just the agent that we saw in the Matrix, Mr. Smith, or whatever it is. It's someone that's working with you, someone. That's an interesting, for you, slip. It's something that is working with you. It could be your piece of software in your phone. It could be a robot that's going to be in your home. It could be your car that knows you, understands your preferences, has an institutional memory of you, and now is helping to advise you.\n\n(33:22):\nI'll give you an example that I'm going to... I go into UCSF all the time. I'm actually just getting through an Achilles rupture right now, so I've had a lot of interactions, and the hospital... or you're getting your healthcare, getting your labs done, getting your physical done, getting your scans done, whatever it is. There's always these pre-operative and post-operative or pre-procedure and post-procedure things, and you're getting these phone calls. Every time I get a phone call, I'm like, \"Ugh, that probably just cost them a hundred bucks, and we probably could do that a lot cheaper and a lot easier with an agent.\"\n\n(33:58):\nThen, when I talk to my doctors and nurses at UCSF, they're all burnt out post-pandemic because they're scheduling pajama time to go through all their digital messages at night. It's like a lot of this could be done a lot easier with agents and AI, and we're going to make their lives a lot better, a lot easier, simpler. Some of those things that they're doing, they don't need to talk to me about what my cholesterol number is because I got my labs, and the cholesterol number is this number or that number. A lot of this can be done with technology, and then save the parts that are important for them like when I come to see them or I want to have a real, deeper, more empathetic conversation face-to-face with a deeply experienced doctor. That's a whole another opportunity for me.\n\n(34:45):\nThat is an agent or the agent is like... Here's an example. I had a CT scan, and you have to drink this contrast, and then all of a sudden, the... drink it, but they give it to you through an IV, and then they're taking better pictures. But then, you have to drink water to flush the contrast out of your body. Do you think anyone called me and said, \"Hey, did you drink the water?\" No, nobody calls me to drink the water. You have to remember. You're on your own in healthcare in the US. So the agent is going to call you and say, \"Hey, did you drink the water? Did you take your meds? Do you need to have a repeat lab? Do you need to go see your doctor again?\" So the agent is going to be there by your side. So that's an healthcare example. There's a lot of examples that we can probably have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (35:25):\nThere's just a story in The New York Times which isn't about agents specifically. It was about comparing ChatGPT to a doctor where they tested a doctor's ability to diagnose versus a ChatGPT directly or a doctor plus ChatGPT. By far, the best was just ChatGPT, removing the doctor from the equation.\n\nMarc Benioff (35:43):\nYeah. They wrote up a clinical study where they actually did look at, in a semi-peer-reviewed way, that ChatGPT, in many cases, was giving more accurate diagnoses than a doctor because the doctor had a more bias coming in working with the patient. So that's super interesting and I think something that we should probably all look at that study and think about that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (36:09):\nSpeaking of The New York Times, there's actually this quote I found. You did this op-ed talking about AI. So the quote is, \"Throughout my career in Silicon Valley, I've witnessed numerous waves of innovation, but none compared to the profound impact of AI. AI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime.\" When was the moment for you where you started to realize this where it's like, \"Oh shit, this is not just another cool toy?\"\n\nMarc Benioff (36:33):\nWell, I keep having these existential freakout moments about AI, and it's happened over a series of decades. But for those of us who grew up with these movies like WarGames and Minority Report or Her or... across the board or read some of these books. One of my favorite books on AI is Ghost Fleet. You think about, \"Where are we going with AI? Where are we going with AI?\" With Salesforce, I think about our journey, and I've been waiting for this to happen and trying to bring us along, especially in the last decade with the development of our Einstein platform, and now the development of our Agentforce platform.\n\n(37:18):\nThis week, at Salesforce, we'll probably do about 2 trillion AI transactions. With our total now, Einstein and Agentforce platforms, we're definitely the largest provider of enterprise AI transactions in the world as far as I could tell, and I keep thinking, \"Wow, this is going to get more and more intense.\" One step was we had to automate all these customer touch points. So like wearing my Disney fanboy shirt here, we run the Disney Store and the Disney Guides, and there's Disney Real Estate, and there's the DisneyQuest call center, and there's... Every aspect of Disney. When you're a customer, you're interfacing with Salesforce.\n\n(38:00):\nSo that's what we've loved doing, automating all these customer touch points: sales, service, marketing, analytics, Slack, integrating it all with MuleSoft. That's what we do, and then aggregating it all into a big database where we call it data cloud, and then federating that data cloud to other data sources. So that's the two steps we've been doing, automate the customer touch points, aggregate the data, and then step three is the agentic platform on top of that.\n\n(38:29):\nWhen you think about what's happening now that you can go to help.salesforce.com and have your issues resolved with that on the agentic layer, that's amazing. Then, the fourth layer that will come will be the robotic drone layer where those robots and drones will then feed off of the platform and all of these capabilities. That vision of the future is something that we've all had in the industry for years. It's not my magic vision. This is a vision that's been around. It's been the fundamentals of computer science that we would move from having... We'd go from data to automation, and that is what we're all driving, and we're driving that industry. We're going lower cost, easier to use, and more automated constantly. That's powerful. This is really moving fast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:21):\nYou mentioned Einstein briefly. I'll also mention my dog is named Einstein, and I got Einstein swag once with the socks, and I love them, so. Also, that's also an example of you bought einstein.com very early.\n\nMarc Benioff (39:33):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:34):\nThat was another domain name that you owned.\n\nMarc Benioff (39:36):\nWell, I just thought Einstein would be a great name to talk about artificial intelligence, and it really has been. There. You can see him behind me right on my shelf, on my bookshelf. I keep him back there. You see Einstein? I think they were [inaudible 00:39:50].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:36):\nMy view is blocked.\n\nMarc Benioff (39:36):\nOh, I'll go grab him.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:52):\nTotally. Okay. Let's check it out.\n\nMarc Benioff (39:54):\nThere he is. Ugh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:55):\nShow and tell Segment in the podcast.\n\nMarc Benioff (39:55):\nOh, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:59):\nOh, cute.\n\nMarc Benioff (40:00):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (40:00):\nThat's a big old Einstein.\n\nMarc Benioff (40:02):\nThat's a key part of our vision for Salesforce, our Einstein platform was everything we're doing. We wouldn't get to Agentforce without getting to good old Einstein here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (40:12):\nVery cute. As you talk about all this, I imagine many people are thinking, \"Oh shit, we're not going to have as many people working. What are we going to do with our jobs? AI as agents.\" I know anything you say could be taken way out of context and just like, \"Marc Benioff says everyone is not working,\" but I guess just... I know you've said you're not going to be hiring as many engineers next year. I guess anything there to help people understand how the workforce will change in the future?\n\nMarc Benioff (40:35):\nWell, I can tell you about my own company and what I'm telling my own employees, which is that, yeah, we're going to have to rebalance some of our workforce because you can see it in the numbers I just gave you which is we need less support engineers because we have a robotic support layer with Agentforce. So that is very real, and we all need to adapt. At the same time, I'm hiring a lot more account executives and folks to grow the company. So I just encouraged everybody on the all-hands call to think about that.\n\n(41:06):\nThen, I just gave you the idea of healthcare. The interesting thing about healthcare though is that a lot of the jobs that I think that are going to get created just... we don't have people for, and I think there's a lot of things that we need help with in the world that we don't have people for. So I think a lot of these jobs will not necessarily get replaced, and I think that... I have a home in a small town, and in this small town... It's very much a blue-collar town. Folks are still working in the restaurants, driving trucks, working in the supermarket, and working on their homes, building, construction, gardening.\n\n(41:56):\nLook, it's going to be a long time before, I think, jobs in the small town where I have a home will ever get impacted. But in the large town where I have a home, San Francisco, well, then I just gave you an example where I think that jobs will get impacted. So it'll be a tale of two cities, literally, and I think you will see different impacts in different places.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (42:21):\nSo what I'm hearing there is support people trending down, account executive sales trending up?\n\nMarc Benioff (42:27):\nRight now, that is Salesforce in a nutshell.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (42:31):\nThat touches on something I wanted to touch on also which is that you're... A lot of founders today are very product-minded, very product-oriented founders, and they want to build product-first companies, grow product-led, all these things. Salesforce, I think, very publicly, is very sales-led, very marketing-led, not product-led. Obviously, product is a core part of it, and it all works together, and all these things. But I guess just any advice for founders that are very product-oriented and maybe are hesitant to lean into sales, into cust-\n\nMarc Benioff (42:57):\nYeah. I would say we're not sales-led. Well, I think let's just use Agentforce as an example, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:01):\nMm.\n\nMarc Benioff (43:01):\nSo we're running the year, we're running this year. This is our fiscal year 25. Okay? It ends in the end of January next year. Lenny, this is the year of data cloud. This was not supposed to be the year of Agentforce. So it's the year of data cloud. I just gave you the pitch. We've automated all the customer touch points. Now, we're adding the data cloud to all of our customer implementations. We have 135,000 customers. We've implemented data cloud into all of them. They all need to turn it on. Our teams need to show our customers how to build data cloud and how it's going to help our customers have a better data structure. I almost combined \"beta\" and \"data\" together. So they need a better data structure, data architectures, data cultures.\n\n(43:51):\nThen, we had our breakthrough, and I can tell you the story where all of a sudden, I'm like, \"Wow, this agent technology is happening much faster than I thought it was going to, and we are going to market now.\" By the time we get to Dreamforce, we are going to take this incredible technology. We accelerated it radically because we bought this company called Airkit, which is one of our Ohana... It's a great story.\n\n(44:18):\nGreat entrepreneur have this company, fantastic company called RelateIQ that we bought many years ago, about 10 years ago, stayed with us for many years, like six or seven years, wanted to leave, and we said, \"Great.\" We gave them the investment to leave, invested in the company through Salesforce Ventures, built this amazing platform, and then we said, \"Now, we want to buy it back.\" Then, he came back about a year ago, and then it just accelerated the agent vision, and then we delivered Agentforce production code at the end of October. So, all of a sudden, now, we are releasing this product.\n\n(44:56):\nI think it's very important, if you're an entrepreneur, to realize it's not just about the product. It's not just about sales. It's not just about marketing. It's not just about accounting. It's not just about your investors. It's not just about your employees. It's not just about your stakeholders. It's about everything, so you better be ready to be an orchestra leader. You can't just be playing the clarinet.\n\n(45:20):\nI think that's what you're getting to, which is that there's entrepreneurs who are like, \"I'm just going to play the clarinet.\" For those, I don't think they're going to go as far as they could go. You want to be playing the whole symphony, and you want to get everyone running. That symphony is sales, service, marketing, product. Every part of your shareholders, your stakeholders, your customers. You have to be constantly playing the whole symphony, and you have to have a big mind to think about, \"Whoa, I have a lot of stakeholders in my company, not just one stakeholder.\" It's not just about product and technology. If you're going to narrowcast yourself, you're doing a disservice not just to yourself, but to everybody else as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (46:02):\nSpeaking of big mind and beginner's mind, we have a recurring segment on this podcast that I call Fail Corner. Where it comes from is people come on this podcast, they share all these stories of, \"Everything is going great. We're killing it. I've had all these successes,\" and people get discouraged because they hear just people only succeeding when they often fail. So I try to ask guests to share a story, and let me ask you this. Is there a story you could share when it was a big struggle for you when you're struggling when something went super wrong that you worked through and learned something from?\n\nMarc Benioff (46:35):\nSure. Well, I'll just give this example. About two years ago, we went through this huge transformation in our company, and there were a lot of crazy things that were happening, but it was a little bit like we're all on this Airplane, and everything is going really well. Then, something seems to be going really wrong, and we look up front, and the two pilots seemed to be missing. Then, the one guy with the parachute jumped out of the plane, and then we're all like, \"Whoa, what are we going to do?\" We had to do some really crazy and somewhat destructive things at the moment to basically get the regeneration of the company.\n\n(47:12):\nOne of those things that we did two years ago was we had to architect a layoff, and we had never done a scaled layoff before. We had to lay off 10% of the company to save the company, and I didn't want to do it. I mean, it's the last thing I want to do as an entrepreneur, which is to adjust our headcount, but we were coming out of the pandemic, and we had just hired too many people.\n\n(47:33):\nNow, it turned out that a lot of companies in Silicon Valley all did that same maneuver during the pandemic. Things were so robust in the pandemic that we were overhiring. By the time the pandemic was over, we had too many people. I mean, what did I know? It was my first pandemic. All of a sudden, my next pandemic, I'll know that there's an economic cycle associated with it and an inflation cycle too.\n\n(47:58):\nSo I learned a lot in the pandemic, and now, we're here. Now, all of a sudden, we're architecting two years ago this layoff. Then, when we did the layoff, then I'm trying to overcommunicate. I'm having all employee meetings. It's a complete dumpster fire. It's a nightmare. I'm getting bashed in the press, on Twitter. Everyone is shooting at me. It's like, \"Oh, boy.\" If I had a thick skin, it got a lot thicker during that moment because it's never going to go well no matter what, and it didn't go well but we got through it to the point where you're giving me these accolades, wonderful, on this podcast about where we are today financially and from a structural standpoint or now from product innovation standpoint, but that's not where we were two years ago.\n\n(48:51):\nIt was clear we had to go through a financial transformation, which included an adjustment of our head count, and we had to go through a technology, and a product, and an innovation transformation. Those two things were going to require us to do a number of things, and they were going to be painful. So we all had to go through some of that pain to get the gain that we have now, and that was not easy.\n\n(49:17):\nI was in shock that I was going through this two years ago because I had already been running the company for 23 years. Things were going pretty well. Yes, there were a lot of failures during that period. I just didn't expect another massive issue to hit me. But guess what? There're constantly massive issues coming at you, and there's more coming, and that's the nature.\n\n(49:39):\nMy friend, Michael Bell, is probably the best entrepreneur I know. He says, \"There is no linear success.\" So what that means is that stock chart that you just referred to, there's no up-and-to-the-right perfect chart where it's just one line. I don't care who you are. Apple doesn't have one. No one has one. Okay? There's going to be changes. It could be economic changes. It could be societal changes. It could be the pandemic. There's no up-and-to-the-right. If you think it's only going to be about up and to the right, you're in the wrong business or you have the wrong life. Right? Hey, the monastic life is maybe more for you where you're just out living in that more of that steady state. Right? But if you want more variation where it's not steady state, the entrepreneurial life is a rock-and-roll roller coaster, and you get ready because it's going to be pounding you all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (50:33):\nOne of these people that you described that jumped out of the airplane speaking on the roller coaster ride is your co-CEO, Bret Taylor. What's interesting to me is he's also all-in on agents, and what it makes me think about is there's this meme of what did Ilya see when he left and tried to kick out Sam Altman. I'm curious just like what did you guys see about agents being the future that you're both so committed to this? So interesting.\n\nMarc Benioff (50:54):\nWell, I just think that this idea that agents are one of the most important things that we're all going to work on, and I think everyone is going to go to agents. Look, I just heard about Google today has Agentspace. At first, I was like, \"Well, I guess they like the Agentforce name.\" I love Sundar. He's one of my favorite people in the world. We heard Microsoft now has agents. I read Oracle has agents now. SAP has agents. Everybody's got agents, and good. That's what we want. We don't want to be the only one.\n\n(51:30):\nIf you're the only one and no one else is working on it, you've got a problem, actually. So you don't want to be the only one. You want to be in a market. You don't want to be one company offering a solution and the only one. You want to be in a competitive market where people are competing with you, and you're selling against somebody else, and you're getting better, and you're moving forward. It's like the automobile industry. One of my favorite people is Akio Toyoda. Toyoda-san was now the Chairman of Toyota, was the CEO of Toyota. His grandfather started Toyota. He says, \"Better, better, better. Never best.\" It's the Japanese motto of Kaizen.\n\n(52:10):\nSo we talked about Japanese Shoshin, which means beginner's mind. Now, we're learning another Japanese word here, Kaizen. Kaizen is continuous improvement, and you need to be doing continuous improvement. With where we are right now with agents, every software industry is going to move to agents. We have to just like every software industry... Well, at least in CRM or automating customer touchpoints, data and managing data, and building that data infrastructure, agents. It's all related. We're all moving in the same direction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (52:47):\nI'm just thinking as a founder, you're just like, \"Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?\"\n\nMarc Benioff (52:54):\nNo, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. That is the mindset you want. You want that mindset. You want the mindset of, \"Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing.\" In some ways, you have to be saying, \"I can't wait for the next failure. I can't wait for the next success. I can't wait for the next innovation.\" Oh, well, that's innovation overall, right?\n\n(53:18):\nSee, we're in an industry where technology is constantly getting lower cost, easier to use, and more automated. So if you're doing for two and a half decades, or four decades, or four and a half decades now that I've been doing it... When I started in this industry, I started on a computer called the TRS-80 Model I with 4K of RAM. I was doing a podcast recently, and they're like, \"Well, who did you sell your first piece of software to?\" I said, \"Well, I sold it to CLOAD Magazine in Goleta, California and-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (53:54):\nFor $75.\n\nMarc Benioff (53:54):\nFor $75, and they said, \"Thank you for...\" and then they said, \"Oh, that's great, and did you send them the disk?\" I'm like, \"No, no. There was no disk. CLOAD standard for Cassette Load in BASIC. That was the command in BASIC, C-L-O-A-D, Cassette Load, CLOAD. That was the command. So that was the name of their magazine, and then you would get the cassette every month with five or six things that they had bought from people like me.\" I mean, they didn't know they were buying it from a 15-year-old kid in high school in Burlingame High School California. But I had written the How to Juggle thing, and they bought it for $75. They sent me the one-page agreement, and I signed it. Then, I told my parents, and they're like, \"What? Huh? You're doing what? Oh, okay. That's nice, honey. Great job.\"\n\n(54:45):\nSo they didn't understand. Nobody knew. It was crazy. It was like 1979 or 1978, so nobody knew I was selling software. I was in high school. It was just a moment in time, but I need to have that mindset all the way along which is, \"What is the next great thing? What is the next great success? What is the next great failure?\" You're growing. You're evolving. You're learning from that. That's what you want. You want to have that growth mindset. Right? You want to embrace that. Does it make sense what I said?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (55:21):\nAbsolutely.\n\nMarc Benioff (55:22):\nI jumped on that one little thought. \"Oh, gee, yeah. I've got this now under control, but now I've got agents, so now, what am I going to...\" It's like, \"No, that's what you want.\" By the way, I want what's after that too, and what's after that, and what's after that. That's what's really exciting about the future. It's coming.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (55:43):\nWhy?\n\nMarc Benioff (55:43):\nI want to be... One of our customers said this, and people think I said it. It wasn't me. I want to get to the future first and welcome our customers there. That's what I think is... By the way, that's what I think Elon Musk does so well. He is like... I don't know all the crazy things he's doing to see the future. He's clearly doing some unusual things, but then he's like, \"Yeah, we're going to have robots in the future, and brain machine interfaces, and driving electric cars. All of these things are going to be happening in the future, and I'm going to have 10 companies that are going to do all of them.\" Wow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:23):\nHe's not only thinking about it, he's doing them each.\n\nMarc Benioff (56:26):\nAmazing,\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:27):\nAmazing.\n\nMarc Benioff (56:27):\nNo one like this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:29):\nYeah.\n\nMarc Benioff (56:29):\nNever seen anything like it. I don't understand how it is even possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:34):\nSame. Marc, I know you have to run. This was incredible. I think this is a beautiful place to end it.\n\nMarc Benioff (56:40):\nOh, Lenny, you're so much fun. I've been looking forward to being on your podcast and talk about entrepreneurship, and thanks for everything you're doing for the industry and for entrepreneurs everywhere.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:49):\nSame, Marc Benioff.\n\nMarc Benioff (56:50):\nWe're all so grateful to you. Goodbye now, and welcome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:53):\nI feel the same. Thank you. Bye. Bye, everyone.\n\n(56:56):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# AI and product management | Marily Nika (Meta, Google)\n\n## Transcript\n\nMarily Nika (00:00):\nThere is something called the shiny object trap, and I'm always telling people, \"Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI.\" Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. Once you have identified what that problem is and what that very, very high-level solution is, then reach out and try to figure out how to actually implement it.\n\nLenny (00:28):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Marily Nika. Marily teaches the most popular course on Maven on AI and product management. She's currently product lead at Meta focusing on Metaverse, avatars and identity. Prior to Meta, she was at Google for over eight years working on Google Glass, computer vision and machine learning around speech recognition. In our conversation, we touch on what PMs should be paying attention to when it comes to what's happening in AI. We talk about a bunch of resources that'll help you get started in the world of AI. How AI tools available today can already help you do your job better as a PM.\n\n(01:12):\nWe also get relatively technical into what exactly is a model, how are models trained, all kinds of fun stuff like that. Enjoy this conversation with Marily Nika after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.\n\nSpeaker 3 (01:26):\nThis episode is brought to you by Amplitude. If you're setting up your analytics stack but not using Amplitude, what are you doing? Anyone can sell you analytics while Amplitude unlocks the power of your product and guide you every step of the way.

Amplitude, power to your products.\n\nLenny (01:53):\nThis episode is brought to you by EPPO. EPPO is a next-generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Tenfold and Cameo rely on EPPO to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth in stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. EPPO does all that and more, delivering results quickly and avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.\n\n(02:41):\nEPO lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And EPPO supports test on the front end, the backend, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out EPPO at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10x your experiment velocity.\n\n(03:06):\nMarilee, welcome to the podcast.\n\nMarily Nika (03:08):\nThank you. Hello, thank you for having me.\n\nLenny (03:10):\nIt's very much my pleasure. We've interacted a little bit on Twitter. We've never actually talked before just right now. I've seen your course just all over the place, your course on AI and PM. And so I just thought it'd be really fun to have you on and help us all understand what the hell is happening in AI and especially AI and product. So thanks again for being here.\n\nMarily Nika (03:33):\nYes, thank you. I'm really excited.\n\nLenny (03:36):\nI would love your help as a former full-time PM/everyone listening that is a current PM, to help us understand what is going on with AI and product tech in general and tools in general. Move really fast, if you're trying to pay attention to what's happening, it's really hard to stay up to date on where things are going and it feels especially hard in AI.\n\n(03:57):\nIt feels like there's just something coming out every day. And so I have a bunch of questions along these lines. The first is just like what media do you pay attention to stay on top of what's happening and what's new and what's interesting in the world of AI and machine learning?\n\nMarily Nika (04:11):\nAs you know very well, subscribing to newsletters is something that's really impactful. And of course, I subscribe to your newsletter, but I am a big, big, big fan of the download by MIT Ecology Review or Atelier. And they're not necessarily AI-centric, but what I'm advocating for and what I'm telling people is that in the future everything will be AI by default. So even if you have something that's technology focused, you'll see a lot of AI starting to get sprinkled in there.\n\nLenny (04:40):\nI want to follow up on what you just said there, but maybe we'll save it a little bit. Maybe going in a different direction first, what do you think is overhyped in the space of AI right now? What do you think is under hyped and undervalued?\n\nMarily Nika (04:52):\nI would like to discuss strategy between, which is both under hyped and over hyped at the same time. I was reading this article this morning where there are writers complaining and they're very, very fearful and they think, \"Oh, writing online is going to die. Everything we've studying for is going to be replaced. They're going to take our jobs and so on.\" And I'm just like, \"No, no, no. Charging PT and technology is enhancing our work. It's enhancing us. It does not steal from us.\" So that's what comes across right now. And there are other things that are under hype, but obviously ChatGPT is amazing. I'm using it day to day, but there are other things AI can do in an amazing manner.\n\n(05:34):\nI was reading a research article the other day that said that AI can now detect place. So lie detection, whether I is for security reasons or at work or anything like that is now possible. So I encourage people to go to these newsletters and go to these online blogs, 10 prints and so on, and just read what's happening. It's not all about chat reading, there's more, there's more about AI, but you should read a lot.\n\nLenny (05:58):\nYou mentioned that you use ChatGPT in your work life. Talk about that. What are you actually using it for?\n\nMarily Nika (06:04):\nEven when I'm at work and I am trying to come up with a nice mission statement, when we're PMs will come up with mission statements, it's just crucial part and it's where the core begins. You want to get people excited, you want to get people inspired. There is nothing I can write that's going to be as good as what ChatGPT looks like. So what I do is I literally go to ChatGPT and I say rewrite this mission statement from me and even the first try produces something which is fantastic, so that.\n\n(06:34):\nNumber two, it helps me create user segments in a fantastic way. It will think of user segments that your mind wouldn't even go there, it just wouldn't go there. And it will provide the motivations, it will provide the pinpoints and you just come up with ideas as you read it. And then the last thing that it does is it provides ideas for you whether AI enhanced. So I just use a day-to-day, even [inaudible 00:07:00] day-to-day workflow, but I'm not making it do my job for me, I'm asking it after I have already had a mission in my head and what it is I want to do.\n\nLenny (07:10):\nSo is the way you're approaching it is you just put in, come up with a better mission statement then and then you give it your version of the mission statement?\n\nMarily Nika (07:18):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (07:19):\nInteresting. And you're saying that that comes up with a better mission statement than the one you had?\n\nMarily Nika (07:25):\nIt's better because the mission statement is going to be read by all disciplines. It's not just going to be read by PMs that already have a lot of context and understand. It's going to be read by leadership, by junior people, by stakeholders, by other departments, by competitors. And you needed to be on Orient ending the words that are meant to be understood by everyone. Even a kid could understand and they would get inspired by you as well.\n\nLenny (07:49):\nAnd then you also said he use it for personas. How do you actually frame that prompt with ChatGPT?\n\nMarily Nika (07:55):\nLet's say you're working for a specific product area and you know want to create some fitness band, so you would say something like, who would be interested in the fitness band that doesn't have a screen? And it will provide a bulleted list all of people like, hey, young professionals are that they're interested but don't have enough time. People that do not want to charge their wearables every day. Then the list goes on. It's just fantastic.\n\nLenny (08:24):\nYou were talking about how you think the future of AI is, it's the default and is what you mean there that it's basically baked into every product we use and it helps the user do better things, it helps the product work better. Is that what you mean or is it something else?\n\nMarily Nika (08:39):\nI believe that ballpark managers will be AI product managers in the future. And this is because we see all products needing to have a personalized experience, a recommender system that is actually good. I mean you cannot watch to Netflix, you cannot even watch a movie without needing that. After you watch White Lotus or Stranger Things, you will want something similar to watch. You're not going to want a romantic thing to be suggested or recommended to you.\n\n(09:06):\nAlso, automation is another thing. We need to keep improving on society. We need to keep making technological advancements. You're not going to be able to do that if you don't have an AI centric view in every sector that you're working on.\n\nLenny (09:20):\nWhen you say that every PM will be an AI PM is your thinking that you'll be using AI tools in your job as a PM or that you'll be building AI into everything you're building with? How do you think about that?\n\nMarily Nika (09:35):\nI think it's that you will need to get comfortable with having a partner that's a research scientist and you will need to understand that these people can produce a smart model. They'll be able to do some automation, some personalization, some recommendations on. In a lot of people, truly uncomfortable, a lot of people don't know how to approach the researchers. A lot of people don't like the uncertainty that research has. A lot of PMs are very, very used to, \"Okay, I'm going to do this, I'm going to launch, I'm going to do this, I'm going to launch.\" Whereas when you're working with research, it's more like we're going to try this and then in a year if it doesn't work out we're going to shut the written down and repeated completing [inaudible 00:10:17]. So I feel that if people get more used to uncertainty and research, things are going to be good in the end for them.\n\nLenny (10:28):\nI thought you were comparing ChatGPT as a researcher you're working with, but you're actually saying people will have PhD researchers on their teams helping them build models into their product to make their product better. Is that what you're saying?\n\nMarily Nika (10:43):\nCorrect. This is exactly what I'm-\n\nLenny (10:45):\nInteresting.\n\nMarily Nika (10:47):\nAnd from a product perspective I can imagine like three bubbles in my head. So you want to find the intersection both something that's desirable by users, something that is going to be a viable business and something that is going to be feasible from a research scientist and technical perspective. And then when you have that, it's just going to be a capacity product for desktop launch that you can run with. So yeah, whenever I say researcher, research scientist that can produce an AI machine learning model.\n\nLenny (11:15):\nWow. Didn't think about how every cross-functional team might end up with a research scientist. Interesting, interesting. For PMs who are curious about learning how to do this stuff, what are a couple things that PMs today who have no experience with AI, what can they do to start learning how to build AI tooling into their products, understand what the hell's happening in the space of AI?\n\nMarily Nika (11:40):\nThis is a good question and I guess the message I want to pass is you shouldn't be overwhelmed by these technologies if you don't have a technical background because you can learn these things and as a PM you'll never need to actually train or code. Also, even if you want to train, there are no code approaches for training models. But to answer the question, if you're working on any product, you can always sprinkle in a smarter feature. So you can make it more secure, you can personalize it, you can enhance it with fraud detection, you can make it more ethical. If it's healthcare, you can make it faster, you can make it more accurate. If it's shopping, you can create better accommodations. Basically anything where you can get data behind the behavior with users can be improved with AI.\n\n(12:30):\nSo I guess it's all about changing the mindset of PMs. Taking a step back and just thinking about, okay, I have all this data that's just lying and sitting around what is it that I can do with it? I've been meeting PMs that said, \"Oh, we're not collecting any data, we're [inaudible 00:12:46] dashboard.\" So even that is a huge first step towards AI. And then just start thinking about it, where you could deal, get a data science intern and just see what they are going to do. There's just so much people can do.\n\nLenny (13:00):\nSo say you want to start investing in some sort of model, some sort of AI within your team, you're saying maybe hire data scientists who can help you start to build something that you can start integrating. Is that your advice on the first step of once you start, you want to start getting serious about building some sort of AI component.\n\nMarily Nika (13:19):\nThere is something called the shiny object trap and I'm always telling people, \"Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI\". Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. Once you have identified what that problem is and what that very, very high level solution is, then reach out and try to figure out how to actually implement it. And there's a definition I like giving. I usually say that the generalist PM helps their team and their company build and ship the right product. But the AI PM helps their team or company solve the right problem. So if you want to get into AI PM figure out what the problem is that you will get a data scientist to create a model for solving, but there needs to be a problem, there needs to be audience, there needs to be a user and a pin going for it.\n\nLenny (14:11):\nWhat are signs that AI may not be a good approach to solving a problem? You said that, and this happened on a lot of my teams, oh we're going to build a really cool model, it's going to do something really smart in this case and it often ended up being a very low ROI investment and took six months to a year before you even knew what the hell what was happening. Do you have any thoughts on signs that maybe this isn't a place you should be putting a lot of time into AI versus this is definitely an opportunity. Yes, we should do this, invest a lot of time into this.\n\nMarily Nika (14:42):\nDon't do it for your MVP. It makes zero sense. Do not waste time of data scientists that can train models with using powerful machines that are going take weeks to train. This is because if you have an MVP and you just want to get buy-in for an idea or feature that may use AI in the future, take it, create a little figma prototype and just show it some users, just fake what the AI is going to be doing. So a lot of young early stage entrepreneurs reach out to me and they say, \"Oh, should train this model to do this and that because we want to prove that there is a market.\" \"No, do not use AI. You should use AI where you think you already have some data or data from an adjacent product that you feel you can leverage for your own product to create something that's meaningful, recommendation automation, what we talking about. But not for an MVP. Please people, this is my advice.\n\nLenny (15:46):\nHow much data do you think you need for AI ML to have a chance to contribute? You have a heuristic of if you have anything less than this, it's not going to work at all.\n\nMarily Nika (15:59):\nThis is a good question and it honestly depends on what I'm what I'm trying to do. If you're trying to classify, if the photo is a category dog, obviously even if you have, I don't know like 15, 20 labeled photos, what's going to work. But if you want to create voice recognizers or complicated NLP applications, you're going to need thousands of [inaudible 00:16:19] of data. And this what's making this not be easy? AI systems are not easy to develop. There is a life cycle of a machine learning project and after scoping you need to figure out, \"Oh god, how much data do we need? Where do I find this data as well, how much data?\" Sometimes I've seen people synthesizing their own fake data just so that they can have something to train with and test their models. But the exact amount is hard to be defined, especially from a [inaudible 00:16:50]. I'm sure data scientists have a different opinion.\n\nLenny (16:53):\nYeah, my guess is most startups are going to have nowhere near enough data to build their own model and make it something really interesting. So do you have a thought on when it makes sense to try to build your own model, try to train your own GPT type thing versus use something that's already out there like say GPT or aJourney or all those guys.\n\nMarily Nika (17:17):\nIf you are a big tech company and you're offering a service that is going to do speech or permission or then it's going to have their own tragedy, you want to use more data and more diverse data to train and retain and train because if you don't then your quality is going to be the same as every other companies. There are agencies that are selling data, packages of data, that are ready so you can get them and train your models. But the question is if everyone takes that exact dataset, then the quality that every single company is producing is going to be the exact same. So you do want to diversify, you do want to collect your own data. And I guess a good question from my prem perspective is when is the quality of your product good enough to lunch?\n\n(18:08):\nAnd that is a really interesting point because it's totally your responsibility as a PM to decide, \"Okay, the recognition of whether this folder is a category dog is good enough for the users, it's like 70% accurate, 80% accurate, where is the bar, where do we launch?\" And that's why I'm like the AI PM role is so cool because you have problems like that to solve that no one else was tackled before. So it's all on you.\n\nLenny (18:34):\nWe've thrown out these words model and we talk about training models. Do you have a good succinct explanation for what a model is for folks that aren't that technical and then just the general idea of training a model. What is a simple way to think of, here is what a model is.\n\nMarily Nika (18:52):\nSo I have a three-year-old girl and I'm teaching hear about life and everything. So I was recently teaching her about the animals and you explain things to her once or twice, what the mammals is or rhino and so on. But you will end up training your kids brain by repeating the same information again. So you will say, \"Hey, here's what the rhino looks like, here's what an elephant looks like, here's what the rhino looks like, here's what an elephant looks like.\" And once you've done this enough times, then your kid will see an animal on the street and they'll be able to recognize and say, \"Oh yeah, that's like rhino what we're talking about.\" This is exactly what a model is. The model is like a kid's brain. It has the ability to take an input, which means it has the ability to take an image and say, \"Oh I recognize what this is. That looks like a rhino. But I'm 70% sure about this.\" So you will output the probability as well of the certainty.\n\nLenny (19:51):\nAnd you said image, but it could be text for say in ChatGPT. In the future I imagine video there's also voice like whisper. That's an awesome explanation. Basically it's like trying to recreate the human brain is a nice way of thinking about it. And then training a model, can you talk about what that means?\n\nMarily Nika (20:08):\nThe problems of training the model for example is providing a lot of images that are legal and say, \"Hey, here's what card looks like, here's what it all looks like,\" and we're talking about thousands and thousands of data sets for this. And once you do this, there's a process where the model is just processing this information and it's learning, it's finding patterns through it and the patterns are not in the form of, oh if this is gray then this means this. No, it just learns in the smart brain how to identify specific things that we don't even understand. And then it's able to output the probability of whether photo is going to contain the cutter and top.\n\nLenny (20:49):\nJust conceptually what is the output of the training? Is it code that is auto-generated with these decision trees and weights and things like that? Is it a database of weight? Just conceptually what is the output of a training that becomes a model? What's the simplest way to think about that?\n\nMarily Nika (21:05):\nSo it's what it speaks. Speech is a great example. For example, I'm talking to a device which is like a home system and I say, \"Hey, what is the weather like today?\" This is going to take my folies and audio and it's going to process it and the output is going to be a transcription. So it's literally going to be text that corresponds to what I sent to it.\n\nLenny (21:24):\nThinking about the stuff you've worked on at Google, at Meta, anywhere else you've worked on, side projects even, what are some of the cooler applications of AI machine learning that you've worked on, contributed to, or even seen that you can talk about? I imagine there's a lot of sensitive stuff too going on.\n\nMarily Nika (21:40):\nOne thing I want to talk about is the team I used to work for, Google, which was then the RVR team and they were working on an air glass and actually they had a video on last year's Google IO. They were able to have the Google glass on someone that spoke one language and then this other person was sat in front of them that spoke a different language and the glass will take as an input that audio that came from that other person and it will transcribe it, it will translate it and show it on the screen for that person in their language. So we're talking about the ability for this devices to unlock the borders of communication and that is not science fiction. This is what amazing and mind-blowing, there's no science fiction anymore. These things are real, the technology is here, it's just a matter of connecting the pieces to the puzzle in order to see them coming to life. So I think that one was one of the most impactful things I've ever seen.\n\nLenny (22:46):\nI remember that demo and it was pretty incredible. Okay, so thinking a little more broadly, do you think ChatGPT or just say GPT four or GPT five, GPT six, do you think at some point this will replace product managers? Something I see on Twitter a lot. People are like, \"Oh my god, product managements done. This thing made my product requirements document for me.\" Or you talked about how it makes your mission statement better. Do you think there's a place where PMs aren't necessary anymore?\n\nMarily Nika (23:13):\nOh, absolutely not. As I said, it makes everything better. If anything it's going to free out time for me to do other things that are less tedious. For example, I am running so many projects and they only their peer [inaudible 00:23:27] and the peer [inaudible 00:23:28] have all these areas that are common across all of them. If I had a system that can actually write the continuous stuff for me so that I can focus on more strategic side of things, that would be incredible. It will make us smarter. If [inaudible 00:23:42], you will unlock new areas of product management that we haven't realized that, but are there.\n\nLenny (23:48):\nAre there areas, do you think with your kind of vision of all PMs will be AI PMs, are there areas that you think PMs should invest more skill-wise or areas they should less focus on invest because say some machine learning model is going to do that for them.\n\nMarily Nika (24:04):\nI'd like to see people being less overwhelmed, less intimidated, less afraid to start learning how to code, how to train a little model on their own. This is because even if ChatGPT or this no code applications may be able to do this for us, it gives you a different approach, a different mindset, a different if you want confidence to know how things work. And here's a silly example, I was learning how to play the piano when I was young and when my teacher came in I was like, \"Oh, I want to learn how to play this cool song.\" There were some songs that I really liked. And she said, \"No, you need to start with a classical music,\" and I just hated it all the time. And I said, \"Why do I have to do this?\" Because she said, \"If you learn the fundamentals and how you know where things started and the beginning of music, it's going to help you along the way to create music on your own if you want to.\" And she was right. I just loved it.\n\n(25:00):\nSo it's the same with coding. I encourage people to just take an online course, understand more, get your hands dirty, pair up with someone else that's in the same boat as you because this is going to give you the skillset to understand how that tool that's going to help you in your day-to-day was even created in the first place instead of blindfoldedly distrusted to do your job.\n\nLenny (25:23):\nThis episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming, subjective, bias and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management including a continuous employee-centric approach. So employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando managers can leverage competency-based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

That's pando.com/lenny.\n\n(26:21):\nFor someone that actually wants to do that and learn to code, which I love that advice, do you have any resources, places that you point people to for learning to code, getting started down that path?\n\nMarily Nika (26:31):\nIt depends on what type of learner you are. There are some people that learn offline, so just go to Coursera, there are so many courses. There is an amazing one actually introduction to AI by Stanford that they're going to encourage people to take a look at. But I know that a lot of people don't like, don't have the time, don't have the discipline to actually take time off or after work, after they put their kids to sleep to just do it. So if you enjoy learning with others, if you enjoying being part of a team, if you enjoy going through a journey together, then I recommend these resources. So there is something called Career Foundry, which is a fantastic on coding school, General Assembly and then Coding Dojo.\n\n(27:13):\nI was actually give a talk, Ages of God Coding Dojo [inaudible 00:27:17] by Python, and all it takes is just a few weeks of your time and passion and just for you to roll up your sleeves and just realize that this is not intimidating and realize the benefits you can get by learning.\n\nLenny (27:31):\nAwesome, thanks for sharing those. We'll include links in the show notes. Going back to a PM trying to become better in AI. If you think about a PM that's early in their career and wants to become a very strong AI PM. I know you have a whole course about this, which we can talk about now or later, whatever is easier, what should that PM be doing? We talked a bit about learn to code, maybe start playing with tools. What else do you suggest PMs that want to become really strong AI PMs do now and invest in?\n\nMarily Nika (28:02):\nSo I do have a course that's coming up on February 6th on [inaudible 00:28:06], which is for current and aspiring product managers that want to build AI products. But I also have offline recordings. I have the same course on an offline basis on my website. I'd be happy to talk to you here, you already chat to me about this. What I feel people should understand is what it takes to manage an AI product. Of course people are very familiar with the stages of product development in general, but AI product development is different. As I mentioned before, sometimes you're actually managing the problem and not the product and you're trying to secure out if there is a problem that makes sense to be answered by a smart solution.\n\n(28:45):\nSo it's a very interesting and more complicated process than regular product management. So number one, figure out how it differs from general product management. Number two, if you're already at the company that is actually having AR researchers and AI research scientists, I encourage people to just maybe talk to them and shadow them and spend an hour of their week just talking to them and experiencing what they're doing. This is going to open your mind, this is going to give you so much context as to what it is and the endless potential that you can identify there.\n\nLenny (29:22):\nAwesome. And is there anything else you want to share from your course that you think might be interesting to folks?\n\nMarily Nika (29:30):\nSo we talked about why it's awesome to be an AI PM, but I do want to call out that there are a few challenges that people need to be aware of. Number one, and I kind of mentioned it before, is the uncertainty. You may have been working on all of these incredible research and ideas in hypothesis, but then when you actually train the model, the results you may be getting may not be optimal, may not be answering the questions or the hypothesis that you actually had in mind. So that's number one. You need to be able to encourage the teams throughout this process because you're like the captain of the ship, you need to be the one that's cheerleading the team, making sure everyone keeps going.\n\n(30:10):\nNumber two, you are going to have to [inaudible 00:30:15]. You are going to have to change the action in managing this from a leadership perspective can be tricky and it can be challenging.\n\n(30:22):\nNumber three, we talked about data, but getting good data is hard. You may need to be creative, figure out ways for data collection that you never thought you'll do. You may get on the street and ask for people to actually contribute data for what it is you're doing. You need to be able to and willing to do everything. And the last thing is from a career trajectory, usually product managers get ahead the more they launch. But if you're in a research or if you're not going to launch as often, so you need to make sure to clarify with the hiring managers early on, \"Hey, what does progress mean? How am I going to get a sense in a research work which is different than what I've been doing so far.\" So it's challenging but I always encourage people to flex different muscles and this is the zero to one muscle. The other thing is this crucial when it comes to product management.\n\nLenny (31:15):\nThis actually is a great segue to a question I definitely wanted to ask, which is around getting buy-in for investment at a company for ML. So there's sometimes all this energy for a zero to one, let's just try something, sometimes not, so maybe there's a two part question here. Do you have any advice on just getting buy-in for we want to try something with ML. It's going to take us six months to figure out if it's worth the effort, but we think there's something here. And then sometimes there's a lot of energy initially and then you get some win, like your search ranking's smarter and it's great.\n\n(31:48):\nBut then maintaining that, having all these really expensive people working and just tweaking this model and continuing to make it smarter and a little more efficient, often it's hard to continue to get buy-in for that sort of team. Do you have any advice on initial buy-in, let's try something here, and then down the road just keeping a team going, trying to make this thing smarter and smarter.\n\nMarily Nika (32:09):\nPeople should know that there is an excellent source of inspiration and something that could kind of de-risk things, which is adjacent products. Maybe the company has already launched the product that has been successful, those AI firsts. And whenever I try to convince leadership about something that I want to do that's a big bet, I always use examples and I'm like, \"Hey, this seemed crazy at the time, here's how they work. What I'm proposing is very similar to this crazy thing. And then I propose a little contingency plan, like hey, if that doesn't work out, here's the rollback plan, here's the maximum impact it will have done in a negative way, which is not going to be too much. And you kind of take it all on [inaudible 00:32:55].\n\n(32:55):\nAnd it's interesting because the more you work on this specific company, the more trust you get. And if the culture is such, then failing is going to be welcome. So a lot companies that welcome pain because you can just go ahead and do this sort of thing.\n\nLenny (33:09):\nDo tell me if I'm wrong, but I feel like most investments in ML are not successes and often not great uses of time. I'm curious if that changes with more tooling and more public models that people can plug into without having to build their own. I wonder if it becomes like, \"Oh okay look we're put in three weeks, we'll get something really useful.\"\n\nMarily Nika (33:27):\nExactly. And also the other thing, and I wanted to add on the question you asked before about hey how do you keep updated about new niche tech? We shouldn't underestimate academia and research blogs and there's a website called Archive where you can see new papers come up, because this is where... ChatGPT and [inaudible 00:33:49] used to be there for a long time, there was a lot of information on this sort thing. But it's now recent where we see that research scientists and research orgs are not as siloed as they used to be. So the more companies invest on staffing, this layer between productionizing and research, academic research, the more PMs you're going to add there, then the more you're going to see this bridge creating goods, products, [inaudible 00:34:20]. So sometimes you have amazing ideas by research scientists but you need a PM to take it and actually figure out ways to also monetize it.\n\n(34:28):\nThat's the other thing, if you're a PM you need to come up with ways to actually be able to monetize and ChatGPT is now free for everyone. But I don't know if you saw, there was a signup forum that was coming around saying, \"Hey, would you pay for this? What would be the minimum you pay? What would the maximum you pay? What would you like to see if you paid?\" So having PMs breached the tap is crucial for companies to be able to take the research and actually come up with meaningful use cases for users.\n\nLenny (34:56):\nI think they actually started charging the other day. I think it's like $40, $42 a month to start using it. I think people have been talking about on Twitter, I don't know if that's live yet. And then you talked about research papers, when I think that, I always think of Tyler Cohen, he has this awesome blog marginal revolution and he is really good at sharing insights from research papers that he's reading. So that's another place for folks to check out. He's just this really smart dude. He's really excited about AI and GPT in general and so he shares a lot of really interesting insights about it all. Segueing a little bit to your course, I have a couple questions about it. One is can you just talk about the broad framework of your course? How long is it, what do you learn, what are the workshops broadly? And then I have a couple follow up questions.\n\nMarily Nika (35:39):\nMy course is three week long. It's meant for people that are either aspiring or current PMs that want to understand how to sprinkle in AI solutions or they wanted a full-time AI course. Week one is more about introduction, what the product development lifecycle is for regular products and how it differs for AIPN specifically. And then we talk about idea creation. How on earth do you come up with ideas? And I love what Steve Job said where he used to say, \"Well, users don't know what they want until you show it to them.\" And that's exactly the mindset I want to invite two people and say, \"Hey, people don't know how on earth you use AI.\" People will never have imagined ChatGPT can be what it is.\n\n(36:26):\nAnd then we take that and we dive deep and we talk about how on the earth do you productionize something like this? What are the different partners you're working with? What is a research scientist and how on the earth do you collaborate and how do you partner with them? How do you convince them what you have in mind for their precious research to be converted into a product? How on earth do you convince them to trust you and how do you influence them? And then at the end we're talking about how you actually will be able to pave your pathway PM all the way from interviewing for this role, from what resumes look like, and doing some mock interviews because the more you practice the better it is.\n\nLenny (37:03):\nHow many workshops are there through the course?\n\nMarily Nika (37:05):\nNine workshops.\n\nLenny (37:06):\nNine workshops. Of the nine workshops, which of them are you finding is the most exciting, game-changing for someone, most interesting?\n\nMarily Nika (37:15):\nSo throughout the duration of all these workshops, people have homework and they actually take home an exercise where they need to create and develop their own AI product end to end, and they can pair up with each other. By the way, there was this two students pair up and actually where I would raise funding, which is mind blowing to me, which is really great.\n\nLenny (37:15):\nThat's awesome.\n\nMarily Nika (37:35):\nBut to continue, the most exciting part is when everyone at the great end are actually presenting their work and they're actually asking questions and getting feedback and they're just really excited and proud for what they created.\n\nLenny (37:48):\nThat's a good reminder of a lot of the learning that you do is just doing it, not just reading about it and following Twitter. Can you share any examples of stuff people built after the course?\n\nMarily Nika (37:57):\nSomeone was able to actually, and I kid you not, create a little model that was able to take us an input x-rays that they found online and was able to tell us what was wrong if something was wrong with that patient. And it's just crazy to think that you can do that within three weeks. Obviously it was just by photos we were able to crawl online for x-rays. But the concept is there that you can build something like that, you can create it. And to take it a bit further, they wanted to create a lower recommender system and say, \"Hey, we think this is what's wrong with you, here are the steps you should follow.\" Obviously we're not trying to play doctors or to pretend that or medical in any way, but being able to see that actually functioning is just, it's very impactful.\n\nLenny (38:48):\nThat's amazing. Do they already know how to code, do this team that built this thing?\n\nMarily Nika (38:51):\nThey did not, but part of the course is to teach people the basics that you are going to need, prove it PM lens. And there are some no click tools as I mentioned that are going to allow you to drive and drop and train these models and input photos in it and be able to do it.\n\nLenny (39:07):\nCan you mention those tools again because that is really interesting and it's just like a peek at your course, but if someone wanted to start building something like this, what are some of these tools they could check out?\n\nMarily Nika (39:16):\nOne of the tools I would like to recommend to people is actually Auto ML. This is offered by World of Cloud and essentially it allows you to train high quality custom machine learning models, which minimal effort, you don't need to be able to code anything like that. You need to have a lot of photos and images that you have already corrected but it's not going to do the collection for you. And a great application I had to seen, there is actually a YouTube video about this. There was this company that actually had a lot of winter banks and what they did is in order to maintain these, they will actually have people manually have huge ladders and go take a look and see if everything was okay. So eventually they just [inaudible 00:39:59] drones and they had these drones fly on all of these machines and take photos of everything. And then they downloaded all these photos and they uploaded on Auto ML and they were able to see which ones needed maintenance and which did not.\n\n(40:12):\nAnd I think they reduced time from three weeks of work to a few hours of knowing which needed maintenance and just be able to send people there. So it's this type of thing that you can do on your own by applying this sort of tools.\n\nLenny (40:25):\nSaying that tool is called Auto ML?\n\nMarily Nika (40:28):\nYes, Auto ML.\n\nLenny (40:28):\nAmazing. We'll link to that in the show notes. Coming back to your course and maybe just a couple more questions. Can you just talk about what it takes to build a course like the course you built, how much time did it take you? How much work did it take? Anything that you want to share.\n\nMarily Nika (40:43):\nIt treated creating like course like a product. This is what I did is, I came up with some hypothesis as to who the audience was and as to what they were looking to get out of it. And I started reaching out to people and I started saying, \"Hey, first of all, would you like to learn from me? Second of all, what would you like to learn? What are the specific questions that you would need answered?\" Because these are people that are working, people [inaudible 00:41:09] that have families. In order to take a break from all that you need to provide something to them that is meaningful. And there were quite a few activations. In the beginning I was focusing the course more for software engineers that wanted to become AI product managers. But then I realized, no, there are a lot of PMs that want to become AI product managers.\n\n(41:31):\nSo I did a little online shift there. So what it takes is make sure you find the right audience, make sure to figure out what that audience wants, make sure to have the right duration. One week I find it too short. Two weeks, it'll still be rushed. Three weeks is excellent because you give the opportunity to everyone to present and to keep to know each other on an offline discord community, which is another important part. And then the last thing, you need to have a personal relationship with everyone. So I've messaged everyone, I've seen everyone's application. I met with some people as well just to make sure to answer any questions and concerns because I wanted to make sure that people were comfortable just trusting a stranger like me and paying them to provide knowledge for their course. So it took quite a few iterations, but I was able to get there and now I'm very, very happy about it and I recorded it offline as well for people.\n\nLenny (42:27):\nHas anything had to change in this course? Maybe it's just as the last question, things are moving so fast. Is there anything you've had to rethink, redo since you first built it?\n\nMarily Nika (42:35):\nI actually added bonus sections and one bonus section was [inaudible 00:42:38] and how it was trained. This is because I started this new cohort in December and on day one the question I got is, what is this? How did it start? What is going on? How did they train it? So I added the dedicated section for it and I point people to it.\n\nLenny (42:52):\nAmazing. Anything else that you'd like to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nMarily Nika (42:58):\nIt was someone that recommended, I actually did a course and in the beginning I laughed and I said, \"Wait, people would want to learn from me. Really?\" And of course they did. And I'm teaching so many people. So what I want to tell people is don't underestimate this. Try creating your own courses as well. People may want to learn what you take for granted. For them it may be game changing, it can be life changing. So building courses is an amazing thing and we're living in the full [inaudible 00:43:30]. So the course is content, so go try this.\n\nLenny (43:33):\nI find that teaching and at least crystallizing thoughts is one of the best ways to learn it yourself. I imagine you learned a lot about AI much more than even came into it with just putting it together into a course.\n\nMarily Nika (43:44):\nAbsolutely. And I got some uncomfortable questions that I had no idea how to tackle. People on day one were like, how do I assess the tradeoffs between these two different months? And I had to figure out how to answer these things and how to incorporate them in my course. So learning from the students, learning from the course, learning from explaining is just so viable. So skills that we can get.\n\nLenny (44:07):\nWell with that, we've reached our very, very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. I'm going to go through them pretty quick. Whatever comes to mind, share. We'll see how it all goes. Sound good?\n\nMarily Nika (44:18):\nSounds good.\n\nLenny (44:19):\nTwo or three books that you recommend most to other people.\n\nMarily Nika (44:22):\nInspired. It's all about how to create tech products people love.\n\nLenny (44:28):\nMarty Kagan, right?\n\nMarily Nika (44:29):\nYes, that's the one. Great.\n\nLenny (44:34):\nCool. Anything else? Or that's the one that comes to mind.\n\nMarily Nika (44:35):\nYou Look Like a Thing and I Love You and I have it right here. It's a great thing, super, super cool. It's about how AI works and why it's making the world a weirder place. It's actually a very fun book. And there's one more, which is a book, a workbook I originally launched with Alana Karen and it's a workbook for women in tech trying to navigate working in tech. It's called Adventures of Women in Tech Workbook. So that's another thing that they want to shamelessly plug in.\n\nLenny (45:02):\nAh, that's a great choice to plug. Where can folks find that? Is that on Amazon?\n\nMarily Nika (45:06):\nYeah, Amazon.\n\nLenny (45:07):\nAmazing. What's a favorite other podcast that you like to listen to?\n\nMarily Nika (45:11):\nI like Boz's podcast. I don't know if you're aware of it. Boz is the CEO of Facebook. He has a great podcast.\n\nLenny (45:19):\nI have not heard it. I do know of Boz. I'll check that out. I didn't know he had a podcast. He had some great writing over the years. Maybe that's why he doesn't write it anymore. He has his podcast. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've loved?\n\nMarily Nika (45:30):\nOh my God, The White Lotus. People were talking about this thing. I ended up just trying it out and me and my husband, we just binge watched the whole thing. Is just so different, so mind blowing, get you excited about going to Hawaii again. It's just really good.\n\nLenny (45:45):\nHave you seen the second season?\n\nMarily Nika (45:46):\nI've seen it and it's so much better than the first, which is rare.\n\nLenny (45:50):\nI agree. Awesome. Love that show. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask, and bonus point if it's AI related.\n\nMarily Nika (45:57):\nI love to ask people, how would you explain a database to a three year old? And I know it's kind of an AI, not everyone say ai, but I love asking it because people are thinking the [inaudible 00:46:11], like what did you just ask me? But it's so important to be able to explain things in a simple ring and have the storytelling to convince a kid and really explain technical terms to non-technical people.\n\nLenny (46:23):\nFavorite AI based tool that you think people should check out.\n\nMarily Nika (46:27):\nTalk about ChatGPT, now I have this on ChatGPT, this is what comes to mind. Well, the Lensa app was pretty cool too, right? We all plugged in our [inaudible 00:46:36] and we're able to see what they would look like as fantastic heroes. I have to say, I tried being the mail version because it was so much cooler than the KingL version, so that's when I recommend to people, try the mail version.\n\nLenny (46:48):\nThat's fun. And they actually have pets now. That's what got me the download and pay for it. You can take pictures of your pets and they look so fun. That's like a killer feature right there. Good job Lensa. And the app is Lensa, right?\n\nMarily Nika (47:01):\nYeah. [inaudible 00:47:02]\n\nLenny (47:02):\nAmazing. Marily, thank you so much for spending time with me, sharing your wisdom. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMarily Nika (47:12):\nThank you so much. People can find me on Instagram. I also have a product channel on YouTube that you can check out. I just started it. I'm getting used to the whole process. I'm also kicking off a newsletter, just any social reach out and you'll see all my links.\n\nLenny (47:28):\nHow do they find the YouTube channel? How do they find the newsletter?\n\nMarily Nika (47:31):\nTyping Marily Nika.\n\nLenny (47:32):\nMarily, thank you again for being here.\n\nMarily Nika (47:34):\nThank you so much, Lenny. It was a pleasure.\n\nLenny (47:38):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Product management theater | Marty Cagan (Silicon Valley Product Group)\n\n## Transcript\n\nMarty Cagan (00:00:00):\nThere is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.\n\nLenny (00:00:13):\nAnd this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.\n\nMarty Cagan (00:00:18):\nThey're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.\n\nLenny (00:00:27):\nWhat made you decide to write another book and what is it about?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:00:31):\nToo many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.\n\nLenny (00:00:46):\nToday my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.\n\n(00:01:43):\nHow to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more. If you care about the field of product management and where it's going, you'll absolutely love this episode. With that, I bring you Marty Cagan after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Thanks for inviting me back.\n\nLenny (00:04:52):\nThank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:05:23):\nIt's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.\n\n(00:06:22):\nSo there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.\n\n(00:07:18):\nAnd I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, \"Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?\"\n\n(00:08:29):\nAnd it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.\n\n(00:09:27):\nWe are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, \"Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate.\" If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.\n\n(00:10:25):\nFor one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.\n\nLenny (00:10:44):\nYeah, I love this.\n\nMarty Cagan (00:10:45):\nBringing that perspective.\n\nLenny (00:10:46):\nI agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, \"I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think.\" So it's a really interesting role.\n\nMarty Cagan (00:11:27):\nI think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.\n\nLenny (00:12:05):\nAmazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.\n\nMarty Cagan (00:12:07):\nAll right.\n\nLenny (00:12:08):\nSo with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:12:18):\nI do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, \"Don't bring that up.\" But also the other side of me is like, \"But people need to hear it.\"\n\nLenny (00:12:36):\nSo let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:12:48):\nThere is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.\n\n(00:13:34):\nFirst of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.\n\n(00:14:44):\nHow many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.\n\n(00:15:49):\nBut there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.\n\n(00:16:55):\nSo anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.\n\n(00:17:51):\nAnd bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.\n\nLenny (00:18:33):\nI think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.\n\nMarty Cagan (00:18:56):\nI think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, \"We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything.\" So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.\n\n(00:19:49):\nAnd I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.\n\nLenny (00:20:46):\nI know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:21:01):\nWell, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.\n\n(00:21:57):\nUsually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.\n\n(00:22:51):\nIt's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.\n\nLenny (00:24:00):\nAnd this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:24:09):\nThe biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.\n\nLenny (00:24:48):\nAnd for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-\n\nMarty Cagan (00:24:58):\nValue and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, \"Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?\" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.\n\n(00:25:45):\nA product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.\n\n(00:26:51):\nThis is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, \"We're on different planets.\" What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...\n\n(00:27:50):\nDevelopers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.\n\n(00:28:51):\nSo you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.\n\nLenny (00:29:27):\nLet me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, \"I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this.\"\n\nMarty Cagan (00:29:48):\nThat's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, \"I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it.\" I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, \"This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different.\" And they're like, \"What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?\"\n\n(00:31:01):\nAnd I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.\n\nLenny (00:32:05):\nI imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:32:19):\nWell, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, \"This is what a product manager does.\" And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.\n\n(00:33:11):\nAnd what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?\n\n(00:34:14):\nThey can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.\n\nLenny (00:34:59):\nI think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:35:18):\nIn fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, \"Oh no, there goes another one.\" It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.\n\nLenny (00:35:18):\nNo.\n\nMarty Cagan (00:36:21):\nIt's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.\n\nLenny (00:37:03):\nDo you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:37:10):\nIt's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, \"Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you.\" So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.\n\nLenny (00:38:04):\nWhat's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, \"Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap.\" I'm like, \"No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?\" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.\n\nMarty Cagan (00:38:48):\nYeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.\n\n(00:39:56):\nBut I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, \"I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this.\" And I'm like, \"Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true.\" But he doesn't doubt it today.\n\nLenny (00:40:18):\nYeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:40:48):\nWell, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.\n\n(00:41:48):\nSo there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.\n\nLenny (00:42:13):\nGot it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:42:20):\nThe other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.\n\nLenny (00:43:16):\nReminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:43:24):\nChristian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.\n\nLenny (00:43:31):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:45:03):\nSo first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.\n\n(00:46:08):\nAnd honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.\n\nLenny (00:47:06):\nAwesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:47:57):\nSo yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.\n\n(00:48:58):\nSo I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.\n\nLenny (00:49:44):\nI know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:49:51):\nWe've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.\n\n(00:50:48):\nAnd what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.\n\nLenny (00:51:43):\nAnd when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]\n\nMarty Cagan (00:51:47):\nYeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?\n\nLenny (00:52:07):\nSomething along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:52:38):\nAbsolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.\n\n(00:53:45):\nNow, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?\n\n(00:54:49):\nWe don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.\n\nLenny (00:55:04):\nCan you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:55:09):\nSo value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.\n\nLenny (00:55:38):\nI want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:55:45):\nI think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.\n\nLenny (00:55:48):\nWe did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:55:55):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:55:56):\nOkay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?\n\nMarty Cagan (00:56:05):\nThis is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?\n\n(00:57:01):\nAnd we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.\n\n(00:58:01):\nSo the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.\n\n(00:58:59):\nAmazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.\n\n(01:00:10):\nAnd the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.\n\nLenny (01:00:28):\nWho would you say this is most suited for? Is it leaders at companies? Is it ICPMs, everybody? Who do you think would get the most out of this?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:00:36):\nWe wrote it intentionally, again, unlike the other books. The other books are written for people like us and your audience and my audience. They're product people. These are written for non-product people too. And so the idea is a CEO, a CFO, a head of sale. Anybody who cares about their company changing how they build and wants to help is written for them. So that was one of the hardest parts really, including those kinds of reviewers and making sure all this stuff made sense to them.\n\nLenny (01:01:08):\nSo basically if you're listening to this and you're like, I'm working on these teams Marty's describing, I don't think this is optimal. We can do a lot better. We can get a lot more on out feature team, hand this book to your CEO essentially?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:01:22):\nAnd I'd suggest they read it themselves so they know. Because I know I'm going to be talking more about this going forward because I know I need to. Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company. They're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. But really they have a family, they're not going to quit. So I think that's not true. I think there is so much they can do and hopefully they can see that in the book. It's like they can see what they individually can do to push their company in this direction, and at a minimum it'll help their career.\n\nLenny (01:02:05):\nI always love just the message of empowerment and giving people motivation to you can actually make change. You're not stuck in this way of working, and I know you do that a lot. The official title of the book, so it's TRANSFORMED: Moving to the Product Operating Model. What do you mean when you... There it is. I don't have my copy yet 'cause that hasn't come out in the US yet, otherwise, I'd have it here on my side as well. There it is. It's a beautiful green color by the way. It goes nicely with the other colors. Amazing. Beautiful design, whoever did that. Okay, so the part of the title is Moving to the Product Operating Model. What does that mean?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:02:40):\nThat was the biggest pain for the book was... 'Cause honestly, I had dodged that question for 20 years. If you look at any of my writing before starting on this book, I just said, \"Look, do you want to work like the best or do you want to work like the rest?\" That's how we referred to it, the best versus the rest because there is no word, there is no name that talks about the common principles with all the best companies. So we would just say, do you want to work like the best or not? But when I started to write the book, I'm like, okay, I can't just say work like the best. We have to have some name for this, but I don't know if you've come across this Lenny, but you don't want to coin a new term if you can avoid it.\n\n(01:03:27):\nIt is really painful to try to develop a new term. Some of the companies we worked with use the term product operating model and don't get me wrong, that's not the only term. Some people use the term product led company or product driven company, but those two we just don't like because it gives all the wrong message and the rest of the company thinks it's a power grab. So we wanted to avoid those words. We like product operating model for a couple reasons. One is it's a model, it's a conceptual model. It's not a process. It's not really a thing, it's more of a set of principles and also it's non-threatening to a lot of people. It's just saying, \"Look, this is how these companies operate. You can look at it and decide if you think it's good for you too.\" So we adopted that term, we call it product model for short. And all it really is it boils down to a set of 20 principles and those 20 principles are what we find.\n\n(01:04:36):\nRemember we started with this. I was explaining, when I listen to your guests, I'm listening for what's special about each of their companies, but what I'm looking for is the commonality. 'Cause most of the time when I see a successful company, they are living these principles. Principles like you have to experiment. You have to embrace experimentation. If you don't do that, most of this is not possible. Or you have to make sure that everything you release is instrumented so that we can prove the outcome. Stuff like that, that there's a million different methodologies and frameworks and tools and processes, but matters is those principles. And so that's what we mean by that product operating model. There's at a high level we talk about it, is how you decide what you're going to work on? How you decide which problems to solve?\n\n(01:05:33):\nThat's what most companies do in annual planning, but it's basically the product strategy. That's what your Meta friend was describing that the leaders do. That's their job. The second is how do they solve problems? Do they have the skills to do product discovery like we're talking about? How to actually come up with good solutions that work for the customer and work for the business. That's the second big dimension of the product model. And the third big dimension is how do they actually build, test and deploy product to their customers? Do they do it in a way that is reliable, that is demonstrable where you can show that this generates the outcomes that you need? Those are the three big areas. And then there's a number of competencies. There's four new competencies that most companies don't have, but what makes it tricky is they have people with those titles, but they don't have people with those jobs. The one we've been talking about is product manager.\n\nLenny (01:06:40):\nWhat would be most interesting to share? You said there's 20 attributes of a power product team.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:06:46):\n20 principles.\n\nLenny (01:06:48):\n20 principles. I'm so curious what these are, but I know we don't have time to go through them all. Can you either share a few of those? You shared experimentation as one, or these four what you just mentioned. I'm just curious what these [inaudible 01:06:58]\n\nMarty Cagan (01:06:58):\nWell, I could share as much as you want, but the four competencies are product manager. Again, we're talking a serious product manager here, not a product owner, not a feature team product manager. Product manager, real product designer, service design, interaction design, visual design, user research, real product designer, a real tech lead, and then a real product leader, a manager of product design engineering that knows how to coach their people and knows how to do a real product strategy, which is what we were talking about. So those are the four new competencies. For most companies, those are new, meaning they might have people with those names, but they don't have those roles institutionalized.\n\nLenny (01:07:43):\nIt's interesting, you're building on the classic triad with this leader above. It's like the stool with something on the stool or something or filling up the stool.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:07:51):\nAnd that is the triad. That's where it came from. The word triad came from those three. We didn't invent that.\n\nLenny (01:07:58):\nRight. But I think the product leader is a really interesting addition there. You can't just have this team off to the side without a product leader overseeing that work.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:08:04):\nThat's so true because one of the things I really learned with INSPIRED was that it wasn't enough to have the teams do their job. They needed leadership to do their job. So it is both. And that's why I was saying we don't frame it as top-down, bottom-up for that. We frame it as each group doing their job. And when that happens, it's actually a beautiful thing.\n\nLenny (01:08:28):\nWe're going to link to a post that you wrote, Product Leadership Theater, which talks about how people do this actually badly and what it looks like when it's just pretend versus actually doing it right.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:08:37):\nGood.\n\nLenny (01:08:38):\nOkay. And then what are some of these principles, just to touch on a couple and a few-\n\nMarty Cagan (01:08:42):\nJust stop me, but there's a set of principles around the more cultural things, like innovation is more important than predictability. That's a principle. That learning is more important than failure. The principles are more important than process. Some examples of that. In terms of teams, empowered with problems to solve. That's one of your foundational principles. We talked about that, this idea of real ownership, real sense of ownership so that it's theirs. Well, of course in discovery you'd recognize all the principles, but it's about addressing product risks. It's about embracing quick experimentation. It's about testing ideas responsibly. These are principles. And then I did mention a couple of the delivery principles, things like small frequent uncoupled releases. For most companies that's CI/CD, instrumentation of everything, monitoring of everything. These are delivery principles. So none of these should surprise you 'cause they are what's consistent in the good companies that we know, but these are the things that we think matter.\n\nLenny (01:09:58):\nThat's awesome. And I imagine people listening to this, if they're in that 10% or 20% of companies that you describe as doing this well are just like, of course. And then the rest are just like, no, there's no way we're going to be able to do that.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:10:09):\nYou have to realize in most of the rest of the world, they release monthly or mostly quarterly. Think about that. Quarterly releases. Think about it. You cannot take care of your customers. You cannot learn at the pace you need to. By the way, quality is going to be terrible in that model.\n\nLenny (01:10:30):\nI don't want to go on this tangent necessarily, but I know in some cases, like a quarterly release, like Shopify as an example, they have seasonal releases like the winter launch and the summer launch.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:10:40):\nAnd salesforce.com has a big... But don't confuse the actual releasing by the teams with the marketing releases. So it's very normal and I think wise to batch. Because look, most product teams are releasing on the order of 20 times per day. You're going to do a marketing release 20 times a day? That would be useless. So it makes sense to have messaging on a periodic basis, but good companies, by the time they message it, it's live. It's been coming out. We may have released some things dark as you know, but we've got it in production solid. We've proven each thing probably with an AB test.\n\nLenny (01:11:25):\nAirbnb is actually in that same model. Most of the stuff they announced every couple times a year is already out or an experiment to most people. One thing I wanted to clarify, so you call this the product operating model. There's also this role product ops, which you touched on a little bit. Any thoughts on product ops? We've had a few guests here talk about it.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:11:43):\nIt's tricky. First of all, some people have asked me, is product ops the same as product operating model? No. That was just a very unfortunate name conflict, but product ops is more analogous to DevOps and design ops, that's all. Now, can you use product ops in the product operating model? Absolutely, if you're using one of the definitions that are part of the model. So for example, the heart of product ops in the good companies I know is user research and data analysts. And the only difference is they're now brought together under one product ops leader. That's all. That that is the same. How long has that been with us, Lenny? More than 20 years. Companies have had user research teams and have had data analyst teams to help you make decisions qualitatively and help you make teams quantitatively. So that's not new at all, but it is good. And I think there is some amount of value about bringing that in.\n\n(01:12:52):\nSome companies, of course, they interpret and define product ops very differently. A lot of them unfortunately think of it, they focus on the whole phrase of process in governance. That's a huge red flag and I try to tell people, if that's what you see, run. Don't walk away from that. The other thing that's going on in a lot of companies, it is amazing to me how creative companies can be to try to find a way to justify giving product managers assistance because the product manager says too much work, which is really ironic to me 'cause they're usually feature teams that are saying this and I'm like, \"It's not even enough for your job.\" But anyway, they're like, \"Too much work.\" And so they're like, \"Well, we need help.\" And so for a while, they would all have these little associate product managers. And then a lot of companies they have, oh, we also have product owners.\n\n(01:13:51):\nProduct manager and product owner makes no sense. Huge anti-pattern. Today a lot of companies use the same excuse, but its product manager has product ops people to do the dirty work. No. And honestly, I would not want to be one of those people because I think they're very vulnerable right now.\n\nLenny (01:14:12):\nI've changed my mind on product ops. One reason is because I also was like, \"I don't need another person in the loop on everything I'm doing. I just want to have...\" I don't know why I would do that even though I have endless work and I have working crazy hours. But I think one of the great things about product ops people that I talk to is there's not many of them. You need one often to do a ton and to help a lot of different teams, so it's not like a team that just grows like crazy.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:14:37):\nThat's what I like. Same with user research, by the way, and you had a very good guest on that I think tried to make that point as well, a small high leverage group. So it works for data analysts and it works for user research where they are helping the teams do the work they need to do, but that's where it really depends what they're doing. I will tell you I've seen too many companies where the product leaders are not doing their job, so what they do is they hire product ops to try to do their job. They're the ones now responsible for educating the product managers. That's just not good.\n\nLenny (01:15:13):\nI have just a few more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Actually, maybe just one more question. We'll see where this goes. So I've mentioned this earlier that a lot of startup founders are just like, \"I do not need product managers. I'm not going to hire them ever. Or maybe I'll wait until I have hundreds of engineers.\" But then I find many of them change their mind, bring in a PM and they're like, \"Oh wow, this is amazing. Why didn't I do this earlier? This person, it's exactly what I needed.\" And these are guests I've had on the podcast that were like, \"We don't need PMs.\" And then they get one and they're like, \"Okay, I see. This is great.\" Do you have any advice for founders that are in this boat of just like, I don't want product managers, they're going to screw us up, they're going to slow us down? Any advice for this?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:15:53):\nYeah. Well, first of all, I'm one of the people that tries to discourage them from hiring product managers too soon because a lot of them make the mistake of hiring them too soon. Now, realize what we're talking about here, again, the whole discussion we've had, this is other layer to, I'm talking about a real product manager. If they're using them as project manager, which a lot of times they are, well, I would tell them they're overpaying, but okay, you can get some help for project management. That's not a good use of the CEO's time. But if they're a real product manager and they're worried about value and viability, that is the founder's job. So the founder should be doing that and needs to be doing that, and it usually causes conflict if they bring in a real product manager too soon. It's too many cooks in the kitchen.\n\n(01:16:45):\nYou need to reach a certain scale before it helps you to have other people responsible for value and viability. That all assumes that they understand real product management, otherwise it's going to lead to very different symptoms.\n\nLenny (01:17:01):\nSo I think one piece of advice here is after product-market fit is a better time to hire a product manager. Otherwise, they're just between you and the product and it slows everything down, right?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:17:10):\nYeah. Remember, usually as soon as you get product-market fit, you're working on it for other products and other markets, and so it's an ongoing thing, but while it's small, it usually is most useful just to look at the number of engineers. At a certain number of engineers, usually 20 to 25, it's a lot better if the co-founder is the product person for that.\n\nLenny (01:17:35):\nAwesome. I was going to ask you if you have a heuristic for engineers and so thank you for preempting that. That's essentially all I had to chat about, Marty. Do you have anything else that you think would be interesting to share or touch on or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:17:51):\nHonestly, Lenny, we talked about so many big topics. I'm worried that may have overwhelmed people, I hope not. Because you asked all the hardest topics.\n\nLenny (01:18:03):\nWell, good job me. Good job you. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:18:09):\nSure.\n\nLenny (01:18:10):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:18:15):\nI love the new book from Tony Fadell called Build. It's a wonderful book and he's describing the product model, but for hardware devices and his perspective was fabulous. He had a front row seat to some of the most iconic products in the world, the iPod, the iPhone, the Nest devices. Love it. So I loved his book and I've been recommending it to all kinds of people. Another one I really liked is, do you know Tim Urban, the guy behind Wait But Why?\n\nLenny (01:18:45):\nAbsolutely.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:18:46):\nI just love the way this guy thinks. And he wrote a book called What's Our Problem? that I found really provocative. Challenged me in a hundred different ways, so love that.\n\nLenny (01:18:56):\nI've been reading about his book writing process as he was writing it over the many years and it was just quite a journey he went on to make that book happen. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:19:09):\nLenny, you couldn't ask that to a worst person 'cause I watch almost nothing, so not a good one for that.\n\nLenny (01:19:16):\nGreat. I think that's often for the best. Do you have a favorite interview question that you either use yourself or find useful when interviewing folks, product managers especially?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:19:26):\nWell, given how much interviewing I do, I stopped giving out my real favorite questions because they became online. But I do have a go-to question that I pretty much start with everybody and I want to know if they can even define the job of a product manager.\n\nLenny (01:19:41):\nWhat do you find in the answer and what do you look for? Is it just how close they are to your version of a product manager?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:19:49):\nI can tell where they learned from their answer, that's all. They don't have to give my answer. They just shouldn't give the old feature team answer, that's all.\n\nLenny (01:20:00):\nDo you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love, whether it's software or something physical, something around the house?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:20:06):\nI recently got a Rivian, which is amazing that they did an absolutely beautiful job. They're the Airbnb of car companies because the founder's a designer and imagine if a designer designed the next generation car. It's a phenomenally good job.\n\nLenny (01:20:27):\nWow. I was imagining you could rent people's cars and that sounds pretty cool, but you mean it in a different way. Interestingly, both you and [inaudible 01:20:38] from Meta both had cars as your favorite recent product discovery. He had a Mercedes-Benz. And I made the joke that I hope to give away these products someday and the budget is blowing up with all these cars in the mix.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:20:52):\nWell, my favorite thing to do is ride motorcycles and there is a new generation of product that who knows, might save my life one day, but these are literally wireless airbag vests that you wear and it uses AI technology and sensors to decide if it should deploy. Luckily, mine has never had to go off, but I know for a lot of people it saved their lives. That's an example of technology where without the technology, it's a very vulnerable... Even with it, it's vulnerable.\n\nLenny (01:21:28):\nWait, do you ride motorcycles?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:21:29):\nI do.\n\nLenny (01:21:30):\nI had no idea. What bike do you ride?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:21:33):\nI have two and they're both BMWs.\n\nLenny (01:21:36):\nWow. We need to see a picture of this somewhere. That's amazing. I had no idea. Two final questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family and find useful either in work or in life?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:21:49):\nI don't really have a life motto, but I do have one I share a lot with people because as you might imagine, I think writing really helps me think and I encourage other people to develop their thinking skills and there's a great quote from Leslie Lamport, the guy who... You're not old enough to know this, but he invented one of the first word processors called LaTeX, which I used to use back in the day. But if you're thinking without writing, you just think you're thinking.\n\nLenny (01:22:21):\nThere's a version of this that I love and it's the same idea that I don't know what I think until I've written it down. I think Joan Didion said that.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:22:29):\nSame idea.\n\nLenny (01:22:30):\nAnd I so agree. That's why I started writing. I just want to figure this out that I have in my head. Crystallizing something that makes sense. Last question. You've been doing this work for many, many years now. How many years have you been at this?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:22:43):\n43.\n\nLenny (01:22:45):\n43 years. What else would you have been doing right now if not having gone down this track?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:22:53):\nOh, well, honestly, I would've been really happy just staying in engineering. I've always loved design too. I think I would've been really happy as a designer. I think no matter what though, I would have been still building something, whether if it was houses or cars or whatever. I like building things.\n\nLenny (01:23:13):\nI love that. You're essentially a one man triad team in this dream. Marty, this was incredible. It was everything I was hoping it'd be. We covered so much stuff. I think we're going to help a lot of people transform. Two final questions, where can folks find your book? When is it available? Where can they reach out if they want to follow up on stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:23:34):\nThe book should be available worldwide in electronic Kindle audio and hardback on March 12th. We'll see, but that's what the publishers promise. And you can find about all of the things I talk about and all our stuff is for free on the website, svpg.com, Silicon Valley Product Group. And if you don't know at least one of the partners, you should try to meet one. We all love meeting the community and I think you'll enjoy it. So hopefully that's useful.\n\nLenny (01:24:12):\nWe've had two partners so far. We'll work our way through the rest over time. And I want to make sure you answer the last question, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMarty Cagan (01:24:20):\nTo be honest, a lot of the inspiration for what we write comes from questions from people, and so we love it when people read something and if it works, great, and they tell us, we love that too. But if they have follow-up questions, one of the nice things about the online archive is we'll just go update the article to address the question. So we love that.\n\nLenny (01:24:40):\nYou do the same thing.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:24:41):\nSo feel free.\n\nLenny (01:24:42):\nAll right. Amazing. Marty, thank you so much for making time to do this and for being here.\n\nMarty Cagan (01:24:47):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:24:48):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How to speak more confidently and persuasively | Matt Abrahams (professor, speaker, author)\n\n## Transcript\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:00:00):\nVisualization is a really useful technique and you see yourself not just in the moment of speaking, but getting up to the stage, seeing it being well received, thinking about how you step off the stage. We see athletes do this kind of thing all the time, and there's good research to say that this desensitizes people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):\nMost of the public speaking we do is on the spot. It's not often you give a prepared talk.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:00:20):\nYou actually have to prepare to be spontaneous. And that's counterintuitive, but when you think about it in athletics or jazz music, it's like of course you would prepare and practice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):\nAre there any other techniques that you love that you find people find really helpful in calming their anxiety?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:00:34):\nStrive for connection over perfection by daring to be dull. Just answer the question. Just give the feedback. Just be engaged in the small talk. By doing that, you dial down the volume of self-evaluation, freeing up resources that can be used to really help you succeed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):\nToday my guest is Matt Abrahams. Matt is a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business where he teaches a very popular class on communication and public speaking. He's also the host of the incredibly popular podcast, Think Fast, Talk Smart; and the author of the very popular book, Think Faster and Talk Smarter. Matt also coaches people one-on-one on public speaking and communication skills. And in our conversation we focus on the two areas that people most need help with. One, reducing their anxiety before and during any form of public speaking, and getting better at speaking on the spot, including giving better toasts, giving feedback, doing Q&A, and even apologizing.\n\n(00:01:36):\nLike we talk about in the actual conversation, speaking well is a superpower in your career for interviewing, for being great in meetings, for pitching your manager on ideas, to leading teams. And the skill becomes even more important as you grow in your career. The good news is that you can get better at it with a bit of help. I've worked on this a lot over the course of my career and I still get really nervous before big talks and even before every podcast episode, but many of these techniques I actually put into practice and I share that in our conversation. If you pick just a couple things from this episode to put into practice, you'll become a better communicator, you'll be less nervous, and you'll get better at dealing with on-the-spot moments.\n\n(00:02:14):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Matt Abrahams after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:29):\nLet me tell you about a product called Sprig. Next-gen product teams like Figma and Notion rely on Sprig to build products that people love. Sprig is an AI-powered platform that enables you to collect relevant product experience insights from the right users so you can make product decisions quickly and confidently.\n\n(00:02:48):\nHere's how it works. It all starts with Sprig's precise targeting, which allows you to trigger in-app studies based on users' characteristics and actions taken in product. Then Sprig's AI is layered on top of all studies to instantly surface your product's biggest learnings. Sprig Surveys enables you to target specific users to get relevant and timely feedback. Sprig Replays enables you to capture targeted session clips to see your product experience firsthand. Sprig's AI is a game changer for product teams. They're the only platform with product-level AI, meaning it analyzes data across all of your studies to centralize the most important product opportunities, trends, and correlations in one real-time feed.

Are you working in a feature factory building filler that nobody wants? Probably, because the sad truth is that most SaaS features are rarely or never used, costing the industry billions every year. Let's change that. Product managers, Dovetail is holding their first industry conference, it's called Insight Out, and they want you to come. Over one day in San Francisco, the product community is coming together to learn how to better leverage customer insights and build products that people actually love to use. It's on April 11, and you can hear from product leaders from Uber, Twitch, Meta and Netflix, as they share their strategies for driving innovation, thriving in uncertainty, and balancing customer-centered work with business needs. And here's the kicker, it's absolutely free for online tickets. Just go to dovetail.com/lenny to register. This is thanks to Dovetail, the best way for product teams to get the most out of customer insights. Check it out at dovetail.com/lenny.\n\n(00:04:50):\nMatt, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:04:54):\nLenny, I am excited for our conversation and thank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):\nThank you for being here. I'm even more excited for the conversation. So what I want to do with our time today is there's two areas I want to focus. One is talking about techniques to help people manage anxiety when public speaking. And two is helping people get better at speaking on the spot, which you wrote a whole book about. And if you think about it, I think that's like most of the public speaking we do is on the spot. It's not often you give a prepared talk. It's usually like you said, Q&A or a or toast someone wants to give you or ask for feedback or things like that. So I'm excited to dig into those things. How do that sound broadly?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:05:33):\nAbsolutely, I look forward to that and those are topics I'm very excited to talk about, have done a lot of research in and look forward to sharing more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):\nI suspected as much. Okay, so let's talk about anxiety. You have a bunch of really novel techniques in your book and your podcast for calming your body down, calming your mind down when you're planning to give a talk, when you're actually about to give a talk, when you're giving a talk. And a lot of these I haven't actually seen anywhere else and I've used a few of them and they are really great. So what I was thinking we'd do is let me go through the ones that I found most useful and interesting and just share your advice on those and then see if there's any I missed and then maybe add those at the end. How's that?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:06:15):\nThat sounds great. That sounds great. I love that you've applied some of these techniques and found value from them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:19):\nI'll talk about this, I'll talk about this. Okay, first of all, just to catch on this, you're not a fan of the picture people in your audience naked approach, correct?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:06:27):\nThe Brady Bunch advice is not good advice. I don't know about you and I don't know anybody who could imagine seeing a bunch of people in their underwear and feel more comfortable with that. And I think if you do, there are other issues you need to be dealing with than beyond speaking anxiety.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:42):\nYeah, it feels like highly inappropriate now, just that idea, trying to picture everyone-\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:06:46):\nNo, but underlying that if you'll give me a moment, there is some value. This notion of visualization as a tool of desensitization actually can be very helpful, but you're not visualizing the audience half naked. What you're doing is you're visualizing yourself in that space. You're visualizing the audience responding to you and what you're saying. So just like a pilot might do a flight simulator, having a visualization can actually really help you feel more comfortable and confident. It literally puts you in the room even though you're not there. And there's some tools and I'm fascinated by these tools that are virtual reality tools that can also serve to desensitize you. So this notion of seeing your audience in advance of actually speaking can actually impact your level of comfort. It's let's keep everybody clothed and let's keep them all focused on your topic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):\nWell, let's actually talk about this one while we're on it because I think this is a really powerful technique. An idea just to kind of summarize, you picture ahead of time, what it's going to look like and feel like. You talking, looking at the audience. You talk about that and just how to go about using that technique.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:07:50):\nYeah, absolutely. And this is some of the oldest research on public speaking anxiety. It was research done in the '80s from the University of Oregon. So visualization, what it does is it allows you to see the event in a way that you have much more control over it so you can think about it. So a good visualization involves some deep breathing to calm yourself. Either you close your eyes or you just look at a picture. Maybe you can get a picture of the environment you're speaking in. I often recommend speakers see the room even if they're not physically present, but get a picture online or some way envision yourself in the room, envision yourself in the room with the people you'll be speaking to. Often we know the individuals or some of them. We can also go online and figure out who they are.\n\n(00:08:39):\nSo visualization is a really useful technique and you see yourself not just in the moment of speaking but getting up to the stage, delivering the presentation, seeing it being well received, thinking about how you step off the stage. And by taking yourself through that you in essence are a dress rehearsal even though you're not physically in the room. And there's good research to say that this desensitizes people. We see athletes do this kind of thing all the time where they'll do visualization to help them and it really does work. And like I said, there are virtual tools now that can help you do this where you can actually program it to have a certain size audience. You can even program some of these to have a responsive audience or a distracted audience. All of this in service of just preparing you for what you're really going to see.\n\n(00:09:25):\nAnd the bottom line is this, what you're doing for yourself is making sure it's not new and novel. It's something been there, done that, even though if it was virtual or visualized in your mind, to help you feel better about the circumstance. It gives you a sense of agency.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:42):\nI've done this myself actually. I gave a TEDx talk once and it was probably the scariest talk I've ever given and I spent a lot of time doing this and it doesn't actually have to take that much time. It could be like a five-minute thing where you sit down, calm yourself, and then just picture the stuff. And ideally you do it a couple times, I imagine.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:09:57):\nThat's right. Good for you. And congratulations on giving a TEDx talk. That is a high-stakes talk.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:01):\nThank you. That was before TEDx became super uncool. It was still pretty early. It's out there in the internet in case people want to find it.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:10:09):\nDon't say they're uncool. I'm doing one in two weeks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:11):\nThey're so cool. That is, they are cool.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:10:13):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:17):\nThey're incredible. I'm impressed.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:10:17):\nI've done a number of them and I've coached many people and I think that there's a lot of value that they can provide people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:21):\nThere is. There is. I think they've just become slightly less cool because now there's a lot of them, but they're still incredibly cool, I'm very proud.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:10:29):\nOkay, thank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:31):\nSo on the visualization piece, I think we have a lot of techniques, but just on this one, part of it is continue to calm yourself as you're doing it. I think that's really important because you want to help your body not connect to the stress that you're feeling like you're going to experience.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:10:46):\nThat's correct. Any distance you can give yourself from the anxiety that you're feeling is helpful and there are lots of techniques that help give you a little bit of distance and visualization is one of those.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:57):\nOne of my favorite techniques that it might be in this bucket, it might be on the spot advice bucket, but I think it works great here is what you call dare to be dull. Can you talk about that because I love that?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:11:09):\nYeah. I really leaned into this with the spontaneous speaking work that I've been doing as of late, but it applies to anybody speaking. This is a notion that comes from the world of improvisation and when people hear improv, they often think of standup comedy, having to be funny. And that's not what improv is all about. Improv is all about being present, being collaborative, being open, and it's a wonderful tool just to help you get present oriented. Think of it as like meditation in action, but also it teaches lots of valuable skills for communication.\n\n(00:11:42):\nWhen we communicate, especially spontaneously, we want to do it really well. We want to answer the question with the best answer, we want to give the right feedback, we want to be the most interesting in small talk and that puts a lot of pressure on ourselves. And you can think of it this way, it's really taxing our cognitive bandwidth.\n\n(00:12:04):\nYour brain in many ways is like a CPU, a computer. It's not a perfect analogy, but it works. And if I am constantly judging and evaluating everything I am saying against some standard of perfection, whatever that is, it means I have a limited amount of bandwidth to focus on what I'm actually saying and connecting to my audience. If you have a laptop or a phone that has lots of windows and apps open, each one of those is performing less well because of the other ones being open. So I often say strive for connection over perfection by daring to be dull. Just get the task done, just answer the question, just give the feedback, just be engaged in the small talk. And by doing that you dial down the volume of self-evaluation, freeing up resources that can be used to really help you succeed. So dare to be dull is all about giving yourself permission to just be present and do what's needed. And when you do that you find that you actually do quite a good job at it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):\nThe last point I think is really important, you talk about this in your book. Is when you start with, \"Okay, I'm just going to say something, it'll be fine.\" Without that pressure, you end up saying something better and more interesting and more insightful because you're less nervous about it.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:13:16):\nThat's exactly right. We are often our biggest impediments to good communication because of the anxiety we bring to the party.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):\nThat's awesome. And I think this can apply to prepared talks too. When you're preparing a deck, don't put this pressure on yourself, \"This has to be the best talk ever.\" Just like, \"I'm going to do my best. Let me just start with something that's good enough.\" People learn something and then from that, their editing ends up leading to something great in my experience.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:13:39):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:40):\nAwesome. Okay, let's go to the next technique, and this is another one I've practiced and another guest on the podcast actually suggested this and these two remind me of using this one, which is to tell yourself when you're going to be giving a talk. \"I'm excited. This is going to be a lot of fun. I'm so excited to give this talk.\" And reframe it from, \"I'm nervous,\" to like, \"No, I'm excited. This is going to be amazing.\" Can you talk about that technique?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:14:04):\nAbsolutely. So this is one of many cognitive reframing techniques. It is often attributed to my friend and colleague, Alison Wood Brooks, she's at Harvard Business School who did some research into this. And what she found is...\n\n(00:14:18):\nWell, first take a step back. When you get physically aroused by anxiety, you're under that fight or flight threat response. It turns out that same response happens to your body when you're excited. The human body has pretty much just one arousal response. Our heart beats faster, we breathe more shallow, we get a little shaky, but the big difference is how we label that. So if I say, \"Hey Lenny, guess what? Your colleague couldn't show up today and you need to go teach the class or you need to go give that presentation.\" You might feel your heart rate go up, get a little shaky, sweat on your brow and you're seeing that as negative. But if I said, \"Hey Lenny, guess what? You just won the lottery.\" Same physiological response would happen, but you would see that likely as more positive.\n\n(00:15:06):\nSo how we label the arousal matters and what Alison's research and others have followed up with suggests is that when we feel those symptoms of anxiety, rather than seeing it as negative, say, \"This is exciting. I get to share my point of view. I get to demonstrate my value.\" And in so doing by seeing it as more positive, it causes us by definition to relax. And her research fascinatingly found that people actually were perceived as communicating better. And again that's because that pressure was taken off of them. So I challenge everybody to think about what are the exciting elements of the communication opportunities you have and really lean into those. And when you feel those anxiety symptoms, remind yourself these are signs of excitement. This is me being excited about sharing this information and it can really help.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):\nThis is another one I've done and it super works. It sounds so trivial and so like, \"Why would this do anything?\" But I find you just say that just like, \"I'm going to have so much fun. This is going to be exciting.\" It does make an impact. So another one to try, even though it sounds really trivial.\n\n(00:16:12):\nKind of along these lines, there's another technique you recommend which is a mantra, having a mantra that you repeat to yourself. I don't know if it's kind of the same general idea, but you have a couple mantras that you recommend to people like \"I have value to add\" and things like that. What advice do you have there?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:16:27):\nYes, thank you. And that's mine. The one that you shared is, \"I have value to add.\" So if we were to really listen to the voice in our heads when it comes to communication, we say a lot of negative things to ourselves. We say things like, \"I'm not prepared. I'm not going to be as good as this person. I'm an imposter.\" We carry around with us a lot of this chatter that actually sets us up to not do well or to be more nervous. So if we can actually change that talk track, it can help us.\n\n(00:17:01):\nI'm not saying you have to go to an extreme and say, \"I'm going to be the best communicator ever.\" Rather you can simply say as I do and as you alluded to. What I'll say right before I speak is, \"I have value to bring.\"\n\n(00:17:12):\nOften when we are in communicative situations, especially at work, people want to hear from us. We've been invited to speak, we're on the agenda for the meeting. There is value people can take from our communication and we just have to remind ourselves of that. So having some little mantra that you can say that's not over the top but just makes sense. It could be as simple as you've got this, or I'm prepared, or I know my stuff. And I actually encourage people to write it on a post-it note if you're old school, sometimes people put it into their phones as a reminder. So like a minute or two minutes before they're set to give the presentation or participate in the meeting, it flashes up. We just have to turn off or turn down the noise of that internal negative self-talk.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):\nWhat are some other mantras that you found helpful or that people use?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:18:03):\nThey're very personal to different people. I was just coaching a senior leader the other day who his mantra was, \"Last time this went well.\" He's a leader, he does a lot of the same presentations and just by saying last time this went well, reminds him that it's likely to go well this time. We are very susceptible to catastrophizing when we're very nervous about things, especially when we're exposed in front of people. Not in the Brady Bunch exposure we talked about earlier, but when we're out there speaking or communicating and simply reminding ourselves that often they go very well is helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:36):\nYeah. There's another one that I think you shared which is, \"It's not about me, it's about my content.\"\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:18:41):\nYes, exactly. That's another one. That's a great one. It can be very helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):\nThe one you shared about, \"I've got this,\" reminds me, my wife took a course with the Artist's Way writer, Julia Cameron I think is her name. And she has this piece of advice where you name your critic, your inner critic that's always telling you to stop doing stuff. You name him or her. So I name mine Jim. And then when he or she is giving you things you don't want to hear, you're just like, \"Jim, I got this. Jim, I don't need this advice.\"\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:19:11):\nThere is a lot of evidence on personifying the things that challenge us and then having conversations with it. It's a way of rationalizing some of the things that we do that are quite negative. So something there for sure to be thinking about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:30):\nThere we go. Bonus advice. That was-\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:19:32):\nBonus advice, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):\nI didn't expect that.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:19:34):\nAnd the cool thing that what you're highlighting is there is a lot of advice out there on how to manage anxiety. Many of us feel like we're the only people who feel this nervous because we see our colleagues, our friends or Ted talks as you were talking about, and we see these people communicating just so effortlessly. Often a lot of work went into that and we don't see that work. And sometimes just knowing that others experience it makes us feel better.\n\n(00:19:58):\nIf you'll allow me, I'll tell this very quick story. I was in the San Francisco Airport, this was several years ago after my Speaking Up Without Freaking Out book came out, and my name was called over the PA system at the airport counter. The seat that I was supposed to sit in was broken and they wanted to talk to me about it. So when I came away from that, somebody came up to me and said, \"Hey, you're the guy that wrote that book on speaking anxiety.\" I said, \"Yes.\" And I said, \"What do you know about it?\" He goes, \"Oh, I bought the book.\" I said, \"Oh, was it helpful?\" He says, \"Incredibly helpful, but I didn't read it.\" I'm like, \"This is weird. So you're telling me the book was helpful and you didn't read it?\" And so I said, \"Tell me more.\" And he said, \"Just knowing that a book like that existed made me feel better because I don't know you and I know you certainly didn't write the book for me. So it implies that lots of people have this issue.\"\n\n(00:20:44):\nAnd just by normalizing the anxiety, which by the way is the normal condition. Those of us who study this believe it is innate to being human to feel nervous communicating in front of others. So sometimes just reminding yourself that you're not alone and that others have it can actually help reduce the pressure that we feel.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):\nThis is such an important point that I am kicking myself for not starting with this also because I think this is something people don't realize. They see all their execs at their company speaking incredibly well, so confidently, so articulately and just like, \"Oh my God, how will I ever be someone like that?\" Is there anything more you can share of just like you have tons of students that go through your class, you see these issues, they're more transparent, you think about their challenges, I imagine. Is there anything more you could share there to help people feel better? Like this is most people, even when you see someone amazing at speaking, they are also probably nervous.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:21:36):\nWith regard to that, I think we just need to talk about it more. We need to share about it. I mean, I always will share that I still have anxiety in speaking in certain situations and it's something that's taken me a long time to work on. I also help people understand that it's not a light switch. It's not like you either have it or you don't. It's a process. And so the idea is over time, we will feel less nervous if we apply some of these principles you and I are talking about.\n\n(00:22:01):\nA great technique to help people that often isn't talked about is many of us feel much more comfortable in conversation than we do in presenting. And conversation is a back and forth. So you can actually set up a lot of your communication situations, a presentation, a meeting, et cetera, as conversations. And you don't even have to have a conversation with the audience. You can simply have it with yourself. For example, what would it be like if you were to start a presentation by saying, \"Today I have three questions I'd like to answer. Question number one is...\" And you state the question and then you answer it. I am actually having a conversation with myself in that moment where I am asking myself a question. I happen to know the answer, I give the answer. This again, just like the reframing as excitement versus anxiety, this is a reframe. I'm not presenting, I'm having a conversation. And in so doing it ratchets down that anxiety.\n\n(00:22:53):\nSo we need to talk about it. We need to share our experiences with developing anxiety management plans. We realize it's not binary, it's not I have it or I don't. And we start seeing where we feel more comfortable and how can we bring that comfort level into the types of situations that make us nervous, like simply having a conversation with yourself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:13):\nYou have another technique I think that's different, maybe it's exactly the same, which is to ask a question of somebody else as you're talking, which is I think deflects attention from you. Can you talk about that?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:23:22):\nYeah. So we talked about the way we desensitize through visualization. The other thing we can do is distract.\n\n(00:23:30):\nI coached a very senior leader at Google who got very nervous when he was up in front of people, and what we did is we distract his audience. So he would start every single presentation saying these words, \"Good morning, let's watch this video.\" And he'd show a 30-second video that was on topic about something they were going to talk about in the meeting. And when the video stopped, he would then facilitate a discussion of what that video was about and then he would ease into his content. So he went from being a presenter to being a facilitator or somebody who was having a conversation with the audience. That made him feel so much better.\n\n(00:24:05):\nAnd so all of us can do things that can distract our audience. Now when I say distract, I don't mean take them on a tangent that's not relevant to what you're saying, but maybe you ask them a question, maybe you tell them a story, maybe you show them a video or ask them to read something. So there are lots of things that you can do that will help get the attention off you for just a little bit so that you can then focus on what works for you or take that deep breath that'll help calm you down. All of these are very useful techniques.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:35):\nYeah, it's interesting once you start talking, it's okay usually. It's the beginning part that you need [inaudible 00:24:40].\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:24:40):\nYeah, most people are most nervous one minute before speaking and the first minute of speaking. And if you can find ways to get yourself through that, then it becomes much easier for most people. There are some people who that's not true for, but for most people that's the way it works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):\nAwesome. Okay, next technique that actually another guest mentioned, and we spent a bunch of time on this, a guest named Johnny Miller, which is a breathing technique. And just to give a little context from what he taught us is that 80% of our neurons go from our body to our brain versus 20% is our brain telling our body what to feel. And so this research shows that what our body's feeling is what our brain's going to think. So if our body's acting nervous, we're going to think, oh, we're nervous. And if you change the state of your body, your mind feels different.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:25:23):\nI love this stuff. This research, embodied cognition is what it's called, is fascinating to me. I'll share one of my most favorite studies in this. There was a researcher at Duke, I think it was Duke, who... The only experimental variation that he did is he had people hold something that was cold in their hand, like an iced coffee versus a warm coffee. And then he asked the participants to make ratings of people. And if you were holding something cold, you saw the person as a colder person, as more aloof and more distant, and if you were holding something warm, you saw them as more collaborative and embracing. I find this stuff fascinating. What our body feels, our minds think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:03):\nAwesome. So along those lines, there's a technique that you recommend that he recommended, but I think it's a great reminder of the double exhale where you breathe in and then you exhale twice as long. Can you talk about that and tell people about it?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:26:13):\nYeah. Breathing is very helpful in managing so many of our anxiety symptoms. It slows down the heart rate, makes our voice sound more normal because when we get nervous, we breathe shallow and that changes... Our voice is a wind instrument, it changes the way we sound, can reduce some of the shakiness. So deep belly breathing, the kind you do if you've ever done yoga or tai chi, qigong, really important to do and there are a whole bunch of variations on it. The one you're talking about is the double inhalation where you're taking an inhale in until you feel completely full and then you sneak in a little extra air and then you take a long exhale. People call it box breathing and other types of breathing.\n\n(00:26:54):\nThe bottom line is this, what's critical to the relaxation response is the exhale. Lots of ways to inhale, lots of ways to exhale. You want your exhale to be longer than the inhale. The magic of the relaxation happens during the exhale. So I have a rule of thumb, I jokingly call it a rule of lung. You want your exhale to be twice as long as your inhale. So if you take a three count in, even if you sneak in a little extra air as we were talking about, take a six count out. And it is that way that you will feel... Not only will your body physiologically feel less stress, you'll be more focused in a present moment and not catastrophizing about all the things that might happen in the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:36):\nGreat. Yeah, so it's like another example of this sounds so trivial and why would breathing differently do have any impact on my nervousness? But one, there's all this research that shows that it does, and two, if you try it, and this is another one I use, is it actually works very quickly and you do it a few times and like, wow, I feel really different.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:27:54):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:55):\nIt is interesting you put these together. From the way I've seen it, these are two different techniques, but I've never tried them together. One is... I think Huberman is big on this one. All his clips are always talking about this. One of you inhale fully and then you inhale a little bit more and there's some capillaries or something in your lungs that fill up that-\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:28:12):\n[inaudible 00:28:12]. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:13):\nAnd then there's the 4, 4, 8 is the way this other guest shared is like breathe in four seconds, hold it four seconds, breathe out for eight seconds. But I'm going to try both. Wow. That's going to double up my calmness.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:28:27):\nYou'll be so mellow, nothing will bother you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:29):\nSo mellow. Okay. Are there any other techniques that you love that you find people find really helpful in calming their anxiety?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:28:39):\nWell, so the first book had 50 techniques and not all 50 techniques work for everybody. One that I personally think is a lot of fun is getting present oriented because when I'm in the present, by definition I'm not worried about the future. And many of our anxiety comes from our fear of a potential negative future outcome like, \"I'm not going to achieve my goal.\" So if I can do anything to be in the present moment, that helps me out a lot.\n\n(00:29:02):\nSomething I do as part of my personal anxiety management plan is I say tongue twisters. Tongue twisters for me are a great way to get present oriented. You can't say it right if you don't say the tongue twister if you're not focused on the present moment. And it also warms up your voice. A lot of nervous speakers get so inside their head that they don't warm up their voice. And we all know if you've ever done any exercise or competed in any sports, you should warm up first. We have this mistaken notion that we can go from silence to brilliance without warming up. And I like saying tongue twisters out loud to get present oriented and to warm up my voice. So that's one that I often recommend. People think it's silly, but I have people who are like, that really works. It really helps me to get centered and to warm up. And so I like that one a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:46):\nWell, let's share a couple of tongue twisters. What are some recommendations?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:29:50):\nI will only share my tongue twister, I say Lenny, if you promise to say it after me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):\nAbsolutely. I'm so ready.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:29:55):\nThis is my favorite tongue twister. It takes five seconds to say, it's three phrases long. And if you say it wrong, you say a naughty word. So I'm going to be listening as for all your listeners. So are you prepared? So it goes as follows, I slit a sheet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:10):\nI slit a sheet.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:30:11):\nA sheet I slit\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:13):\nA sheet I slit.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:30:14):\nAnd on that slitted sheet I sit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:18):\nAnd on that slitted sheet I sit.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:30:20):\nVery good. You didn't say that naughty word. I'm sure you can imagine what it would've been.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):\nA lot of danger, a lot of [inaudible 00:30:26].\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:30:26):\nA lot of danger. But in that moment you weren't thinking about, what's the next question I'm going to ask Matt? Or how much longer do we have in the podcast? No, you were simply focused on what we were saying and trying to say it without saying a naughty word. So that's that [inaudible 00:30:39]-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:38):\nAnd not have to censor this podcast.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:30:42):\nI've only had to bleep one guest in all my years of doing this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:46):\nOkay, cool. We're going to link to that. Is there any other ones you want to share before we move on to getting better at speaking on the spot?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:30:52):\nWell, the last one I'll say is, and this one is another one that falls in the kind of funny category, but there's research that says that when you swear, curse, it actually helps you reduce anxiety. When you curse, you release a flood of neurochemicals that blunt out the neurochemicals associated with anxiety, cortisol being a big one. So you get a big dopamine hit, for example, serotonin when you swear. So I'm not saying get up on stage and drop an F-bomb, but my students love this. I mean, it's like, \"Matt's giving me permission to swear.\" And no, that's not what I'm doing, but it's an interesting technique that seems to help some people is to curse not necessarily in front of people, but that can help. And it also has an analgesic effect. It actually reduces pain as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:44):\nThat's interesting. I could see during birth women screaming curse words.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:31:48):\nYeah. Well, I'm not going to say what I heard when my kids were born, but...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):\nBut again, this could double up with the tongue twister where you just go for it and say-\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:31:58):\nYeah, every tongue twister has to start with Nantucket and then we're good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda, and I mean that literally. I use Coda every day to help me plan each episode of this very podcast. It's where I keep my content calendar, my guest research, and also the questions that I plan to ask each guest.

I appreciate that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:44):\nNow we're going to be so, so careful, I don't want this podcast flagged and for adults only. Okay, shift to a new topic. You have a whole book about how to get better speaking on the spot. And I think why this is important is again, what I said at the beginning that I think most of our \"public speaking\" is not planned public speaking. There's people asking for feedback in a meeting, people wanting you to give a toast, Q&A as we talked about. So what I want to do is you have advice for broadly getting better at these things and then you have advice for very specifically how to get better at giving better toast, doing better Q&A, getting better at small talk and things like that. So I want to start with the broad advice and then get into each of these. That sound good?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:34:27):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:28):\nHow about you share your favorite techniques for broadly getting better at speaking on the spot, and then we'll see where that goes?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:34:37):\nSure. So the first thing in helping yourself feel better, speaking spontaneously, which is the vast majority of our communication, the plan presenting, the practiced pitch, the meeting with agenda pale in comparison to the times that we are spontaneously speaking. And the first thing that is important for everybody to know is we can all get better at it. That's the fundamental bottom line. Many of us feel like we're either born with the gift of gab or we're not. And so the first thing we have to realize is we can get better at it.\n\n(00:35:08):\nThe second big point to make is you actually have to prepare to be spontaneous. And that's counterintuitive, but it is through preparation that we get better at it. And if you think about it, if you think about an athlete, when an athlete is doing their sport, they are being spontaneous, they are responding to the conditions that present themselves to them. What helps them do well is all the preparation and practice that they've done. So there are lots of analogs to this, but when we think about it in of communication, it seems foreign, but when you think about it in athletics or jazz music, it's like of course you would prepare and practice. Those are the two big underlying principles to helping people get better.\n\n(00:35:48):\nThe next level has to do with we have to attack both mindset and approach and the actual messaging itself. The only way I have found to help people get better at this is to look at how we approach it, our mindset, and then how we actually craft the messages through structure and focus that help us be better. So that's the gradual process from the broadest level about how we have to go about making this better for ourselves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:14):\nMaybe let's dig into the structure.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:36:17):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:17):\nWhat is your advice for how to think about structuring if you're on the spot, like, \"Oh, shit, how do I share something smart [inaudible 00:36:22]?\"\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:36:22):\nSee, the bad word came out, so you're ready for my tongue twister. So structure is critical. In spontaneous speaking, most of us, because we feel the intense pressure, the anxiety we just talked about, we just spew out information, we list and itemize information. We take our audience on the journey of our own discovery of what we want to say as we're saying it, and our brains are not wired for lists of information. In fact, Lenny, how many items do you need to buy from the grocery store before you actually have to physically write it down? For me it's four. Anything over four, I'm going to forget something. Our brains aren't wired for lists, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):\nYeah.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:37:03):\nAnd so-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:04):\nI text myself.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:37:05):\nYeah, right, exactly. Yeah, no, I'm old school. I actually put it on a piece of paper, but the point is that we're not wired that way. Our brains are actually wired for story, for connection, a logical connection of ideas. So it's about connecting those pieces together. So a structure is nothing more than a beginning, a middle, and an end. A package of information. The structure that almost everybody listening in is familiar with is one that comes from the world of advertising. Most advertisements are set up as problem, solution, benefit. There's some problem in the world, here's how we solve it with our product or service, and here's how you benefit from it. That's a structure. It's a logical beginning, middle, and end. These items have a connection. So by finding a structure that you can rely on when put on the spot, it halves your burden.\n\n(00:37:54):\nWhen you're put on the spot, you have to think about what to say and how to say it. The structure tells you how to say it, and then you just have to think about what to put into it. So it's like having a recipe. If I have a recipe and I have good ingredients, I can cook a good meal. So there are lots of structures.\n\n(00:38:10):\nThe whole second part of the book Think Faster, Talk Smarter is specific structures for specific situations, introducing yourself, making an apology, giving feedback. And I'm not saying every time you give an apology or give feedback that you have to follow these structures. It just gives you a place to go when you're in that moment where you're like, \"Where do I go? How do I start?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:33):\nCool. So we're going to talk about those examples. One of the structures that I liked that I wrote down is called prep, which is make your point, give a reason for making that point, give an example. And then what's the last one point again?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:38:47):\nYeah, restate your point. Review it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:48):\nRestate your point. That feels like something that say in product teams can come up a lot is just like, here's what I think, here's why. Here's an example and then let me just remind you again what the point I'm making.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:38:57):\nThat's right. Yes. I love prep and the structure I really like is a three-question structure: What? So what? Now what? And people on product teams I think could benefit so much from this. What is your product, your service, your offering, your update, your feedback? It's the what of why you're speaking. The so what is why is this important and relevant to the people you're talking to or to your company or to prospective clients? And then the now what is what comes next. So on a product team, if you're describing a feature, here's what the feature is, here's why it's important, and here's what we're doing about it. If you're giving an update in an update meeting, a standup that you're having, here's what I'm working on, here's why it's important, here's what I'm doing next.\n\n(00:39:41):\nBy packaging the information up in what, so what, now what, it becomes much more digestible, much more memorable. Just like prep. Prep works really well for a point you're making. What, so what, now what works really well for a broader presentation, update, feedback session that you're giving. So having a whole series of these tools in your toolkit can really make a difference.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):\nSo we've talked about three structures so far. What, so what, now what; prep, which is make the point, give a reason example, and then restate the point; and then problem, solution benefit. So people listening to this it's like, \"Oh, amazing, all these structures are great.\" Do you have any advice on how to remember these? You're like, \"Oh, Matt, what do you think of this design?\" Like, \"Oh, shit, which one should I go with?\"\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:40:28):\nI try to give each structure a catchy name. What, so what, now what rolls off the tongue. There's a structure in the book for giving feedback called 4Is for Apologizing AAA. So part of it is just coming up with a mnemonic that works for you and you can name them whatever you want, but really the way to get familiar with them and to have them at the ready is to use them.\n\n(00:40:48):\nWhen I coach people on what, so what, now what, I encourage them at the end of a podcast they listen to or something they read, take a moment and say, \"What was it about? Why is it important to me and what can I do with that information?\" And if you do that, not only do you get better and more comfortable deploying that structure, but you also remember the material better because there's a whole bunch of research that says when we interrogate the material that we listen to or read, we digest it and remember it more. So in 30 seconds you're really helping yourself at least in two ways by getting the structure down and remembering more. So you have to put it into practice.\n\n(00:41:24):\nThe other way to do it in which we do a lot in my classroom is we have people dissect communication. So you listen to somebody or you see it and you say, what structure did they use? So it's about awareness building and then actually getting the reps. The only way you get better at communication, spontaneous or planned, is the way you get better at anything. Repetition, reflection, and feedback. You got to practice, you got to think about what worked or what didn't, and then you have to get feedback from others. We are not always the best judges of our communication. And in so doing, repetition, reflection and feedback takes your communication to the next level.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):\nThat's a lot of work, Matt. That's a lot of work.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:42:02):\nIt is work. There is no shortcut.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:04):\nGot you.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:42:05):\nBut that's true with most things in life that are really important. There's no shortcut.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):\nThat's right. That's right. As people are thinking about this and listening to this, there's your course, obviously that you teach at Stanford and only Stanford students can take that. There's your book obviously. Is there anything else? If there's nothing, that's totally fine, that you point people to to actually practice these outside of the workplace? Are there courses that anyone can take that you recommend? Anything else you can point people to?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:42:31):\nAbsolutely. There are a lot of resources out there. One, I'm a huge proponent and a former member of Toastmasters. I think Toastmasters is a wonderful organization designed primarily to give you the reps. They do some teaching, but it's really to give you the reps. So I highly recommend Toastmasters.\n\n(00:42:48):\nImprovisation is another way to get comfortable with these skills. When people hear improv, they think, \"Oh, I got to be funny and it's about performing,\" and it's not. Improv is really just about being more comfortable, being present, and really focusing on collaborating with others.\n\n(00:43:04):\nAnd then there are courses. You mentioned obviously that people have to be MBA students to take my MBA class, but Stanford and other institutions have continuing studies classes or extension classes that are open to the community. So I, every quarter teach a class that's open to anybody who registers all over the world. It's virtual. I have students this very quarter who take a class on a Monday night Pacific Time, 7:00 PM. I've got somebody in Egypt, I have somebody in China. So there are ways to take advantage of things happening at universities without being an enrolled student. So I would point people to all of those. And then clearly listening to podcasts, reading books, checking out blogs and videos can be really helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:44):\nI think to your point, it's like you can read about this and listen to podcasts all you want, but you're not going to actually get that much better. And with your course, I imagine there's practice you're doing as a part of the course.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:43:53):\nEverything is applied. The only way to get better at communication is to do communication, to watch communication. And that's why in the books I write, I have this, try this. It's literally put the book down, go do this and then come back because that's how you learn communication. And so yes, any avenue to help you get the reps is going to be helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):\nI'll be honest, I did none of the try this. I'm just like, that's too much work. So I think that's why it's important to take something where you have to do it because it's too easy just like, yeah, yeah.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:44:24):\nYeah. You're not the first person to say that they don't take the time to do that. There are others who say they really appreciate that. And for people such as yourself, at the very end of my book, I have a QR code that takes you to a bunch of videos. So if you don't want to do it yourself, you can actually watch people do it or watch me do it. And so that's at least better than not doing any of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:46):\nAwesome. I'll also give a shout-out to Toastmasters. I did Toastmasters for a while and two things there. One is there's a special focus on the spot speaking that's a part of the sequence.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:44:56):\nThey call them table topics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:58):\nTable topics, yeah. And that's like a 60-second, someone gets up and just has to talk on something. So it's a big part of that method. Also, I did it for a long time and all I did was I was the counter or the timer. You can do it without having to give any talks for as long as you want. And it's very cheap and they're everywhere. There's a local chapter wherever you are.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:45:17):\nAbsolutely. And many companies sponsor their own Toastmasters groups, so that's great. And they are very good at easing people into it. You're not forced to do anything. And the same is with improv. A good improv teacher never forces anybody to do anything.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:31):\nGreat. We went way off-topic, but let's get back to the agenda at hand, which is let's talk about specific situations and advice you have for getting better at these. So maybe we start with small talk and there's one that I love and I find so important and so subtle, which is have comparable levels of disclosure. And the question basically is how do we get better at small talk? And here's one technique.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:45:55):\nYeah, so let me get to that point in a second because that's a more refined point than some general principles. When it comes to small talk, many people dread small talk, they feel really awkward about it. I think small talk has a bad reputation, needs to be rebranded. I think a lot of big things happen in small talk. We learn about ourselves and others. We form and foster relationships. I challenge everybody listening to think about some of their friends, our closest friends. How did you meet them? Probably some component of small talk played a role, especially early in those relationships. So it does good things for us.\n\n(00:46:32):\nThe best advice I have ever heard for small talk came from a guest on my podcast. Her name's Rachel Greenwald. She's an interesting person. She's an academic and a matchmaker, really fascinating. And her advice was this: Be interested, not interesting. Many of us go into small talk thinking we have to be super interesting. We have to spike the ball over the net every time. When in fact small talk is more like playing the game of Hacky Sack, where it's simply just set the other person up to be successful and get the ball back to you. So if we go in with that mindset, it makes it easier.\n\n(00:47:06):\nNow there's some rules that we can follow. One rule is the one that you shared that in small talk there should be a balance of disclosure or depth of disclosure over time. So if you're telling me about the first time your first pet died, and I'm telling you my favorite color is blue, there's a discrepancy in disclosure there. Clearly you've revealed a lot more than I have. And we have this notion of reciprocity that if you share something that is appropriate but is more disclosive, that I should at some point match that level or come close. And if we don't, then it feels very awkward and we feel like we're not jiving in that way.\n\n(00:47:49):\nI don't want everybody sitting with a little card that they're checking off, but having that general notion in mind can help. And the trick here is not to be too disclosive too quickly. So if we start small talk and we're talking about the I meeting that we're at, and you immediately jump into the fight you had with your significant other that might lead to divorce, that's a deep and big step that might feel a little inappropriate. But over time, if we continue to disclose, it might be perfectly natural for you to share that. So there's sort of expectations and we just have to be mindful of those.\n\n(00:48:24):\nAnother thing we need to be mindful of that I think is really important is this distinction between shifting and supporting responses. In a conversation, I can be supportive. That is, you might say, \"Hey Matt, I just got back from Costa Rica.\" I could say, \"Oh great, did you spend time in San Jose? Did you get to any of the beaches?\" Those are supporting responses. I'm asking you to keep telling me more. A shifting response would be like, \"Oh, you went to Costa Rica. I went to Hawaii.\" And the goal in a good conversation is to have more supporting responses than shifting, but to have some shifting responses. Because if all I do is continually support you, it looks like I don't want to share. I'm not being disclosive at all. So there are these subtle things that we can be aware of to help the conversation go and to breed that intimacy and immediacy that we feel, but it takes a congruence, a balancing of doing that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:16):\nThis is awesome. I feel like everyone needs this class to just like, how do I talk to people? What's the right way to talk?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:49:24):\nWell, right. The point that you're bringing up there, Lenny, is we're never taught this stuff and yet we have to do it all the time. And that's why focusing on it I think really matters. And it can really, as you said, superpower, it can be a superpower because so many people don't do this or spend the time getting better at it. We all operate under this notion of... the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. And that's not good for small talk and other communication situations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:53):\nI love this balance you just shared of... So the primary piece of advice for small talk is be interested, not interesting, ask person questions, get excited about what they're telling you. There's a classic book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, which is very much about this. Highly recommend it. It's like very old school now, but there's so much good advice there. There's no better sound to someone's ears than their name. So just saying their name, they're like, \"Yeah, I love that.\" And then just smiling. There's all these very simple things that that book shares. It sounds like you recommend and you're fan of that book, and it's something you've read, right?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:50:27):\nI know the book. Some of that stuff has been true for a long time. Some of the stuff. I'm not a big fan of ingratiation and manipulation. I like authenticity and some of the advice in books like that can sound like smile, nod your head. And all of that can sound a little manipulative and inauthentic, but I think some of those principles are important. And if you can in an authentic, true, appropriate way, leverage some of that, I think it would help you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:57):\nYeah, somebody once shared a story with their kid... Then they're 13. They read that book and it just effed them up for a while because they just started putting these into practice way too young.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:51:06):\nWell, one thing... I mean, all of a sudden you're focusing on... You can get so wrapped up in doing these things that you're actually not connecting. It's like people who travel on a vacation and all they do is take pictures of where they are instead of experiencing where they are. And that's not where we want to be with this advice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:23):\nBut I love this other component of... Because a lot of people hear this advice, ask questions, be interested, be excited, this version of it, but you need to have somewhat equal levels of disclosure is really important. Because I fall into this sometimes where like, \"I don't care about myself. I just want to ask you questions. And this is going great, I'm just going to keep asking.\" And if you're not sharing anything by yourself, it gets really strange. Even when they ask you, you're like, \"No, no, let's keep talking about you.\" You think they want that, but they don't. They actually want to hear about you.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:51:50):\nYeah, absolutely. And you do such a lovely job as a podcast... I mean, so podcast host is a great job for you if you like asking questions, but I bet you have found, because I have found this for me as being a host of Think Fast, Talk Smart is that sharing a little bit about your own experience actually makes the conversations go better. And so I think that's a lesson for all of us, and you don't have to have your own podcast to learn that lesson.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:16):\nYeah, I read this book on podcasting interviewing when I first started, and one of the big piece of advice is if you share more about yourself, you'll hear more stories that they can share. They're more vulnerable. Not that I think about that, but that's in my head sometimes.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:52:29):\nYeah. Well, you do a good job of it, even if it's just intuitive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:33):\nAppreciate it.\n\n(00:52:33):\nLet's talk about another version of on-the-spot talking, which is giving feedback. Oftentimes people listening to this podcast, they're asked, what do you think of this design? What do you think of this roadmap? What do you think of the strategy? What are some tips for getting better at on-the-spot feedback?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:52:48):\nFirst and foremost, we need to look at and define feedback. Feedback to me is an opportunity to problem solve. Certainly there are some behaviors that we absolutely have to shut down. It's inappropriate, it's inexcusable, we have to shut it down. But often feedback is really an opportunity to problem solve. And if you take it as an opportunity to problem solve, then what you're looking for is collaboration with the other person, which means that we have to invite them to join us as we do this. So it's not me bestowing upon you my opinion, it's me inviting you to together work on whatever this issue challenge is that we have. And I am a huge disciple of Kim Scott, Radical Candor. I really like her approach to it. Kim's a friend. She's actually a neighbor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:33):\nWell, she's been on the podcast, by the way.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:53:35):\nOh, great. So you know Kim and your listeners know Kim. Yeah, she's great. Where I think I can add a little value to what Kim talks about, and she does talk about structure, but I think having the structure to package up the information to make it easier to digest by your audience, the person or people you're talking to, but also to formulate your thoughts can help. And we've already talked about one mechanism, one structure for feedback. It's what, so what, now what?\n\n(00:53:59):\nSo imagine, Lenny, you and I come out of a meeting and you say, \"Hey, Matt, how'd that go?\" I could say, \"I thought the meeting went really well, Lenny, except when you talked about the implementation plan. You spoke a little quicker than you did with the other parts and you didn't go into the same level of detail.\" That's my what. \"When you speak quickly without a lot of detail, people might think you're not as prepared or you're really concerned about this part.\" That's the so what. \"Next time I suggest you slow down and you include these two or three bits of data so that people see you really are knowledgeable on this area.\" So that's the now what.\n\n(00:54:32):\nSo that what, so what, now what helps me very quickly structure information and package it in a way that helps me as the giver of the feedback, think through what are the things I need to say? I need to think through what's bothering me, what the consequences are of that behavior, and then what I think you should do.\n\n(00:54:51):\nThere's a more robust structure I talk about in the book called The 4 Is, and each I stands for something starting with the letter I. But four eyes also like glasses. It helps you see more clearly. So in the 4 I structure, the first I is information. You're just setting the playing field so the person knows what you're giving the feedback about. The second is impact, and this is impact on you, the feedback giver. The third is the invitation that you make, and then the final is the implications or consequences.\n\n(00:55:19):\nSo imagine I have an employee who doesn't show up to the meetings on time and prepared. I might say, \"This is the third time that you have showed up late to this meeting. I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others of us are. What can we do to help make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting? Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project.\" So information, impact, invitation, and implications. Now, certainly I can vary the tone and the directness of some of those responses so it sounds very differently, but thinking through it in my mind, I have to level set what we're talking about. I have to share why it's important to me at least, make the invitation, and talk about the benefits or consequences. Makes a lot of sense. So there are lots of structures and lots of ways to communicate, especially in feedback. Find one or two that work for you so when you're put on the spot, you can default to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:13):\nMaybe a big takeaway here is pick one of these structures that you want to use when somebody asks you for feedback. And the two you shared are what? So what? Now what? Or these four Is. Give information, show the impact that it had on you, invitation and then implications.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:56:30):\nThat's correct, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:32):\nOkay. Let's talk about another category, which is not a work category, but I suck at toasts and I am always trying to get better at this. And you have a bunch of awesome advice for how to give better toasts. Can you share some stuff?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:56:45):\nYeah. We have all been victimized by bad toasts. The toast that goes on too long, the toast that's more about the person giving the toast than the event or the person. And when I say toast, I don't just mean at weddings, bar mitzvahs, quinceaneras. We give tributes at work all the time. Congratulations to the team or somebody's anniversary or somebody's retirement. So we give toasts and tributes all the time. In fact, I heard a statistic once that it is the most frequent public speaking event across people is giving toasts and tributes. So we should learn how to do these well.\n\n(00:57:16):\nSo I have an acronym. It works. It's called WHAT. W-H-A-T. The W stands for why are we here? Now, if I'm at a wedding, I don't have to tell the audience why we're here. We get it. But if we're doing an all hands and I'm called up to speak, it might be in my best interest to share with everybody, I'm here to celebrate the release of this product that that team put out. So you might have to say, why are we here?\n\n(00:57:42):\nThe H is how are you connected to the event? So if I'm at a wedding, people might not know who I am. I could say, \"Hey, I've known the groom for 25 years.\" And people are like, \"Oh, okay. Now that makes sense.\" If you're giving a tribute at work, you don't have to say, \"And I'm the boss.\" Everybody knows your position. So again, these are choices you make. So why are we here? How are you connected?\n\n(00:58:02):\nThe A stands for anecdote. Tell a story or a quick example that is relevant and accessible to everybody. There's no insider knowledge and keep it concise.\n\n(00:58:16):\nAnd then ultimately the last part is the gratitude, the thank you. So express gratitude, express some kind of thanks. In a toast at a celebratory event, you might say cheers or whatever's appropriate for the culture you come from to signal closure. But again, why are we here? How are you connected? Anecdote or two, and then the gratitude or thanking at the end. And if you follow that structure, it can navigate, just like a GPS, your way through the toast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):\nThis is such an easy structure to remember. There's so much of it that I love. What I want to understand is where do you put the actual content of the tribute and the toast? Is it the anecdote expands into, \"Here's what I want to say?\" Like there's an example or story and then it's like-\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:58:59):\nExactly. So it is typically part of that. You might do it as part of the why we're all here. \"We're here to really celebrate the Herculean effort of this particular team to get this product launched. I'm so honored to have supported it. I'm the manager of the team. Here's a story about how Lenny worked overtime to get this done. Let's raise our glasses and give them a salute.\" So yes, you could do it in the why are we here or through the anecdotes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:29):\nOkay. And then one of your other piece of advice, which connects to what you just said is be brief.\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:59:33):\nYes, yes. So nobody has ever complained about a toast that's too brief. I'm sure it's possible, but the majority of complaints are the toast went on forever.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):\nDo you find that it would ever make sense to give a couple anecdotes or make a couple points in a toast?\n\nMatt Abrahams (00:59:51):\nYeah, and it depends. Toasts are opportunities for teaching and learning as well, especially in a work environment. So it might make sense to tell a couple anecdotes. I'm a huge fan... I mean, your listeners know, you know minimally viable product design, agile development, really critical. What is it about? It's about understanding your audience, your users, and it's about rapidly prototyping and iterating. I believe in minimally viable communication, trademark pending, where it's the same principles. Know your audience, put together a rough draft of what you want to say, test it out. So if you're going to give a big toast in front of a company all hands, run it by a few people and say, \"Is it too many anecdotes? Would it benefit from having another story?\" Get people's feedback. We are not the best judges of our communication. So the answer is yes, but test it out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):\nAnother element of a great toast that you recommend is to be emotional. Can you touch on that?\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:00:50):\nWell, so emotion connects with people, and as long as it's genuine and authentic, it's really important. I've been thinking a lot about emotion and communication. My father recently passed away and everybody in my family said, \"Well, Matt's going to do the eulogy.\" It was like, I had no choice. What do I do? I'm the guy who teaches communication. So I felt added pressure not only to honor my father's life, but everybody's like, \"This is the way you do a eulogy.\" And so I wanted to do some research on what's all the advice out there on eulogies, and there wasn't a lot. So I actually wrote an article on my experience, and hopefully it'll help people. But the point is, in those circumstances where there's a lot of emotion, it's important because it connects to the audience, it makes it human, but sometimes the emotion can get in the way for you as a communicator. I mean, I was very concerned that my emotion would cover up or overshadow the honoring I was trying to do of my father. But the same thing can happen in any kind of toast situation.\n\n(01:01:48):\nSo think about emotion. Emotion is a tool to use. The best way to convey emotion in a toast is through the anecdotes you use. The anecdotes reveal the emotion. It's one thing to say, \"I am so sad.\" It's another thing to tell a story that is sad.\n\n(01:02:02):\nI was very fortunate to interview for my podcast coming up soon, a one-panel cartoonist. So she has to create everything in one panel. And her advice is: Don't tell, show. In that don't tell somebody you're angry, show that you're angry in the panel she writes. So showing the emotion through story and anecdote is the way to do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:22):\nHave you had Matthew Dix on your podcast?\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:02:26):\nSo it is so funny. I have not, and I want to. His name comes up more than anybody else's. And I know of his work and his advice, so I might ask you to connect me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:35):\nAbsolutely. I thought of him as you were talking because he helps people create their eulogy ahead of time before somebody passes away, before you get really emotional and you have to rush it. So that's one of his services is he helps to write eulogies for people.\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:02:50):\nYeah, yeah. No, I'd love an introduction. His work is very influential.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):\nAbsolutely. He's amazing. We'll link his episode about storytelling.\n\n(01:02:57):\nOkay, let me talk about a couple more. Q&A, getting better at question, answer at the end of a talk, whether it's on the spot or not.\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:03:05):\nAgain, I always start with approach. Many of us see Q&A as threatening or challenging, and in fact, we need to see Q&A as an opportunity. It's an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, learn. Even in the most hostile of situations where people are really coming at you with a lot of spice or hot and heavy, you can get a lot of value out of it. So we have to come to the approaches. These questions are opportunities. We have to make sure that we take the question in without interrupting or over-validating the question.\n\n(01:03:36):\nI have two pet peeves about Q&A sessions. One is saying good question to every question. And two, at the end of answering the question saying, \"Does that make sense?\" Because in both cases, you're trying to validate the asker when you say good question. You're also trying to buy yourself time. And there are other ways to do that. And at the end when you say, \"Does that make sense,\" you've got a laudable goal in mind, which is, \"Did I answer your question?\" But I'd much rather you say, \"Did I answer your question? Can I tell you more? Do you have a follow-up question?\"\" Because if you keep saying, \"does that make sense, does that make sense,\" people are going to start thinking, \"Maybe he doesn't make sense because he is always asking.\" So some pet peeves there.\n\n(01:04:15):\nOnce the question comes in and you have to answer it, I have yet another structure. This structure is related to the what, so what, now what structure. It's called ADD for adding value. You answer the question cleanly and concisely. You then give an example to reinforce the answer, and then you explain the relevance or significance of the answer so people know it. Would you mind role-playing an example of this with me, Lenny?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:43):\nAbsolutely.\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:04:44):\nOkay. Imagine you're hiring me. You're a hiring manager, and I'm interviewing to be what I do for my day job. I'm a lecturer at Stanford's Business School, teach strategic communication. You so happen to have a position open for a strategic communication lecturer. I show up. What is a reasonable question you would ask that doesn't just have a yes no answer?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:07):\nWait, so you're interviewing for a role to be a lecturer in my school and [inaudible 01:05:11] communication.\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:05:11):\nYes. You're the dean. You get to hire me. What's a reasonable question? I mean, you could ask a super hard one, but I want people to hear how ADD works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:19):\nThis might be too simple, but just how many students have you worked with and taught over the years?\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:05:23):\nOkay, so I'm going to morph that question because I could just say thousands, which is true, but I'm going to turn it into a question about experience, because really what you're asking me is what's my experience? So because that I can give an ADD answer too. If it's just a numeric answer, just give a number. So I might say, \"I've been doing this for 25 years and I have taught over thousands of students. I've taught both in the academic world, but also in the corporate world. What this means is I can tailor my material to be relevant and useful to your students.\"\n\n(01:05:56):\nSo I answered the question. The question was, what's your experience? 25 years, thousands of students. I then give an example. I've done this in the corporate world, I've done this in the academic world. So I ground it in something tangible. And then I show the relevance. What this means for you as a dean hiring me, is that I'm going to be able to tailor my experience. We often assume that people can connect the dots. If I give my answer, you're going to see, \"Oh, that's why this is relevant and important.\" But we need to actually connect those dots for our audience.\n\n(01:06:24):\nI had a psychology professor once who said, the funny thing about common sense is it's not so common, and we often make the assumption that people will connect the dots. So answer the question, give a detailed example, and then explain the relevance. And if you do that, it will help. And I challenge every one of your listeners working in companies that have FAQs, frequently asked questions, go back to those FAQs and put them in this structure. Not only will it help you digest and get familiar and comfortable with the structure, anybody looking at those answers begins to see that this is a way to give a complete answer. This is how our organization answers questions. And that can be so helpful to building consistency and helping yourself answer better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:06):\nJust to clarify, the acronym is ADD?\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:07:09):\nADD. Answer, detailed example, describe the relevance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):\nDescribe the relevance. I see how you snuck that D in there.\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:07:16):\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, you can come up with whatever acronym you want that helps you remember. ADD because it adds value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:24):\nAwesome. Okay. And maybe one last quick one, apologizing. What's a couple tips for getting better at apologizing on the spot?\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:07:33):\nFirst and foremost, we need to take the time to apologize. Many of us don't. And when we apologize, we need to make sure that we apologize for the transgression and not for how we made people feel. So often people will simply say, \"I'm sorry that you feel bad.\" Well, that's not an apology. You're not assuming responsibility. So we need to first start by talking about the issue that we are addressing or the problem that we caused somebody. So we need to think about apologies in that way. So an apology to me, I have a AAA, like roadside repair service here in the United States, AAA. It's three steps, acknowledge, appreciate, and amends. So I have to acknowledge what I did.\n\n(01:08:23):\nSo imagine we're in a meeting and I interrupted you. You were in the midst of speaking and I interrupted you. So I might say, \"I'm very sorry for interrupting what you were saying. I over-spoke when you were talking.\" I'm acknowledging what I did.\n\n(01:08:36):\nThen I appreciate. \"I can imagine my doing that made you feel bad and you feel that you didn't get your fair share of sharing your point of view.\" So that's the appreciation.\n\n(01:08:46):\nThe amends part is, \"I will work not to do this. In fact, I will wait till you're done, and I will actually paraphrase what you said before I contribute my point.\" So I'm signaling I understand it, and here's the very specific thing I'm going to do to try to remedy it, which of course you can comment on. You can say, no, I don't think that's enough. I think you whatever, or thank you, I think that's even more than is needed, whatever. So you acknowledge the actual behavior and offense, not how you made the person feel right away. You then express appreciation for the difficulty you might've caused, and then you make amends. And the AAA approach, I think can really be helpful to people to be better at in-the-moment apologies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:29):\nAmazing. Matt, I think we've packed this episode with so many tactical golden nuggets to help people become better communicators, especially on the spot. Is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with before I ask you how they can find you online and things like that?\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:09:45):\nAgain, I want to go back to how we started the second part about spontaneous speaking. Everybody can get better at communication. And I encourage, I challenge people to take the steps that they need to take to do it. So it starts with initiative. It's followed by grace and a lot of compassion, it takes time. But in so doing, you can improve your communication and help others. It's not just about you finding your voice, it's about you sharing that voice with others. So taking the time to work on your communication is critically important, and I encourage everybody to do so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:18):\nAll right. I'm hoping people will follow that advice. And if not, think back to what we talked about at the beginning of just how much impact these have and how many people are also going through the same challenges you're probably feeling speaking and being on the spot. All right, where can folks find your podcast, your book, and also how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:10:37):\nOh, I love that last question. So mattabrahams.com, great place to go to to find things. So at mattabrahams.com you'll find a whole bunch of resources. My own and others. I've curated a bunch of resources. You can find Think Fast, Talk Smart wherever you get podcasts and on YouTube. And then the book Think Faster, Talk Smarter is available everywhere. I'm a huge user of LinkedIn. And to answer that last question you asked, I invite people to connect on LinkedIn. I'd love to hear their stories and find ways to collaborate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):\nAwesome. And your podcast is ranked higher than this podcast. You're in a different category, which is a very competitive category. The business category. I've moved myself to the technology category, which feels more natural to me, but your podcast is killing it, so congrats.\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:11:06):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:21):\nThank you for sharing your wisdom with us. That's it. Matt, thank you again for being here.\n\nMatt Abrahams (01:11:27):\nGreat pleasure to have the conversation with you, Lenny. I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:30):\nSame.

  "transcript": "# The surprising truth about what closes deals: Insights from 2.5m sales conversations | Matt Dixon\n\n## Transcript\n\nMatt Dixon (00:00):\nWe collected two and a half million sales calls and studied them with a machine learning platform at scale.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05):\nThe big insight is that you're losing most of your sales deals, not to competition, but to indecision.\n\nMatt Dixon (00:12):\nAnd that indecision stems from their fear of failure. Dialing up the FOMO backfires 87% of the time. They're not afraid of missing out, they're afraid of messing up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20):\nYou just talk about how to actually leverage these insights to improve your sales process. You have something, I think you call it the JOLT method?\n\nMatt Dixon (00:25):\nYeah, JOLT them forward. The first thing is we've got to judge their level of indecision. The second thing is we've got to offer a recommendation. The third thing is we've got to get them to start trusting us and we call it limit the exploration, and the T is we've got to de-risk the deal. We've got to take some risk off the table. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38):\nGreat segue to The Challenger Sale, which is basically this on steroids. \n\nMatt Dixon (00:41):\nMost salespeople are trying to figure out what's keeping the customer up at night. The challenger approach is about showing the customer what should be keeping them up at night. What's a risk that they don't know about but you do. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51):\nHoly moly, this is going to be the most action-packed, high-density podcast episode we've done. Today, my guest is Matt Dixon. Matt is one of the world's foremost experts in sales, known for his groundbreaking research into what makes the best salespeople different from everyone else. His first book, The Challenger Sale, was a number one Wall Street Journal bestseller and has sold over a million copies worldwide. His most recent book, The JOLT Effect, builds on his lessons and insights and will change how you do sales. \n\n(01:23):\nIn our conversation, Matt breaks down what you're probably doing wrong in your sales process based on research, into millions of sales conversations, and then how to tweak your process to be a lot more successful. This episode is for anyone that wants to improve their sales skills or improve the rate at which they close deals. \n\n(01:40):\nWith that, I bring you Matt Dixon and if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Matt, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nMatt Dixon (01:59):\nIt's great to be here. Thank you for the invitation, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:01):\nIt's great to have you here. First of all, a huge thank you to April Dunford for connecting us. She's a huge fan of your work. She mentioned you a number of times on the podcast episode that she did. She's great. \n\nMatt Dixon (02:11):\nYeah, she's very nice. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:12):\nShe's amazing. You basically spend your time researching salespeople and digging into what makes the best salespeople different from all the rest, and then synthesizing these lessons into these really actionable pieces of advice so that anyone can become better at sales, which to me feels like a dream come true even if I'm not a salesperson, even though many of us do sales part-time, but especially if you're a salesperson. \n\n(02:40):\nFirst of all, just to give people a sense of the work that you do, could you just talk a bit about the research that went into the books that we're going to talk about, we're going to be focusing on The Challenger Sale and The JOLT Effect. What is the research they did?\n\nMatt Dixon (02:53):\nYeah, sure. Just start with The Challenger, because that chronologically came first. We actually started that research study in, I think it was in late 2008 actually, and we published the initial results to, at the time I was working for a company called CEB, which was acquired by Gartner Group in 2017, a research organization, and then I was running the group that served heads of sales, business, business heads of sales around the world. We had five or 600 clients around the world, and we launched that study in '08. \n\n(03:24):\nWe published the initial results for our clients in '09. We kept collecting some data and then we published the book in 2011. The book was published off a data set of 6,000 salespeople, so we did an in-depth survey with 6,000 salespeople, as well as collected performance data on those 6,000 sellers. It was a global, cross industry, different types of companies as well, product companies, services companies, large, small, slow growth, fast growth, you name it.\n\n(03:50):\nOvertime, though, that research has been ongoing, so we've collected data. I think to date, on roughly a quarter million salespeople around the world that we continue to go back and not just validate the original findings, but look at how things are changing and do cuts of the data now that the data set's so big. That was a survey based piece of research we did. \n\n(04:11):\nThe JOLT Effect, we started that research in 2020, actually. It was actually in March of 2020, which I think is a time that everybody remembers with probably mixed emotions, most of them bad. I think though, you remember March was a time when people were getting into Tiger King and baking sourdough bread. A few months later, that got really old, but in the beginning it was kind of surprising and weird and this whole pandemic thing, but we actually thought because we're huge nerds, that this would be an interesting time to do a sales research project.\n\n(04:44):\nWe had always been fascinated by what Professor Neil Rackham did back in the '70s and '80s and spin selling, and he and his research team sat in on 30 something thousand sales calls, physically sat in on these meetings and took notes. They're a team of psychologists to produce the research that went into spin selling, and so we always kind of aspire to get, if you will, at the coal face or where the rubber hits the road in sales, which is the sales conversation when that salesperson is sitting across from the customer. \n\n(05:11):\nThe problem with that is it's really hard to get people to pay for that kind of research, that kind of undertaking, and then let alone, getting invited into those meetings because a lot of the really critical sales meetings took place, of course, in the client's office. Until March of 2020 when that all changed and the entire sales process for every company on Earth went to Zoom and Teams and Webex and other virtual platforms.\n\n(05:34):\nWe recruited several dozen companies across industry and around the world into a large global study, and we collected two and a half million sales calls and studied them with a machine learning platform at scale. That was a very different kind of research project and honestly, it's fun just as a researcher to look back on Challenger and the manual survey-based approach and the interviews and all this stuff to fast forward to today, being able to take advantage of large data sets and advance technology to study millions of sales conversations is pretty cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (06:07):\nAmazing. Okay, so the second book, the most recent book, The JOLT Effect is based on these two and a half million sales conversations. \n\nMatt Dixon (06:13):\nMm-hmm. That's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (06:14):\nI love insights that come from tons of data, so this is most excellent. This episode is brought to you by Enterpret.

The way that I understand is the big insight is that you're losing most of your sales deals not to competition, but to indecision. Basically, customers preferring to do nothing versus choosing something because they are afraid of making a mistake.\n\nMatt Dixon (08:24):\nGood summary. Yeah, [inaudible 00:08:25], if you're busy, you said it more succinctly. I've been doing this for a while now and you said it way more succinctly than I can. Just to back up for a little bit, I think one of the data points I always start with when I present the research on The JOLT Effect is that our analysis showed that anywhere between 40 and 60% of the average salesperson's qualified pipelines, these aren't just leads, sometimes bad leads that are thrown over to us by marketing, these are qualified opportunities. \n\n(08:53):\nThese are people we've met with, customers we've pursued, we've engaged, they're in the sales process, 40 to 60% of them will be ultimately marked as closed loss, no decision. That's actually, I think that number is actually on the rise, especially in places like SaaS and the broader tech sector over the past year and a half, but that's a really painful thing. \n\n(09:13):\nIf you think about as a salesperson, that for 46% of your deals, you're going to spend a lot of time, energy, resources, a lot of your company's money and their time and resources pursuing these opportunities where you eventually just get ghosted and you don't really know what happened, just like the customer, the opportunity evaporated on you, they ghosted you, they want radio silent. You don't really know what happened there. \n\n(09:35):\nWe decided to take this two and a half million sales call dataset, which you could have used to answer lots of different questions, but we were really fascinated by this question, maybe two, two questions. One is why do customers make no decision? Because you understand it's frustrating as a salesperson, but it's also puzzling for customers to do that. They go through the entire process to evaluate a solution, and many of those customers say, \"Yeah, I want to buy,\" and then they ghost to the salesperson and it's so puzzling. \n\n(10:02):\nWhy would they waste their own time evaluating a solution than doing nothing? Then, the more important question is probably what are the very best salespeople do differently? What have they figured out to avoid that outcome? \n\nLenny Rachitsky (10:13):\nCool, and we're going to talk about that latter part to help people understand why, because it sounds like, okay, I guess this happens, but help people understand why this happens. Why are people nervous to make a mistake and not make a decision at all?\n\nMatt Dixon (10:24):\nLet me maybe take us a step back, Lenny. There was a reason we actually even asked that question that you just asked, and the reason was this, when we looked at sales calls, if you think of the typical sales process or buying journey, it kind of moves through three phases. Phase number one, is the customer in their status quo. It's what they do today. They use your competitor's product. Maybe they do use a homegrown solution, maybe they never saw a need for a solution like yours, but that's their current state. \n\n(10:51):\nStep two is we've got to get them to agree that the current state is no longer acceptable and they've got to move forward in a new and different way. We call that agreement on a vision. We've got to get their intent to move forward and to change, and that step number three is you got to get them to buy something. That's the action step where they execute the docuSign, they sign on the line that is dotted and they send the contract back. \n\n(11:11):\nIt's a simple three step process, and what we found in our analysis is one of the big places where a lot of deals fall out of that process is between intent and action. It's after the point where the customer says, \"Yeah, Lenny, this sounds great. I'm sold. Let's talk.\" But before the point where that actually deal gets sold, a lot of deals kind of go sideways in that moment and the way this comes across in sales calls is that customers start, if you will, relitigating concerns that they had asked and you thought you'd address much earlier, like what might go wrong and is this really the right answer for us? \n\n(11:45):\nThese are things that are puzzling to salespeople because it feels like this thing is slipping through my fingers right before my eyes. I thought we had this closed. I thought you said you want to move forward and now you're asking questions that we addressed three months ago, what's going on? \n\n(11:58):\nWhat salespeople tend to do, because they've grown up in a world where they've been told, the only reason the customer hesitates is because you haven't put to bed their status quo bias. We all know, we're all human beings, not just customers, but perhaps especially customers, are guilty of status quo bias, meaning we are prone to laziness and doing nothing because it's easier, it's inertia. It's easier to just keep doing more of the same than to change behavior. \n\n(12:23):\nChange is really hard and salespeople have been taught that the status quo is their biggest competitor, and if the customer is starting to get cold feet, it's because they still think either what they're doing today is good enough, what you are proposing is not a compelling enough reason to change, or maybe it's just not a top priority for them or their organization. It's got to be one of those reasons. \n\n(12:43):\nWhat salespeople have been armed to do is go out and dial up the FOMO and make the customer sweat a little bit. The first thing they do is they say, \"Lenny, remember the demos and the proof of concept trial, how excited you were and those benefits, you got to pay for it. You're not going to get all those great benefits for your organization unless you sign the agreement.\" \n\n(13:03):\nIf that doesn't work, I'll try to kind of scare you into action by dialing up the fear, uncertainty and doubt and saying, \"Lenny, you told me about these problems in your business. You guys are really struggling right now. By the way, did I mentioned, we're working with all of your competitors and they're seeing tremendous benefits from our product and you're going to be left in the dust and those problems you brought up with me, they're not going to solve themselves.\" \n\n(13:22):\nI'm trying to create that burning platform a little bit for the customer and get them to realize the cost of their inaction. There is a cost of doing nothing, and if those two things don't work, what most salespeople go to is the 10% discount that's only good this quarter. It's like the price driven urgency. Maybe this will be the thing you need to just get you over the finish line. \n\n(13:43):\nWhat we were so surprised by which led us to the question you asked, Lenny, was that 87% of the time when salespeople do that dial up the FOMO in those moments, especially with a customer who says that they're ready to move forward, but they start to backpedal and waffle and waiver and become hesitant dialing up the FOMO backfires 87% of the time. In other words, it increases the odds, the deal will be lost to no decision.\n\n(14:06):\nIf it weren't for that finding, we never would've even bothered asking the question about why do people end up, why do we lose deals to no decision, why do customers make no decision, but this was really puzzling because it flew in the face of everything we talked about, including in Challenger, to be totally candid. We talked about how challengers are exceptional at breaking the customer's status quo bias by showing them the pain of same is worse than the pain of change. \n\n(14:29):\nAgain, overcoming that inertia, that not just individuals but organizations suffer from. Challengers are really good at that. Here, we see that the tactics that you might associate with challenging actually kind of backfire, which was, as the author of The Challenger, still a little bit troubling to me, but we'll come back to that, but I think what we realized was we got it right, but we got it kind of half right.\n\n(14:50):\nWe went into the data and we asked a slightly different question, which is why are deals lost in no decision? What drives that? We found that actually, there are a lot of deals that are lost because the customer does actually prefer their status quo. That is status quo bias. They believe what they're going to say is good enough, what you're talking about, it's not a compelling enough reason to change or this is not a top priority. \n\n(15:11):\nThose are all status quo preference reasons, but it turns out those are only 44% of the no decision losses, 56% of no decision losses are customers who want to buy but can't buy because they're stuck in this no man's land of indecision, and that indecision itself stems from their fear of failure, which you put your finger on earlier, and this is the part I found so fascinating, so we dug into the psych research. We read probably 30 years of cognitive psychology journal articles, many of them from Dutch universities, which I find very interesting, but a fairly very big into this stuff. \n\n(15:49):\nA lot of the Kahneman and Tversky work around loss aversion and prospect theory, et cetera, and one of the big findings we came across is that there's actually a more powerful human bias, even more powerful than status quo bias that rears its ugly head and causes indecision, and that is called the omission bias. \n\n(16:06):\nThe omission bias is, if you get down to it, is the fact that people don't want to be blamed for making decisions that lead to a loss. In the human mind, there are two types of loss that we think about. We all like to avoid loss, but not all loss is created equal. There are losses that happen when we do nothing, and then there are losses that happened because we did something. \n\n(16:25):\nWe made a decision, we picked a vendor, we executed a contract, and then something bad happened. It turns out that in the human mind, people are okay with missing out. They are not okay with messing up and being blamed, and this is really powerful. It's even more powerful than status quo bias, as I said. \n\n(16:44):\nThe shorthand for salespeople is this, dialing up the FOMO can be very effective to overcome status quo bias, but knowing that every human being, including all of your customers, who I include in that definition of human beings are definitely afraid of being personally blamed if things go wrong. The FOMU actually matters more than the FOMO. The FOMU is the fear of messing up or in the not safe for work version of your podcast, I'd say FOFU, but your listeners can figure out what that stands for on their own, but this is really powerful for salespeople, right to understand. \n\n(17:16):\nLook, if you are trying to scare your customer into action, you're going to miss out on these benefits. You're going to miss out on solving these problems. You're just going to pay more later if you don't say yes now. What you're really doing is using scare tactics, but you're trying to scare somebody who's already afraid. The problem is they're not afraid of the thing you think they're afraid of. They're not afraid of missing out, they're afraid of messing up. \n\n(17:36):\nWe've got to address that as salespeople. We've got to help instill the confidence in the customer that you're making a great decision. I've got your back. You're going to look like a hero, not like a fool and that's really what The JOLT Effect is about. It's about how the very best salespeople execute that. It wasn't that we're wrong with Challenger, it's just the story was kind of incomplete. \n\n(17:55):\nYou got to break status quo bias. If you don't do that, you're never going to have an indecision problem, but even once you overcome the customer's indifference and their status quo bias, you got to second battle you've got to fight, which is you've got to instill the confidence and make them feel good about this. Frankly, leap of faith they're about to take and their fear, you got to deal with the fear that if something goes wrong, they're worried that they're going to be blamed for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:16):\nWe're going to talk about this method you developed for how to actually do all the things you're talking about, but first, to make this even more real, what I'm thinking about is an example. Is a good example, maybe a CRM, like a better CRM product, say someone has Salesforce installed and now they're like, maybe there's probably something better out there we should probably evaluate. \n\n(18:34):\nThen, I'm thinking from the perspective of a startup trying to build a better CRM. There's always this advice, you have to be 10 times better for anyone to pay any attention. I think that feeds into exactly what you're showing is it needs to be so much better that this fear is reduced. Can you just talk about maybe an example, whether it's that one or a different one to make this more concrete?\n\nMatt Dixon (18:52):\nWe encountered a ton of examples. It's so interesting you mentioned startups and I think sometimes, I was actually with a big enterprise software company and I think when, and I presented this research to some of their sales leaders and one of the folks in the room said, \"I'm really glad we are who we are, that we are the 800-pound gorilla, especially in a market like we're in right now,\" because as the old adage goes, it wasn't IBM, but the old adage is that nobody ever got fired for buying from IBM, right? \n\n(19:21):\nThis company is like the IBM of their space. They're the 800-pound gorilla. They've got the brand strength, the reputation, they're the safe choice. This team felt kind of comfortable or comforted, I should say by that fact, especially in a tight environment where it's a battle for deals and for mindshare and for wins out there in the market right now, especially in tech.\n\n(19:42):\nWhat I said is you've got to remember though, that may be true, and I would argue, and I think you're right, that for a startup, yeah, you've got to be 10 times better to get that mind share. It may be even better than that to get somebody to take a leap of faith with you. There is inherent risk in going with the unproven player, but I cautioned these folks and I said, \"Now, remember, what are the things that drive fear of failure and indecision?\" \n\n(20:08):\nIt turns out there are three big ones. The first one is have I made the right choice? I know I want to work with this vendor, but did I configure the solution of the proposal the right way, the right contract length, the right implementation, the right used cases, the right integrations, all that professional services or DIY, all those big questions.\n\n(20:26):\nThe second thing that customers worry about in their second fear of failure is that they're going to learn something after the contract is signed that's going to make the decision look like not such a great decision. I'll give you a really specific example about this. I spoke to a tech company not too long ago, maybe a month ago, and they landed their biggest deal of their existence. It was an early stage company, seven-figure deal, game changer for this organization. Then, they beat out some big established competitors. This is a huge win. \n\n(20:54):\nThey went out. They celebrated. It was just totally amazing, their first big enterprise win and their first seven-figure deal and their first victory against some of these incumbents. Unfortunately, about two weeks after they won this deal, the new Gartner Magic Quadrant on their space came out and they were shown to be kind of, eh, right? They weren't the leader, but they were sort of middle of the pack.\n\n(21:16):\nAll of a sudden, the client who signed the agreement, the CTO just got crap rained from everybody saying, \"Did you see the Gartner Magic Quadrant? It looks like the company we just plunked down seven figures with was kind of seen as so-so by the Gartner analyst? Have we talked to these guys and those guys and why aren't we going with the leaders,\" and blah, blah, blah? \n\n(21:36):\nThey ended up backing out of the contract because the CTO said, \"I'm spending every day talking to all the other key stakeholders trying to convince them that yes, we did all of our due diligence, but life is too short and we're probably going to end up going with one of the big players. We're sorry. I mean, that's such a painful story, but that's the customer is like they're going to keep doing research because they don't want to be surprised when some new piece of information comes to light. It's the second big fear of failure driver or failure driver. \n\n(22:03):\nThe third one is that the customers are worried they're just not going to see the ROI. They're not going to get the full benefits. You might project for them a 5X improvement in sales productivity. What if it comes in at two or three X and my name's on the agreement and the CFO comes asking why we didn't get the benefits we thought? In today's environment, that's not just egg on your face, you could get fired for that stuff. \n\n(22:26):\nThis is the client who's really looking for that vendor to have their back and to assure them that they're going to see the benefits that are being projected and promised through the sale. What I said to this big enterprise tech company was, \"Look, you guys, yes, it's tough to be a startup right now, early stage company, there's a lot of risks there, but who's offering more choices, them or you guys? You guys have a partner ecosystem. You have 20 different cloud products. You bought seven companies in the past three years. You have a cornucopia of options, which adds to the buyer's anxiety that they haven't chosen the right thing. \n\n(22:59):\nSecond, do you think there's more written about you guys or about them? You could fill a football stadium with all the coverage on you guys. I mean, everybody's got an opinion about you because you are the 800-pound gorilla and everybody's worked with you before and they have opinions, good and bad, and people want to leave no stone unturned. \n\n(23:17):\nThen, lastly, it turns out you guys are a lot more expensive because you're trying to move from selling simple products like these ankle biters out there, these startups into selling big enterprise solutions. You guys are selling not seven-figure deals, eight-figure deals, nine-figure deals to your customers. That increases the customer's anxiety that I really have to see return on this. \n\n(23:36):\nYou, in many respects, are getting whipsawed by these factors in a way that the startups are not because they don't have as many choices. There's not as much coverage about that. The investment is lower, and so there's a little bit less risk for the customer. You guys aren't immune just because you're the big brand.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (23:53):\nYou're doing a great job making it clear why it's so nerve-racking to buying new software. There's just so many things that could hurt you as a person at a company. April Dunford, I think this is barred from your language that she talks about how it's actually more stressful these days to buy software than to sell software because of all these things you've talked about.\n\nMatt Dixon (24:13):\nYeah, I think she's on point on that one. I mean, your customers are, yeah, they're really, really afraid of this not panning out. It was so interesting, and salespeople can think of so many different occasions where the purchase buying your product, just made all the sense in the world for the customer, it would make things so much better. It would solve such big problems for them. \n\n(24:37):\nThey're so dissatisfied with their current approach. It's just a no-brainer, and the customer will look at that and they will agree with you and they still won't make a decision because of the what-ifs, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (24:47):\nYeah. This is got to be very frustrating for founders to listen to and be like, \"Come on, our product is so much better. What are you doing?\" But I think this explains a lot of the challenges they're probably having. \n\n(24:58):\nThis episode is brought to you by Heap, the product analytics solution that shows you everything users do on your digital product, website, mobile product or other digital surfaces.

You have something, I think you call it the JOLT method?\n\nMatt Dixon (26:10):\nYes. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:11):\nAwesome. Let's get into it.\n\nMatt Dixon (26:12):\nThe JOLT, it's an acronym. It just so happened it worked out that way, but I like it because it's memorable, but it also speaks to what's happening. Our customers' stuck in their indecisive state. They want to buy from us, but they just can't because worried about what might go wrong. You got to JOLT them forward. We got to JOLT them into action.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:12):\nBeautiful. \n\nMatt Dixon (26:30):\nHow do we do it? The first thing is we've got to judge their level of indecision, we've got to figure out what we're dealing with. The second thing is we've got to offer a recommendation. The third thing is we've got to get them to stop doing endless research and start trusting us and limiting, we call limit the exploration, and the T is we've got to the derisk the deal. We've got to take some risk off the table, and we establish that safety net for the customer so they feel like we've got their back. \n\n(26:49):\nMaybe we talk about each of those. I'll start with the J because it's first, but also I think the way, while it's kind of linear, I would encourage listeners don't think about this as a process where it's like I do step one, two, three, four, J-O-L-T. Think of it as it starts with the J, and the J tells you what the next step is. Is it the T? Is it the L? Is it the O? Is it the O, and then we got to deal with the T. Then, we got to go back to the O because it comes up again. \n\n(27:14):\nThink of it as sort of the dividing rod. How do we figure out what's got the customer nervous? This is a really, really, really tricky thing because, and I've likened indecision to the carbon monoxide poisoning of sales. It's everywhere, but it's odorless, it's tasteless, but you need a carbon monoxide detector, and that's what the J is. \n\n(27:37):\nHow do we get fear of failure on the table? The problem with this is that, and I think most of your listeners will be familiar with this, everybody, especially customers suffers and senior executives especially, especially, suffer from what's called the Dunning-Kruger effect, which is they think they're better at things than they really are and decisiveness is one of those things that buyers will think they will say they think they're decisive. \n\n(28:00):\nIn fact, if you surveyed your customers, not that they recommend this, and you add 100 of them, if they consider themselves to be decisive folks, like 99 out of 100 will say, \"Absolutely, yes, I make the tough calls. I manage from the gut. I live on the edge as an executive making those big calls,\" but the research tells a very different story. It turns out that 87% of buyers in our two and a half million sales calls we studied, either showed moderate or high levels of indecision. \n\n(28:25):\nThe folks who are not worried about fear or failure were 13%. Yeah, those people do exist. By the way, if you find one of those people, you should sell them everything as soon as possible because they're making the decision quite literally on the dollars and cents and the ROI and whether it makes sense for their business. It's a rational decision for them, but for the rest, they're dealing with a lot of emotion, and that emotion is all wrapped up with fear of failure. \n\n(28:48):\nWhat's so tough about this is that it's not just Dunning-Kruger like we think we're more decisive than we really are, even if your customer knows that they're indecisive or they're worried about failing or how their boss is going to perceive them, if this purchase doesn't pan out, they don't like talking about it because it's embarrassing. They don't want to talk about like, \"God, I got to tell you this better pay off because if it doesn't, I'm already on thin ice with my boss. She doesn't like me already. This is going to be the last straw.\" Nobody's going to say that stuff. \n\n(29:17):\nHow do we get on the table? One of the things we don't think works particularly well are classic open-ended questions like, \"Lenny, do you find when you go to the Cheesecake factory, do you leave satisfied or hungry because you can't decide what to order?\" I guess, it's not great approaches with customers, you'll end the sale pretty quickly because again, your customers find that kind of offensive. They'd like to think of themselves as decisive people. \n\n(29:39):\nWe found a technique, this is actually not in the book, we found it after we wrote the book, called pings and echoes that high performers use. Think of the way a surface ship might detect a submarine in the water using sonar. They send a ping out into the water and they're listening, if you will, using sonar for the reflection back and the reflection tells them, is it a friendly submarine, an enemy submarine? Is it just a whale? Is it heading towards us? Away from us? At what speed are they about to torpedo us? All that good stuff. \n\n(30:08):\nWe want to do the same thing in sales. The way this works is that a salesperson will try to articulate but in a non, not to out the customer, but to get confirmation or refutation, if you will, that what they've articulated is actually a concern for their buyer. \n\n(30:25):\nHypothetically, let's imagine we're talking about a purchase and we've had a lot of great conversations. I've shown you a lot of demos. You guys have liked everything we've shown. We showed you partner options. We showed you different configurations. We did POC over here. We did a pilot over there. You guys are just eating it all up, but I'm kind of getting the sneaking feeling that you guys actually don't know what you want and we've shown you a lot and we've probably made that problem worse. \n\n(30:49):\nWhat I might say to you is, \"Lenny, I'm just curious if we could calibrate here for just a moment, and there's a reason I'm asking this, which is a lot of the customers at this point in our process of working together, they get almost overwhelmed with all the options, and look, I probably made this worse. We're very proud of what we do. I want to show you, paint the art of the possible, but I also know if we're going to do business together, you told me right away budgets are limited and you can't have it all. You've got to decide what's nice to happen and what's need to happen. I'm just curious, are you and your team clear on what would be in and out of the proposal?\" \n\n(31:25):\nWhat's going to happen is one of two things, one you might say, or a few things, you might say, \"You know what? No, we don't know and we have liked everything you've shown us, but as you said, we can't have it all. So, we'd be really curious to know what do other companies like us start with? How do we get going? What are the things we can do without and we can maybe add later on down the road,\" or you might get the customer says, \"No, no, no, we were just being polite. There's a lot of stuff you showed us that we're not actually that interested in. It's cool, but it's just not for us. We are very clear on what we want. \n\n(31:55):\nSo, let me share that with you now. However, what I'm really concerned about is once we get this kind of specked out and configured and priced, I'm going to take it to the CFO because I've got to get her approval on this and I can't build our business case on the claim you guys make about improving sales productivity by 10% because she'll laugh me out of her office. Help me get grounded in what's a believable outcome for us so that I can sell it and I can be confident we're going to actually hit it.\" \n\n(32:25):\nAgain, it's not designed to embarrass the customer, it's designed to get this on the table so it can be recognized and dealt with and contextualized. You're totally normal. Everybody struggles with this. There's a lot of stuff we throw in front of people and it ends up doing some harm. They don't know what to pick. Let me be of service and value to you. \n\n(32:42):\nThat's the first thing that we point to and that's going to tell us, okay, is it a choice problem? They're overwhelmed. They don't know what to choose, like that example we just used. Is it that they're just doing endless research and they feel like they haven't really come down the learning curve yet around this purchase or is it, no, I don't actually know that we're going to get what we're paying for here and we screw this stuff up every day of the week at twice a Sunday and I don't think it's going to be any different and then I'm going to get blamed, so help me manage the downside risk, but it tells us kind of where to go next on that journey, if that makes sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (33:12):\nYeah. Awesome. The advice there is basically get a sense of how clear they are internally on knowing exactly what they want that'll help them make a decision. There's kind of this moment of, okay, let's just help me understand the question, the way you phrased it, are you and your team clear on what would be in or out of this proposal?\n\nMatt Dixon (33:31):\nYeah. That's just a one example. That's if I hypothesize that you're really struggling with what to choose. Now, my hypothesis might be, you know what you want. You've done plenty of research, but you're really worried about the ROI and you're just worried you just aren't going to be able to accomplish that. \n\n(33:47):\nThat ping might sound very different. It might be we've been having a discussion about, you've been asking for multiple terms of the ROI calculation and changing parameters and really trying to make it bulletproof, but a lot of customers struggle with that a little bit because that's a big thing. You're putting your name against that. Maybe we should have a conversation about whether that's a concern for you. Is there a believability gap? Is there an execution gap you're worried about on your side or on our side? \n\n(34:15):\nLet's have a conversation about that so I can set the proper expectations so you feel really confident going to the CFO and lobbying for investment here. That ping could go in, but it's based on what I think is holding you up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (34:28):\nGot it. It's just like at this point, many customers have this question... \n\nMatt Dixon (34:32):\nYes. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (34:33):\n... and that maybe comes from the thing that you think is probably blocking them. \n\nMatt Dixon (34:36):\nYeah, I think that's perfect language. At this point, most customers like you, are thinking about this or they're worried about that, or they're getting a little anxious about this. Let's have a conversation about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (34:46):\nAwesome. Okay, cool. Let's go to step two, offering your recommendation.\n\nMatt Dixon (34:50):\nSure. Oh yeah. This was right with that example we talked about before. Options are really a double-edged sword. What we know from the research is that options are great early on. If you're meeting at the trade show and the customer's swinging by your booth or you're doing a first demo or first, let a thousand flowers bloom, but if you want the customer to actually make a decision, you've got to get the weed whacker out and call it down to a manageable set of choices. \n\n(35:17):\nThe science is very clear on this, that too many choices at some point will overwhelm the customer and it leads to a lot of bad outcomes. It leads to the customer not making a decision at all because they don't want to make the wrong decision. I don't want to work with you, but you put so many options in front of us. I don't want to be blamed if I choose the wrong one and it leads to things like post-decision dysfunction, which is, I thought I made the right decisions, but now I'm learning more and people are asking hard questions and maybe I need to go revisit this. Hey, Lenny, we're going to have to scrap that agreement and start over because I don't think we can figure this right way. \n\n(35:49):\nWe have to, there's a time and place to offer options, and there's a time and place to narrow choices up. The simple guidance here for salespeople is that you've got to shift your posture from asking the customer what they want and just diagnosing their needs, to actually recommending to them what they should do. Salespeople get a little bit anxious about this, I find, because they don't want to be seen as like, I told you to do A, but you're like, I don't want to do that. I want to do B and now I feel like we're at odds. \n\n(36:16):\nThey worry about that. Salespeople have grown up in this world that it's the customer's choice. The customers always right, let me just guide them, but they're the ones should make this decision, but sometimes the customer can't and they don't know enough about these decisions. We know the stuff because we eat, sleep, and breathe it every day as salespeople. We work in this industry, they don't. \n\n(36:35):\nWe are in a much better position to be able to guide them toward, you know what? You don't really need X, Y, and Z. You can leave that out of the proposal. Companies like you, they get started in this way. Let me put three options in front of you. I would go with the middle one because I really think that's going to be the best for you in the first year, and then we can expand from there.\n\n(36:54):\nHere's an analogy, I'll often tell people to think about the last time they went to a fancy restaurant and they looked at a menu with some expensive entrees and everything looked delicious, but they didn't know what to order, so you asked the wait person what they recommend. How helpful is it if that wait person says to you, \"Well, what are you in the mood to eat tonight?\" It's no help at all, right? You're no closer to a decision. They basically just dump the problem back on your lap.\n\n(37:17):\nBut what a great way people do is they say, \"If you want my opinion, I love this dish and I'd probably say it's our most popular. We sell out of it every night. We've still got it. So you're in luck. It's a lot of food though, it's a big portion. If you're in the mood for something lighter, there's a vegetarian option. It doesn't get as much play on Yelp, but I love this one. It's absolutely delicious. It's one of our kind of dark horse favorites, if you will, but remember, everything we make here is delicious. If you don't like those choices, you're not going to go wrong with any of them, but those are just my favorites.\" \n\n(37:46):\nNow, what happens in that moment is what psychologists call the delegation effect, which is rather than the burden of a bad decision being solely on the shoulders of the decider, that burden is now shared. Now, think about it, if you order the dish the wait person recommended and you don't like it, whose fault is it? Well, technically it's your fault because you ordered it, but it's also kind of their fault because they recommended it. \n\n(38:07):\nYou feel like there's some safety in getting that recommendation, that endorsement. It's a really simple example, but it works in complex sales as well. Customers are looking for somebody to share in the risk and the burden of making a bad decision and having that partner who's guiding them toward what they should care about and what they shouldn't care about, what they should consider and what they should take out of the proposal, is actually very reassuring and comforting them and it increases the odds of getting some kind of decision from them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:35):\nAmazing. This is a great segue to The Challenger Sale, which we're going to talk about, but let's get through the last two steps and then we'll talk about The Challenger Sale, which is basically this on steroids, this idea on steroids.\n\nMatt Dixon (38:45):\nThe last two, so L is about this customer who's doing endless amounts of research. Every salesperson has seen this customer, they're never happy with the number of reference calls or the amount of research they've done. They want to talk to more and more people. They're just in information overload mode and/or what we might call analysis paralysis mode because at some point, they're never satisfied with, they always feel like all the answers will be in the next white paper they read or the next reference call they do, or the next person on LinkedIn they talk to. \n\n(39:15):\nWhat salespeople need to do to stop that, you got to understand I think why customers do that. They don't want to be surprised. That is the main reason, but they also don't trust the salesperson to be forthcoming. They believe the salesperson is paid to sell them more than they need, to put one over on them, hide the dirty laundry, only talk about the things that work in the platform, not the things that don't work. \n\n(39:37):\nYou're not going to get introduce any of the customers who hate you. You're only going to introduce the customers who love you, and we know we're going to say great things about us. That's what the customer thinks. That is what is in the customer's mind. You've got to actually shift, get the customer to stop trying to be an expert and start trusting you as an expert. There are two keys to that. \n\n(39:57):\nThe first one is you've got to establish some trust. I know that sounds like a platitude, but we found in the analysis, there are specific things that great salespeople do very early on. They are brutally transparent with customers about like, \"Hey, I know you were interested in this capability. I got to be honest, we get mixed reviews on that. It's kind of an early capability for us. We're still trying to iron out the kinks,\" or \"I know you are interested in this used case, but I have to be honest, we're actually not the best in the market at that. Our competitors much better at that than we are.\" \n\n(40:26):\nThese kinds of moments show the customer that you're not here to put one over on them. You're here to get them to a great decision. It kind of makes no difference to the salesperson, whether the customer buys from them, doesn't buy from them, it buys from a competitor. You just want to help them get to a great decision. That's step number one is building that trust. \n\n(40:42):\nStep number two is you got to demonstrate some expertise. What we see in so many sales interactions, especially in tech, is that salespeople will show up with the clown car of experts, the subject matter experts, the solutions engineers, the product people, the executive sponsors, and then they will just punt to these people. \n\n(41:00):\nWhat happens in that moment is dangerous for the salesperson. The customer, it sounds like they're loving it, right? They're loving that. I'm talking to the people who really know their stuff, but what's also happening in that moment is the salesperson is actively getting delegated down to the person they sound like. If they don't sound like any more than a glorified emcee or a coordinator, then that's kind of all the customer will perceive them as. \n\n(41:21):\nWhat right or ability would you have to guide the customer on what to choose if you've offered no value or expertise? You don't have to be as deep as the product people. You're not going to be, you're a salesperson, you're not a product person, but you do have to be deeper on than the customer, and you do have to demonstrate that expertise. Those are the keys, again, the customer to stop trying to be an expert and start trusting you as their expert.\n\n(41:43):\nThen, the T is taking risk off the table. Two keys to doing that, I think the first one happens really early actually, and that is resetting the customer's expectations. Average salespeople love when they get an inbound lead from a customer who says, \"Hey, I saw that case study on your website of the customer who got the 10X improvement in sales productivity, and we want that. That sounds great.\" That company's in our industry, amazing. That's a slam dunk business case for us. \n\n(42:09):\nThe average salesperson's thinking like, \"If you're excited about that, I'm not going to talk you out of it because that means you're going to be excited to take in the CFO and excited to sign the agreement and get going.\" \n\n(42:16):\nWhat great salespeople do though is they know that while they'll stand by those claims, those case studies, those proof points, they try to kind of under-promise and over-deliver and they might say something along the lines of, \"You know Lenny, absolutely, that is a great case. I was involved in that sale, but what we also need to understand is everything went perfectly. They resourced it to the hilt. They had no integration issues, no hiccups. It was beautiful and seamless. I don't think you and I can think of many technology implementations that happened that way. \n\n(42:45):\nWhat I'd rather we do is build your business case around a 5X improvement in sales productivity because we see that at least that, in 100% of our implementations. Then, let's set up to over-deliver against that because I think we're going to do better than that based on what I know about your organization, easily 6, 7, 8, 9%, maybe even 10, but we don't want you to just walking in and promising 10X improvement sales productivity. If we finish the year and we're at 7X, if the CFO is now asking her questions when in absolute terms, she should be thrilled with 7X, right? Let's make sure we set ourselves up for success.\" \n\n(43:18):\nThe other thing you've got to do though is establish some safety net options. There are lots of different shapes and forms. These can take everything from before the deal is closed, pulling the implementation team onto the call, or the customer success team or the account management team so we can start roadmapping, \"Hey, as soon as we get signature, here's how we're going to spend our next six months together to make sure you guys are getting all the value you expect, if not more. Here's what we got to do. Here are the stage gates, here are the owners, here are the metrics we're going to monitor. Here's how often we're going to connect with each other.\" \n\n(43:48):\nInstills a lot of confidence with the customer because it feels like, \"Oh, you guys have done this before, right? You've been there, you've done that. You've helped other customers like me get value.\" Everything from that kind of stuff to adding in professional services support, especially like you think about a tech purchase. I'm not saying give it away for free, but you will find that high-performing salespeople will also add on professional services, but it is not just because selling more, which they are because they're high-performing salespeople. It's the way they position that.\n\n(44:13):\nThey usually position it as an insurance policy. \"Hey, I know you guys want to DIY this. This is one of the great things about our solution. You totally can. You got all the training support, all the videos, you got all the enablement content you need, but I know this is a big priority for you, and I think it would be really smart to carve out a slug of professional services hours that way our A team is lined up in case anything slips and if it does, we get you back up on track because the last thing we want is for you guys to be upset that you're losing ground and you're not going to deliver on the outcomes that you promised to your boss. So, let's set that up.\" \n\n(44:44):\nThere's lots of different ways we can create those opt out clauses in some industries are an option. Not very common in B2B, but in some cases, you can offer those or specialized contract carve outs for instance. There's lots of different things we can do to create that safety net where the customer doesn't feel like they're jumping out of an airplane by themselves, but you are the tandem skydiving instructor that's going to guide them safely to the ground.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:05):\nAmazing. All of this, especially this last step, is coming from, they're probably not going to decide on anything that that's what you're fighting is help them...\n\nMatt Dixon (45:13):\nThat's right. That's right. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:13):\n... be less worried about messing up.\n\nMatt Dixon (45:15):\nYeah, that's right. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:16):\nI especially love this point about under promising and over delivering because so much of, and most of this is B2B SaaS software that you're working with, right? Like B2B SaaS companies?\n\nMatt Dixon (45:26):\nOur dataset cut across, I think that it might just be that SaaS is the place where we're seeing the most indecision these days, but it's not suggest it's kind of an easy target, but it is rife within indecision these days, and unfortunately I think it's also rife with a lot of these missteps that salespeople make that actually make things worse, but we had data from manufacturing firms, services businesses that cut across. This was prevalent and consistent across industries.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:57):\nWith the under promising and over delivering, I think that's especially powerful for where most companies want to get to is net revenue retention being higher than 100% where you can expand larger within the org and it makes sense to help them set up base, feel like, wow, this is so much better than we even thought it was going to be, versus...\n\nMatt Dixon (45:57):\nAbsolutely. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (46:15):\n... it's not delivering what we thought. Amazing. Okay. Any last piece of wisdom to leave listeners with around The JOLT Effect before we move on to The Challenger Sale?\n\nMatt Dixon (46:25):\nThe only thing I would suggest is that for anybody, I mean, I think just do it is this, is that you should hit the pause button when the customer, because the customers, we all know, are going to get cold feet, often late stage, and it can be very frustrating. The knee jerk reaction for almost every salesperson out there, this happened in our analysis, 75% of salespeople we studied, would immediately go out to dialing up the FOMO. \n\n(46:47):\nGo back to doing that. You're not going to get these benefits. You're going to be stuck in this terrible state of affairs you're in right now. Dial up the cost of inaction, or let's try to use some price base or other delivery window-based urgency driver to get the customer to move forward. But just remember that if the customer's already convinced that the status quo is suboptimal, and you've already got the intent that basically again, you're using fear on top of a customer, selling into a customer who's already afraid and you're actually making it worse. \n\n(47:17):\nHitting the pause button and just reflecting a little bit on what's really going on here. Is it that they're indifferent or is it that they're indecisive? Those are actually two very different things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (47:26):\nAmazing. I know you have a meeting in 10 minutes, so this is going to be the most action-packed, high-density podcast episode we've done. We've got 10 minutes talk about Challenger Sale. \n\nMatt Dixon (47:33):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (47:33):\nFirst of all, how many copies of this book have you sold at this point?\n\nMatt Dixon (47:37):\nI think it's about a million. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (47:39):\nHoly moly. \n\nMatt Dixon (47:39):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (47:39):\nThat's insane.\n\nMatt Dixon (47:39):\nThat's a lot, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (47:42):\nOkay, so it's a legendary book in the world of sales. I imagine many people have heard of it, at least some people know the teachings. Let's spend a little time there. If I were to summarize the big insight of the book, basically it's the best salespeople challenge their prospects thinking and teach them about the market and what they should be doing versus just helping them get what they want.\n\nMatt Dixon (47:59):\nYeah, very well said. I think one of, just like the FOMO, FOMU kind of shorthand, here's a shorthand I'd give to salespeople is most salespeople are trying to figure out what's keeping the customer up at night, right? It's classic solution selling needs, diagnosis, et cetera. \n\n(48:15):\nThe Challenger approach is about showing the customer what should be keeping them up at night. What is the thing you know that they need to know? What is the way that other customers are using your solution to generate returns and benefit for their organization? What's the risk that they don't know about but you do because by the way, you're going to talk to 10 times more customers, or I say you're going to talk to 10 of that customer in a week or 10 times more than a week than they will all year. \n\n(48:42):\nYou are a window into the outside world for them, and that's what challengers really understand. It's not free consulting though, because if you remember from the Challenger Sale, it's not just about bringing these provocative ideas that reframe the customer's understanding of the world. It's about leading to your unique benefits. What you're really trying to do is create a fire and then be the only person in town who sells the fire extinguisher that'll put it out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (49:05):\nIs there an example you could share of a Challenger sale type of sale?\n\nMatt Dixon (49:08):\nYeah, we wrote a sequel to The Challenger Sale called The Challenger Customer. In that book, we talk about a case from a company called Dentsply. Dentsply, as the name would suggest, manufactures or produces dental supplies, right? They sell equipment and product into dental practices and dental offices. \n\n(49:27):\nYears ago, Dentsply had developed, we all know, I think your listeners can all relate to this, when you go to the dentist and the hygienist is polishing your teeth or they're using the water pick, or unfortunately, maybe the dentist is using the drill. That wand has a very heavy power cord that's attached to it and it's attached to this power base and that it feeds water through there and electrical current and all those things. \n\n(49:51):\nDentsply had developed the world's first lightweight, ergonomic, cordless wand that drill bits could be attached to cleaning, implements, et cetera and it was a total breakthrough. Actually, when they unveiled it was pretty interesting, they gave, you remember the scene in Pulp Fiction where they opened the briefcase and then it emanates like a light emits from it. They gave all their salespeople like this little aluminum briefcase thing with this eggshell foam and a wand in there. \n\n(50:19):\nI can't remember what it's called. Let's call it the XP-9000 Wand, but it had one demo wand in there and they would go around to dental offices and be like, \"Ah.\" It was lit, literally, it had blue lighting inside... \n\nLenny Rachitsky (50:30):\nWow.\n\nMatt Dixon (50:30):\n... and it was really cool, the reveal and they'd take it out and they give it to the dentist or the head of the dental office and they would hold it and be like, \"What? It's so much lighter and it's ergonomic and this thing is cordless? It's amazing. It's a revolution.\" Then, the first thing they would ask is, \"How much is it?\"\n\n(50:47):\nWhen they told them it costs like three times more than the current old-fashioned wands they're using with the heavy cord, they would gently put it back in the briefcase, close the briefcase, say, \"Can you give me a price on new drill bits or new like polishing attachments?\" They couldn't get anybody to want to pay for this thing that was much more expensive than the old one. \n\n(51:06):\nThey did a lot of work and they figured out, they knew that this was unique. They knew this was a unique product. Nobody else in the market made this. They're the only supplier who had figured this out, total innovation, but they hadn't given the customer reason to want to pay a premium for that innovation until they figured out the connection between the equipment that hygienists use and absenteeism and workers' comp. \n\n(51:32):\nIt turns out that one of the biggest professions that where you get carpal tunnel syndrome, shoulder and neck and lower back injuries is being a dental hygienist. The reason is that they're standing, holding that heavy wand being dragged down by that heavy cord at an awkward angle all day long. That's why dental offices really struggle to keep hygienists showing up, not calling in sick, not out for months at a time for reconstructive shoulder surgery, not with exorbitant health benefits claims and workers' comp claims. \n\n(52:08):\nThey came in and they revised their sales pitch. Now, when they come into the dental office, they sit down, they say, \"I'd like to talk to you about your hygienist workforce. Are you guys seeing higher turnover? Have you seen any absenteeism due to carpal or lower back or neck or shoulder injuries? What are you guys doing about that? What's the cost to your business?\" \n\n(52:26):\nThey get the dentist talking and the way they start talking about, \"It is not just the insurance and workers' comp costs, it's stuff like when my hygienists get injured, and it's a repetitive motion business and job, when they get injured and they call in sick, I've got to reschedule all these cleanings and all these appointments, and that's a bunch of upset customers who end up then going to the practice down the street or saying bad things about me on Google reviews or what have you.\" \n\n(52:52):\nThere's all kinds of ripple effects for the dentist. The cost of losing a hygienist is massive and the market for hiring them is very, very tight. What Dentsply does is start the conversation there, and then they say, \"One of the things that we figured out is that, based on our own independent research, one of the primary drivers of all these bad outcomes, absenteeism, repetitive motion injuries, is related to the equipment that hygienists use. It's because they're holding that old fashioned heavy wand, attached to that big heavy power cable at an awkward angle doing repetitive motion all day, but what if you could solve for that? What if that was no longer a problem?\" \n\n(53:33):\nThe dentist says, \"Well, how would you solve for that? There's no other technology.\" \"That's what we got. We've had the same equipment for 30 years. Let me show you the new XP-9000. We're world's first cordless, lightweight, ergonomic drill. We can show you that it is far preferred by hygienists because they don't get injured as often because it's much easier to hold and it doesn't put stress on the joints and pinch points, if you will, where hygienists tend to experience these injuries.\" \n\n(53:58):\nIt's just a simple example, but you see, again, they're still selling a fancy wand, but before, they were leading with it. Let me show you this and talk about the features, benefits, and that led to how much does it cost. Now, they're leading to it. They're starting with an insight and giving the customer a reason to care about solving this business problem, and it turns out the only way to solve it is buying this XP-9000 drill from Dentsply.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (54:22):\nThe key lesson from this book, and I know we don't have a ton of time to dig into it, is start with an insight they may not be aware of. Give them a sense of where the things are going. Help them learn something about the future and the problems that they need to know about that they may not be aware of, and then transition to here is how we can solve that for you.\n\nMatt Dixon (54:40):\nYeah, that's exactly right. Make sure those connections are really tight, right? Getting this right starts with answering the question, why should the customer buy from you instead of your competitor? It's not because you're more customer-centric or more innovative and possible to prove your competitors claim the same thing. It's not that you're the leading global solution provider of whatever you sell. \n\n(54:59):\nIt starts with the product or the way you deliver the product or something about your service delivery that only your company does you are only capable of. Nobody else can touch with the barge pole. Then, the second question is, what would have to be true for the customer to want to pay us for that, to pay a premium ideally? That's the core components, if you will, of a challenge or a conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (55:21):\nAmazing. Matt, I promised I let you out here in time.
