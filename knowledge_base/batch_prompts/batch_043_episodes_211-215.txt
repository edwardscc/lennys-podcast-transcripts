At the end of the day, real... I don't care if you're a marketer or a product person, engineer, ops person, people ops, real professional ship, and they ship at a pretty high frequency for whatever they're doing. In my opinion, your tempo framework is more important than your org design. And so if you've ever had a team that seems really, really smart, but they're always planning or they don't really ship a lot, or you've had trouble where everyone kind of gets it at the leadership level, but then the team below them and below them seems to be kind of going in a different direction, you probably don't have enough alignment and you don't have enough alignment on what good looks like in terms of tempo.\n\nAudio (00:00:45):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Patrick Campbell. Patrick is the founder and CEO of ProfitWell, which he bootstrapped and sold without any funding for over $200 million. I've been a big fan of ProfitWell and of Patrick for many years. He's one of the most insightful and smartest people that I know, constantly sharing wisdom on Twitter and in his newsletter, primarily on pricing and retention and team building and all of the elements of building a successful SaaS business.\n\n(00:01:19):\nI've been excited to get Patrick on the podcast since I launched it, and I think this may be the most action-packed signal-to-noise episode yet. We cover 10 topics in an hour, including hot takes on team building, bootstrapping, shipping, competitive analysis, user research, and of course, pricing and retention. Do not miss this episode, it is one of my new favorites. With that, I bring you Patrick Campbell, after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.\n\n(00:01:45):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or are you going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements.\n\n(00:02:09):\nAlso, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious and expensive.\n\n(00:02:31):\nEnter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast-growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Good to finally... we've been texting, chatting for years now and I just realized we've never had an actual conversation, so this is where the relationship and the friendship ends because we realize how awkward we are together, I guess.\n\nLenny (00:03:48):\nI highly doubt it. I hope that doesn't happen. I've wanted to get you on this podcast ever since I started this podcast. It's always been on my list. You're just generally one of the smartest humans and most amazing humans I know, and so thank you for joining me on this podcast.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:04:02):\nWe've got to introduce you to more people, but I appreciate that. I appreciate that.\n\nLenny (00:04:07):\nYou're a humble, humble man. So usually what I do with these podcasts is I have this one main topic that I focus on, but I feel like you're such a renaissance man of a brain that I thought would be more fun to go through 10 different topics and power through them and see your perspective. I feel like you have all these contrarian takes on things and these interesting insights. And so what I want to do is just go through 10 topics and just get a sense of what's a big mistake founders companies make in this area, what's maybe a big opportunity they miss, or just like what's a hot take on this topic. How's that sound?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:04:43):\nYeah, 100%. Let's do it. I'm going to change my Twitter bio to that, renaissance of a brain. That's [inaudible 00:04:50] for me. Yeah, I appreciate that.\n\nLenny (00:04:52):\nYeah, just renaissance [inaudible 00:04:55] that quote. That'd be hilarious. People will be like, \"What the hell's he...\" Anyway, let's just jump right in. First topic is building your team as a founder or just a leader of any kind. So here's the question, just what are the biggest mistakes people make building their team? What are the biggest opportunities people miss when they're building their team? Or just generally what's like your take on how to best approach building your team as a founder or just a leader of people?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:05:23):\nYou always have to start answers with cliches, and I think the biggest cliche with building a team is, team is everything, right? If you're listening, you've heard that, you've probably said that to somebody or gotten mentored on that. And I was told that in the early days of building, and I actually thought it was terrible advice. I thought it was going to be the product or marketing or something that was going to hold us back. But I think that although team is everything, and I truly believe that, if you look at most data or most behaviors that most companies make, this isn't actually how we think or what we do.\n\n(00:05:55):\nLet me give you two fundamental issues. I think the first one is we confuse team by being everything to all people to accommodating to every single person, and especially in tech the last couple of years, maybe that's going to change a little bit now, but it was always like, \"Oh, everyone needs to be happy.\" And I think that's a really, really big misconception because you're not there to make everyone happy. You're there for some sort of mission and some sort of goal and you want to set up the culture and the team in a way that gets to that particular goal.\n\n(00:06:24):\nAnd I think the little bit more actionable way to look at this is, I don't think we actually focus on our team. The average tenure of a manager in tech right now is about 15.7 months. I actually went and looked into this mainly because we got into hyperdrive about team a couple of years ago. The average time a report has the same manager in corporate tech is only about 10.8 months, so just under 11 months. And there's no way that team is everything, or at least we actually believe that when the purveyors of your team, your management only lasts that long, it's just impossible.\n\n(00:06:57):\nAnd I think for the most part, people ops is an afterthought. And even if you get into the history of HR, which we should not do because that's an entire podcast, it's all about reacting. It came out of the labor movement in the mid 1900s, and it was all about, \"Hey, how do we CYA?\" rather than, \"How do we push our team forward?\" And I think in tech we had the opportunity to do that, but we haven't really focused on our team as much. So I don't know if I answered your question, but that's the scope of that problem I think, is we don't actually focus on our team, we don't actually focus on our team in the context of the mission. We just hire people, hope they're really happy. And obviously I'm generalizing, but if you look at the stats and you look at what's happening, that's how it shakes out.\n\nLenny (00:07:38):\nIs there something you've done in building your company that has been counter to that, something you've learned about? Because I totally agree, people always talk about team, team, team and then that's often really sucky to work at a lot of companies and clearly they don't care that much about your experience.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:07:52):\nSo super actionable things that we've done. I think, one, it comes back to the baseline feedback or advice you've probably received, or if you're listening to this before, which is you can't be everything to all people, so who are you for? Who are you for and who are you not for? I think really defining that in your values, and values aren't values unless there's an actual trade-off. And so we had things like optimize for the long-term. There's a clear trade-off when we optimize for the long-term, you probably give up short-term revenue.\n\n(00:08:22):\nYou also have different types of people that do better at the particular company than not. One of the more controversial things we did is we talked a lot about behaviors and the one thing that we had is this concept known as the most charitable interpretation. It's not something we made up, but there's this idea that basically when there's conflict or when there's some sort of confrontation, the way that you handle that confrontation was really, really important to us. And the way that we wanted our teams or the people that we wanted to hire for basically would take the most charitable interpretation of that confrontation.\n\n(00:08:53):\nSo Lenny, if you were like, \"Hey, Patrick, I like your shirt,\" and I just didn't like when people commented on my shirt, instead of getting pissed off, going to HR, or getting mad at you, what we would do is we'd say, \"Hey, the right way at ProfitWell wall to handle that was be like, 'He didn't know, so I'm not going to bring it up,' or 'Hey, Lenny. You probably didn't know, but I don't really like when people comment on my shirt.'\"\n\n(00:09:14):\nIt seems super trivial, but when you have over 20 people, all of a sudden these things start to come up. And I think most of the time we infantilize our teams where we let them run to HR, we have different policies or all of these different things, when at the end of the day you're paying an exorbitant amount of money for very smart human beings to basically do stuff and you want them basically working together and not having to go in this runaround with policies and people to push things forward.\n\nLenny (00:09:41):\nI love that. It reminds me of something at Airbnb where our head of product was always encouraging us to assume good intent from the other person that just like, \"What is the good version of what they're trying to achieve? It's unlikely they're trying to cause harm.\"\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:09:54):\nBut the important part is, and this is where you really care about your team, is if you believe that, and it's okay to have a culture that doesn't believe that, it's not a culture for me, and that's okay, that's the entire point, but if you believe that, then people who have trouble assuming positive intent or who have trouble taking the most charitable interpretation, they can't be at your company, and they have to go and you have to find... And we would have people, and we didn't always defend this and when we started defending it, everything got better. But all of a sudden we would say, \"Hey, it seems like this is really tough. This is how we think about things. This is how we handle this type of behavior here. If that's hard for you, let's find you another job.\" And thankfully we're not digging ditches here, we're all working in tech. And so it's \"easy\", quote-unquote, enough to find another gig even in economies like now.\n\nLenny (00:10:41):\nThat reminds me of there's this guy Douglas Atkin, who I worked with for a while who helped us craft the core values at Airbnb, and he made this point that your values need to be clear, exactly like you said, who doesn't fit, who doesn't belong. Because if it's everybody, it's worthless. Integrity, trust, everyone wants that and it fits into that, but it's only valuable if it's clear who's not a fit, exactly how you're saying it.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:11:07):\nWell, we get this fear of that accommodation culture, again, where it starts even in the interview process, we're like, \"Oh my god, we need these hires, we need these salespeople, we need these engineers.\" So we don't end up being upfront with these values and these trade-offs in the interview process. And then all of a sudden you spend a lot of time and a lot of money hiring someone who just doesn't fit. And I think that's really, really bad for them, it's really bad for you. And so that was the other thing is we would pull all of this forward into the interview process and talk about it and basically say like, \"Hey, if this is not how you think, that's okay. We're not better than you, you're not better than us, it's just this is how we do things here.\"\n\n(00:11:42):\nAnd I think a lot of times we're scared to do that because we have that founder, that exact fear of, \"Hey, we have to get this thing done and the only way to do that is to do X, Y or Z Z when in reality that's actually going to make your deadline go out further than actually focusing on alignment as much as humanly possible.\n\nLenny (00:12:00):\nNext topic, bootstrapping. I feel like you're probably in the bootstrap hall of fame. You built a company-\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:12:06):\nHere we go. That's all I've ever wanted.\n\nLenny (00:12:09):\nI think you're in there. So you tell me if I'm missing anything, but basically you bootstrapped a company, sold it for 200 million. I don't know if I've heard of anything like that. So what's your hot take? What are mistakes people make around bootstrapping?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:12:22):\nThe basic idea is bootstrapping is for lifestyle businesses that want to cash flow. Funding is for companies trying to create a billion dollars in annual revenue. And that answer offends everybody. That answer offends the indie friends I have, they're going to be like, \"Oh, what about Basecamp [inaudible 00:12:43], ProfitWell?\" And I'll tell you, ProfitWell, this was a big mistake. Yes, it was a great exit, we sold for over $200 million, et cetera, but we probably, if we had taken money, we could have had a billion-dollar exit or we could have kept going.\n\n(00:12:56):\nAnd we should have taken money earlier in our life cycle. This was actually a big mistake because we got hooked on the efficiency and that was great, but we could have moved even quicker than we were. And hindsight is 20/20, and I'm obviously not crying over this, but it's one of those things that I think that you have to know who you are and you have to know what your goals are for a company. And our biggest thing was we wanted to build a big company and we were going after that, but we weren't doing the things in order to actually make that happen, which is i.e. getting funded. So yeah, that's my hot take and hopefully I offend everyone. But it's also just the end of the Twitter argument where it's like, \"Yeah, it depends,\" but that's the thing to think about.\n\nLenny (00:13:38):\nIt's interesting because usually you hear from the other end, someone that raised VC money is like, \"I shouldn't have raised money, I should have bootstrapped this thing longer.\" It's cool to hear from the other side someone that did that like, \"No, we maybe should have raised the VC money along the way.\"\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:13:50):\nWell, I think there's a lot of ideas that should not raise money. There's a lot of ideas that should just be great cash flowing and they can be large businesses. There's large businesses cash flowing tens of millions of dollars without funding. And I think it's just one of those things that you need your goals, your model, and ultimately your funding situation all to match. And I think a lot of folks, they go in the opposite direction where they're just like, \"Oh, everything on TechCrunch, everything on Twitter is like, \"Hey, I need to raise money, raise money, raise money.\" And they don't take a step back and go like, well that idea, it's just not a very good business to get money. And money is so plentiful even now still that it is, quote-unquote, \"relatively easy\" to raise money on, just not a great idea, and so that's obviously problematic.\n\nLenny (00:14:37):\nI've been thinking about writing a post on that exact topic, something like, \"Your startup probably is not venture scale,\" because a lot of people think they could raise money and build a huge business. What's a heuristic that maybe tells a founder that they shouldn't raise money, it's never going to be a billion-dollar company?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:14:53):\nI used to look at it 10 years ago you'd say, \"Is this a company that can get to 100 million in annual revenue?\" And now those numbers are all changed because IPOs are happening closer to 200, 250 million and the markets are all over the place depending on the day. I look at this as if you are going to be that large company, you need to get to a billion in revenue per year. It doesn't have to be overnight, it can be over 20 years, it's not something that has to happen quickly, but that's how I think about it. And if I don't feel like there's a clear path to that, it doesn't mean I don't raise money. It just means that I take a step back and really think about that particular idea because when you get on that treadmill, there's plenty of ideas that will sell for 400 million, 500 million.\n\n(00:15:38):\nBut then if you're on the funding treadmill and you look at how much money that founder that exec team ends up getting at the end of it's like you might have been better just building a 50 million cash flowing business that you're getting more money from that and you still have the choice to sell it.\n\n(00:15:52):\nSo that's how I think about it. It's a spectrum and it's on the margins there. It's not a fixed rule. But the other thing I also think about when I think about building my next company, we're going to be bootstrapped for, I don't know what... It's not a timeline, but I had imagined probably the first 18 to 24 months because I don't want to give up that equity for that funding on figuring out the idea. Obviously, I had an exit so I'm able to afford that and I'm in a position where I don't have to worry about my own livelihood.\n\n(00:16:22):\nBut I think it's one of those things if you can bootstrap, even if you're going after a funded idea, if you can bootstrap for the initial ideation and maybe even through product market fit, which is not an easy thing to do, but that's the ideal time then to raise because then you're just going and you're going for the fences at that point.\n\nLenny (00:16:37):\nI really like that very concrete stat you shared and that's exactly how we think about it, that if you don't think you can get to a billion dollars in revenue a year eventually that it probably is not a venture-scale business. And I think that just boils down to how large is the market. If there's not enough people that are going to pay enough money to make this a billion dollar a year in revenue business, you probably shouldn't go down the VC treadmill.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:16:59):\nAnd I think when you think about that, it opens up this world of options for you as someone listening to this. And so think of it this way, you don't have to have the pressure to create a billion dollars in revenue If you can take a step back and be like, \"Okay, I can create a $10-million business.\" You're listening to this and probably you're like, \"I don't know.\" But if you were a director level somewhere at a corporate company or you're leading product somewhere, you can go create a $10-million business. It might not happen overnight, it might take 10 years, all these other things. But that's amazing. That's insane.\n\n(00:17:33):\nThink of 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, you'd have to have a corner store and you'd have to work 18 hours a day to build that type of ability or that wealth to then hopefully retire when you're 65 and sell the business for 1X. Now you can build a software company that's doing a million a year, have an amazing life, reduce the number of hours if you want, or go all in, make it into a 10 or $100-million company over time. And I think that's amazing and we should celebrate that rather than if it's not a billion, you're failing. But we should just know our limits. I think that's the thing a lot of people fail out with funding.\n\nLenny (00:18:09):\nNext topic, pricing. You are probably the most... okay, you're in the top 1% smartest, most experienced people on pricing. We could have done a whole podcast on pricing, maybe we will in the future, but as maybe one of 10 topics, what comes to mind as maybe the biggest mistake people make in pricing, biggest opportunity they miss, biggest hot take?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:18:31):\nIt's super boring, but the biggest hot take is you just have to do something once a quarter. That's it. I've been trying to teach about pricing for a decade now. I've done a lot of different approaches on this, and I think the easiest thing is, listen, you have three growth levers. You have acquiring customers, monetizing them, and retaining them. You're spending a lot of time and money on acquisition. You're spending some time and money on retention. You're probably do nothing on pricing and monetization and it's because you think it's this nebulous thing and there are some nebulous aspects to it.\n\n(00:19:06):\nBut to make it super concrete, it is the revenue per customer. Look at that number, that one KPI, and you want that number going up and to the right, it's obviously going to go to the right over time, but you want it to going up over time every single quarter, not as high as your sales volume or your lead volume or your revenue maybe. But you want that number gradually going up and just do one thing per quarter. The least sexy thing when it comes to pricing is have a pricing committee. If it's a two-person company, it's you and your co-founder. If it's a 100,000-person company, it might be 30 people, but really it's only eight people central to that particular product.\n\n(00:19:42):\nAnd then just realize there's a lot of things that influence that revenue per customer. There's the actual price, your packaging, your add-on strategy, your discount strategy, your price localization, freemium. There's a whole host of different things there, but just find one thing you're going to do every three months, put a calendar invite, let it renew every three months. You're going to snooze it a couple of times, I get it, I've seen this many, many times before. But just do something, even if it's super small. I guarantee you it's just like any other thing you measure, as soon as you start measuring and caring about it, you're going to start to do some stuff, some of it is going to go poorly, some of it is going to go great. Then you're going to do more stuff, and then just over time, all of a sudden that number's going to go up into the right. But just do something. That's the basic idea.\n\nLenny (00:20:24):\nI love the simplicity of that. If I think about the pie chart of the things you will do and may change, you mentioned a few. One is raise prices. One may be lower prices. One's probably change your pricing model. There's a couple more. I guess, in your experience, where have you found the biggest opportunities end up being maybe early in the early phase of a startup in that pie chart?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:20:47):\nThe number one thing to figure out when you're thinking about the different pricing pieces, pound for pound, it's the pricing metric or the value metric. That's how you charge per user, per thousand visits, per thousand what's its, whatever it is. Consumer companies, it's a little bit harder. Physical good products, it's really hard obviously because you have that physical good, the physics you can't get over. But the reason this is so powerful is because if you get everything else in your pricing wrong or not great, but you get that right, you tend to be okay when it comes to monetization.\n\n(00:21:21):\nAnd the reason is because, first, from an acquisition standpoint like acquiring customers, you end up making sure that you get Disney coming into your product, they're paying Disney prices, and then you get Johnny or Jane's startup coming in and they're paying Johnny and Jane prices. You don't want them paying the same thing because obviously the value's different, even if they're consuming almost the same amount. So this allows you to figure that line out.\n\n(00:21:44):\nAnd then what's really beautiful about it is churn tends to be about 20 to 25% lower because people will downgrade, but they're using... you don't get this like, \"I'm paying for so much and end up not using a lot of it.\" It's like, \"Oh, I'm using eight seats this month, I'm going to downgrade,\" or it's just automatic. And then your expansion revenue's typically double when you're using a particular value metric because instead of me having to resell you and being like, \"Hey, Lenny, there's this really cool feature in this upper tier, do you want this?\" And you're like, \"I already use the product, I don't really want this.\" Instead, I just go, \"Hey, Lenny, congratulations. You now have 100 videos in your account. That's awesome. You guys must be growing. I'm just going to bump you up to the 100-video plan. Let me know if you have any questions.\" It's just a very, very implicit way to get expansion revenue. So that's the thing pound for pound that's the best.\n\n(00:22:30):\nAnd then I would say if you have a lot of politics internally, which everyone does with pricing because it sits in the center of so many different teams, I would actually start with a price increase. You should be increasing your overall price once per year if you're building. If you're not building and your support sucks and your NPS is low, then don't worry about it. But if your NPS is over 20, which is not a very high NPS, you should raise your prices once per year. The reason I suggest that is because it gets all of the BS and all the politics on the mat. You're going to have to collect some data, you're going to have to prove it to sales, you're going to have to make sure you have the enablement, you're going to have to make sure your messaging is...\n\n(00:23:06):\nBut it's a tight enough non-nebulous thing that you're doing versus a value metric where you can have a bunch of debates about this metric or that metric, and should you give 10 away versus 100 away. It's a good way to rip the bandaid off. And most companies don't change their actual number that they're charging once per every three years. So if you haven't done it for three years, you're overdue for it. So it's a good one to kind of rip the bandaid off.\n\nLenny (00:23:30):\nSo this episode already pound for pound I think is up there. This is amazing. I'm excited to get to the next topic, but first I'll plug. You wrote a guest post in my newsletter about pricing and we'll link to that in the show notes, and that goes deeper into this value metric and how to think about pricing. So check that out.\n\n(00:23:46):\nNext topic, retention. So when I think Patrick Campbell, I think pricing and retention. So again, this could be its own podcast episode, but let's just pick one thing to talk about. What are the biggest mistakes people make, retention opportunities, or just hot take?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:24:00):\nThe reason I started writing about retention and publishing data on it is because I didn't want to be the pricing guy. I was trying to basically differentiate myself and then I was trying to be the SaaS guy, but that's too broad. But anyway, so retention, the hottest of hottest takes, and this is the one to offend 90% of the list... no, it's not going to offend, but this is a product podcast, that's how I think about it. Product homies. You fail at realizing most of the time that there are two types of retention. There is strategic retention and then there's tactical retention.\n\n(00:24:38):\nStrategic retention is all the stuff that you as a great product leader, a great product team are doing. Your ICPs, your time to value, road mapping, the right features, figuring out your mission metric, agonizing over every little thing, all the paper cuts of being a great product leader. But because you're so focused and so biased towards that, you miss out typically on this thing we call tactical retention, and these are things like payment failures, term optimization, cancellation flows, offboarding, et cetera. And if you're past product market fit this area, this tactical retention, it's typically about 25 to 40% of your churn problem, which is a significant amount, but you don't really look at it because again, you're like, \"I've got to go focus on features, I've got to do this, and I'm going to go be this great product leader.\"\n\n(00:25:26):\nAnd so because product is so entrenched in that thinking that that problem can be solved with two months of work, it's not that much work putting in, basically, a marketing funnel when people's credit cards fail. Not that hard, not rocket science. Doing offboarding, being really smart with offboarding. And one little tidbit. I looked at two million cancellation flows. We built some products for this, that's why I have this data, just to be clear. But looked at two million cancellation flows and we found you have about 18 to 30 seconds when someone hits that cancel button, we found you should ask two questions. One, \"Why are you leaving?\" Multiple choice. Don't do the free response. You get one out of 100 great responses, and the 99 are not great.\n\n(00:26:08):\nAnd then the other question we found works really, really well is, \"What did you like about the product?\" And the reason that works so effectively is because that person's on a freight train to basically cancel. They're like, \"I'm already done. Oh yeah, this is why I'm leaving.\" The minute you ask them what they like, you're basically tapping into this nostalgia effect and you're stopping that freight train. And then when I have that information, it's great for a product team, it's great to figure out, \"What's working, what's not? What should we do more of? Was this a good customer?\"\n\n(00:26:34):\nBut then based on their engagement data, their plan, whatever, all their firmographics about them plus their answers, then I can offer up a salvage offer or a pause plan or a maintenance plan or these types of things. But all this type of stuff, this is really, really powerful. And I always suggest finance teams should just take this on because product teams are always going to be thinking so much more on the future rather than fixing this right now. But that's the hottest take I've got for retention.\n\nLenny (00:27:00):\nThat's a great, awesome take. And I want to plug ProfitWell right here, actually. I know you guys offer a product that does this and I've used it. So I don't know if that's still true, I know after an acquisition, things change. So I use ProfitWell for my newsletters. I just plug it into my Stripe account and it's the most amazing free product because it just tells me everything I want to know. And then it's got this cool feature, you just turn it on and it does these things for you like it tells people, \"Your credit card is about to expire.\" Hey, this card failed, you should try putting in a new card.\" So that's a cool reason to check out ProfitWell.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:27:29):\nThanks, man. I appreciate that. And it's actually cool because I think for us, because the fact that product teams don't really think about this stuff, we stumbled into this whole thesis that could be a whole episode, which is all the product features are done for you. So what I mean by that is, you noticed this, but when you log in and set this up, you're not writing emails, you're not setting up the flows. And the reason is because we have all this data from $30 billion in ARR flowing through our metrics product that we can study and understand what works and what doesn't.\n\n(00:28:02):\nAnd that kind of stumbling that is useful for folks is what we discovered is this anti-active usage type product, it retains itself at a really, really high rate because people are just getting the value and they don't have to use it. And so what we found is a little bonus thing on retention. When we look at churn rates across different types of products, those products that are workflow products you use every single day or mostly every single day, or those products you don't have to log into but you still get the value, that's where the lowest churn rates are, the highest retention. Anything in the middle, it's like death. And this is why ProfitWell metrics ended up being free because we were just like, \"It's terrible to build a metrics and analytics product. It's so hard because people just don't appreciate how much work goes into it, therefore they don't retain at a high rate, they're not willing to pay that much,\" et cetera.\n\nLenny (00:28:49):\nI think that alone is a really interesting story, and I don't know if we should get too deep, but just to highlight what you just said, so many startups build an analytics product that it's just a better way to measure and track all the stuff that's going on. And what you've found is you won't make money doing that, people don't want to pay for a SaaS analytics tool.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:29:08):\nYou have two options. You go up market and you pretty much become a data product with a UI or you go super niche. And even super niche, it's super hard and it's just because, I don't know, everyone's trying to kill a spreadsheet, and it's like, \"You're not going to kill a spreadsheet.\" All real analysts will do everything in a spreadsheet. So for us it was we want to give you a clean UI and then we want to help you get this data into spreadsheets or email or whatever you're using for your databases, things like that.\n\nLenny (00:29:38):\nYeah. I don't want to make this an ad for ProfitWell, but it's like founders come to me with pitches of, \"Hey, we've built this sweet analytics.\" So I'm like, \"Just look up what ProfitWell is giving away for free, that's going to be a high bar to exceed.\"\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:29:49):\nYeah. Yeah. We were going to try to sell it. We were trying to sell it in the beginning, but what ended up happening is we ran into all this, that's why we didn't.\n\nLenny (00:29:56):\nAll right, back on track. Topic number five, shipping. What have you learned about shipping? What are mistakes people make when trying to ship faster, ship more efficiently?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:30:05):\nYeah. The bratty thing here is that real professional ship. At the end of the day, real... I don't care what if you're a marketer or product person, engineer, ops person, people ops, real professional ship, and they ship it a pretty high frequency for whatever they're doing. And so the thing that we thought a lot about is, in my opinion, your tempo framework, and I'll explain a little bit more of what that means in a second, is more important than your org design. And so if you've ever had a team that seems really, really smart, but they're always planning or they don't really ship a lot, or you've had trouble where everyone gets it at the leadership level, but then the team below them and below them seems to be kind of going in a different direction, you probably don't have enough alignment and you don't have enough alignment on what good looks like in terms of tempo.\n\n(00:30:56):\nAnd so the way we looked at this was we have to establish mission metric and guiding principles at the top so, what do we do? How are we measuring it? And how we're going to get there? So for us was we automate subscription growth. Our mission metric was the amount of revenue that was on ProfitWell because that was good from acquisition, but it also meant we were doing our jobs. Then how we're going to get there. We want to be the most helpful brand in SaaS. And then we also we're going to do it for you, this whole thing that I just talked about.\n\n(00:31:25):\nThen what we did is we established that at the leadership level, every org leader, so marketing, sales, et cetera, they need a framework that fits into that overall. So marketing at ProfitWell was this whole inbound media, so lots of podcast, video series, et cetera. And the most important part of that was they needed to determine what good looked like in terms of shipping. So if we're like, \"Hey, we're doing sales,\" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, or marketing in this case, \"this many episodes per month, it's this many product launches per month, this many big product launches per quarter,\" whatever it is.\n\n(00:31:57):\nAnd then your leadership is basically a conversation of, \"Great, that's what good looks like, we agree. How do we close that gap?\" And then all of those conversations are like, \"Okay, you only shipped one thing per quarter, we want to do one per month. Why?\"\n\n(00:32:10):\n\"Well, I don't have enough resources.\"\n\n(00:32:12):\nWe solve that problem or we figure out how to get the more resources, then they're not doing it again. \"Okay, why?\"\n\n(00:32:17):\n\"Well, there's this problem.\"\n\n(00:32:18):\nAnd then all of a sudden you start to create this very high output team across the board, and you also have this alignment so you don't wake up nine months into someone being at your company and being like, \"Well, I think Tim sucks.\"\n\n(00:32:30):\nAnd it's like, \"Well, why did you just all of a sudden wake up and think Tim sucks.\"\n\n(00:32:34):\n\"Well, he's not shipping blah, blah, blah, blah.\"\n\n(00:32:35):\n\"Well, it's probably an org problem rather than a Tim problem,\" because again, you vetted Tim. Tim was at this other company and apparently was a really great rockstar. So what's the difference here? You screwed up the hiring? Well, maybe because that is really, really hard, but most of the time you just haven't set an expectation of what good looks like in terms of tempo, and then you haven't had that constant conversation to make sure that Tim has what he needs in order to ship.\n\nLenny (00:33:00):\nWhat was a big learning, I guess, in doing that? Is that just something you built up over time of we need to create this tempo at ProfitWell?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:33:05):\nYeah. Complete misalignment if you don't call it out on what good looks like, just complete misalignment. Like so-and-so is going and building, they think one product launch per quarter. Or I'm sitting there and I'm like, \"Well, we should have a medium one per month and then we should have a big one per quarter.\" Complete misalignment. And if you don't have a way to talk about that, some sort of nexus to have that conversation, you end up not having it, and then you end up creating this friction and resentment on both sides because everyone thinks, again, \"Tim isn't doing well.\" And it's like, \"That's not what's happening. It's just the expectations aren't set.\"\n\n(00:33:40):\nAnd then what was really cool is that you start to find out that the why they aren't hitting what good looks like is all solvable, and most of the time it's this team isn't talking to this team. \"Oh, great. Well, marketing wants to do these launches, product isn't providing them stuff. All right, let's get these two people together, have this conversation because we didn't have product marketing or official product marketing.\" They have this conversation and then all of a sudden it's like, \"All right, Neil, you need to provide one thing a month. There's so much stuff we've built, a lot of it we haven't announced, you just need to provide one thing a month. Marketing will worry about how to position it in a way that isn't too far, isn't overselling it, but also gets us something per month, and you can approve that positioning.\" And then all of a sudden you start getting this tempo going, which obviously is the goal.\n\nLenny (00:34:27):\nReminds me, David Sacks has this awesome post called The Cadence around how marketing and product and sales should operate and create this kind of cadence. So being aligned but also offset schedule, which will link to them in the show notes if you haven't seen it.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:34:41):\nYeah, that's great.\n\nLenny (00:34:42):\nNext topic. First principles thinking. As a renaissance man of a brain, I feel like you've spent a lot of time thinking about from first principles and in our conversations you always have really interesting approaches to things. What have you learned about actually implementing first principle thinking, which people are always talking about. How do I [inaudible 00:35:00] first principle?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:35:01):\nYeah, people always talk about it. And there are no good courses that I have found on first principles thinking. There are good blog posts, but the good blog posts kind of explain what it is, and then that's it. It's like, \"This is what it is, and here's an example.\" And most of them quote Elon Musk about rockets and breaking down the different parts. So what I kind of found is there's the five whys, which I think someone's talked before or at least I've read it in the newsletter before, which is just you keep asking why. Kind of, \"Well, this is this way.\"\n\n(00:35:36):\n\"Well, why is that?\"\n\n(00:35:36):\n\"Well, this is this way.\"\n\n(00:35:37):\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n(00:35:38):\nI found the model that people who aren't great at first principal thinking or aren't great at talking about it that kind of helps them unlock is this thing called problem, cause, solution. So I learned this in debate in college and high school, and it basically is you have a problem that you're trying to solve. Well, you can't actually solve a problem. So if we talk about world hunger, you can't just solve world hunger because it's kind of the symptom, it's this problem that exists.\n\n(00:36:06):\nWell then I want to break down what are all the causes of world hunger? And it's a little more brainstormy when you have these conversations with folks, especially again when they struggle with this. And all of a sudden I could list out all the causes, irrigation crisis, aid not getting to where it needs to be, famines, drought, et cetera. And then what I can do is I can rank those causes in terms of magnitude. So if we're trying to solve world hunger, and for some reason we discovered irrigation was the biggest problem, if we solved irrigation, everything would be great, well then I'm going to align my solutions to all of those different causes. And you get this nice alignment between, well, I can solve a cause, and if I solve the cause that's big enough and proper enough, I'm going to eventually solve the actual problem or mitigate the problem, I should say.\n\n(00:36:50):\nSo that's the framework that I found really, really useful. And also, it's great for using for presentations, it's great for a mission, it's great for all of these different things because it's a little bit more actionable than just the five whys, which is more of a way to have a conversation.\n\nLenny (00:37:06):\nSo the way you operationalize this, say problem, cause, solution. You're saying on strategy templates, you write out, \"Here's the problem we're trying to solve, here's the source of the issue, and then here's how we're approaching it.\" Can you talk a bit more about how you implement this at your company and the people you work with?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:37:22):\nYeah, totally. So I'll say big, medium and small things, and I'll try to be really quick. So big things it's like, \"What are we facing?\"\n\n(00:37:30):\n\"Oh, we're going to try to charge for this metrics product. Now there's a bunch of competitors. The customers don't really care about it.\"\n\n(00:37:37):\nSo we have this problem and the problem is growth. How do we grow a product like this? How do we grow our company? And what's really interesting about a big problem or a nebulous problem like that is you end up having a lot of conversations about the problem, which I think is more useful sometimes about, \"Well, what are we actually trying to do? Let's get alignment as much as possible.\" And then it's like, \"Okay. Well, what are the causes of our growth problem?\"\n\n(00:38:00):\n\"Well, people aren't willing to pay for metrics. Getting accuracy is really, really hard. Actually, the market stance,\" all these other things.\n\n(00:38:08):\n\"Well, what are some of the solutions?\"\n\n(00:38:10):\n\"Well, we could do this, could do this, could do this.\"\n\n(00:38:12):\nAnd normally what ends up happening is the solution ends up being kind of an approach. So our approach that mitigated or solved for some of these causes and mitigate the problem was freemium, and then these paid products that were all pay-for-performance because with pay-for-performance, you could charge a significant amount more in a market that only has 100,000 logos, which is a really small market. And so that kind of an example there.\n\n(00:38:37):\nMedium and small, let's talk about a support ticket. This person's pissed off. They're coming in, they're pissed off. What are the causes? Well, there's a lot of different causes that were probably like, \"Oh, we didn't get back to them in time, and then we gave a crappy solution, we gave this...\" It just kind of allows us to look at the problem. And so it's more of a way of thinking on that level. And it's not happening. We're not going to have an hour-long conversation about a support ticket. But the support folks that I've talked to about this, they go, \"Okay, cool. Why is he upset?\"\n\n(00:39:06):\n\"Well, we didn't get the answer in time.\"\n\n(00:39:08):\nOkay, my first line is going to be, \"I understand we didn't get you an answer quick enough. Apologies for that.\" It just allows them to have a little bit of an extra second to think through things and move forward with that.\n\nLenny (00:39:21):\nI love that. I love that big example and a small example.\n\nAudio (00:39:26):\nThis episode is brought to you by Dovetail, the customer insights platform for teams that gets you from data to insights fast, no matter the method.

I feel like you have a pretty interesting perspective on custom research, so let's go into it.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:40:27):\nI think I have the 85-year-old curmudgeonly man perspective on customer research. So here's the thing. Everything in your business, it does not matter what type of business you have, everything is used to drive someone to a point of conversion or justify the product or the price that you're offering up. That customer is a human being you're driving to that point of conversion and it's your job to understand how they perceive you, how they perceive their problem, how they perceive the world around them, around your products.\n\n(00:41:00):\nWe all know this on a philosophical level, but here are some fun facts. So one, only one in five companies have buyer personas or ICPs, only one in five. So we talk about this all the time, we retweet the articles, we give the advice, so many of us give the advice. But then we look at our own companies, only one in five have some sort of segmentation ICPs. And then only one out of 10 companies actually do customer research or development on a quarterly basis. This should be a continuous thing, it should be a monthly, weekly type thing. Not saying you're sending up surveys or having all these conversations on a weekly basis, but only one out of 10 are doing quarterly. So that means the number they're doing monthly is even smaller than that. And I just think that's insane.\n\n(00:41:44):\nAnd when we look at all data, and we have a lot of data on this, and this is something where I've been talking about customer development for a long time. Everything is better. Everything is better. NPS is higher for organizations that have customer development functions or even just ICPs or buyer personas, depending on what framework you're using. Willingness to pay is typically higher. The funnel is more efficient. LTV to CAC is normally much, much higher. All those growth numbers, you're typically growing in a much higher rate, like a 15, 20%, not a small delta, 15-20% higher rate. Retention's better. All these things are better.\n\n(00:42:21):\nAnd the thing that, I think, 20 years ago or 10 years ago you didn't have to do customer development because, and this is where Keith [inaudible 00:42:30] is just like customer research is dumb or whatever his famous quote is, but you didn't have to do it because there just wasn't a lot of stuff out there and we all were riding the wave of the internet. But now the market's harder and harder. So what are you going to do? Are you just going to keep throwing stuff up against the wall or are you going to actually do the stuff that all of us talk about doing and actually do the research? And the research is hard. It's never going to be 100% accurate because you're going to have to use your judgment, but that's your job.\n\n(00:42:54):\nAnd so that's more of a rant, I guess, than a hot take. But I also think this is one of those things that AI starts solving, especially all this generative AI because now you can just throw all that stuff into a workload and then all of a sudden you'll get back a lot of the sentiment or all that kind stuff so you don't even to do the hard part anymore. Yeah, that's my rant.\n\nLenny (00:43:14):\nLove the rant. Maybe one follow-up question. Why do you think it is that companies don't do this? I love the point you made of the retweeting, \"Yeah, research is great.\" Writing blogs that research is use useful, \"We've got to do research.\" Why do you think companies don't do it? And then what's one thing that maybe they could do tomorrow that'll bring them closer down that path?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:43:35):\nThe one thing you can do, put a number on a whiteboard. You're going to have 10 customer conversations a month, just 10 non-sales conversations. You're just going to talk to 10 people. Or you're going to send one survey. And people are terrible at sending surveys. Surveys are actually great. You just have to be good at sending them. And good, it's not a high bar, it just means that you have 30 to 45 seconds of someone's time unless you're compensating them. And don't send 45-question surveys by email where the first question is, \"What's your email?\" Don't do that. But just put a number on the board.\n\n(00:44:09):\nI think the reason we don't do it is because it was, quote-unquote, \"easy\" to get away with not doing it. If you really think about a funded environment... and some products are so paradigm-shifting that the biggest misconception about customer research is I have to listen to them. You don't have to listen to them at all, you just have to understand where they are, and then you're filtering all of that with all this other data and then you're making a decision and you're earning your paycheck as a product person. Typically, it's the product person, but also in marketing.\n\n(00:44:37):\nSo I think it's just one of those things where you could get away with not doing it. Now though, the way the market's going, you're just starting to see this more and more, you're starting to see more tooling. The reason you're seeing more tooling is because they're starting to connect it to actually being useful rather than you having to set up your own customer development program. I think the other reason typically people haven't had to do this is because there's a lot of brute forcing that's done in startup land and it only lasts so long.\n\n(00:45:06):\nSo all of these companies that raise a bunch of money, get the $100 million dollar exit, everyone's clapping because it's a big number, but cap table screwed, everything's bad. It's a win because it's a win, but all of those companies are ones who were able to brute force to a certain level and they never learned how to actually understand their market or their customer. And I think that that kind of story will continue to happen as long as we have a lot of capital flowing in the market. But I would rather not be that company. I would rather be the company that gets the $100 million, 200 million exit with bootstrapping, or builds the billion-dollar annual revenue company because I know my market, I know my customer so well.\n\nLenny (00:45:47):\nTalking to customers is good, you should do it. Great reminder. People are going to listen to this like, \"Yes, we should do this,\" and then we'll just move on. And then-\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:45:55):\nMy joke when I give talks is, \"Only 20% of you are going to do this when I give a talk on it, and so I'm not even going to talk deeply on it. You 20%, come talk to me, I've got a whole framework for you,\" that type of a thing because I think people just nod their heads and they tweet it, and they just don't end up doing it.\n\nLenny (00:46:10):\nStatus quo is hard to overcome sometimes. We're onto our eighth topic, we've got three to go, and it's on competitive intelligence. And this touches on a really interesting part of your background that I don't know a lot of people know.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:46:24):\nYeah. So my background, I started my career... I worked in US Intelligence, I worked for NSA. And I was just a entry level intel analyst, basically, I was only there for just over a year. And what was interesting is you get taught first principles thinking in so many different ways because you're solving essentially puzzles every day. Now those puzzles are finding a bad guy or a gal or finding this piece of information. Those are all the puzzles, but you have to think through how to figure this out. And a lot of those puzzles involve, \"You have these number of entities, how are they going to react?\" And you're trying to predict how they're going to react, and you're also trying to help figure out how you're going to react or act in the context of them, so like node analysis, basically.\n\n(00:47:09):\nAnd what's interesting from a startup or a business perspective is I think that don't focus on your competitors is terrible advice. It's amazing advice for product teams. When you have a competitive intelligence program or you have competitive intel, I try never to share that with product ever because products should just focus on the customer, they should not give two craps what's going on with competitor A or competitor B. But as an overall missive, don't focus on your competitors is terrible advice. And if I'm being charitable, it's just outdated because some fun facts, and I alluded to some of them before, over the past decade, if you're building in tech, particularly in SaaS or subscriptions, you now have 16 times the number of competitors if you started a business today, than if you did 10 years ago, and this is because everyone and their mother can spin up a website, a server, they can drive traffic to that site.\n\n(00:48:02):\nSo there's just a bunch of stuff in the market. And then because of all that stuff, all these marketing channels are getting denser and denser. CAC and B2B is up about 110% over the past 10 years. Consumer, it's up 145%. If you're selling sales and marketing software, it's up 220% because there's just so much sales and marketing software doing sales and marketing things in the market. And so the other reason for this is we haven't had a brand new marketing channel since 2015, and that was Snapchat. We have TikTok, but TBD, depending on how you think about it. But we're going from brand new marketing and advertising innovation every quarter to basically every five years.\n\n(00:48:42):\nMy point is, if you are not in a Blue Ocean, you're not in the Peter Teal, go to a market of one, you're not in those types of things, which is most of us, and even some of us who think we're in those things, we're actually not, you do have to focus on your competitors on some level. And the levels I particularly think are a bare minimum, just knowing who they are, having a strategy. So for ProfitWell we never had comparison pages because we very quickly went from a challenger in this very competitive market to the leader in the market. So all of a sudden we were going to be above the fray, that was the idea, that was the strategy that we had, which is, \"We're going to have a lot of intel on what's going on with them, why people care about this product.\" We had white label NPS surveys and customer development surveys going to our competitors' customers. That's the level. And it was just automated. It wasn't like it was taking a lot of time, but we just wanted that intel.\n\nLenny (00:49:34):\nWhen you say white labeled, that means you're emailing your competitor's customers to see what they think of your competitors, right?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:49:41):\nExactly. So we're basically, and we did it as a third party basically, which was, I think one of them was analyticssoftware.com, stuff like that. So it wasn't like we were spoofing as our competitor because I think that crosses a little bit of a line. But basically we would have this intel. There's a whole program here. Basically, I'd have sources... Basically, these customers I knew were always going to stay because they liked the founder or something like that. I would get on the phone with them every quarter or two just to be like, \"Hey, what are you liking? Why haven't you switched yet?\" these types of things, or I'd see them at conferences.\n\n(00:50:14):\nSo there's a whole program there. And again, it's not like it's distracting anything, it's just I want the intel so I can predict what's going on, I can predict who to care about, who not to care about. But even then, if you're a challenger, competitor marketing pages are really powerful. And the thing is, your customers, especially in a denser market, they know your competitors exist or they're looking at them. Don't infantilize your customers, help them, \"Hey, this is how we compare to X, Y, Z competitor,\" and be honest as much as possible. Well, we should always be honest, but be as upfront as possible, I should say, with where you're bad at and where you're great at, those types of things.\n\n(00:50:55):\nBut long story short, having something awareness and then choosing a particular strategy, and then depending on your strategy, you might ramp up how much you actually do with the actual intelligence program.\n\nLenny (00:51:06):\nThis is amazing. Two questions. Should every startup have a former spy on their team to help them operationalize these ideas? And then two, is there anything else that you found super valuable that you did based on your training there?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:51:20):\nWe didn't have a formal program, but I love hiring veterans, either veterans of intelligence, so they're citizens, so they're not veterans from a military perspective, but people who had worked in Intel or people who were actual veterans of different military branches. There's a lot of reasons for this, but I think that the intelligence folks, it's a way of thinking. Now you ought to be careful, and this is just purely my opinion, because depending on how long they were in... the reason I left is because it's the government, it's super bureaucratic. It was one of the most fulfilling jobs I will ever have, and I was only there for a short amount of time. But it's just one of those things where it's just so bureaucratic.\n\n(00:52:01):\nSo the 15-year person there is not thriving, they're not trying to change the world necessarily. They have a job. So you've got to be careful with that. But yeah, I think there's these really smart people that just think in a different way. And a broader point is I think it's just really, really good to go to different industries. All this customer development stuff, you go to any major retailer or any major e-commerce company, they have entire teams just dedicated to this stuff. Hallmark was one of our first pricing customers back in the day before we went subscription focused. They had 119 people in customer insights and research. And this was one of the reason we were like, \"Well, you guys don't need our help, you've got enough people.\" But those are great people to hire, even though they don't necessarily have the actual industry knowledge, they have a lot of domain expertise.\n\n(00:52:50):\nIn terms of things I learned, I'll put it this way, not to get political, if I was in charge of budget, I would give so much more money into the intel community. I saw conflicts or heard about conflicts being stopped just because of intelligence that didn't go hot in terms of war fighting. I think it's one of those things where I would put so much more money there than the actual other side of the defense budget.\n\n(00:53:12):\nAnd also everyone asks me about Snowden. So again, not to get political, it's a lot more complicated, I think, than a lot of people think. It's one of those things that the issues that were brought up, obviously they got really sensationalized, but they're really important conversations to have, but it's not as simple as, \"Oh, stop doing this, start doing that.\"\n\n(00:53:33):\nYou don't have to worry about the NSA, the NSA's all outward-looking. You should worry about the FBI. The FBI are the ones who get a little testy with certain things, and you're seeing that in the court cases and stuff like that. But just know there's a lot of really hardworking, very well-intentioned people who you might disagree in terms of trade-offs, in terms of safety and things like that. They're also some of the most privacy orientated people on the planet, so that's worth a whole conversation. So hopefully I didn't throw too many grenades in this part.\n\nLenny (00:54:02):\nNo, we need more grenades. That's the first time Snowden was brought up on this podcast, so that's cool. There you go. And this is actually a good segue to the next topic, which is around local strategies like FBI versus NSA. I think you have a strong perspective that local strategies are much more likely to [inaudible 00:54:19] so we'll just get into that one.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:54:21):\nYeah, yeah. Just to give you a tease, I'll tell you what I think of Snowden after the podcast. So the world doesn't get to know except that I'll tell you what my opinion is afterwards.\n\nLenny (00:54:30):\nWhat a tease.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:54:31):\nLocal strategies. Local strategies, very basic. People like to buy from people, but we as operators get so excited about the scale of the internet that we forget the basics of humanity. Here's some fun data points, we did a bunch of studies on this. So prospects who meet you in person, and this is not just for profit, all the data I've shared, it's all global-level data or segmented depending on how we did it. It's not just our findings, it's like we looked at probably a minimum of 2,000 companies per factoid and most of the time much more. But prospects who meet you in person have 10 to 30% higher willingness to pay than those who didn't. Churn for those folks who you meet in person is typically 20% lower than those folks who have never met you. Expansion revenue is typically 15 to 20% higher.\n\n(00:55:23):\nAnd this is not only in hand-to-hand kind of sales, coffee meetings, lunches, lunch and learns this type of thing, but it's also in scaled products, so products that cost 20, 50 bucks per month. And so my suggestion is to you, especially in a post-COVID, I don't know if that's the right term, but in a world that hopefully does not see another pandemic in our lifetimes, knock on wood, do meetups, do lunches, go to conferences, unless you're Lenny who is not a big fan of conferences. But get out of the office. Make sure you get out of the office. And the budget doesn't have to be as big as you think. Breakfast and lunches are super cheap. We would push all of our P2 and P3s to a meetup, and all of our P1s, we would have one-on-one coffee dates. It's super cheap.\n\nLenny (00:56:08):\nWhat do the Ps mean? Is that priority?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:56:10):\nPriority 1, we want these people to convert, they're very good fits, all this other stuff. P2s are like, they're probably good fits, but they're just not as big. And then P3s are with a content play, they just love our content and stuff, but they're not necessarily good fits for us. And so people make the mistake, they push everyone to dinners and it's like, I don't want to spend all of my money on P2s and P3s.\n\n(00:56:34):\nAnd so breakfast and lunches are cheaper than dinners. Meetups can be extremely inexpensive, get creative. We like to do barbecue type stuff for, not dive bars, but the unique dive bar, I guess is the best way to put it. So it's not fancy. People just want to meet people, they want to talk to you, especially if you're doing content and things like that. The Lenny Newsletter, Lenny Empire Meetups, I see the pictures of those all the time. There's just an urge to learn from one another and hang out. So yeah, that's the biggest thing, get out of the office or get out of your desk at home.\n\nLenny (00:57:07):\nYeah, that's right. You're on Zoom. And you're saying it's not just the founders, it could be anyone on the team, salespeople, that all works.\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:57:14):\nAnyone. I led marketing as part of my role as CEO, and so I do a lot of this and I'm also the one doing a lot of the content and stuff like that, or the face of a lot of our content, so I did a lot of it. But your head of sales... and you just have to position this a little differently. If they're going to meet with a salesperson, it's the same thing as if they get a email from a BDR, they're like, \"I'm not going to figure it out. I don't want to deal with this.\" But if it's like, \"Hey, we're hosting...\" We're doing these lunch and learns right now. I was in Paris, New York, and London last week, it's probably why I'm so sick this week, and all of a sudden we did these lunch and learns. People just want to hang out.\n\n(00:57:47):\nSo we had 10 people, we had 20 people at one, 10 people, all priority 1 leads. And then we did these meetups with 100-plus people at each. Just think of that brand equity. And you just hang out. It wasn't just me at all of these things. I ran the content, but then all of our sales folks were hanging out and doing their thing. But it doesn't have to be super complicated. It's just those touchpoints that people want. And it's so high leverage because there are a lot of people who will not answer your email but will come to an event to meet you or meet someone from your team because it's something to do, especially if you're buying them breakfast or coffee or something like that. It doesn't have to be something that's extravagant.\n\nLenny (00:58:25):\nI love this advice. Basically, it's like if your sales aren't where you want it to be, find a way to meet your potential leads or someone in your team meeting your leads. That's a very actionable thing you could do like, \"We're not hitting our numbers, let's just go meet some people, find opportunities to hang out in real life.\"\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:58:41):\nWell, in the early days, pre-product market fit, this is all we would do too. I would stay at the worst hotels, I would stay at hostels, but just to get to, \"Okay, I want to sell to these people.\" The best information I'm going to get isn't in a Zoom or I'm asking them questions, it's going to be like, \"Hey.\" I gave a talk on pricing because that was a high leverage thing I could do because no one knows anything about pricing, but they know it's important, so a lot of people want to listen. But then afterwards it's like, \"Oh yeah, how do you think about this? What are you doing for this? What are you doing for...\" all of those fun producty questions. It's just really, really high leverage. And I think it's one of those things that... It depends on your role, it depends on your stage, but everyone can use something there.\n\nLenny (00:59:21):\nGreat segue to our final topic. A lot of people spend time on top of funnel driving visitors, driving traffic, getting the word out. A lot of people spend time at the end of the funnel, closing customers, increasing within an organization. You have this perspective that the middle of the funnel is maybe the biggest opportunity these days. Can you talk about that?\n\nPatrick Campbell (00:59:40):\nPound for pound biggest opportunity. So take a quick step back. Demand generation exists for more than just supporting the sales team. We forget that. So sales and marketing, the past decade, it's all been the funnel, we're top of the funnel, middle of funnel, bottom of the funnel. HubSpot's trying to make it a flywheel, but marketers are still talking about funnels. And when you look at the data, it depends a little bit on the price point and a little bit on the vertical, but 80% of sales and marketing budgets tend to go to the top of the funnel and the bottom of the funnel. So sales folks and ad-type spend, field events, whatever it is, that's where it goes.\n\n(01:00:24):\nAnd the whole point is you're trying to move someone from a lack of awareness at the top of the funnel to being aware about you and then to a sales combo or a conversion point, if you're not doing sales. The problem is bottom of the funnel efficiency and top of the funnel efficiency has plummeted the past decade, just plummeted. And it's not only because of the factoids I was saying before about CAC and all these other things and so many competitors being in the market, it's just one of those things that the days of just hiring a bunch of BDRs, not training them, not having them in account-based marketing, not doing all these other things, those days are not here anymore. Those days are gone. Maybe in some specific verticals, in specific parts of the market.\n\n(01:01:11):\nBut here's the other problem. Sales today is so much more about timing than it once was. Because there's so much stuff out there, it's one of those things where people are waiting until it's the right time. They're aware of you, but they're waiting. So the question we have to ask ourselves to not bury the lead any further is do we need to make this river of demand generation, basically what demand generation works? But that's table space.\n\n(01:01:37):\nIf we want to be even increasingly more successful, that middle of the funnel needs to get bigger. That pool of users who is aware of you, interacting with you on a regular basis. What if you had leads basically hanging out there in the middle of the funnel, interacting with you on a regular basis before all of a sudden their timing was right and then all of a sudden they go to the bottom of the funnel, and even better they opt into them. You don't have to keep going after them and doing sales processes that are very kind of churn and burn. So that pool of leads.\n\n(01:02:07):\nAnd so the best way to create pools of leads, freemium. I'm a huge fan of freemium. I used to write articles about how freemium is terrible, so I'm a big convert. I wrote a book on freemium as well. The thing with freemium is CAC is still up over the past decade, but it's up a lot less than overall CAC. Customers who convert from freemium and become paid customers, their retention is typically about 10 to 20% higher than those who converted from a free trial or converted from a traditional sales process. And then on top of that, NPS or CSAT, we measured it through NPS, is typically about double because they're converting on their own timeline, not on some artificial timeline of a free trial or artificial timeline of sales.\n\n(01:02:47):\nYou should still have those things, but I want this pool of people who are aware of me and are using something of my product because at the end of the day, what better content do you have than your actual product? Even if you're a big enterprise solution, give them something to interact with. And then the other way to fill that middle of the funnel is, I think inbound marketing is just becoming SEO and eBooks. Kieran from HubSpot gets offended when I say that, but I love you, buddy. It's okay. I'm still a huge fan. And this is just because CAC and inbound marketing has gone up and it's all about a lot of SEO and we'll see what AI does to that.\n\n(01:03:21):\nBut this whole thing of inbound media, we got on this train about five years ago, and inbound media is just podcast video series. When we sold the company, we had eight different podcasts and video series, all very niche like Pricing Page Tear Down, which was a show about we collected data and tore down pricing pages, the good and the bad. We had Boxed Out, which was a retention focused show for the subscription e-commerce industry.\n\n(01:03:44):\nSo all of that was to build this pool so that people were aware of us. And then over time, all of a sudden they're like, \"Oh, we have a pricing problem, we should go talk to these guys. Oh, we have this content or this retention thing, we should go talk to these guys.\" But I think the pool is kind of the future and a lot of people are still treating it as just this gateway between the top and the bottom of the funnel.\n\nLenny (01:04:02):\nMiddle of the funnel is the new top of funnel. We need a bumper sticker.\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:04:05):\nThere you go. I don't know if that's going to sell well, but I will buy one, so.\n\nLenny (01:04:09):\nThe most nerdiest of all bumper stickers. Patrick, we've gone through 10 topics. Is there anything else you want to touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning rounds?\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:04:18):\nI think what I will say is this is all still hard. So I'm giving some heuristics, I'm giving some benchmarks, but your mileage is going to vary. But again, that's your job, whether you're a founder, a product person, an exec, whatever you are, your job is to take in information, your job is to analyze the problem, and then ultimately come up with the best solution. And so I think it's one of those things that there's some hard truths I think we talked about, but then there's a lot of this that you have to evaluate it for yourself. So just a general, I may come off like a know-it-all, but I understand that mileage varies I guess is the best way...\n\nLenny (01:04:54):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:05:01):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:05:02):\nOkay.\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:05:03):\nI feel like I need a buzzer.\n\nLenny (01:05:05):\nI'm going to add a buzzer someday. Anyway, here we go. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:05:11):\nI have read High Output Management probably 20 times in the past 10 years. I read it at least once a year now. I commissioned a bronze bust of Andy Grove, so that's being done. I'm a big Andy Grove fan.\n\nLenny (01:05:25):\nOh, it's in progress?\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:05:26):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. It's in progress. It's not done. I'll send you a mockup after this. But yeah, High Output Management. Thinking in Bets, going to that first principles thinking. I find that a good book to share with people so that they can think about things and get on board with that.\n\n(01:05:40):\nAnd then Powerful by Patty McCord. Anything around HR to kind of break your brain a little bit about what you think about HR and people ops. That's the gateway drug. That was the one where I was like, \"Oh, we can choose how to design our people ops teams.\"\n\nLenny (01:05:55):\nOkay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:05:58):\nI don't have one that's recent, but I watch The West Wing at least once per week, so I've done that for a long time. I love Sorkin, I think the writing's just so good, so I'll just throw that out.\n\nLenny (01:06:10):\nGreat one. Someone was telling me there's a podcast to analyze each episode, which [inaudible 01:06:14].\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:06:13):\nIt is a great podcast and I've listened to most of them, so yeah.\n\nLenny (01:06:18):\nOkay, great. You're all over it. Favorite interview question that you like to ask because you're interviewing.\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:06:22):\nI have a controversial one. I'm not going to be able to go through the entire question in a lightning round. But what I do is I do a mini... I did all the final interviews at ProfitWell, and we did a very hard culture check in the final interview. There's a mini case study, it only lasts about a couple of minutes, I'm not going to go through it, but I asked them if someone in Slack responded to someone sharing something benign, like some report they found on the internet from McKinsey, they shared it in Slack, and then someone responded to that with something indirectly offensive.\n\n(01:06:55):\nSo it's changed over the years, sometimes I say, \"Oh, they called it the R word, they said it was stupid,\" something indirectly offensive. And I say, \"What would you do, and what do you think the company should do?\" And no matter what they say, I challenge them, and I always tell them, \"I've never seen that at ProfitWell,\" which is always good just to make sure they don't have a bunch of fear in this position.\n\n(01:07:19):\nBut it gave me a really, really good opportunity to talk through our culture, particularly the most charitable interpretation piece. And I would say there were about 10% of people who had a zero tolerance policy for whatever the situation was. And I would tell them, I would say, \"Hey, listen. We have zero tolerance for the obvious things, we probably all agree on those.\" But for this type of situation, we would ask some questions, we'd want to figure it out, we want to see, there's probably some judgment around what happened, how long if they'd been doing this for a while, that type of thing. And then we would make a decision on what would happen. And a lot of times nothing would happen except, \"Hey, don't be an idiot, you're smarter than that, use better words,\" or something like that. And so that was a good culture check to opt them in or out.\n\nLenny (01:08:05):\nThat is very cool. It circles back to the value of culture and values and being aligned within your company on culture and values. And it's interesting that that's the question you ask, and not something technical or skill-based.\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:08:16):\nYeah. Well, I do all the final interviews. So they've already gone through a skill-based and they've done culture screen already and stuff like that. So this is more of the, here's why you should not work here, that type of conversation basically.\n\nLenny (01:08:30):\nI love that. Next question, what are five SaaS products that you or your company uses that you love? And bonus points for ones maybe people haven't heard,\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:08:39):\nThat's hard to answer too because at the end of the day, we'd all say Zoom, Google Workspace or whatever they're calling it these days because those are the things that are so central. I've got to give a shout-out to Notion, we use Notion for all of our documentation. I use Notion for my personal... all these things. I know Code is a sponsor, so I apologize but-\n\nLenny (01:08:59):\nThey're both sponsors, and so we're friends with everyone over here. Both are great-\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:09:02):\nAmazing. Lenny's Podcast, friends of all products. Descript. I use Descript quite a bit. I use Descript not only for... it's like a video recording and editing tool, or you can bring in video to edit. But it's got some cool features that... I use it more than Loom a lot of times because it just works in my workflow, not only for creating, but also for those quick conversations.\n\n(01:09:25):\nK-Tool. Here's a fun one. This is an indie product, K-Tool. There's probably other products that exist like this, but I actually really like the interface of it, it's super simple. Basically if I'm online or someone sends me a PDF or something like that, I can basically choose to send that to my Kindle. So if someone sends me something I could just choose to send and then I can batch all of those things into a weekly newsletter that I can curate. So my Sundays and my Monday morning are just spent reading. So I have this weekly newsletter of someone wants me to review this thing or someone wants me to read this article or something like that. So I batch that into a little newsletter and it's just a Chrome extension that works really well.\n\n(01:10:03):\nTweet Hunter, I'm trying to be more on Twitter. I went through lulls, so now I'm trying to be consistent. So Tweet Hunter's pretty good. It's got some AI fun stuff into it to make discovery better. And then it's not a SaaS application, but the last one is this Apple Watch Ultra. So I don't carry my phone anymore. I just don't... I found myself being on a computer, walking away with my phone, going, doing stuff and then just never being off-screen. So I have this for when I'm not in front of my computer and I'm this close to also doing it when I travel to when I've been traveling, my phone will stay in my suitcase, but it connects if I need to make a phone call. It connects via Bluetooth, all that kind of stuff. But just trying to take my attention away from my phone basically, so that's, that's been the unlock.\n\nLenny (01:10:51):\nDamn. What a list. That was incredible. I'm going to ask just one more question. What's favorite lesson from your NSA experience that helps you in life day to day?\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:11:02):\nI shouldn't say everything, but most things are more complicated than it seems. And that's not like a sinister thing, it just means when that person's coming at you and super angry about something, whether it's your fault or not, something's there, they're having a bad day, on top of it, you really messed up, you tapped into a particular emotion that you didn't realize you did. Or hey, there's even the story in the news about this politician's bad or something like that. Everything's a lot more complicated, and not in a it's too hard to understand way, it's just you should always caution yourself on believing the first reaction that you have.\n\n(01:11:44):\nAnd I developed that there because there's so many things where... And it was also my first job, so a lot of this stuff happens because it's your first job, many people may have this experience at a different place, but it was like, \"Oh, this geopolitical thing that's happened. Oh, here's my first instinct, that means this is bad.\" They're like, \"Well, actually, there's this other thing going on over here and this other thing going over there, and those are actually connected. That's why this is caused.\" So that's helped me, one, not get so pissed off at the news. That's also helped me, I think just as a human, along with most charitable interpretation, to just be like, \"Okay, let me not overreact here. Let me seek to understand and then react or respond, versus react.\"\n\nLenny (01:12:23):\nWhat a beautiful way to end it. Patrick Campbell, renaissance man of a brain. This may be the most action-packed episode we've had, and I'm not surprised. Two final questions where can folks find you online if they want to ask you questions, reach out, learn more about what you're up to? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:12:38):\nYeah, so I am on Twitter @patticus, childhood nickname, P-A-T-T-I-C-U-S. LinkedIn, Patrick Campbell. I don't check my LinkedIn messages, I'm going to get around to it, it's just there's so much spam in there. But yeah, you could find me there or just pc@patticus.com, that's my personal email. So yeah, if I can be helpful or you want to see more of the data or you have this question or that question, we've probably written or recorded something on some of the things we talked about today, so I'm happy to send it over and just obviously want to be helpful, so yeah, feel free to hit me up.\n\nLenny (01:13:08):\nAmazing. Patrick, thank you again for being here.\n\nPatrick Campbell (01:13:11):\nThanks for having me, man.\n\nLenny (01:13:12):\nBye, everyone.\n\nAudio (01:13:14):\nThank you so much for listening.

This is going to radically transform society. And I think if people don't explore AI properly, it will leave them behind. I'd start with the thing your product does. \"What's the core premise behind it? Why do people use it? What problem does it solve for them?\" That kind of thing. So, go back to basics. And then ask, \"Can AI do that?\" And for a lot, the answer is going to be, \"Yes, it can.\" For some it might be, \"It can partially do it.\" And then, maybe for others, \"It can't do that, at least not yet.\" And then, for some of it'll be replacement, AI would replace, it'll just do it. And, in other places, it'll be augmentation. It'll augment. It'll help people. But yeah, I think that you've got to match your product, and what AI can do, and what it will be able to do, and then ask yourself, \"Okay, what are we going to do?\"\n\nLenny (00:00:52):\nToday my guest is Paul Adams. Paul is chief product officer at Intercom, a role that he's held for over 10 years. Prior to this role, he was global head of brand design at Facebook, a user researcher at Google, a product designer at Dyson, and his first job was an automotive interior designer. In our conversation, Paul shares some amazing stories of failure, including the story of him giving a huge presentation where he froze on stage and had to walk off. And what he learned from these experiences of failure. We then get deep into how to think about AI as a part of your product strategy, including a ton of great examples from Intercom's experience going all in on AI. Paul also shares some of his favorite frameworks, and product lessons, and so much more.\n\n(00:01:34):\nThis is the first recording I've ever done not from my home studio, instead from a hotel room.

Paul, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nPaul Adams (00:04:14):\nThanks, Lenny. Nice to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:15):\nIt's nice to have you here. I've heard so many good things about you from so many different people, so I'm really happy that we're finally doing this. Also, you have an Irish accent, which is always a boost for ratings in my experience, so thank you for bringing that with you here.\n\nPaul Adams (00:04:26):\nYeah, that's nice to hear.\n\nLenny (00:04:28):\nI wanted to start with a couple stories. So the first is your story of giving a keynote at Cannes. Can you share what happened there?\n\nPaul Adams (00:04:38):\nYeah, some things that happened in work are very memorable at the time and they don't really scar you. This goes in the book that have scarred for life. Yeah, it's good. Long story short, I was at Facebook just over a decade ago. Loved it at the time. I think it was a great place to be at the time. And, basically San Francisco, I did a lot of talks for Facebook internally and externally. Facebook had a keynote slot, always had a keynote slot at Cannes, the world's biggest advertising festival. And, the year prior, Zuck had been interviewed. He was the speaker, he'd been interviewed. He'd gotten a hard time on privacy. It didn't go well as well as they'd hoped.\n\n(00:05:14):\nSo, the next year they asked me to do it. Maybe it was the Irish accent that made the offer come my way. And, yeah, I got out and spun a stage, the world's biggest advertising stage. And, I'd say, I was three, four minutes into the talk, a very similar talk when I'd given lots of times. And, I just froze. I couldn't remember what I was supposed to say. It was the first ever time in my life I'd rehearsed the talk word for word. Usually, I have talking points, and things get mixed around, and it's informal. This was media trained, \"Do not say the wrong thing.\" Kind of talk. And I just could not remember what to say. I had some version of a panic attack, walked off-stage, I was still mic'd up, cursed. Everyone started laughing. I was like, \"Geez, are they laughing at me? Oh my God, this is...\"\n\n(00:06:06):\nBut, I managed to turn it around, I walked back out. I'd been disarmed internally in my head. And, the most of it went well. And I was famous that night. Out in Cannes afterwards on whatever the sea front, it's just like rose everywhere. And yeah, I was famous and infamous for my performance.\n\nLenny (00:06:26):\nI feel like you lived the worst nightmare that everybody has when they're thinking about giving a talk. And, I think what's interesting is you survived. And, I think that's a really interesting lesson is you could freeze in front of thousands of people, walk off-stage, and then it works out okay.\n\nPaul Adams (00:06:43):\nYeah. And it all happened organically, I guess, or very naturally. But yeah, ever since then, every time I walk out onto a conference talk stage, still today, I have this tiny doubt in the back of my head. It's never happened since. But yeah, I think you have to go with it with these things, when life throws you these, whatever, curveballs you have got to adapt and it's not that big a deal. None of these things are that big a deal, at the end of the day. You move on and live and learn. So yeah, but I still hope it doesn't happen again.\n\nLenny (00:07:15):\nI also hate public speaking and I always fear this is exactly what's going to happen to me. And so, I think this is nice to hear, that even when the worst possible thing basically happens, things can survive.\n\nPaul Adams (00:07:27):\nYou can turn it around. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:07:29):\nA second area I wanted to hear from is your time at Google. And, there's a couple products you worked on at Google. Both of them were not what you'd call big successes. And then, there's a transition to Facebook, which was also messy. Can you just share a couple stories from that time?\n\nPaul Adams (00:07:45):\nYeah. Similar to the walking on stage thing, you live and learn. And, I was at Google for four years now and I was at Facebook for two and a half years or so. And, in both of those companies, this is at the height of... The social tech wave was at its peak. Google were very afraid of the existential threat posed by Facebook. Facebook were very confident they could pull off some new social advertising unit that would be an AdWords or something like that, that would destroy Google's revenue, eat them from the inside out. And so, being there at the time was fascinating and moving to the new companies. At Google, I worked on a lot of failed social projects, like you mentioned. Google Buzz, Google Ventilator, Google Plus. I think, a lot of the motivation for those projects came from a place of fear. It didn't come from a place of, \"Let's make a great product for people. Let's really understand the things people struggle with when communicating with family and friends. Let's really, really try and create something wonderful.\" It came from a place of fear.\n\n(00:08:47):\nAnd so, during those times, I learned I think how not to lead in places. And by the way, I should say, at the time in Google, there was other things happening that were amazing, like Google were building Google Maps, an incredible product. One of my favorite products. I think one of the best products ever made. They were building Android. I was in the mobile team and the mobile apps team at the time, the Android came out. So, they can make an incredibly good product. So, I just happened to be in the social side, which wasn't as good. And, yeah, Google Buzz is a privacy disaster, and Google Plus is similar.\n\n(00:09:24):\nAnd so, halfway through I'd published research about groups and I'd done a ton of research. An interesting side note there is, at the time, I was working in the UX team as a researcher, I was been asked to do a lot of tactical research, like usability study type stuff, like can people use these products? And, I ended up doing a lot of formative research as well in the same session. So, I'd say to the team, \"Hey, I'll do the research. I'll answer your questions. But also, I'm going to do this other thing, and I'm going to take 20 minutes doing that.\" And so, what we used to do is, what I used to do with people was map out their social network, all the people in it, their family, their friends, how they communicate. We'd map on all the channels, we'd talk about what worked well, what didn't. And, we did this with dozens and dozens of people over the course of maybe 18 months. And the same pattern emerged every single time, which was, people need way better ways to communicate with small groups of family and friends.\n\n(00:10:17):\nAnd I look back now and go like, \"WhatsApp.\" Or it may be iMessage if everyone's on Apple. But, really obvious in hindsight. But at the time, not obvious. And so, we tried to build a product around that called Google Plus. But, again, it came from the wrong place. And so, halfway through, the research that I've done, all this research had been made public through a conference talk. And, Facebook noticed, got in touch, one thing led to another, and I left and joined Facebook, which was an amazing thing for me, personally.\n\n(00:10:51):\nFacebook was an amazing place at the time and exciting. And they were trying to do things for the other reasons, the good reasons. \"Okay, let's build an amazing product for people.\"\n\nLenny (00:11:01):\nAnd this was during Google Plus being built, you basically shifted.\n\nPaul Adams (00:11:04):\nYeah, midway, I'm stressed to even tell you about it. The project hadn't been launched, it was still under wraps. It was highly confidential. Google had done a lot of things at the time that were the first for them. I don't know if they've done them since. But things like, everyone worked in Google Plus was sent to a different building. That building had a different key card. If you didn't work in Google Plus you could not get in. All sorts of counter-cultural things at the time. And, as a result, there was a lot of antagonism internally for Google Plus. And so, when I left in the middle of the project, leaving with all of the plans in my head to the enemy, some people saw me as a traitor, understandably. Other people thought I was enlightened, too fancy you talked to. But it was the right thing for me to do. But at the time, it was a hard thing to do.\n\nLenny (00:11:56):\nI know there's also a lot of scrutiny in what you took with you and the process.\n\nPaul Adams (00:12:01):\nYeah, when I left, Google assumed that I was one of the spies. I was quarantined. I told them I was leaving. They forensically analyzed my laptop, all sorts of stuff like that. So, it was pretty intense. Looking back, I can understand why that happened. But the root cause for me is that the project has been run from a place of competitive fear, which I don't think leads to good things.\n\nLenny (00:12:32):\nSo one of the themes through the stories you just shared is, let's say, failure is... I don't want to make it that harsh, but just things not working out. And, I'm curious as a product leader, how important you think that is for people to go through, if you think that's something that is almost a good thing? And, I guess just is there anything there that you find helpful as a coach, as a mentor, as two people that are trying to become basically you?\n\nPaul Adams (00:12:58):\nVery, very. It still is. It still is. I've personally failed so many times. There are two stories and the Google one is long deep tentacles. They're two stories. I failed a ton of times. I remember, when I was at Facebook I was very happy. And, I knew Eoghan and Des, the co-founders of Intercom. And, they were trying to persuade me to join Intercom. We were like, it was a 10-person company at the time. But, Eoghan said something to me at that time which has stuck with me ever since. He said, \"At Facebook, you can design the product. But at Intercom, you can design the company.\" And, that was extremely appealing to me, a great pitch. He's like, \"Just design the company with us that you want to work in.\"\n\n(00:13:41):\nAnd so, part of that was a company that embraces failure, that says it's okay to try things. I'm a big believer in big bets, high risk, high reward. I don't get as excited about incremental things. No, I haven't said that. There's of course a place for that too, especially as companies get bigger. But, I get excited about big bets. And if you make big bets, you're going to get a lot of it wrong. So a lot of the principles that we built here at Intercom are in building software.\n\n(00:14:09):\nWe have a principle called Ship to Learn. And, we've actually changed it since. It's over on the wall here. Ship fast, ship early, ship often is what it says now. You say Ship to Learn. Ship fast, ship early, ship often. So, in that idea is the idea of failure. It's not going to go right. And, it's going to go wrong more often than not. But if you ship early, and fast, and learn fast, you can change fast, and you can improve fast. And, that's the culture that we, as much as possible, try to embrace and teach people. But it's much easier said than done.\n\nLenny (00:14:43):\nYeah. Especially when you're in the moment like, \"God dammit. Everything's going to fall apart. I really messed this one up.\"\n\nPaul Adams (00:14:48):\nYeah. And there's a trade-off with quality that people really struggle with. We've high standards of ourselves. A lot of Intercom comes from a design founder background. We value the craft a lot. We never want to be embarrassed by what we ship. So there's a real tension there, a real trade-off, where people have these high standards, which we encourage. We encourage them to ship fast, and learn, and make mistakes. It's a constant tension that we're navigating.\n\nLenny (00:15:17):\nSpeaking of taking big bets and going all in, I know there's been a huge shift at Intercom to move towards AI and embrace AI. And so, maybe just to start broadly, I'm curious just what are some of your broader insights or surprises so far in how you've thought about AI and how you think AI will integrate into product and product strategy?\n\nPaul Adams (00:15:39):\nWhat day that ChatGPT launch? November 29th, I think, last year. Ever since that day, I literally wake up every day thinking about AI pretty much. And, I read as much as possible and still feel like I'm way behind in it. I think, for me, when I talk to you about AI, people typically fall into one of two camps. You're either all in, really truly all in. This is a meteor coming towards you. This is bigger than mobile as a technology shift, as big as the internet. Maybe it's bigger than the internet itself as a technology shift, the way it'll shape society. So I'm all in. I've gone over the hill or whatever. I'm over the other side. And so, there's people in that camp.\n\n(00:16:23):\nAnd then, I think there's people in another camp, which is, \"I've heard this before. It's hype. Last year was crypto. It was Web3. None of those things worked out. There was the metaverse.\" So, there's definitely I think a lot of skepticism or maybe cynicism around it. And I don't understand why. The other things didn't really pan out. The metaverse is coming back. And, I'm trying to remember, there's the law where you have the hype, and then the trough of disillusionment, and then you come out the other side.\n\nLenny (00:16:54):\nYeah, that little curve.\n\nPaul Adams (00:16:55):\nYeah. And I think that's where a lot of people might be, where there was so much hype, it was so noisy, and still is a little bit so noisy that you tune it out a little bit. And, I think, some people have fallen into that camp. I'm all in in the other camp. This is going to radically transform society and it blows my mind even seeing new types of things that come out, like ChatGPT Vision just came out recently, and just seeing the things that people can do with it. And we're just scratching the surface still. So, we're all in, for sure.\n\nLenny (00:17:31):\nAwesome. I want to unpack that. But, I think there's also this camp of people that like, \"Yes, something big is happening. I just don't have the time to understand, to build, to play around.\" What have you found and/or what advice would you share to people that are just like, \"I want to go deeper down this rabbit hole. I just don't know where to start, because I have so much work to do already and this isn't a side thing.\"\n\nPaul Adams (00:17:53):\nThe advice I have for people, and the advice I have for myself, I'm in that too, I wake up every day to too many emails, and Slack chats, and people knocking on my door, and my desk, and all things. So, this is a challenge for me too. You just have to take the time. There's just no other way for me. And that to me doesn't mean... It's about priorities. It doesn't mean that you need to work crazy hours. I don't believe in working crazy hours. I don't know what hours I work. I don't know, 50 hours a week maybe. I think, beyond that, you start to make bad decisions and things like that. You get tired. And you need to live the rest of your life. You got to put it into your day. Whether that's setting aside dedicated time to read.\n\n(00:18:33):\nReading is the thing. You got to read. You got to stay up to date, and you got to play with things, and try things. If you don't have ChatGPT... If you don't have a... I can't remember if it's a pro licenser, whatever, but if you haven't upgraded to get access to things like GPT for Vision, where you can take photos and you have the mobile app. And I was going out for dinner last Friday night with my wife. I try not to take work to dinner with my wife. But, I wanted to try it. And, I took some photos of her food. And, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff, like tell you how healthy the meal is or whatever.\n\nLenny (00:19:07):\nOh, wow.\n\nPaul Adams (00:19:07):\nAnyway. You got to try it. You just got to try it. So, my advice people is, you've got to try it. You've got to set aside the time, or it'll pass you by. It does remind me the mobile wave about a decade ago. Again, I was at Google at the time, I was working on the mobile team. So I guess, it was my job to stay on top of things. But, at that time, some companies like Facebook went all in on it, maybe a bit late, but they eventually made the brave decision. I think if people don't explore AI properly, it will leave them behind.\n\nLenny (00:19:38):\nIt reminds me, I think, at Facebook, Zuck, and also Airbnb, Brian did this, is he said, \"Any mocks you show me for new product designs have to be in a mobile app or on a mobile web. They can no longer be desktop for now.\"\n\nPaul Adams (00:19:50):\nRight. Yeah. Same with Facebook. Yeah, that's right.\n\nLenny (00:19:54):\nI guess, do you think that that's the way to approach this is as a leader, just, \"Everything you bring me needs to have some AI component.\" That sounds probably not like a good idea, but is there something that you're thinking about, or have done of just convincing people this is where you want to spend your time?\n\nPaul Adams (00:20:05):\nYeah, it's harder, for sure. It's harder, because-\n\nLenny (00:20:08):\nYou don't want to force it.\n\nPaul Adams (00:20:09):\n... Yeah, a lot of the tech is invisible. We have a machine learning team we've had on here for a long time, so we've been working in this space for quite some time. But, it's funny, even if you go back 18 months, I think if I was on your podcast 18 months ago and you said to me like, \"Hey, what do you think about AI?\" I would've said something like, \"It's not real. Machine learning's real, let's talk about that.\" So, things change, and my perception of it's changed. But a lot of the improvements are behind the scenes. They're with large language models or different types of things people are building in the background of infrastructure.\n\n(00:20:43):\nSo I don't know what it looks like to design mobile mock-ups that are AI mock-ups. But I do think that people need to start really thinking strategically. Maybe it's just not a mock-up stage, but start to think really strategically about their product and whether it's in the line of the media, or it's coming or not. It's not everything is. And if so, for some I think they require a foundational strategic change. Others, it might be less so. But, I think that's actually the head space that I think people need to be in.\n\nLenny (00:21:17):\nCan you impact that further? What does that look like to really think deeply about whether your product is in the way of the meteor?\n\nPaul Adams (00:21:25):\nYou can get sidetracked by the technology, for sure. And I do. I just mentioned, hey, going out for dinner and taking a photo of my food. You can get sidetracked by the tech and some of it's really cool. I wouldn't start there. I'd start with the thing your product does. What's the core premise behind it? Why do people use it? What problem does it solve for them? That kind of thing. And then, ask the question. So go back to basics. \"Okay, what is my product for? And why do people love it?' And then ask, \"Can AI do that?\" And for a lot the answer's going to be, \"Yes, it can.\" For some, it might be, \"It can partially do it.\" And then, maybe for others, \"It can't do that, at least not yet.\"\n\n(00:22:07):\nSo you're going to need to map what your product does against what AI can do. And AI can do a lot. It can write. I'll give you a list. It can write, it can summarize, it can summarize text, it can write text, it can answer queries, it can find facts, it can scan text, it can scan images. It can listen to your voice and repeat it. It can take actions. That's the next big thing coming. It can take actions, actually do things. It could like, I mean, \"Hey AI. Whatever the AI is called. \"Change my flight to Tuesday.\" Right? It can do things like that.\n\n(00:22:46):\nAnd so, it can do a lot of things. It can build rules. So, I think any product that has any workflow in it, which is almost all B2B SaaS products, any product that has multimedia in it, they're in the media line or whatever. I don't don't know if this metaphor is working. But, the media is coming and they're in its path. And so, for a lot of these products that you just need to look at what AI can do. And then, for some of it'll be replacement. AI would replace, it'll just do it. And, in other places it'll be augmentation. It'll augment. It'll help people as the copilot ideas that are going around. But yeah, I think that you've got to map your product, and what AI can do, and what it will be able to do, and then ask yourself, \"Okay, what are we going to do?\"\n\nLenny (00:23:33):\nIs there an example of that at Intercom or a different company of, \"Here's a problem we're trying to solve? Oh, AI can actually do this fully for us.\"\n\nPaul Adams (00:23:40):\nOh, yeah. I'll give you Intercom first. Again, this date, I think it was November 29th, etched in our head. We have Fergal who was our head of machine learning. And, Fergal just turns around that day and he's like... Okay, I think he tweeted something actually. He had a tweet that day that was like, \"This is it. This is the time. This is the moment. This is the before after.\" I actually often talk about people... because this is a framework I have, before, after moments. This is a before after moment. That was before. And that is after. And everything has changed. So, we literally ripped up our strategy almost entirely, and started again, from first principles and said, \"Okay, why do people use Intercom?\" Intercom is a customer support product. And then, very soon after that, Sam Altman, who's the founder and head of OpenAI, said, \"Hey, one of the first industries that's going to be disrupted is customer service.\" We're like, \"Yep.\"\n\n(00:24:35):\nSo we did. We totally changed how we think, how we work, and we just went heads down and built a product called Fin. We built other things first actually. Fin came later, now that I think about it. But we went all in on it. It was a little bit of a bet the farm mindset. So we've done it. I think other companies like Google and Bard have to do it, and maybe they're a little bit slow, but it's so early in this tech cycle that, I think, they're fine. So yeah, we did. It was hard, but we had to do it.\n\nLenny (00:25:13):\nCan you share briefly what Finn is just for folks that aren't familiar?\n\nPaul Adams (00:25:16):\nFin, first and foremost, is an AI chatbot. So, if you think about customer service, people have questions for a business, and historically, that was mostly email, and phone, and mostly ticketing based. You'd file a ticket, a lot of do not reply email, and so on. And then, came along conversational customer support, which is just basic messaging, like WhatsApp or iMessage, like I mentioned earlier. Now, there's bot first experiences and Fin is an AI chatbot, AI first, chatbot first. So the first line of defense for a customer support team is Finn, not a person. And so, it fundamentally changes. The results we've seen with Fin are mind blowing. Our biggest challenge is actually trying to help customer support teams think about organizational change.\n\n(00:26:05):\nThe tech is way ahead. It's actually people wrapping their heads around what this means for the role, the teams, loads of cool stuff, like new types of jobs for people, like conversation designers, a job we have where you design the conversations that Fin does or managers. So anyway, that's what Fin is. Fin has expanded. So, Fin is now also in our Intercom inbox. They've placed a people answer queries, customers support queries, and now Fin's in there too, helping the support reps. Suggesting answers for them to use, or helping them rephrase things. So, it's now augmenting people as well as answering questions by itself.\n\nLenny (00:26:46):\nI think you're one of the few companies that has pivoted fully into AI. And, I think there's a lot of lessons here about how team structures might change, product strategy, priorities, things like that. So I'm curious just to unpack a couple more things here. First of all, what impact have you seen after going all in and going in this direction?\n\nPaul Adams (00:27:05):\nIt's very early, honestly, to be able to answer that properly. And it depends what you measure as success. So, again, there's a lot of hype and buzz with AI. So, if you're measuring it by interest, it's a huge success. Our target customer is customer support. Our customer support manager leader. And so, they're very curious. They're like, \"Does it actually work?\" Again, back to the earlier thing of there's so much hype, there's a bit of skepticism around it. \"Does it actually work? Is it as good as a person?\" And in customer support, people who tend to work in that role are typically very high empathy, care a lot about people. And so, they're like, \"But is it as good as a person? Is it nice, friendly? Does it understand humanity?\" And so, a lot of curiosity, and a lot of interests, and a lot of people trying it.\n\n(00:27:57):\nWe have some customers who are hugely successful with it. They can answer up to 50, 60, 70% of their inbound questions with Fin. So we've some customers who see huge success. But it's early. And so, has it transformed our business financially? Not yet. I think, all fast-growing startups... If you think of AI Intercom as, I guess, a new startup, even though we're 900 people, the growth curve, you're looking for this exponential curve, as opposed to big public company linear growth curve. With the exponential one, it takes a while. The first year or two years is the bottom of that. And so, I think we're still in the trying to figure out exactly what's going on, trying to talk to educate people. But, we have enough evidence to believe it's the future for sure.\n\nLenny (00:28:53):\nAre there any examples of either this product or other instances of AI just blowing your mind where you're just like, \"Wow, I never imagined it would be this good\"?\n\nPaul Adams (00:29:02):\nI go back to that before after thing. So, the first version of ChatGPT was a before, after, where we we've been working, like I said, in this space, we've had a machine learning team for a long time. The way our machine learning thing worked before ChatGPT was that there was not a manual setup. A customer support manager would have to orchestrate the bot, and teach it what to say, and just a lot of orchestration, a lot of teaching it. And then, ChatGPT showed up and it's like, \"Oh, it can do it by itself.\" It gets it wrong sometimes. So, do people get the question wrong too? It's as good as a person nearly for a lot of these basic things. So that blew my mind. And then, that was, \"Oh, it can answer questions.\" But then, you're like, it can reason.\n\n(00:29:45):\nThere's actually a debate about whether is this reasoning or deduction. But, it can work things out. And, I'm not one for going down into these really philosophical things. I'm like, \"We just need to build. Let's go back, build the product.\" Or whatever. But it can work things out. And that blew my mind. And, we fed ChatGPT and other companies too, we played with other LLMs, like Entropik and so on, it can work things out. And that was mind-blowing. Then you can see it doing things, like writing code. And I was like, \"Wow, it's really good at writing code. What does that mean?\" And then, you start thinking, here at Intercom we have a one to five ratio. So a PM has about five engineers on a team. And you're looking at this thing writing code and you're like, \"What happens next? Do we need as many engineers or will their role change? And they'll start doing different types of things like reviewing code instead of writing code?\"\n\n(00:30:41):\nSo that blew my mind. And then, the visual stuff, like I mentioned earlier, I think the visual thing was bigger than the original one. It can parse imagery, and it can help you see the world. You take a photo of your bike and say, \"Hey, what's wrong?\" And It'll tell you what's wrong, how to fix it. You can be traveling, take photos of stuff. It's in a different language. It's etched in stone on a 12th century cathedral. You're like, \"What does that say?\" And it'll tell you what it says. It's just like how to do that. This is what I'm actually repeating most to people these days, here in Ireland, if you want to be a radiologist, so study X-rays and tell people what's wrong, and so on, and forth, it's seven years training to learn that skill. So, seven years to be a radiologist, and then you're just into the job. AI, it seems it's already better at it. So, it's already better at it, and it can ingest every X-ray ever made. No human can ever read, and think about, and synthesize every X-ray ever made.\n\n(00:31:45):\nSo, of course it's better. And then, you're like, \"Okay, what happens now?\" I guess, the whole job changes. Radiologists will not take x-ray. Well, I guess they might take them. But, they won't analyze them, for sure. They'll look at what AI says, check that it's right, and then it's bedside manner time. Tell the patient, maybe tell them what course. So the job just fundamentally changes. And by the way, that could be amazing. Here in Ireland, we have long queues for hospitals, epic waiting lists for people getting X-rays. So, this is a really good thing possibly for people. Here's the craziest one I have. AI can listen to your voice and copy it, so it can say things and it sounds exactly like you and it's really, really good. Almost in distinguishable. You're like, \"That sounds like Paul.\" And so, I mentioned the Metaverse earlier. I don't know if you saw Zuck talks to Lex [inaudible 00:32:35]. See that?\n\nLenny (00:32:35):\nYep.\n\nPaul Adams (00:32:35):\nSo that was my first, \"Oh.\" For people who haven't seen it, they met in the Metaverse, I think, or some virtual world.\n\nLenny (00:32:42):\nIt was a black room.\n\nPaul Adams (00:32:44):\nIn a black room. Yeah. And, the tech has come on so they can analyze your face and build a 3D model. It's really good, really, really close. So, you can imagine, that's going to get better. Based on the trajectory of that technology, it's going to get better. And so, the voice thing and the face thing means both of those things are almost indistinguishable from a real person. And, AI will be able to ingest all the things people say and do. And, when people die, it'll be able to replicate that person. And so, there's an afterlife, hey, your parent dies and you can still talk to them. And, that could be the weirdest thing. Maybe it's not good for people. I don't know. But, that tech is just around the corner. And the AI can answer your questions, mind-blowing. It's mind-blowing.\n\nLenny (00:33:35):\nThere's actually a Black Mirror episode with that same premise, where-\n\nPaul Adams (00:33:38):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:33:39):\n... Yeah. And I don't think it ended well.\n\nPaul Adams (00:33:41):\nNo.\n\nLenny (00:33:43):\nBe careful.\n\nPaul Adams (00:33:44):\nFor sure. For sure. Yeah, I think, the [inaudible 00:33:48] and the voice translation thing is another one. I can't remember. Maybe it's in Mission Impossible, where it can take a voice, translate it, and translate it in real-time. And this tech is, again, just here, where if I was a native Spanish speaker and couldn't speak English, you and I could still have this podcast. Your voice would be translated in Spanish in real-time for me. It's, again, mind-blowing.\n\nLenny (00:34:10):\nWe're actually working on dubbing/translating podcast episodes, which is all done through AI, where it figures out what you're saying, makes it Spanish, and then also changes your lips to match. And, we're trying to launch a couple of those. And that's actually very AI-based. Yeah.\n\nPaul Adams (00:34:25):\nThat's cool. That's really cool.\n\nLenny (00:34:27):\nYou mentioned that your ENG team might change your thinking, because AI can make them much more efficient and work differently. I'm curious what you've seen actually change on your team, either using AI-ish tools, or just building AI products. What do you think is most different? And I'm curious from the perspective of a team that's trying to think about integrating AI and starting to lean into AI, what have you seen most change and should change?\n\nPaul Adams (00:34:52):\nUltimately, you need really great machine learning engineers. That's where it starts. And if you don't have that, then you're going to find it hard to build truly, really, truly great things. So, what OpenAI provide, and what Entropik provide, and Claude, they provide an amazing technology, but you got to build on top of it. If you really want something brilliant, you got to build on top of it. So, we adapted what they build for customer support. Maybe someday we need to go build our own LLM that's just for customer support. Maybe. I don't know where that will all go. And maybe everyone will have their own LLM for every single business. I don't really know, to be honest. Maybe these companies will provide specialized LLMs. But anyway, that's the first thing. And, of course, these people are in high demand. So, you need to invest in building out that function, I think. Really invest in building out the function.\n\n(00:35:46):\nSo that's what we've been doing. Our ML team's way bigger than it was and way bigger than it ever has been at Intercom. And then, it forks. So, some projects are very heavy on that ML team and it needs them. But other projects are more front end, like the inbox stuff I mentioned earlier, where we have Fin and Fin is working, we've built the underlying technology. Now it's a question of if you have a human support person answering questions in the inbox, that's a natural chat conversational interface, pretty straightforward. What happens when there's now an AI assistant in there? How do they talk? And what do they do? And when do they interject? And how do you represent that in the user experience that feels natural? So that's a really hard design problem.\n\n(00:36:32):\nSo, saying back into like, okay, we've a product team that's a product manager, a product designer, maybe three, four, maybe five engineers, and they're getting help from the machine learning team. So, we now have both setups. And increasingly, we can do more with the latter, more teams who can build on the foundational technology that we've been building over the last 12 months or so. So that's one thing. I think a second thing that comes to mind is not to think about it as bolted on. I think some people are still in that camp.\n\n(00:37:08):\nAgain, I'll go back to the mobile thing. There's just so many direct parallels with it. Like I said earlier, at Google, I worked in the mobile apps team. I worked on mobile Gmail, mobile docs, and it was the mobile team. And we were in London. We're like, \"Hey, we're the mobile team in London.\" And meanwhile, over in Mountainview in California, no one cared. It's was like, \"You're 20 people. We're 200. No one uses this stuff on a phone.\" And again, a lot of skepticism. \"No one's going to write docs on the phone. Seriously? They're going to write a full document on a phone, are you crazy?\" So, don't do that. We're trying not to do that. Don't bolt it on. Don't be like, \"Oh, we'll have a bunch of AI people...\" And we do have some specialists. But generally speaking, we're trying to have everyone learn about it.\n\nLenny (00:37:57):\nInteresting. So, I'm curious just specifically what that looks like, don't bolt it on. The idea there is don't just have a site team that's like, \"They're the AI team. They're going to add AI to all this stuff.\" You're finding and lesson is integrated into every product team.\n\nPaul Adams (00:38:10):\nAnd we're still early there. We're still early. So, what we're trying not to do is have the AI inbox team, and they're the only people who work on AI features in the inbox. I think it's much better to have everyone learn about it. By the way, I'm a big believer in generalists, a big, big believer in... I guess, my background is jack of all trades master of none. That's probably how I describe myself. I've worked as a researcher, designer, PM. And so, I believe in generalists, and so I believe in setting teams up that way. And, yes, specialists matters at times. Machine learning for sure is a deep specialism. And in Intercom, we generally, in engineering too, much prefer people who learn new things, whether it's a new coding language, or framework, or how to design AI interfaces, or whatever, get more people being able to do it.\n\nLenny (00:39:05):\nI feel like, again, your company is a little bit of living in the future, where a lot of companies are going to get to once they realize, \"Oh shit. We really need to get big here.\" Or they're already working on it. I'm curious if there's other maybe pitfalls you ran into that you think people should try to avoid and something you could share there, or just any other lessons about making this transition that you think might be useful to other people.\n\nPaul Adams (00:39:27):\nYeah, what I've mentioned so far, don't bolt it on. Stay up-to-date. I mentioned earlier, read, read. I feel like I'm behind all the time. It's moving so fast.\n\nLenny (00:39:36):\nWhat are you reading? What do you find is most interesting and informative for reading about what's happening in AI?\n\nPaul Adams (00:39:42):\nI'd love to tell you that it's incredibly structured. I have a great reading list that I got to read every Sunday morning. It's pretty random. I'm on Twitter, which is now called X, of course, a lot. I follow some people on Twitter. I actually use the recommended feed in Twitter a lot. I think, because I interact and look at a lot of AI, I get to see a lot more. So I do that and I do it deliberately to try and generate more stuff. I'll search Twitter as well. There's loads of cool stuff there. There's some newsletters as well and some people I follow.\n\nLenny (00:40:12):\nAny newsletters you could call out that you think are most interesting?\n\nPaul Adams (00:40:16):\nYeah, Matt Rickard is one guy who talks a lot about AI. The blogs of companies too. OpenAI have a pretty good blog, and they write papers, and summarize them.\n\nLenny (00:40:27):\nCool. If there's any other ones you think of, either people on Twitter to follow or newsletters, email me after, and then we'll add them to the show notes.\n\nPaul Adams (00:40:34):\nYeah, perfect. Yeah, yeah, there definitely is. I'll dig them out. Your question earlier, how do you do it? You just try. Try book out half an hour and just go deep for half an hour, and then bookmark a few things, come back to them. Like everyone, you could be so busy, so many distractions, you just got to have to set aside time.\n\nLenny (00:40:50):\nAre there any other tools or apps that you find really helpful? Sounds like ChatGPT is at the center of how you play around with it. Is there anything else that you find really interesting?\n\nPaul Adams (00:40:59):\nI'll try other things like Bard. For example, Bard is Google's AI search engine. Rewind is another fascinating company. I think it's rewind.ai. Rewind is basically augmented AI for your memory. So, install it on your local machine, and it captures everything, and remembers everything. It's all local, so there's no privacy issues. And, you got to try these things to understand whether it's any good, or useful, or where's the boundaries, and how does it work, and so on. So, I'm a believer in that type of thing.\n\nLenny (00:41:35):\nThis episode is brought to you by HelpBar by Chameleon, the free in-app universal search solution built for SaaS.

When you started rolling out AI and leaning into this direction, did you run into any big challenges or hurdles organizationally, or personal interests, or opinions? I don't know. Is there anything you ran into that was a big stumbling block and something you had to get over?\n\nPaul Adams (00:43:00):\nYeah, Intercom is full of diverse opinions about things. And, I think with AI, I'm all in. I'm leaning forward. The media is coming. I'm sold. I'm way past that point. Also, no one knows. No one knows. And so, a lot of the time, when we talk internally, the strong buy-in from Eoghan, our co-founder and CEO, Des co-founder, like me, like a lot of the senior leadership team we're in all in camp. And so, that helps a lot. Of course, if you're senior leadership team in the company are all in, of course, then it trickles down. But equally, some of the hurdles have been like, \"Why are you all in?\" And I'm like, \"An educated guess. A hunch.\"\n\n(00:43:51):\nThe part of business strategy and product strategy that, it's just hard. It's like taste. People talk about product taste, \"Who has product taste?\" And a lot of it is, it's judgment based on experience. That's all I can say. I don't know. For me, personally, I don't know, I lived through the mobile thing pretty closely, having worked at Google on mobile. I lived through that phase. So, I can see the same type of thing happening now with bigger. So I'm using that experience to go all in.\n\n(00:44:23):\nBut it's a challenge for some people, because they don't have that context, or they disagree with it. We have a lot of debate here about the future. Fergal, I mentioned earlier, gave myself and a few other product leaders and Des he gave us a... I don't know, is it a pitch or what? A play? I don't know, about how maybe all of our roadmap with AI is wrong. I don't know if you are familiar with the Horizons framework of Horizon 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLenny (00:44:54):\nMm-hmm. Yeah. Amazon.\n\nPaul Adams (00:44:56):\nYeah. So, Horizon 1 is the medium short to medium term, next 12 months, 12 to 18 months. Horizon 2 being like, \"Hey, what's happening?\" Whatever, 18 to 36 months out. Or, I think, people use different timeframes, different Horizons. Anyway. We're in Horizon 1 land. We're like, \"Yeah, and the next year we're going to do this.\" And he's like, \"Yeah, but two years from now, if this path plays out, everything we're doing now is going to be irrelevant and useless.\" And you're like, \"Oh, okay.\" And so, those discussions happen. And, the level of ambiguity is off the charts. So, a lot of the challenges have been navigating that ambiguity and helping people get the conviction I have without drying out voices of alternative voices and opinions, which are often valid too.\n\nLenny (00:45:53):\nWhat does help people get that conviction? Is it just showing them examples of, \"Here's something.\" \"Wow, look at this thing. This is unreal.\" And, I think, partly what helps, I imagine, is the market you're in seems like such a clear opportunity for AI, feels like an easier pitch than maybe a lot of other markets.\n\nPaul Adams (00:46:09):\nYeah, that's true. For sure. That's true. Yeah, showing people is definitely the easiest way. I think customer support is definitely... Like I said, [inaudible 00:46:20], number one, customer support. So you're like, \"Okay, I guess we should adapt.\" Adapt or die is our mantra. Adapt or die. I think that there are other industries where they're on the same journey, it's just not as obvious. So for example, reporting software, Tableau or any reporting product, how do they work? Well, they're the typical read, write app, build dashboards, filtering, querying, hardcore querying, query database, get some numbers, show it in a UI. A lot of thought and care goes into how you present that data to people. The different types of charts that are appropriate help people make good decisions ultimately.\n\n(00:47:04):\nI think, again, this is hand wave, who knows. Maybe that's all done dead now. And, the reporting product of the future is just a box, and the box just goes to the database, and the box is just, \"Who was our best salesman last year January? Okay. Who was our top performing representative in January? Lenny.\" The report product to the future might look like that. And so, project management tools is another one. There's a bunch of products that I think are just outside the most obvious customer support one. And yet, equally ripe for a newcomer to come with a completely different paradigm and potentially take over.\n\nLenny (00:47:45):\nI like that this connects back to your very first point about trying to think about where AI integrates is. Think about what problem are you solving as a company. For example, Tableau, helping people visualize data. And then, the question is, can AI just do this for you? And in that case, oh, and maybe you can. And that gives you basically a whole strategy of like, \"Okay, how do we actually do that with AI?\"\n\nPaul Adams (00:48:06):\nYeah. And, I don't know if the reporting thing will play out that way. But, if you're a Tableau type company, you've tons of designers who design dashboards, and filters, and querying type workflow. What do they do? The UI is the box. So, it's really hard to get into your head like, \"We must...\" If you have conviction that we must change really hard.\n\nLenny (00:48:33):\nMaybe one last question here. For team members learning and starting to work within this realm, is there anything you find helpful to get them ramped up, other than the advice you've already shared, which is just read a lot of stuff, watch Twitter/X, subscribe to these newsletters, and then just try it?\n\nPaul Adams (00:48:49):\nI also try and read things that say it's all a load of crap. So, it's very easy... I've been guilty of this many times. Back to the mistakes you've made. I've been guilty of this many times, where I've jumped on a bandwagon and it was all wrong. And the older I get... The Web3 thing, I'm like, \"I don't even know what Web3 is.\" Crypto, I never bought crypto. Maybe I'm wrong about that. But, I'm not a bandwagon jumper. But, maybe might've been when I was earlier. And I try these days to read the alternative opinion. People who are skeptical or think it's bad. A lot of people think this is terrible for humanity. This technology is going to eat us alive. So, I try and balance my optimism. I'm a delusively optimistic thinker, so I try and balance that with a negativity, I guess.\n\nLenny (00:49:50):\nThat's really good advice.\n\nPaul Adams (00:49:51):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:49:52):\nIs there anything else in this realm that you think might be useful to share before we shift to a different topic?\n\nPaul Adams (00:49:58):\nOh, yeah. The other thing is, don't be afraid. I think people are a bit afraid of it. And, for example, if I started walking around our office here saying, \"Hey, I think we need two engineers per team going forward.\" That's probably not really a good idea to do that. And I think in reality that's not going to be how it plays out. I just feel like there's loads of great studies over the years about how people don't end up losing jobs, the jobs get moved around. And also, for customer support, for example, it's a high attrition job. So, people saying, \"Hey, everyone's going to lose their job. A bot's going to take over.\" It's like, maybe some of that will happen. But probably to attrition, as in someone quit and just didn't get back-filled. So, the doomsday scenarios that I don't think would play out as much. But, for sure, it's easy to be afraid of it. And, I think you have to lean into it.\n\nLenny (00:50:54):\nI love that. Okay, I want to chat about frameworks. You have a lot of interesting frameworks you've put out there. So, maybe we do a rapid fire through a number of frameworks that you've worked with and find useful. And, you actually mentioned this before and after, which I hadn't heard about. What's the general idea to that concept?\n\nPaul Adams (00:51:14):\nBefore, after is literally that simple, I think. We've a rebrand at the moment happening, and that'll be a before, after moment. We're redesigning our pricing. And then, the day that pricing goes live, that would be a before, after, because nothing's the same. And so, we need to go back out and talk to people again. I'm a big believer in talking. You got to talk to customers, it's the only way. You've got to talk, talk, talk, learn, learn, learn. Don't take with the safe face value, go deeper. And so, a lot of these before, after moments, once you've passed, yeah, into the after you got to start learning, \"Were we right? Were we wrong? What happened? What do people think?\"\n\nLenny (00:51:54):\nCan you talk more about this pricing learning/mistake you shared? What do you think you did wrong? What happened there?\n\nPaul Adams (00:52:00):\nWe had a principle called align price to value. By the way, I think, pricing is incredibly difficult. A lot of the design team who work in pricing here, I say to them, it's one of the hardest design problems I know. I think onboarding is another one. Onboarding people into a product is also. People are like, \"Oh hey, you just design a few steps and it's pretty easy. People will follow the steps.\" Again, deceptively difficult to design great onboarding.\n\n(00:52:30):\nSo, I think pricing is deceptively difficult. But we had a principle around allowing price to value. People should pay based on the amount of value they get in the product, easy to say and incredibly hard to do. Value is subjective. The price, for some person they get 10 units of value. I think that's about $5. Someone else is like, \"I'd pay $5,000 for those 10 units of value.\" So, the biggest mistake was a lot of mistakes compounded. And, this is an area where I think we were risk averse. We've ended up with too many pricing models. We've built on top of old competitive mistakes. And, it took a brave decision to say, \"We're going to start again.\"\n\nLenny (00:53:18):\nWow, this feels like it could be a solo episode, just talking through your pricing lessons and journey. Maybe just is there a nugget of wisdom you could share for someone that's trying to think about pricing right now based on your experience?\n\nPaul Adams (00:53:31):\nNumber one thing I would say is keep it simple. Keep it simple. It's so tempting to... With us, for example, a lot of SaaS products have add-ons, where you're like, \"Hey, we built X and that's 10 bucks.\" Or 100,000, depends on what product you're selling. \"We built X and that's the price of X. Hey, we've just built Y. Y is awesome and it's a new thing you can do, and it unlocks all these new capabilities. People shouldn't get that for free, because it's a new thing that didn't have. So let's charge more for Y, but that doesn't really work with the other... Okay, let's look at an add-on. Oh yeah, cool. People just add on.\" But then, later, now you've got people who have the add-on, and people who don't, and then you're like, \"Add another thing.\" And so, we've added tiers, with products, tears, add-ons, tearing in the add-on. Oh my god. People can't understand their bill. So, my advice is keep it simple. Fight so hard to resist the temptation to add extra ways in which you price.\n\nLenny (00:54:43):\nAmazing. I didn't think about going into this topic, but I'm glad that we touched on it.\n\nPaul Adams (00:54:49):\nThink I was talking about scars for life earlier. That's another scar for life.\n\nLenny (00:54:54):\nAll right. Let's keep talking about some frameworks. Another that I found that I loved is something that you call differentiation versus table stakes. What's that about?\n\nPaul Adams (00:55:03):\nIt's like the Kano model, if you're familiar with that. But, it's very simple. I guess, we took the Kano model and just tried to make this really crazy simple version of it. Again, I'm a little bit allergic to things like this. I even hate myself for bringing up the Kano model. I'm allergic to people over intellectualizing frameworks. And like, \"Oh, well if you've seen the new different law...\" Of whatever. I'm like, \"Keep things simple, practical, and pragmatic. And then, let's all, again, go back to work and start building the product, so that customers can benefit, because that's actually all that matters.\" And so, difference versus table stakes, very simple. I think people who adopt a product, or buy a product, or switch to a product, there's two driving forces. One is the attraction of the new solution, and that's basically differentiation. So what's different and better? But critically, what's different and better in ways that customers care about?\n\n(00:56:00):\nAgain, back to all the failed projects, my lesson for a lot of these was, we were different and better in these Google projects in ways people didn't care about. All sorts of Google projects, like Google Wave was an amazingly innovative product that no one really cared about. So, be different and better in ways people care about. So that's the attraction that's like, \"Oh, I want to check out that. That looks cool. I want to check that out. That looks better than what I have today.\" But, on the other side, there's a entry requirement or table stakes. To play the game, you got to have a certain amount of things. And so, they're table stake features. They're often very boring. They're real basic stuff, boring stuff, and easy to ignore, and easy to not build.\n\n(00:56:44):\nAnd again, a mistake with Intercom maybe over the years is that we were much more attracted to the differentiation and built a lot of that. So we went through different iterations of our roadmap, sometimes changing over the course of a year or two, where we were all the differentiation to realize that everyone loved it and really wanted to buy, but they couldn't, because we didn't have the basic report that they needed or we didn't have the basic permission feature that they needed. And then, the robot is built based on those... Trading off why do we need more differentiation or trading off why do we need to invest more table stakes? And so, these days, the basic Intercom today is we're 50/50 probably in terms of resources, but it has swung 70/30 in both directions at times.\n\n(00:57:26):\nThe last piece about it is, I think it's really powerful to look at a roadmap or look at a proposed roadmap and ask yourself, which of these do things matters more to us, not to us actually to our customers right now? The other thing that we've talked a lot about here internally is if you're a startup and you're entering any established category, customer support for us, big established category, massive, a lot of table stakes, built up over years, decades. ServiceNow, Service Cloud, Salesforce, Zendesk, decades of table stake feature building. So to play the game, you need a lot of the table stakes, unless you have incredible differentiation. So from the early years of Intercom, people just buy us alongside Service Cloud or Zendesk. They just buy us alongside. They're like, \"This Intercom thing...\" We were like first modern messaging and modern UX. They were like, \"We want that for our customers, alongside the big giant bag of table stakes.\" Because Intercom doesn't have any of those.\n\n(00:58:26):\nThen over the years, we've built the table stakes to a point where, okay, now we can fully play the game and people can switch, so they can swap Zendesk for Intercom. But it took us years to get there. And then hence, if you're a startup, you need to invest a lot more in differentiation. And then, over the years, I think you start to balance the books a bit.\n\nLenny (00:58:47):\nI think what's interesting about this is one, it just gives you a way to think about looking at your roadmap. How much are we actually doing? And are we doing too much table stakes? Are we doing too much differentiation? So it gives you a awareness of what's happening. And I think, it's an interesting strategy as a startup like, \"Do we spend years doing table stakes and then launch? Or is it go the way Intercom went, like differentiate first we'll build everything else later?\" Wonder when it makes sense to go one or the other.\n\nPaul Adams (00:59:13):\nYeah. And it probably depends on the market, different categories, and all sorts of things. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:59:20):\nYeah. Awesome. Okay. The next framework is something that you call swinging the pendulum. What is that about?\n\nPaul Adams (00:59:28):\nI actually mentioned an example a bit earlier. Differentiation in table stakes was swinging the pendulum. So, swinging the pendulum means, you take a step back from everyday work life, and you make the observation that something's in an undesirable state. So, maybe it's, \"Whoa, we've all the differentiation in the world, but people can't adopt the product, because we've never built any of these table stakes. It's undesirable.\" Or, \"Oh, we've now built all these table stakes and we've not been investing in differentiation. And actually, we're not that attractive to people, because switching product is a pain. And we're not just attractive to people. Okay, so this undesirable state.\"\n\n(01:00:08):\nAnd then, so you go and fix it, but the temptation is that you over-correct. And we've done this so many times in so many domains, everything from, \"Okay, we don't have enough differentiation.\" A year later, \"Oh, wait a minute, we're missing all the table stakes. Okay, we're over there.\" So, product building is one, people is another one. Building out teams and people. Another big one was, I don't know, maybe five years into Intercom, we were on this high growth trajectory, really good classic startup before our pricing problems. And, we looked around and said, \"None of us have done this before. I don't think that's good. Undesirable state. Do we even know what we're doing? We're just a bunch of random people. Do we know what we're doing? We need to hire some experts. We need to hire some experts. If we're going to go up market, we need market people who've done it before.\"\n\n(01:01:07):\nSo, that was undesirable state, fix it by hiring people who've done it before. And then, we hired loads of people who've done it before, and what they did was brought the culture and ways of working of their prior company to Intercom. And so, we totally over-corrected, didn't work out in a lot of cases. In most cases, it didn't work out. Because, we weren't trying to be a bigger company, that already exists. We're trying to be us. So, I think, hiring and building teams is another where we really over-corrected to find out, \"Okay, it's a balance here.\"\n\n(01:01:43):\nRelated to hiring, one is generalists and specialists, similar theme. People who've done it before, or people who are specialized. And, we hired a bunch of specialists only to realize that they're not adaptable. And, in Intercom, we have a lot of ambiguity, and we lean into the ambiguity, and people who are highly specialized can thrive in big companies, really thrive. They're invaluable employees. But in a fluid startup-y culture with a lot of ambiguity, they can really drown, really struggle. Maybe the middle of this pendulum, landing in the middle is, \"Let's hire someone who has done a bit of it and have a bit of specialism, not much, but enough to try and figure it out.\" So, we hire a lot of those people today.\n\nLenny (01:02:34):\nFirst of all, I love all these stories of things that don't work out, because a lot of people don't like sharing these. And, this is what people want to hear, like, \"Here's not everything was perfect. Here's a lot of mistakes that are made along the way.\" And, it feels like this framework is a result of just doing this too many times. Is the main lesson here generally avoid swinging the pendulum too far? Because sometimes, it's worth it, like in this case of AI, is like, \"No, we're going all in.\" Or in mobile, it was worth going all in. I guess, yeah, what do you think of when I say that?\n\nPaul Adams (01:03:04):\nIn talking to people about this before, sometimes the conclusion of the conversation is something like, it's the only way to do it. You actually can't do it a different way.\" And so, maybe the question is really, how high does the pendulum go? Versus, you got to swing it, and then it's like, how far do you swing it? And for sure, you're right. With AI, we are swinging it pretty high. Maybe I overestimated earlier, if AI is in the differentiation camp to mix the frameworks, we're still building a lot of table stakes features too, building depth into the product. And that's 50/50, I think I mentioned 50/50 earlier, so that's 50/50. So, we're not totally swinging it. It's swung, but we're also doing the other thing and balancing things out. So, I think you probably have to swing it. It reminds me to know where the boundary is, is what I was going to say.\n\n(01:04:01):\nIt reminds me back to the olden days stories. I remember, at Google, privacy was really top of mind, to the point that it would block decisions, block product progress, just privacy circular conversations, so many circular conversations, and nothing ever got built or shipped. I worked on a project for a year at Google and we shipped nothing in the year, just circular conversations, which killed me at the time. So, when I went to Facebook, I realized they have a different approach to privacy. And again, I'm not advocating it's necessarily good, it certainly didn't help their brand. But, there was an idea that to know where the boundary is, you got to across it. And crossing it is painful. But, if you don't cross it, you'll never know. So if you think you're going up to the boundary and you stop before it, turns out it's actually miles over there.\n\n(01:04:54):\nSo I think with a lot of this stuff, you don't really have a choice. You got to cross the boundary, feel the pain, be humble enough to realize you didn't get it right, and go again or whatever the corrective course is.\n\nLenny (01:05:12):\nYeah, get that pendulum off the even pivot thing that it's on. And then, let's fix that pendulum. Let's put it back.\n\nPaul Adams (01:05:18):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:05:20):\nOkay. Another framework that I read about briefly, and I love the general idea of it already, which is something that I think you call product market story fit.\n\nPaul Adams (01:05:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:05:31):\nWhat is that?\n\nPaul Adams (01:05:33):\nSo yeah, with product market fit, pretty basic, well understood, very important. The way I describe product market fit is, you've got to build the right product for the right market. I think, by the way, as an aside, not enough people think about the market side of that equation. A lot of product people don't think about the market side. But for me, it's very simple. The market is the people, the problems they have, and how important the problems are to them. To have a good market, you need a lot of people with the same problem, and they need to care a lot about it. Going back to the Google social stuff, we found a lot of people with the same problem, but they didn't really care. They didn't really care. What they had was fine. So a lot of people with the same problem and a lot of energy around the problem and the product is the solution to that. The market's the who, the product's the what.\n\n(01:06:21):\nAnd, I don't know, in my career again, so a bunch of products that were built, there were good products in good markets, and they failed and I couldn't work it out. And eventually, I came back to this idea that... And maybe someone might say, \"Paul, it's marketing. You're talking about marketing.\" But story, the story's wrong or the story's missing. And so, sometimes, it would be a great product in a great market explained in a convoluted way. I see that a lot. I used to see that a lot at Google again, just explained in a very complicated way over intellectualized. And, as a result, people are like, \"What? What are you talking about?\" You don't get their attention. And so, the story is really important, as important. And actually, sometimes you'll see not great products, certainly worse on paper... I'm trying to remember the Spotify competitor back in the day, people were like... What was the name of it?\n\nLenny (01:07:19):\nOrdio?\n\nPaul Adams (01:07:20):\nYeah, Ordio. Ordio was one of these where-\n\nLenny (01:07:20):\nI like Ordio a lot.\n\nPaul Adams (01:07:26):\n... Yeah, all I've ever heard about Ordio was, \"Amazing product.\"\n\nLenny (01:07:29):\nMm-hmm.\n\nPaul Adams (01:07:30):\nIt's failed. And why did it fail? Spotify and Ordio had the same market. They were solving the same set of problems. Ordio was arguably the better product at the time. I don't know if that's true, but arguably the better. I also think Spotify's an incredible product. But, they got the story wrong. And so, again, I think, all product people, whether you're a designer, product manager, people in research, data science, need to think about the story all the time. Work of marketing, work of product marketing, and learn about how to explain the product, as much as how to build the product.\n\nLenny (01:08:03):\nMm-hmm. Makes me think about positioning and how important that is. And, we had April Dunford on the podcast very recently talking a lot about that.\n\nPaul Adams (01:08:12):\nYeah. Yeah, she's excellent. Yeah, it is really, \"Why are you better and can you explain why you're better?\"\n\nLenny (01:08:21):\nThat's such an important point. A final area I wanted to touch on is jobs to be done. So we had the co-creator of Jobs to be Done on the podcast. We had Shyam Krishnan on the podcast. They very much disagree about how effective Jobs to be Done is. I know you guys are big on Jobs to be Done. So, what are your just general thoughts on the Jobs to be Done framework? How effective was it for you all? How do you use it? What do you find work? Doesn't work? Whatever comes up.\n\nPaul Adams (01:08:47):\nYeah. I'll be totally honest, at the risk of finding people do this, we worked with Bob West years ago. I think Bob's a great guy. And we followed that model of Jobs to be Done more than the ODI, I think, is the other skill of thought. Anyway. I'll try say this in a simple way. We found Jobs to be Done really good. Very, very useful. But, in a very simple way... Again, back to this idea of simple frameworks, in a simple way, separately, there's so many people who spend so much of their energy debating the nuances and peculiarities of one version. Who cares? No one cares. Oh well, I don't care. They care obviously. But your customers don't care. People you're trying to build a product for don't care,. No one cares. That's a cool intellectual debate. But, for me, maybe this is too extreme. It doesn't really have any place in the work we do. We're just trying to build a great product.\n\n(01:09:50):\nAnd so, for us with Jobs to be Done, it was a really good way of us centering on the customer problem, focusing on not getting distracted, basing it in good solid research informed insight, that told us the thing people are trying to do. What is the thing people are trying to do? Again, energy. Do they have a lot of energy around it? Maybe the energy thing might've come from talking to Bob actually, now that I think about it. I think it did actually. I think, the idea of this idea that you need people who have a lot of energy around the problem. And you have to interview them for that most of the time to feel the energy they have. It's very easy to see if someone's apathetic versus into it.\n\n(01:10:30):\nSo, we've had it pretty good. And, we invented this job stories thing by accident. I can't remember exactly what happened. But, I wrote out this way of writing a job story basically. Well, we didn't call it job stories, someone else called it that. We just, at the time, were like... I can't even remember. It was a trigger. And, anyway, we didn't even give it the thing a name, someone else named it, I think. And, I'm just like, \"We're just trying to build a great product.\" So, we've had it really good in that way, really simple. And then, the other one that we use a lot still here is the four forces, which is this framework of Jobs to be Done. The four forces being... There's different forces when people try and switch product. And some of it's the differentiation, table stake stuff, like the attraction of the new solution, the reasons that you might not adopt it. Habits. People have anxieties.\n\n(01:11:26):\nHere's another funny story to tell you how much... The four forces is really good. Here's a funny story, I was saying earlier that Eoghan and Des were trying to convince me to leave Facebook, which I loved at the time, join and to come. They wrote out the four forces for me to join. And then, secretly, over a few beers, talked to me and fed me my anxieties. And basically worked me on the four forces. And I was like, \"That is genius. That is ingenious. Maybe it's a bit... But it's ingenious.\" And so, the four forces is incredibly good at helping understand why people make decisions.\n\nLenny (01:12:07):\nI love that a lot of your advice just continues to come back to, keep it simple, cut away anything that isn't necessary. And, I find the same exact thing with Jobs to be Done. I find it really useful as a framework for the podcast, the newsletter, but I think there's this endless set of processes and ways of optimizing that gets people distracted. And, often just slows everything down.\n\nPaul Adams (01:12:28):\nYeah, yeah. And it's interesting and fun to talk about sometimes, really fascinating, unless you're an academic. But if you're working in a company that you're trying to build a software product for people to improve their lives in some small meaningful way, it doesn't matter. Just use the thing that helps you do that. That's the goal. And use the thing that helps you do that. And that's it.\n\nLenny (01:12:55):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nPaul Adams (01:12:58):\nI'm ready, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:13:00):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nPaul Adams (01:13:04):\nYeah, the two books I recommend to everyone always, I have copies in my office here, It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want to Be. It's a book by Paul Arden who worked in advertising a long time ago. It's an excellent book. It shows people that you feel an unlimited potential if you think about it the right way, everyone does. The second book I recommend to everyone and buy for people and give to them is Principles by Ray Dalio. I'm a big fan of Ray Dalio. I think he's incredible. I'm a big believer in principles. A lot of us at Intercom are... I always get those two books. And they're totally different. The Paul Arden book, you can read it in 20 minutes. Principles is that thick.\n\nLenny (01:13:38):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nPaul Adams (01:13:42):\nMost recent is The Bear, which I came to late. The reason I love the show is because I think it somewhat celebrates the grind. And I think that's important. I worked in coffee shops a lot when I was younger, when I put myself through college and stuff. And, the grind is part of life, and the grind is a necessity to get things done, and make great things happen sometimes. And I like that about it. I really like that about it.\n\nLenny (01:14:09):\nWhat is a favorite interview question you'd like to ask candidates?\n\nPaul Adams (01:14:13):\nYeah, I'll give you a slightly different answer. I don't really have certain few questions for candidates. And I don't like answer question diversity. I don't like questions that rely on memory. Like, \"Tell me about the last time you did X.\" Here's an amazing question I got given recently by Alyssa who used to work here. I had to do referral calls. So, you're interviewing someone, you want to give them the job and they've got referees, and of course, the referees they have are the best people that they've ever worked with and their favorite managers. So this question is, \"What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?\" It's an amazing question, because the person can't dodge it. There's an answer. And, it's incredibly enlightening.\n\nLenny (01:14:55):\nAnd that's a question you ask on reference calls?\n\nPaul Adams (01:14:57):\nYeah, on reference calls.\n\nLenny (01:14:58):\nThat is such a good question. I love it.\n\nPaul Adams (01:15:00):\nYeah, it's a amazing question. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:15:02):\nAll right, what a gem. Thank you for sharing that. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nPaul Adams (01:15:09):\nThis is maybe cheating, but I go back to a lot of the AI products. I think ChatGPT Vision is mind-blowing. I've been playing with Rewind lately. I was a bit late to it. Des, and Kiran, and a bunch of people here, founders of Intercom, love Rewind, use it and love it. Thing's amazing. So I'm a bit late to that. But, it's just augmented memory. It's mind-blowing. So, Rewind's been fun.\n\nLenny (01:15:32):\nAnd they just came out with a little audio thing that can record your actual day.\n\nPaul Adams (01:15:36):\nYeah, I'm not so sure about that.\n\nLenny (01:15:39):\nYeah, got some flack.\n\nPaul Adams (01:15:42):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:15:43):\nI'm not so sure. I don't know. I don't know if it's real. It looked like not a real product when they launched in, but I think it's real.\n\nPaul Adams (01:15:47):\nAnd it tippy-toes into what's okay and not okay with AI. And, yeah. Yeah, it's a cool theory though, for sure.\n\nLenny (01:15:57):\nWhat is a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with people, find helpful for yourself?\n\nPaul Adams (01:16:04):\nYeah, I have a post-it on my monitor that says, \"Only work on what matters most.\" It's on my monitor, a post-it. And it sometimes falls off, and I have to write it again. Only work on what matters most. And, it's amazing. I go into work, someone emails me, and I'm like, \"Oh, God.\" I'm like, \"Only work on what matters most.\" The second one related is, stop worrying about things you can't control. And so, I have two of those. And so, only working what matters most. Stop worrying about things you can't control. It just reduces the temperature. Again, life lessons learned. I sent a lot of dumb emails in my past, like, \"Red Energy, oh my God, what are they thinking?\" You wake up in Dublin to a San Francisco email. And you're like, \"Oh god. Keyboard.\" And, if your monitor says these two things, you just don't do that. You just take a breath, get a coffee, come back. Does it really matter?\n\nLenny (01:17:02):\nBeautiful. The second one, I think, I learned first from Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. Have you read that?\n\nPaul Adams (01:17:02):\nOh, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:17:10):\nJust think about the focus, the circle of things you can control, and then there's the circle of things you can influence, and then there's the things you have no control over. And, I find that really helpful myself. I love that you have it as a post-its. I feel like, I need to make post-its of all these lessons people share as their little mottos.\n\nPaul Adams (01:17:26):\nYeah, the post-it on the monitor is a real life hack, I found a few years ago. Because it's dumb in a way. The posts on the monitor, it's in the way.\n\nLenny (01:17:34):\nWait, you actually put it on the monitor in the way of your screen?\n\nPaul Adams (01:17:34):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:17:34):\nOh, wow.\n\nPaul Adams (01:17:38):\nIt's in the bottom left, just covering the bottom. Because otherwise, if it wasn't there, I wouldn't look at. I make myself look at it.\n\nLenny (01:17:47):\nYeah. Wow. I haven't heard of people putting it over precious real estate on their monitor.\n\nPaul Adams (01:17:53):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:17:53):\nThat works. What's the most valuable lesson your mom or your dad taught you?\n\nPaul Adams (01:17:58):\nThe biggest one, again, so reductive and simple is to be nice to people. I think, being nice goes way further than people really realize. One thing that I've learned, again, the hard way through life is you have no idea what's going on in people's lives. You've no idea. People could have all sorts of really stressful, all sorts of personal stuff going on, and the reason they did the thing at work that you didn't like is because of that. And so, I try and think, \"Be nice. You don't know what's going on. You might learn later. Don't act in a way you would regret.\" I think, being nice in life goes far further than most people give a credit for, because it's too much of a, I don't know, fluffy truism or whatever.\n\nLenny (01:18:54):\nI 1000% resonate with that. I've been told I'm too nice and I had to become a little less nice. But, I still can't lose that. So I fully buy into that. My parents taught me a similar lesson.\n\nPaul Adams (01:19:08):\nYeah. And sometimes it's hard. I'd never fired anyone before I joined Intercom, for example. I really did not like doing it. And, since then, I've done it quite a few times in a bunch of different circumstances, and realized it always works out for both sides. And the nicest thing to do is to do the harder thing. It's actually the nicer thing to do. People are relieved in this example. It's a nicer thing to do. So, it can be a complicated one.\n\nLenny (01:19:37):\nI love it. Final question. You're Irish, you're based in Ireland. What is an Irish food you think people should definitely try out if they ever visit Ireland?\n\nPaul Adams (01:19:50):\nCan I cheat and say Guinness? Is that food?\n\nLenny (01:19:54):\nAbsolutely.\n\nPaul Adams (01:19:56):\nThe Guinness in Ireland. People talk about this and it's true. The Guinness in Ireland is much, much better for a whole bunch of reasons. It's basically a fresh product and it's brewed here. It's the way they think about, it's like milk. Milk goes off, Guinness goes off. Guinness is older than a few days old, tends to start deteriorating. So, Guinness Ireland is amazing, because it's made here. The other thing I think that Ireland does really well is fish. Ireland has not had, by the way, the greatest reputation for culinary excellence over the years. I think Irish food in the States in particular is not good. But, the fish here is incredible. You can get incredible fish. And Ireland's obviously an island, so there's a lot of fish.\n\nLenny (01:20:37):\nOn the Guinness front, is there any way to get the good stuff not in Ireland? Or is that just you got to go?\n\nPaul Adams (01:20:43):\nNo, there is actually. You just need to be near a brewery. So Guinness is brewed in Nigeria. There's a huge Guinness market in Nigeria.\n\nLenny (01:20:43):\nI did not know that.\n\nPaul Adams (01:20:53):\nI think they actually use a different recipe, but it's brewed there. I think the brewery in the U.S. is somewhere in the east coast between New York and Eastern Canada. So, it's somewhere there. So, often, the Guinness in New York can be actually pretty good. The Guinness in San Francisco tends to be really bad. I remember talking to someone about this that works in Guinness. One of my friends, does a lot of work in Guinness. I think the boat carried the Guinness goes down through the Panama Canal back up to San Francisco. So, it's 12-weeks-old or something.\n\nLenny (01:21:25):\nWow. Did not think we would be learning about the travel path of Guinness from-\n\nPaul Adams (01:21:31):\nAt least this is what I've heard. The Guinness has so many myths, you just don't really know what's true. But, these are the stories I've been told.\n\nLenny (01:21:38):\n... Amazing. Paul, you are awesome. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nPaul Adams (01:21:46):\nI have a handle, it's everywhere. Basically, P-A-D-D-A-Y. It's Paddy with an extra A. So, P-A-D-D-A-Y. That's everywhere. So, paddy@gmail, @Paddy. It's my handle everywhere. So, that's where you can find me. I'd love people to reach out to me, right, genuinely learn. I'd love to hear from people who think my AI talk is nonsense and it's more a crypto Web3. Or, I'd love to hear people who have alternative opinions and challenge mine. That's how I like to learn and get better. So, if people have those opinions, I'd love to hear them. I'd love to talk to them.\n\nLenny (01:22:25):\nBe careful what you wish for. The YouTube comments are always a spicy place. We'll see what we see. Awesome, Paul. Thank you again so much for being here.\n\nPaul Adams (01:22:33):\nYeah, thanks Lenny. I really appreciate it.\n\nLenny (01:22:35):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Redefining success, money, and belonging | Paul Millerd (The Pathless Path)\n\n## Transcript\n\nPaul Millerd (00:00:00):\nTake three hours during a workday. Has to be during a workday. Block off your schedule, sneak out. People can pull this off. Go for a walk without a destination or do something from your childhood that you used to do all the time. Did you use to play basketball? Did you use to paint? Did you use to play an instrument? And just pay attention. What is emerging? Do you feel bad for sneaking out of work? Where does that bad feeling come from? What does that mean about your definition of work and what work means to you?\n\n(00:00:30):\nA lot of people have never really thought about, why do you work? People say money. Okay, that's fine. But what else? Why? Are you trying to be a good person? Do you see a good person as somebody that works every day? Maybe. These are a lot of scripts people grow up with. You're really just creating this space to get in touch with, how do I actually feel about work? How do I get to know myself more? Are there things that I've lost touch with that really bring me alive?\n\nLenny (00:00:59):\nToday my guest is Paul Millerd. Paul is the author of The Pathless Path: Imagining a New Story for Work and Life. His book is getting a lot of traction within the tech community, because it explores a different way of living, essentially breaking free of the default path for your work and your life that we all basically start on. What Paul describes in his book is almost exactly the path I took to figure out this very weird and wonderful work that I do now with the newsletter and podcast. And because of that, I think this is an important conversation to have, because it may inspire you to explore a different path in your own life.\n\n(00:01:33):\nIn our conversation, Paul explains what the pathless path is, how to go about exploring your own pathless path, how to address fears we all have around money, and prestige, and safety that keep us on the default path, plus tons of stories and examples, and very tactical advice for thinking about exploring a new direction in your own life. With that, I bring you Paul Millerd after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:58):\nThis episode is brought to you by Sanity. Your website is the heart of your growth engine. For that engine to drive big results, you need to be able to move super fast, ship new content, experiment, learn, and iterate. But most content management systems just aren't built for this. Your content teams wrestle with rigid interfaces as they build new pages. You spend endless time copying and pasting across pages, and recreating content for other channels and applications. And their ideas for new experiments are squashed when developers can't build them within the constraints of outdated tech.\n\n(00:02:30):\nForward-thinking companies like Figma, Amplitude, Loom, Riot Games, Linear, and more use sanity to build content growth engines that scale, drive innovation, and accelerate customer acquisition.

I actually joined Maui Nui Venison earlier this year, after hearing their ad on the Tim Ferriss podcast, and I'm excited to be spreading the message further. Not only does this company provide the most nutrient dense and protein dense red meat available. Their operation produces the only stress-free, 100% wild harvested red meat on the market, that is the only one of its kind in the world, actively managing Maui's invasive axis deer populations, helping to restore balance to vulnerable ecosystems, food systems, and communities in Hawaii. Also, it is seriously delicious, not at all gamey, and easy to cook. My wife and I made stew, and steaks, and all kinds of grilled goodies with the meat. \n\n(00:04:07):\nWe also feel great about it as a protein from an ethical standpoint. I highly recommend trying their all natural venison jerky sticks for an optimal protein snack, as well as a wide variety of fresh cuts all available in their online butcher shop.

Welcome to the podcast. \n\nPaul Millerd (00:04:38):\nExcited to be here Lenny.\n\nLenny (00:04:40):\nI'm more excited to have you on. You published a book called The Pathless Path, which I have right here. Last I heard you've sold over 40,000 copies of this book, which I know puts it in the top 1% of books sold, possibly in the top 0.1% of books sold. It's an absurdly high number for books sold. People don't really know this. And especially for a self-published book, it's a huge success.\n\n(00:05:02):\nAnd I thought it would be good to start with a concept that you call the default path. What is the default path?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:05:08):\nYeah, I think the default path is different for everyone and slightly different in every different culture. It's really the story in your head about what you should do. And most of us have some sort of script that we're living out. This is especially powerful when we're in our late teens and early twenties, right? We're trying to execute a script.\n\n(00:05:31):\nAnd it can be different in every country. In the US it's sort of like go to college, get good grades, get a good job, make a good salary, buy a house, get married, have a family, things like that. And when it comes to work, the default path is get a job and work continuously for all of adulthood.\n\n(00:05:50):\nAnd when you opt out of the default path, there aren't really offerings. People have a hard time even contemplating it. You'll trigger insecurities in other people by just existing outside the frame of the default path. And it's the default path in their head of their conception of how the world should work and does work, right?\n\n(00:06:15):\nSo a lot of what I explore is what is life beyond the default path, and what are the stories we can use to one, at minimum, feel better about what we're doing? And two, what are the stories we can adopt to thrive?\n\nLenny (00:06:32):\nI imagine many people listening to this are feeling like, \"No way I'm on the default path. I'm doing so many interesting things. I'm doing what I want,\" but they probably still are on this default path. What are some signs that might tell you that you actually still are on this path, and there's such a new direction you could explore that you haven't explored?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:06:50):\nYeah, I think there's nothing wrong with the default path. The difference I would make is, are you conscious about what you're actually doing? What are the costs of your game? What are the trade-offs? What are the implicit contracts are you creating with yourself? A lot of times when people quit their jobs, they forget to fire the manager in their head. They don't realize they can take the afternoon off to spend it with their kids. They've created this implicit contract that Monday through Friday, eight to 10 hours a week you have to work. And that may work for people, but are you actually opting into that, or are you just sort of accepting the default? \n\nLenny (00:07:35):\nI think it's a really important point. It's totally fine to stay on this default path. It's not for everyone to try something totally different. Can you talk a little bit about just how to think about the benefits of that and the trade-offs of, \"Okay, this is great, I'm going to stay where I am\"?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:07:48):\nIt's interesting. I did not think my book would resonate with people that were firmly in the traditional work role. Full-time jobs, big companies, things like that. But I've had many people reach out that say, \"Wow, this sort of loosened the tightness between my identity and my work reality, and loosened it up a little bit. And I'm able to play with it a little more.\" I had one friend, he said, \"From your book, I made a list of the four priorities. Right now I'm getting three of them. And it's helped me become more aware that I'm actually getting these three things that I prioritize. I'm missing the fourth. I'm probably going to have to make a change two years from now. Maybe another role, because I do want to lean into that fourth thing.\" I think it's really just about remixing your path. My hot take is that we're all on a pathless path. You were at Airbnb. Airbnb, every two years were there was a different company.\n\nLenny (00:08:53):\nAbsolutely true.\n\nPaul Millerd (00:08:54):\nRight? And so we're constantly needing to reinvent and reevaluate. And I think thinking of our lives as this smooth trajectory up this corporate ascent sort of limits the possibilities of our own life. So just acknowledging that we are being disrupted. We all have personal lives where we have relationship challenges, health challenges, external shocks, inflation, things like this, that are changing our reality all the time.\n\n(00:09:25):\nAnd it sort of sucks that there aren't these comfortable middle class jobs that are growing and abundant. They're shrinking. David Autor, a economist from MIT, has pretty good research on this, and it's just making people a little more unsettled. It sucks, but this is the reality we're living in, especially places like the US becoming super tech heavy. And how do you navigate that? It's hard. Everyone's struggling with their relationship to work.\n\nLenny (00:09:58):\nLet's actually talk about the pathless path. You've been kind of touching on various ways of thinking about it. What's the simplest way of thinking about this concept of the pathless path?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:10:07):\nI really shied away from trying to define it super clearly. I think I have this passage at the beginning of the book that it's like the pathless path is basically a shift away from the default. It's a shift away from not knowing what you're doing as a problem to be solved toward an embrace of uncomfort, discomfort, and uncertainty. \n\n(00:10:32):\nAnd it's sort of a personal journey of shifting away from operating around scarcity towards operating from a sense of abundance, having faith that things might be okay. And on a path like yours, this is a necessary condition. You have no idea what comes next, because nobody has been on the Lenny path before. \n\nLenny (00:10:57):\nTrue. \n\nPaul Millerd (00:10:59):\nRight? And a lot of us are in this situation. Now if you're an accountant at an accounting firm in your early twenties, maybe there is a track, and you can sort of plan it, and it's pretty legible. But even still, I would argue that developing a relationship with uncertainty, not knowing what's happening, experimenting a little more, it's all of these things in one. And it's sort of my attempt to come up with a better narrative around work.\n\n(00:11:27):\nAnd it's been pretty cool, because a lot of people are embracing this and now using the term like, \"I'm on my pathless path.\" And it allows people to sort of name it and gives them comfort. \n\n(00:11:40):\nI've had people email me that have been on a path for seven years, and they're like, \"This is the first time I actually felt okay about my path,\" because a lot of what my book is, is an exploration of, why does it feel so weird to do your own thing? Why does it actually feel shameful to leave a full-time job? Which is an aberration in the history of the world.\n\nLenny (00:12:06):\nI imagine a big question everyone's mind right now is, \"This sounds amazing. I would love to just do the work I love and break out of this path. How do I do that?\" And I want to talk about that. But before we do that, what are some examples of pathless paths people have ended up doing? Something just to make it a little more real of, here's what people have ended up doing with their life. \n\nPaul Millerd (00:12:29):\nSo I think it ranges from a short sabbatical. And to someone like you or me who are sort of on this path and committed to this creator path, and things like that, there's a huge component of their creator economy. Not the creator economy from a VC perspective of all these startups that are going to save creators, but creators that are actually betting on themselves, finding some deeper satisfaction, a better relationship with work and committing to it. But it also encompasses people that are independent freelancers, that have a stable path, more predictable income than creator economy stuff. And it also includes people that are jumping from job to job.\n\n(00:13:16):\nI also have examples of people that are older. I talk to a lot of people in their fifties. They've solved their financial problems, but they've lost that sense of aliveness. And they're looking to re-inject that, and they need maps of how to approach that, how to think about that, what are the models, things like that. \n\n(00:13:37):\nSo yeah, it's a pretty big umbrella. It's a nice way to claim everyone's path, but I think the shared ethic is really a sense of possibility, and opportunity, and optimism. \n\nLenny (00:13:54):\nSo just to kind of list out some of these end, and I think what's interesting is there's no end to this. It's an endless path to continue discovering. There's actually this quote that I wrote down here that I'll read that I think is a really nice way of thinking about this pathless path. \"The goal is not to find a job, make money, build a business, or achieve any other metric. It's to actively and consciously search for the work that you want to keep doing.\"\n\nPaul Millerd (00:14:15):\nThe big shift there, the big shift for me actually, when I left my job, I wanted to run away. I wanted to escape work. I wanted to not work. And I more or less accomplished that. I basically lowered my cost of living in Asia to about 1,000 per month. \n\n(00:14:34):\nBut then I started developing this relationship with writing, and creating, and all these things I actually really enjoyed. And I wasn't doing them to be famous or grow a following. I just really liked them and I liked doing it in public, because I was meeting others that were engaging on these ideas. \n\n(00:14:52):\nSo the big aha for me was, \"Oh, you can design around liking work.\" The hidden assumption I had around work for the first 32, 33 years of my life was work sucks. You have to figure out how to tolerate it.\n\n(00:15:13):\nAnd within that frame, try to do your best to enjoy some of it. But ultimately, it's a trade-off of your time. You have to suffer through it. A lot of it is going to suck, and you have to put up with that.\n\n(00:15:26):\nNow, I think I'm very protective of what I do and don't do. This is why it was very easy for me to say no to Penguin. I didn't want to write a second book for them. I want to write a second book the way I did, which was super fun process. Writing a book was one of the most fun things I've ever done in my life. And so I sort of think about protecting them. \n\n(00:15:48):\nAnd a lot of people are looking for meaning through work in a job shaped container. And I think that's just really hard to find. You can find it for short bursts, but maybe after seven or 10 years, it's just not doing it anymore. \n\nLenny (00:16:05):\nSo let's talk about how to go about finding your pathless path and create the space and opportunity to do this. Because again, a lot of people listening are like, \"I have bills to pay. I got kids to take care of. I got a home, I got a mortgage. I can't just go on a sabbatical, explore, travel, and find here I'm going to start a newsletter.\" So what have you found are ways to enable this exploration without risking everything? \n\nPaul Millerd (00:16:31):\nA three month sabbatical is much more attainable than people think. Companies are desperate to keep people and are much more open to things like this these days. And the way I frame it is if you're assuming you're going to work continuously in adulthood, that's about 500 months. Try to find three months of that where you can create space and reconnect with yourself, explore things, just see what emerges, see how you feel. I think this is so vital for people in their thirties or forties who've worked for 10 years just to reconnect with themselves. \n\n(00:17:11):\nAnd three months in a total of 500 months, people accomplish much more impressive things than that, like saving for their dream home. That is such a powerful thing people aim for that they make it happen. Even people that don't have a ton are able to make that happen, because it is such an important priority. And for me, I think creating this space was more important than owning a house, getting married. It was the most important thing for me.\n\n(00:17:42):\nAnd I actually quoted your piece. I pulled up the quote. It said, \"Lenny Rachitsky took a sabbatical after a long career in product management, thought he would return to work. But by the end of the break, it was crystal clear to me that I was ready to move on to a new adventure.\" And then you said several weeks into your sabbatical, you stopped checking your email. \"My heart was no longer in the work. I didn't yet know what I wanted to do next, but I knew it was time to shake things up.\" And you probably weren't in that state when you were still at Airbnb. \n\nLenny (00:18:16):\nThat's right. I was super into the work. And I think the way I thought about it is the Kool-Aid kind of exited my bloodstream, and taking that time off kind of created separation. And then I started thinking, \"Man, is this really what I want to be doing?\" And that visceral feeling of getting excited about the work disappeared, which was crazy and scary. \n\nPaul Millerd (00:18:35):\nYeah. And so you have smart listeners, and smart people are great at excuses. So they'll say, \"I can't do it because of this.\" I always think these things are much more possible if they really are the main priority. \n\n(00:18:48):\nSo what I tell people is fine, don't take a sabbatical. Take an afternoon. Take three hours during a workday. Has to be during a workday. Block off your schedule, sneak out. People can pull this off. Go for a walk without a destination, or do something from your childhood that you used to do all the time. Did you use to play basketball? Did you use to paint? Did you use to play an instrument? Do one of those two things, even better if you do both.\n\n(00:19:19):\nAnd just pay attention. It's a sort of form of work mindfulness. What is emerging? Do you feel bad for sneaking out of work? Where does that bad feeling come from? What does that mean about your definition of work and what work means to you?\n\n(00:19:38):\nA lot of people have never really thought about, why do you work? People say money. Okay, that's fine. But what else? Why do you work? Are you trying to be a good person? Do you see a good person as somebody that works every day? Maybe. These are a lot of scripts people grow up with. Or people that don't have a full-time job, are they bad people? \n\n(00:20:04):\nAnd so you're really just creating this space to get in touch with, how do I actually feel about work? How do I get to know myself more? Are there things that I've lost touch with that really bring me alive?\n\nLenny (00:20:19):\nIt's interesting how much of what you described, we didn't know each other before we met for this podcast episode, but so much of what you say is exactly what happened in my path. I took three months off exactly. I took a sabbatical. I started poking around, exploring, doing a little writing. And basically led to what I do now, which is a crazy thing I never imagined in my wildest dreams. And so clearly this works.\n\nPaul Millerd (00:20:43):\nYeah, and I think people will say, \"You can do that because you worked at Airbnb,\" or, \"Oh, you can do that because you\"... I've talked to hundreds of people. So what I did before the pandemic for years was I opened up my calendar every Wednesday and I said, anyone that wants to talk to me about work can talk to me about work.\n\n(00:21:02):\nSo at this point, I've probably talked to 500 plus people about their relationship to work. And the reason that's not surprising about what happened to you is it happens to almost everyone. The sabbatical almost has a 99.9% approval rating. \n\n(00:21:22):\nI talked to one person. She was like, \"I took a sabbatical, I stayed at home. My husband was still working for two months. I couldn't wait to go back to work.\" I was like, \"Cool. You're the first person I met that didn't get anything out of a sabbatical.\"\n\nLenny (00:21:37):\nThat's hilarious. I haven't met that person. So your advice is try to take a sabbatical, and you're also encouraging people to, you can actually probably do this at some point, but maybe it takes a bit of time to set people up for the fact that you're going to do this. Maybe you need to work at the company for a while, but in your thirties or forties, it sounds like try to find time to take three months. And is three months important? Is that what you find, that large of a block of time?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:22:03):\nI've found it takes six to eight weeks just to unwind.\n\nLenny (00:22:09):\nYeah, that's exactly what I found.\n\nPaul Millerd (00:22:11):\nI think for me, there was the initial unwinding after six to eight weeks, and then a deeper unwinding after probably two to three years, where you start to trust yourself a little more, if you stay on the uncertain path that is. But yeah.\n\nLenny (00:22:28):\nIf founders are listening to this and feeling like, \"Shit, why would I give people sabbaticals? They're going to leave, start their own companies, find some other catalyst path. I want them on my default path.\" Is there anything you could say to a founder thinking about offering sabbatical?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:22:43):\nI would say if that's their reaction, it sounds like they have an insecurity around work. So I would interrogate that first. What is the implicit story they have about how much people are supposed to work and such?\n\n(00:23:00):\nYeah, I don't know if it's a good employer strategy. I think a decent amount of people would leave. I know Intel, I have friends that have done the sabbatical at Intel. You get six weeks after seven years. Maybe after seven years, they're a bit burnt out that they don't have enough time in those six weeks to unwind. \n\n(00:23:22):\nBut I think getting creative, especially now that remote work is so much more common about these opportunities, to let people become the people they want to be. People leave companies because they don't see a path to be the person they want to be. \n\nLenny (00:23:40):\nOkay, so you take a sabbatical, or you take an afternoon, or you take a walk. You talked about be mindful for what comes up. What are you feeling about work? What is a thing you want to do? Do you want to go play basketball? Do you want to go draw? What else do you encourage people to do, to try to discover a potential new path?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:24:00):\nI think meeting others. So in exercise, I'll have people do if they're curious about this... And for the most part, I don't want to convert people that like what they're doing and like traditional jobs. But a lot of people are curious, and I say have a path expert conversation. Reach out to somebody, sort of like a podcast, that's ahead of you on a similar path, and just send them a message and say, really thoughtful message. Say, \"Hey, you're on a path a few years ahead of me. I'm really curious about this. I don't have people in my life that have done things like this. Can I just pick your brain? If we can't jump on a call, can I send you a list of questions?\"\n\n(00:24:42):\nMost people will agree to that, especially the latter if they're a writer, because writing just enables them to come up with new ideas. So I'll always agree to do the written questions. I don't do the open calendar anymore now that I have a daughter. She wins my time over random stranger's booking. But if people want to send me questions, I'll always answer them in text form.\n\nLenny (00:25:07):\nAnd again, this path doesn't have to lead to creator, artist, writer person. It could lead to starting a new business. It could probably lead to a new career. It could shift in careers. Is there anything else, again, of just where this could lead to people so they're like, \"Oh, wow, that's interesting.\"\n\nPaul Millerd (00:25:23):\nSomebody sent me an article today about this guy. I think he was a performing artist. He became a therapist. I forget his name. But I think just the possibilities for reinventing yourself and taking different paths, working online, working flexibly, it's way more possible than 25 years ago. It's also going to continue to be more possible. All the tools and technology to enable these kinds of lives are just getting better and easier. And especially this week, ChatGPT just released their new GPT. I was playing with that today and I'm like, \"Oh my gosh.\"\n\nLenny (00:26:04):\nThis episode is brought to you by Wix Studio. Your agency has just landed a dream client, and you already have big ideas for the website, but do you have the tools to bring your ambitious vision to life? Let me tell you about Wix Studio, the new platform that lets agencies deliver exceptional client sites with maximum efficiency. How?\n\n(00:26:22):\nFirst, let's talk about advanced design capabilities. With Wix Studio, you can build unique layouts with a revolutionary grid experience, and watches elements scale proportionally by default. No-code animations at sparks of delight, while adding custom CSS gives total design control. Bring ambitious client projects to life with any industry, with a fully integrated suite of business solutions. From e-commerce to events, bookings, and more. And extend the capabilities even further with hundreds of APIs and integrations. \n\n(00:26:50):\nYou know what else? The workflows just make sense. There's the built-in AI tools, the on canvas collaborating, a centralized workspace, the reuse of assets across sites, the seamless client handover, and that's not all. Find out more at wix.com/studio.\n\n(00:27:08):\nI think when people might hear some of these professions like, \"Maybe I'll become a therapist, maybe I'll become an online writer person. Maybe I'll start a business.\" It may feel like that assumes you'll make less money doing these things. But in my case, and I'm curious if it's in your case, I make significantly more doing what I do now. I try not to talk about the income of this stuff, but it's significantly more than I made at Airbnb as a very senior product leader. And I feel like that often happens. You discover a way to do something you love and also make a lot more money.\n\nPaul Millerd (00:27:39):\nI think it's easier to make money in a sustainable, long-term way doing stuff you actually like doing. That sounds so simple, but it actually would've been really hard for me to stay on my previous path. \n\n(00:27:53):\nNow, in my case, it was not until my fifth year that I came close to the salary I left. For the first three years, I really optimized for exploration, creativity, just getting to know myself again. I made 50 grand the first year, because I was freelancing. Then I made 30 grand, 24 grand, and then 30 grand. So I was really optimizing for getting to know myself. I dramatically lowered my cost of living, and that is one path. \n\n(00:28:26):\nBut this year, I'll make more than I ever made. And that is mind-blowing to me, because every single day of this year has been absolutely delightful. I've spent abundant time with my wife and my daughter. And it's so crazy.\n\n(00:28:44):\nNow, if I had stayed in my previous path, I'd be making a lot more than I make now. But that path was not viable for me for becoming... I'd be so frustrated right now if I had to go back to work. An eight-month-old, I know you have a four-month-old. Wait till eight months old. They're so fun to hang out with.\n\nLenny (00:29:12):\nI can't wait. You talked about this lower spend, lower expense life. What other tips and tricks do you have for people to create this space where they can continue living and paying the rent, while exploring, and wandering, and exploring these things? Is it cut down on expenses? Is there anything else that one can do? \n\nPaul Millerd (00:29:33):\nI've talked to so many people at this point. I've seen all sorts of things. I've seen people move abroad. I've seen families with kids and a mortgage sell their house and decide to live in an RV. I've seen people dip into their retirement. I've seen people apply for grants and get those. I've seen people apply for loans.\n\n(00:29:55):\nA big move that a lot of people do is turn their current job into a contract job, which a lot of employers are a lot more open than people would think. Because a contractor's very easy to fire. You can fire a contractor in a day. So if the company's struggling, boom, you're gone, right? \n\n(00:30:14):\nAnd so there is more risk, but if you're known in the company, it can actually be a somewhat stable path to create more space in your life. You say, \"Hey, I want to work three days a week. I want to be a contractor. Here's exactly what I want to do. Are you open to this?\"\n\n(00:30:30):\nAnd as soon as you're a contractor, they can't tell you where to work. You can develop a relationship and they can ask you to work in a certain place, but they don't have control over where you work. \n\nLenny (00:30:42):\nA trick that I found really useful actually for helping me feel comfortable about taking time off, I ended up taking six months off, and then it ended up being a year off because I kept trying to figure out what is the thing I wanted to do. The way that I felt good about that is I set a budget of, \"Here's the runway that I'm going to give myself. Here's how much it's going to cost to do this for six months. Here's the runway I'm going to give myself. I'm just going to burn through this money, just with the bet that it'll lead to something interesting.\" And that made me and my wife also just feel like, okay, we were going to lose all that money probably, but the bet is it's going to lead to something really great.\n\nPaul Millerd (00:31:15):\nYeah, I love this. I think this is something I've been thinking about a lot lately, and I've actually been trying to write something around this, which is that naming what you're spending money on or coming up with agreements like that, you're sort of saying, \"This is money I'm investing in my life MBA.\" Because if somebody says, \"I'm going to Stanford Business School,\" generally you'll receive positive praise. \"Oh, that's awesome.\" But what they're really doing is not working for two years and spending 150 to $200,000, and not earning a salary.\n\n(00:31:55):\nAnd then to me, it was really interesting to look back at my path. Now, the first three years of my path, I broke even. But compared to being in business school, people thought business school was way better of a path for me. People were judgmental in my path, critical of my path, insulted me, projected their insecurities on me. \"How could you do this? This is so crazy. What's your plan?\" So coming up with these reframes is super powerful. \n\n(00:32:26):\nOne powerful one that worked for me was consider it a gift from your former self. So on the consulting path, I did like it for a while, but at the end I didn't like it. I was sort of just grinding through, going through the motions. I was good at it, but I really didn't want to be doing it if I had choice. And so I earned a decent income doing it. So would I gift that to my future self to be happier? Yeah. So now that I'm in the present, receive that gift and be like, \"Thank you former self for working that job.\"\n\nLenny (00:33:08):\nIt's interesting. I could also flip it from the other way of your future self is returning to, \"Hey, here's some money to spend to help become who I've become.\"\n\nPaul Millerd (00:33:17):\nYeah, exactly. \n\nLenny (00:33:19):\nSo I imagine not everyone ends up on a beautiful, amazing new life. They go down this route, they spend a bunch of money, and then they're like, \"God damn, I don't have anything to show for it. I've spent all this cash.\" Imagine there are stories of that. Is there anything you could share around those stories and how to maybe either avoid them or be okay with them? \n\nPaul Millerd (00:33:38):\nI think there are surprisingly few stories of that. I think that is people's fear of what might happen. What I've seen in reality, as soon as people are without an income or without a job, they spur into action. People, we're far more creative than we give ourselves credit for. Having a child, we have no idea what we're doing when they come out.\n\n(00:34:03):\nBut it makes perfect sense that you're going to figure everything out, because you have to. You have no choice. And so the ingenuity and creativity of people as soon as they bet on themselves and go off into the wilderness, is far more than people expect. \n\n(00:34:24):\nAnd it also has to do with regrets. People do not regret the things they do. They regret the things they didn't do. And the reason for this is if you've made a mistake, you can actually take action to correct it. But if you didn't do the thing that you're regretting, there's nothing you can do except do the thing. \n\nLenny (00:34:46):\nAnd it reminds me of a quote that you have in your book that I have here. The secret to doing good research, and I think it's related to this of finding a new path, a pathless path, is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.\n\nPaul Millerd (00:35:00):\nYeah. And I wonder if you've found this too. Sometimes, the best way for me to write is to go for a walk, or to take a couple days off and just sort of reset. Creative work can't be forced a lot of time.\n\n(00:35:20):\nAnd increasingly, a lot of work is creative work. Your work at Airbnb was ultimately creative work. You're creating new products and offerings, in a whole new conception of an industry. You're making stuff up. A lot of times, I think people get fried in these companies because they're not actually given the schedules and the support systems around what actually enables creativity. \n\nLenny (00:35:53):\nYeah, absolutely. Although I find with writing also, there's the benefit of the opposite of, \"I'm just going to sit here and write, and I'm not going to give myself a chance to go walk around. I'm just going to keep writing, even if it's terrible, because it'll maybe lead to something.\"\n\nPaul Millerd (00:36:07):\nYeah. And even that though, a lot of times, what ends up on the page surprises you. Right? So you do need a certain sense of openness to let that emerge.\n\nLenny (00:36:20):\nSo kind of along the same lines, another important concept that you talk about in your book for finding this pathless path is just this idea that it's not ever like this all or nothing. I'm just going to leap into this new thing. It's kind of this, the way you put it is people quit jobs after years of awakening and safely testing changes, kind of eliminating risks along the way. \n\nPaul Millerd (00:36:40):\nSo years before I left, and I'm curious if you had a similar experience, I was starting to read personal development books. I was reading Tim Ferriss. I was doing these small experiments like coaching on the side, helping people with their resumes, volunteering, helping people with careers. \n\n(00:37:00):\nAnd so I was writing too. I was writing for fun on Quora with no goals. And all these things make perfect sense now. And even looking back further, I was always tinkering on the internet, and all these things fit my story perfectly now.\n\n(00:37:16):\nBut I didn't know why I was doing them at the time. But each one gave me the confidence to be like, \"Okay, I don't love my day job, but all these random things I'm doing on the side, like writing an article and posting it on Medium and LinkedIn, and the people I'm meeting, this is really interesting and energizing. I'm going to pay attention to that energy. Something is there.\"\n\n(00:37:41):\nAnd when I quit my job, I didn't really have a plan for how to deal with that, but I had experienced enough of this positive energy. I was like, \"I want to chase that. I want to go after that.\"\n\nLenny (00:37:53):\nThat's exactly what I found. So I'll tell my story briefly on this. Some advice I got when I went on my sabbatical that ended up being incredibly powerful is essentially what you just said, which is when you're doing stuff during some period of time off, pay really close attention to what gives you energy after you do the thing. Say you have a call. Did that give you energy or did that sap you of energy? Do you feel more energized or you feel like, \"I'm tired now\"?\n\n(00:38:19):\nSo it's like after calls you make, after things you do with friends, after some kind of hobby you're trying to do, after you write some stuff, just pay really close attention to what energizes you, what saps you energy. And then my whole strategy was just do more of the things that energize me and do less of the things that de-energize me. \n\n(00:38:37):\nSo in my case, I thought I'd want to do some advising or consulting. I found after every advising call, I was de-energized. I was just like, \"No, I do not enjoy this as much as I thought.\" But after writing and putting a piece out, I was like, \"Wow, this is really cool.\" Even though writing's very hard and there's a lot of de-energized moments, broadly it's like, \"Wow, this is cool. People seem to really value this.\" So I started doing that more. I thought I wanted to start a company, but that kept sucking me of energy as I was working on ideas. So that alone was really, really powerful. And it sounds like really simple advice, but it's really [inaudible 00:39:10].\n\nPaul Millerd (00:39:10):\nIt's hard too. I think the pull to create a company when you leave a big tech company is so powerful. And what you're saying is sort of crazy. You're saying, \"I just feel good writing. I'm going to follow that.\" \n\nLenny (00:39:29):\nIt's not a popular path amongst my friends and family. \n\nPaul Millerd (00:39:32):\nAnd I think the root of that is you're triggering insecurities in them. You're doing something they weren't allowed to do at your age. \n\nLenny (00:39:41):\nThe thing I found really helpful there, another friend gave me this advice, just tell people you're tinkering. When they ask you, \"What are you working on?\" \"I'm just tinkering. I'm tinkering with some writing.\" Because something about that word makes it sound like, \"Okay, cool, it's delightful and cool. Tinker wave.\" \n\nPaul Millerd (00:39:57):\nI feel like that did not work with my parents. But yeah, trying different things. I always tell people you need a boomer compatible story for what you're up to, as just give them something. Just say, \"I'm an entrepreneur,\" or, \"I'm a business owner.\"\n\nLenny (00:40:18):\nThat totally resonates. I'd be excited about that if I was a boomer. In the book, you also talk about taming fears. So we talked about a few of these things, and just the power of taming some of these fears that you have. There's success, the fear of not being successful, of money, of belonging, of loneliness, and of health. Can you just talk about either all of those or any of those, just why it's important to tame those fears, and then how one goes about taming these fears?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:40:45):\nYeah. So a big source of inspiration around this is Tim Ferriss' fear setting, and he basically forces you to write down what are your fears, how could you mitigate these. But more powerfully, the second part is... And you're framing them around action. And so he reframes, what is the cost of inaction? And that was really powerful for me, and it sort of exposed a lot of the costs in the current state of what I was doing. \n\n(00:41:16):\nAnd so actually, I want to thank you. It's funny, you messaged me as I was listening to a podcast you were on. I think it was the one with David Perell. \n\nLenny (00:41:26):\nYeah, I slid into your DMs.\n\nPaul Millerd (00:41:31):\nBut I was listening to your podcast and you were talking about hiring a community manager. And this is actually something I've done in the past few weeks. And I think I was scared to commit to the community because I didn't want to create a job for myself.\n\n(00:41:48):\nAnd one thing I've realized is that I'm scared of creating a job for myself, but I sort of reframed the cost of inaction. What's the cost of inaction is if I don't actually hire someone, I'm going to drain all my creative energy, and that's an existential risk to this path. And so that's one example of I'm always thinking about these things, and that enabled me to take very quick action on that. \n\n(00:42:17):\nBut I think it was helpful to hear from you. You were like, \"I'm not a community manager.\" And this is a big aha for me, because I launched my community at the beginning of this year. I suck at community management. I'm not good at it, but I found somebody that actually was good at it and I was like, \"There are people that like this and are good at it.\" So that's one thing. I think more broadly though is some fears don't disappear. So that's a very specific project-based fear.\n\n(00:42:47):\nExistential fears around health, death, importance, money, they don't really go away. I think the great thing about this path for me is that you can't pretend like they don't exist. They sort of just punch you in the face. You'll wake up one day and you'll have an existential breakdown of, \"What the heck am I doing? Is this sustainable? This is so silly. Am I going to run out of money? Next year, are my book sales going to tank?\" And so the longer I've been on this path, those big worries turn into these small little daily things that pop up. And I'll sort of have a conversation with my fear and I'll say, \"We're worrying about money today. Okay, I see you. Yeah, that's real. Yeah, I don't know if we can solve that, but yeah, six and a half years, let's keep going. Let's see if it works.\"\n\n(00:43:48):\nYeah, that's the thing that makes me feel better every time something like that comes up is, it's worked this long. It's probably going to work for a lot longer. There's this concept of [inaudible 00:43:56], of the time something is going to last is usually as long as it's already lasted. And so that always makes me feel better. The main thing I think about, is am I going to run out of stuff with a newsletter to write about? And it's been four years now. I'm like, \"Nah, it's probably going to keep going for at least four more years.\"\n\n(00:44:12):\nIt's very important to dance with your fears and really get in with them. If I'm afraid of not making money, it's very reasonable that book sales will fall. And so I don't know if we can sustain our lifestyle on what I have set up two, three years down the road. But taking that fear and saying, \"Okay, I'm going to solve that and make that fear go away by getting a job,\" is off the table. So I have no choice but to actually just be like, \"Yeah, that fear's going to be here. It's going to be part of my life, and we're going to have to just deal with it.\"\n\nLenny (00:44:52):\nAlong those lines, is there a path you took that was a big failure or didn't work out, something that you thought was going to be a big opportunity and wasn't?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:44:59):\nThe first 10 years of my career, I just kept jumping from job to job. I think I was looking for my current path in job shaped containers and I couldn't find it. And I was just so desperate to find a really good situation.\n\n(00:45:15):\nAnd there were all sorts of circumstances, like bosses who hired me, kept quitting immediately after I would join. Layoffs, all sorts of random things that happened that were very weird. And I just sort of kept searching. \n\nLenny (00:45:33):\nSo I've been comfortable with trying things, and starting new things, and experimenting for a long time. And so one frame I have, I call it ship, quit, and learn, which is what is the quickest way I can ship something designed to quit, but as soon as I ship it, I learn about what to do next?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:45:57):\nAnd so this is how I started my podcast. I just said, \"I'm going to do five episodes.\" I stole this from Tim Ferriss as well. I'm going to do five episodes. I'm going to see how it feels. And this is one of these things, super energizing. I love how I feel after podcast conversations. I'm going to keep doing it. I wasn't aiming at success, but it was like, \"I know I can keep doing the podcast and my newsletter.\" I had that experience, that feeling from it, but there are things I've tried that I'm like, \"Yeah, not again.\" A couple consulting and advisory type things early on in my path, it was like, \"Whoa, I need to build in protectors such that I don't take a gig like this again.\"\n\nLenny (00:46:39):\nI connect to something you said earlier, which I super resonate with, which is you want to avoid creating jobs for yourself that you don't enjoy with this path. There's so many things you could be doing and so many pulls that often, for me, it's like writing a book is always this thing that's out there. Actually, starting a podcast with one of these for a long time, \"I don't want to start a podcast. Life is good. I got this awesome newsletter. Things are going great. Why would I want more work?\"\n\n(00:47:05):\nEventually I crumbled, and I did it, and here we are, and I'm happy I did. But there's all these other things that are always like, \"I should do these things.\" But I think it's really important to pay attention to what do you not enjoy and don't do that. It's easy to create bad jobs for yourself.\n\n(00:47:19):\nA really clear example of that is finding a niche that you don't enjoy, spending time on in this life of writing about something you don't actually care about, or podcasting about something you don't care about. You just created a job for yourself you hate. Why would you do that? And so it comes back to paying attention to what gives you energy. \n\nPaul Millerd (00:47:37):\nSo I've created a lot of slack in my life. So I'd say 95% of my days, I cannot work. So I don't do meetings. I don't really have employees or anything like that. I have contractors, but I hire contractors for very specific roles. And I create systems such that we can do it asynchronously. And of course, I'll have conversations with them if they want to jump on a call. But I optimize for people that want asynchronous and work on those specific things. So I'm just very conscious of that.\n\n(00:48:15):\nI think one challenge I have now is I've created so many things that I'm doing a few things really well, and then sort of ignoring a lot of them. So I actually feel like I'm in this evolution right now of trying to figure out what comes next. \n\n(00:48:35):\nSo we haven't even talked about this, but I started this business strategy early on in my path because I wanted to productize my consulting. And one of the consulting projects I loved early on was training people on consulting skills. I did a training program for a consulting firm in Boston, and I was like, \"Ooh, I could turn this into an online course.\" And that has slowly built and evolved, and I do workshops now with companies. And that made most of my money from years two to five when I started moving away from project-based consulting.\n\n(00:49:13):\nAnd so the game I was playing was make money from that, don't focus on it too much, spend minimal time, don't try to maximize for success. Create a self-paced course, because I am not interested in making more money in a cohort-based course, because I just don't want to spend the time. And then use all the abundant time to write and explore, create podcasts, spend time with my wife, and do all the non-work experiments, see how I feel and write about it.\n\n(00:49:44):\nNow I'm making money from the work I love, which is very weird. I'm going to make, I'll hit soon about $200,000 made for my book, which is mind-blowing. I published a book completely on my terms about what I love and loved the process of it. It's so crazy. \n\nLenny (00:50:05):\nThat's amazing.\n\nPaul Millerd (00:50:06):\nAnd so now I'm building a community around that. That's really fun. I'm doing the podcast. I have some sponsors around that. And so that's sort of taking over. I still have this StrategyU though. \n\n(00:50:19):\nSo now I'm trying to figure out how to unwind some of these things. I'm actually exploring trying to find somebody that might want to start their own pathless path, like a strategy consultant that wants to leave that world, that wants to be an operator on this business. So if you're listening, I've recently come to terms with this might be the path forward. \n\n(00:50:38):\nBut yeah, it's a constant journey of protecting your time, creating that space, going down projects you want to execute, but then stepping back and like, \"Okay, I have all this maintenance I'm doing. How do I outsource this, eliminate it, restart, recreate?\" And I think this path is really just a commitment to constant reinvention, which is really, really hard. And you shouldn't do it unless you get some satisfaction out of personal reflection and that journey.\n\nLenny (00:51:09):\nFor someone that may want to help you with that program, what's the best way to reach out to you if they're just like, \"Oh shit, this is a cool opportunity\"?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:51:14):\nYeah, Twitter, paul@strategyu.co, or I'm very easy to find. My email is all over the place. But yeah.\n\nLenny (00:51:22):\nWe'll link to it in the show notes too. Just a couple more questions. I feel like one criticism of this path is, is there anyone left to actually do work at companies and build things and scale if everyone ends up being on this pathless path, creating content, starting their own companies? Do you have any thoughts on that side of things? \n\nPaul Millerd (00:51:42):\nI don't buy that, because I've met most people and most people are like, \"Hell no,\" when they hear about my life.\n\n(00:51:51):\nI think it's an interesting critique. I also think there's a more secular trend of gigification of work. All the growth in the economy from 2005 to 2015 in the labor market came from alternative work arrangements. So if you search David Deming's work on this, it's pretty compelling. Right now, we don't really count non-traditional work that well, so it's really hard to get good data on this. But even the way companies are treating their internal talent, it's much more project-based. People are shifting around, moving to different roles a lot quicker. And I think that's going to continue. \n\n(00:52:29):\nSo you could make an argument that people will actually be able to slot into companies more easily in the future. Right now, companies under exploit the creator economy and the freelance economy, because they're so tied to you have to hire somebody through a full-time job. \n\n(00:52:47):\nSo I think there's two sides to that, is one, most people would hate my life. And two, the world is becoming more giggified. So it could go back the other way actually. \n\nLenny (00:53:02):\nI really like that advice. Paul, is there anything else you want to leave listeners with to maybe start down this pathless path or any other piece of advice before we get to very exciting lightning round?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:53:14):\nI think the key thing that doesn't get talked about enough is it might be hard and it might suck, but it might be worth it. And I think that's a hard reframe for people, because people will say, \"Well, I'm worried about not knowing what I'll do or not making money and all these things.\" And it's like, yeah, I felt like after quitting my job. \n\n(00:53:44):\nBut man, I'm so glad I did it, because it enabled me to now know that I don't have regrets about trying this and figuring it out. And a lot of people that do go back to their jobs are so much happier, because they know I tested that, I found my boundaries, I need more stability. It's not this quit your job and get rich pitch. It's very much like if you're somebody that has a sense that there's something more, there probably is, and it might be worth exploring. \n\nLenny (00:54:17):\nWhat's the next step you recommend someone take to start exploring this pathless path? What's something they could do today or tomorrow or in the next-\n\nPaul Millerd (00:54:24):\nRead my book.\n\nLenny (00:54:26):\nPerfect. \n\nPaul Millerd (00:54:28):\nSo I'm very committed to creating resources for people around this. My podcast is all conversations of people on an unconventional path, and sort of the inner game of work. And I don't talk about tactics and outcomes as much as really just, how does it feel? How'd you deal with that? Things like that. And so I do that in my newsletter, my podcast, etc. But just find people that are on interesting pasts and ask them about their lives. \n\n(00:54:59):\nOne interesting thing I've had happen to me over the past few years is I've just met a much more wider diversity of people. I'm friends with people that work at restaurants, and work part time, and work weird schedules, and work nine months of the year and take three months off. And now it just feels so much more normal what I'm doing, because before all I knew was full-time workers. I was working all the time, and that's all you're surrounded by. So yeah, try to find the weirdos. \n\nLenny (00:55:30):\nAwesome. And for folks that want to check out your book, should I just Google The Pathless Path? \n\nPaul Millerd (00:55:34):\nPathlesspath.com. I just moved over everything last month. \n\nLenny (00:55:39):\nOkay, great. And then we'll link to all of these things in the show notes. With that Paul, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? \n\nPaul Millerd (00:55:46):\nI am ready. \n\nLenny (00:55:48):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:55:52):\nYeah, one is called The Great Work of Your Life. Sounds like a cheesy title, but that's actually a good resource for people that want to hear about people from history. Over the past several hundred years, different eras of people that really did design their life around work. It was really interesting, and that was a great book.\n\n(00:56:16):\nA second book I'd recommend, I actually really like Luke Burgis' book Wanting. That was another great personal story/deep dive into a nerdy topic. That's my favorite kind of book. That's the kind of book I wrote, which was personal memoir plus nerdy deep dive. And Luke Burgis' is really good too, more from a tech perspective, because he went down the startup path as well. Tut that's a great book. That was my favorite read of the year. \n\nLenny (00:56:44):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show? \n\nPaul Millerd (00:56:47):\nI struggle to answer this, because I'm not watching much TV. I did watch the Anthony Bourdain documentary. That was excellent. Talk about a pathless path, and the ups and downs, and the struggles, and the dark side of it. Man, that person was bringing forth what is inside of him and grappling with his demons at the same time. That was a powerful story worth watching.\n\nLenny (00:57:18):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you interview, say, contractors or anyone else you work with or hire? \n\nPaul Millerd (00:57:25):\nI'm always curious about, what makes you come alive? I want to work with people that are alive, and connected, and inspired. So the two people I'm working with right now, one's a podcast producer in Poland, but he's doing a bunch of other stuff around video. And he's super energized, used to be a lawyer, reinventing himself. The other person is also a former finance person in India, and she's two years into this self-employment journey. She's writing and exploring all these ideas. So yeah, I'm always looking for that energy first and skills second.\n\nLenny (00:58:03):\nIs there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:58:07):\nI really love the Nuna travel stroller. Super convenient for traveling.\n\nLenny (00:58:15):\nWe don't have the travel stroller, but we have the Nuna car seat.\n\nPaul Millerd (00:58:17):\nYeah, yeah, we have that one too. It fits. So we've brought that around the world. That's been super convenient. And then more on the tech side, I just got into the esim game. That was amazing. And then ChatGPT, I just created my own GPT to do podcast show notes automatically for me today. Took me an hour to train it, and it is incredible, so that's amazing. \n\nLenny (00:58:44):\nThat's awesome. I don't know if folks know, but there's a lennybot.com site that uses all of my podcast transcripts and newsletter to have a little bot that you could ask questions to. That's working actually, shockingly well. We're going to try using the new GPT thing that they just launched, where you can kind of train your own GPT and that'll be fun. And actually, a podcast listener reached out to me and offered to help build this thing, so that's a huge success story from this podcast. \n\n(00:59:12):\nNext question, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to, sharing with friends, finding really useful in work or in life?\n\nPaul Millerd (00:59:22):\nOne, coming alive over getting ahead. That's something I keep coming back to. I'm default skeptical of chasing achievement, and I use this to remind myself that it is about that personal energy versus extrinsic outcomes. \n\n(00:59:43):\nI'm very convinced from my own life experience that the extrinsic outcomes aren't going to do a ton for me. Sure, I need to make enough money. But when I'm in extended states of feeling alive and connected to everything I'm doing in my life, that's it. And I basically repeated this mantra to myself right before rejecting the book deal. It was like I did not feel good in the conversation with the people. They talked down to me, they told me that I probably wouldn't succeed, and it was like coming alive over getting ahead. Don't need their prestige. \n\nLenny (01:00:21):\nFinal question. You've been podcasting, I think, for six years. What's your best piece of advice for someone that wants to start podcasting, has maybe already been doing podcasting like myself, or being successful or anything along those lines?\n\nPaul Millerd (01:00:36):\nYeah. I think if you want to podcast to make money, it's probably not something you should get into. Even if you have an audience, it's probably not the best way. I think if you have a massive audience, it can work, but it takes a really long time. Podcast is the ultimate long game, so you need to find some intrinsic connection to what you're actually doing. If you don't love the conversations or the format you're doing, don't do it. \n\n(01:01:05):\nBut yeah, I would recommend more people start podcasts. I'm against... The New York Times says there's too many podcasts, but I take the opposing view. I don't think there's that many podcasts. If you ask people in their personal life out of tech bubbles, \"How many people in your life have a podcast?\" Now in Austin, a lot of people have podcasts, but yeah, most people don't have a podcast. Even if you do something like interview your parents or anything, it's such a cool, creative thing. It's free. It's free, and you can send it to everyone in the world. Podcasts and newsletters are incredible innovations. Let it rip. You had to get permission to do these things 10, 15 years ago. It's so great to be alive in today's world. \n\nLenny (01:01:52):\nI feel like when people say there's too much of say newsletters, too many podcasts, my answer is always there's always room for better newsletters and better podcasts. If you can deliver more useful, valuable, interesting stuff, people are going to pay attention. The bar just keeps rising is the challenge.\n\nPaul Millerd (01:02:08):\nYeah. It's also like do it for the sake of itself. Do it for the creative act. The creative act can be super meaningful in and of itself. I've lost money in my podcast over the lifetime of it. Love it. I don't care. I'm going to keep doing it. \n\nLenny (01:02:27):\nAnd also, the best stuff often comes from just doing it for yourself and then realizing, \"Wow, other people might find this interesting.\"\n\nPaul Millerd (01:02:33):\nYeah. I didn't start getting podcast feedback until the last two years when it started growing a lot more. I was sort of just doing it into the void. \n\nLenny (01:02:43):\nSpeaking of that, Paul, we've been on our own pathless path. I feel like we're going to send a number of folks on their pathless path. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more about what you're sharing in your journey, and how can listeners be useful to you? \n\nPaul Millerd (01:03:01):\nYeah, so I've been compiling a lot of my more recent stuff under pathlesspath.com, that will link you to my podcast, newsletter, community, and book. And I'm always willing to gift my book to anyone in the world who wants it. Just email me. I'll even send you a printed copy, if you don't have the money to do it. And I'm always happy to send bulk orders to people that want to gift it and do book clubs or things like that. And happy to send it at the author rate, which is about $4 per book.\n\n(01:03:34):\nAnd yeah, I am starting to explore the potential of selling my StrategyU business or finding an owner operator who might want to get some sort of profit sharing or something like that. It'd be interesting if there are former consultants that might be interested in something like that. \n\n(01:03:54):\nI don't know. I'm so bad at asking for help. I think if you want to share my book, that would be cool, because it is pretty neat to make money doing something from something I'm really proud of. \n\nLenny (01:04:08):\nGo buy The Pathless Path, available all online bookstores, I imagine. Paul, thank you so much for being here. \n\nPaul Millerd (01:04:15):\nAmazing. Keep going on your path too. I'm really inspired by how you're approaching your path and sharing your reflections too. \n\nLenny (01:04:23):\nI appreciate that. Bye everyone.\n\nPaul Millerd (01:04:25):\nAdios.\n\nLenny (01:04:28):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Founder-led sales | Pete Kazanjy (Founding Sales, Atrium)\n\n## Transcript\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:00:00):\nThe thing that I just like to encourage founders and product managers and what have you is just don't be afraid of sales. There's a lot of people out there who would love to tell you a story that it's magical or like, \"Oh, you've got to be a born seller,\" things like that and it's really not. Those people are just talking their book, if you will, and so just getting good at those behaviors, it's going to benefit you in a myriad of ways.\n\nLenny (00:00:26):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Pete Kazanjy. Pete is the author of my single favorite book on sales, called Founding Sales, which I point every B2B founder to. He also runs a huge community of salespeople called Modern Sales Pros. He's also the CEO and founder of Atrium, which is a SaaS product that helps you make your sales team more efficient through analytics and data. In our conversation, we focus on three things. One, why founders should be doing sales themselves for a long time before hiring your first salesperson and also when it's time to hire that first salesperson, we get into how to hire for your first salesperson, what to look for in their profile and the most common mistakes people make, and finally, we cover a bunch of tactical tips for getting better at sales. Pete didn't come from a sales background and he learned everything by just doing it, learning, researching, and repeating. I know that you'll learn a ton from this conversation. With that, I bring you Pete Kazanjy.\n\n(00:01:28):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC to your port can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious, and expensive.\n\n(00:02:14):\nEnter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?\n\nAshley Mulligan (00:02:53):\nAt least 40%.\n\nLenny (00:02:55):\nHow many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?\n\nAshley Mulligan (00:02:58):\nWell, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So, if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common considering customer files are chock full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n\nLenny (00:03:17):\nI am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding as one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to their aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n\nAshley Mulligan (00:03:32):\nTotally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and Zora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.\n\nLenny (00:03:49):\nIf you'd like to learn more or get started, check out Flatfile at flatfile.com/lenny. Pete, welcome to the podcast.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:04:00):\nHey, Lenny, super awesome to see you.\n\nLenny (00:04:03):\nEven more awesome on my part. Ever since I launched this podcast, I have always wanted to have you on it, we're finally here. We've been online buddies for a few years now, ever since I discovered your book, Founding Sales, which we're going to talk about, and it's just been a lot of fun knowing you, so thank you again for being here.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:04:20):\nThe quick story was Lenny had shipped his different genres of marketplaces and how to start the liquidity and growth and whatever and I was obsessed with it, and then somehow, I ran into you at Brianne Kimmel's SaaS School. I gave a presentation on Founder-led Selling and there was a scrum of people around me and I was talking about amazing writers and amazing content online and I referenced the series, and then you raised your hand and you were like, \"That was me,\" and I was like, \"What? You're amazing.\" And then we got beers and now, we're happily ever after.\n\nLenny (00:04:53):\nLook at us now. And then you encouraged me to make a book out of that post, which I have not yet done, maybe one day.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:05:00):\nEventually.\n\nLenny (00:05:00):\nEventually.\n\n(00:05:01):\nSo, we're going to be talking a lot about sales and a lot of the stuff that you cover in your book. Before we get into it, could you just take a minute to share a little bit about your background and some of the wonderful things you've done, to give folks a sense of your experience in the sales world?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:05:14):\nI think probably the most important thing to characterize for folks is that I don't actually have a background in sales originally, which were most sales leaders and sellers come from, they graduate from school or a BDR, become an AE, AE manager, or a BDR manager, and then go on to sales leadership. My background's actually in product marketing and product management. I started my tech career at VMware back in the day, tons of amazing, fun VMware diaspora. And then I started a software company called TalentBin, it was a recruiting software company in, geez Louise, 2009. We quickly realized that, \"Man, this B2B software stuff doesn't sell itself, irrespective of maybe what people say on the internet,\" at least back then. So, I had to be our first seller, our sales manager, our first sales leader, and that's where I learned how to do sales.\n\n(00:06:02):\nAlso, I just realized, \"Man, this isn't rocket surgery, anyone can learn this. If I can learn this, other people can learn this, even though there's not documentation on it.\" So, the software company was eventually acquired by Monster Worldwide in 2014 and then I wrote a book on sales for founders and other first-time sellers, it's called Founding Sales. Mainly, it was the book that I wish I had, rather than having to learn by a narrative from the first round capital portfolio and what have you. And then subsequent to that, I started what became the nation's largest sales operations and leadership community, it's called Modern Sales Pros. It's 30,000 sales operations, sales leaders, et cetera. And then started a new software company called Atrium that makes data-driven sales management software, and then here I am. So, I think a little bit about sales, turns out modern sales, not that old sales, modern sales.\n\nLenny (00:06:59):\nOoh, I'm curious to hear what that is. But before I ask you that question, I just wanted to mention your book, Founding Sales, is the book I give every founder that is trying to figure out sales. Every time I give it to them or point them to even your site that has it all for free there, they're always just like, \"Holy shit, this is exactly what I needed,\" so we're going to be covering a lot of that stuff in our little chat.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:07:20):\nRad.\n\nLenny (00:07:20):\nCan you actually just briefly talk about what is modern sales versus what you called traditional sales or old-school sales?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:07:25):\nOh, I just think that there's a little bit of a mindset change. It's a little bit related to some of the reasons why founders and other folks maybe have this perception of sales be like, \"Ew, sales, ugh\" because people, their only experience with sales is Glengarry Glen Ross or movies with a sleazy used car salesman and stuff like that, whereas the way to think about what sellers are is they're the microeconomic agents in the market that bring supply to demand rather than waiting for demand to find supply. They have supply in their back pocket and they run around trying to find people who ought to have the demand, maybe they have the demand right now, maybe they don't realize that they have the demand, and then they elucidate to them why they ought to have the demand.\n\n(00:08:08):\nSo, A, that process is very important from a technology deployment standpoint and also, B, it's very measurable, especially in a modern environment with modern CRMs and also all the digital activity that we do, email, calendar, phone, Zoom, et cetera, all this information is now being recorded such that you can then measure, manage, and improve behavior. So, very similar to how back in the day, you do product analytics by licking your fingers and sticking it in the wind, and then Mixpanels showed up, then Amplitude showed up, then so on and so forth, and the same is the case in sales, as well. So, modern sales is a more thoughtful, operational, rigorous, analytical bent, it's been around for a while. It's one of those things, the future is here, it just wasn't widely distributed, but now it's being much more distributed and much more embraced. Like the pre-Moneyball moment in sports and baseball to the post-Moneyball moment, we're now just flipping over there, so that's the delta.\n\nLenny (00:09:17):\nAwesome. I definitely want to talk about ways to get better at sales and things you've learned about just how to improve at sales, but to set a little bit foundation for that conversation, I want to talk about founder-led sales. You touched on this topic, your book is basically named after this concept of founder-led sales. Can you talk about what that is, why it's so important, and maybe why founders often get this wrong?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:09:37):\nThe way that I think about the book, Founding Sales, I like to think of it as the sequel to Eric Eric Ries's The Lean Startup or Steve Blank's Four Steps to the Epiphany or Startup Owner's Manual or whatever, where if you think about the stages, and this is all B2B, if you think about the stages that a product goes through, it's one, you've got to know what problem you're solving and validate that, and it's got to be real. It can't be like, \"Oh, well, I thought I had this problem,\" it's got to be validated. That's customer development, that's customer research, and that's more of a product management function. And then there's building the minimum feature set in order to prove that maybe technology can fit to this problem and solve it.\n\n(00:10:26):\nThat's how we create value as technologists, is piecing together technology and code or bits and atoms and what have you in order to solve a problem that people have. But then the next step is like, \"Cool. Now, I've got to get someone to pay for this and I've got to do that in a reliable fashion and I've got to do it in a scalable fashion,\" and so there's a little bit of a loop there. It's not like, \"The product's done, throw it over the wall, have fun, kids.\" It's a loop, where the minimum viable version of your product is probably going to suck and then in order to get to the minimum valuable step, you've got to be interfacing with a lot of customers and that's a sales behavior, getting in front of people and being like, \"Hey, I think you probably have this problem if you look like these other folks right here.\"\n\n(00:11:11):\nThe point is is that you can't outsource that behavior, the founder's got to do that stuff. A lot of people ask me that question, \"Well, I suck at sales,\" or, \"I'm afraid to talk to people,\" or, \"Interfacing with non-friendly parties makes me uncomfortable.\" The way to think about it is, I forget who the person was who said, \"Startups versus incumbents is a race between can innovation get to distribution before distribution can get to innovation?\" So, this is a related concept where as a founder, it's going to be way easier for you to get good, or minimally viable good, at selling by having interactions with non-friendly parties and having commercial conversations and asking for money in exchange for the value delivery.\n\n(00:11:58):\nIt's going to be easier for you to do that than it is for some third party to become as expert at the subject matter that you're tackling that you are. Because as a founder, early on, use Atrium as an example, we make data-driven sales management software, which it exists to help sales managers and teams use metrics and data to improve the performance of their reps. The way I think about it is Datadog-y Amplitude-y, but for your sales reps. I'm probably the expert in sales analytics in the world, and so back in 2016 and 2017 when we were doing this, put aside the fact that I already know how to do minimum viable selling, if I had tried to get somebody else expert at that in order for them to go out and do that in the market, that would have been not good.\n\n(00:12:46):\nThis is why Steve Blank always talks about startups can't get to scale without firing their first VP of sales, it's oftentimes because they skip that step, and so the founder's like, \"Hey, man, I'm going to pour a little bit of sales on this, hire some sales leader or whatever, some sort of seller, and outsource this.\" You really just can't do that, not for the first couple dozen customers, it's just not tenable. You lose that feedback loop, you lose the learnings of whether or not your message fits the market, all that sort of stuff. You're playing a game of telephone with that with a third party seller versus even you just want to keep that in one brain to start, then package it, and then when you have a repeatable while loop, a selling while loop, then package it and hand it to someone else. So, that's my diatribe on why founders have to do this.\n\nLenny (00:13:35):\nI was going to try to summarize the reasons that you should be doing this and it sounds like there's so many. One is figure out what you should actually be building, that's a reason founders should be selling, two is learn how to position and pitch and sell, three is figure out what you could teach your salesperson when you hire them. Is that a summary of why you should be selling as a founder for a while?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:13:55):\nYeah, for sure. One, it's going to help you with your product development because you're not going to have that abstracted, for sure, two, you're going to be the person who's going to figure out how to talk about it in an effective way, and then three, it's going to make it such that you can package that up such that other human... Because that's the way that B2B startups scale, is it's not WhatsApp or Twitter or Airbnb or whatever, where you have this scalability via marketing, the way that B2B organizations scale primarily is by adding more salespeople who then have customer-facing meetings with prospects.\n\n(00:14:32):\nAnd then you cap out with the number of hours that are in the week, there's only four or 50 hours in the week, especially as a seller because you interface with other people during business hours, and so the way that you scale up is by just adding more salespeople. So, that's why packaging that up is really important, because then you're going to shove it into the brains of two more salespeople, and then once they're successful, you're going to go to four, and then once they're successful, you're going to go to eight, and then once they're successful, you're going to go to 16.\n\nLenny (00:15:00):\nYou talk about this while loop concept, which I love. What are signs that it's time to hire your first salesperson? It begs the question, when do I do this?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:15:10):\nI'm not a software engineer, but I like to use technical metaphors with technical audiences because I think it's helpful, so it's like when it runs on your local, now it's time to see if it reproduces over here, so if it reliably runs on your local and it doesn't air out, so then what would the definition of not erroring out look like? So, generally speaking, it is to contingent on your sales motion, but it's going to be that you can reliably, at a pretty okay win rate, so maybe 15% or 20% or 25%, turn first meetings into eventual customers and do that in a reliable fashion. It's not like, \"I engaged 10 arms-length parties and I got two customers closed.\" It's like, \"Hey, that's great. That's a good start. 5X that, 10X that.\"\n\n(00:16:08):\nTake 50 at-bats, take 100 at-bats, and now that you know that you reliably, for every cohort of ten first meetings, what's known in sales land as opportunities, for every cohort of 10 that you engage, are you closing 1, are you closing 1.5, are you closing 2, or are you closing 2.5, if you're in there? But if you're at like, \"For every 30 I interact with, I close one,\" well, it seems like that's probably pretty inefficient, unless you're selling $500,000 deals or something like that. So, it's at the point where it feels like it's statistically significant, it feels like it's repeatable, because what you're going to then do is now it feels like it's a safe bet to try to abstract that out to somebody else.\n\n(00:16:54):\nBecause the only way we're going to get to success is we're not going to have Lenny go and sell from morning, noon to night. What we're going to do is we're going to take the information out of Lenny's brain and we're going to put it into slides and we're going to put it into scripts and we're going to put it into email templates and all that sort of stuff, and then we're going to shove that into the brain of two more reps and see if now we can get it to run in the cloud, in the sales cloud here. And then to start out, it may fail, the same way you're like, \"Cool, it runs on my local. Uh-oh, it breaks over here. Why?\" And then that's the next stage is now you're figuring out how to get those other folks to sell as successfully as you have, and that becomes the next job.\n\n(00:17:39):\nActually, this is the presentation I gave at Brianne's SaaS School, if you Google it's just called Founder-led Selling, it's available online. Essentially, there's a bunch of stages in the B2B maturity journey and you have to go through them in order to get to the next one, if you jump stages, you're hosed. So, in this case, if you know that you can reliably sell this yourself, that's great. Then, the next thing to do is get at least a couple people reliably selling, as well as you, not 10, because you're never going to get 2 successful if you're trying to onboard 10 concurrently. And then if you get those 2 successful, now you've earned the right to go to 4, 8, et cetera.\n\nLenny (00:18:21):\nI love this heuristic that you shared that you want to get to about 15 to 25% of contacts closing to a customer. I see you shaking your thumb. I think that's really useful. So, it's a bit less than a third and doing 50 to 100 attempts is roughly where you want to be?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:18:39):\nYeah. Importantly, what you don't want to do is, and I think probably a lot of the product managers who like to listen to Lenny's Podcast here might appreciate this, is you want to bring on cohorts of users and then see what's going on, then learn, and then bring on new co cohorts of users. So, going and doing 100 at-bats and then being like, \"Did it work or did it not?\" Versus, \"Hey, let's have 10 for prospect and try to get 10 first meetings,\" have all those interactions, see how your conversations land, see how the discovery questions are evoking the right response or not the right response, see how your slides land, see how your demo lands, all that sort of stuff.\n\n(00:19:15):\nIf it's working well and you're getting to the next stage, \"This is great, I would love to introduce you to my boss,\" that's a good sign. If it's like, \"I'm just not getting it.\" Cool, back to the drawing board, versus doing 100 all at once and being like, \"Now, did it work?\" We want to break it up and then constantly just be iterating, iterating, iterating. Again, I think your audience might appreciate this, the way to think of a sales motion, so sales motion is a fancy-pants way of describing just all the things that you do in order to take a prospect and bring them through the sales process and then eventually close them. One helpful way to think about it is kind of like software and what you want to be doing is constantly updating it. Oh, that was a really interesting question that the prospect asked right there, I didn't have a good answer for it and moreover, I didn't have a slide for it.\n\n(00:20:04):\nYou know what I should do? I should make a slide that handles that objection so I can show it to them visually and also, it'll help give me guardrails and a talk track and that'll be nice. So, I'm going to do that and then I'm going to update the source code. Now, my sales motion has been updated. And then the next loop through, ideally the next time that person says, \"Oh, I don't know, Lenny, it doesn't really sound like X, Y, Z,\" you're like, \"Oh, a lot of people say that, but here, if you look over here, you can see this.\" \"Oh yeah, that's a really good point.\" \"Wonderful. So, as the next step, let's go ahead and talk to your boss.\" So, now your sales motion has been updated and the collateral's been updated and now, we're being more effective sellers. You're just going to do that dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of time before you have a repeatable sales motion.\n\nLenny (00:20:55):\nWhat's interesting is with this heuristic, two-thirds of the time, it's not going to work out.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:20:59):\nNope.\n\nLenny (00:21:00):\nSo, a lot of times, they're going to be like, \"Ah, I don't get this, leave me alone.\" Is there other leading indicators that tell you that you're improving, knowing that only a third or maybe a fifth of the time it'll work out? Is it talking to the boss off more often, what else do you look for?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:21:13):\nYeah, exactly. Totally. So, what are the leading indicators of success? Because if you're only looking at lagging indicators, again, it's probably a it's a funnel on a new feature, so the opportunity is an at-bat or a potential transaction, and so usually what you do is you model out the stages in your opportunity. So, generally, there will be different stages depending on the sales motion. So, use Atrium as an example, we sell on customer data. It takes five minutes to turn on an Atrium account, it's really helpful for folks. They just sign in, they OAuth with Salesforce, great. So, a really important stage in our sales motion is, we call it data light, has data been lit up? So, that's a stage, we have a discovery stage, we have a data light stage, we have what we call a preview stage, are we previewing it with the staff? Then, we get to a commercial discussion.\n\n(00:22:08):\nSo, you can measure how you're getting to those stages, which is somebody lands on whatever page that Lenny was in charge of at Airbnb and did they click on the right thing and do they get to the next thing and did they get to the next thing, get to the next thing? So, in sales, it's kind of the same thing. So, the more sophisticated version of this is looking at stage conversions, what have you, the less sophisticated version of it, which early on, I think is an appropriate way of doing it, is like, \"Hey, man, are we getting second dates?\" So, just metaphorize it to Hinge or Coffee Meets Bagel or whatever the more recent one is, it's like, \"Are we getting the second dates? Are we getting the third dates? Because if we're not getting the second dates, probably something's amiss there.\"\n\n(00:22:51):\nSo, what we want to do is we want to say, \"Great, of all of our ten first meetings, how many gets to second meetings?\" It would be great, the lagging indicator is 2 wins out of 10 or what have you, but I'm going to come into these conversations and out of my ten first meetings, I want seven of them to get to the second meeting. And then of those seven, maybe I want 4.5 of them to get to the third meeting, and then ultimately, I want 2 or 3 to win. That's the way to think about that, those are the leading indicators. So, as those conversions get better like, \"Man, I'm not getting any second dates. Oh, okay, cool, you need a haircut or you need a shower,\" and the same applies to your sales motion, as well. Your message is not landing, you're targeting the wrong people, what's going on here? You need to think about it.\n\nLenny (00:23:42):\nYou need a better pickup line.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:23:43):\nThere you go. Now, you're not even getting first dates, man, go all the way up to you need a better Hinge profile picture. You're just not getting any matches, ew.\n\nLenny (00:23:55):\nAs a founder, do you have to get good at sales? A lot of founders are like, \"Oh my God, we're going to do PLG. We're going to be self-serve, freemium, we don't need sales. I'm just going to let people figure it out.\" Is it a requirement of a B2B business to get good at sales as a founder?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:24:11):\nI would say you don't have to get good at it, you just have to get non-zero at it. There's this really great article on Lenny's newsletter on adding a sales organization to a self-serve product that Lenny had me write and then he edited the heck out of it, and it's really a fantastic asset. But what I would say there is that there are a lot of PLG or self-serve motions out there that they've stagnated themselves because they didn't add the sales piece to it. I would encourage people to read that article, I forget what it's called, you added a really cool name.\n\nLenny (00:24:47):\nOh, The Transition: Layering on Sales to Product-led Growth.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:24:51):\nSee, you're good at naming things.\n\nLenny (00:24:54):\nThat's inspired by David Sack's The Cadence, which I love for how to operate.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:24:58):\nThere you go. That is a great article. So, it's not that you have to be great, you just have to recognize that it's important. A good example of this would be, probably the most famous example of an organization that maybe didn't get sales religion as quickly as they should have would be Dropbox. Dropbox has phenomenal early sales leadership. One of our investors here at Atrium is a gentleman named Mike Marg, he's a partner at Craft Ventures, he was an early sales manager and leader there, Kyle Parrish was the head of sales at Figma, Marissa Fuhrer is over at Figma, as well. There's all these just absolutely fantastic Dropbox folks, but the problem was is that the organization, from a product standpoint, never put all as many calories behind product development that would support the ability to sell to across an entire organization.\n\n(00:25:48):\nSo, the way that I try to succinctly describe that is never mistake your lead gen for your business. I think the good news is that a lot of people took a lot of lumps there and folks have learned that, maybe Slack almost missed that, but then they brought in a bunch of Salesforce folks and other folks, actually, Mike Marg was also an early sales manager at Slack, as well, and really got a religion around that. Because it turns out that people paying 19 bucks a month or 29 bucks a month or what have you is really great, but getting to a $50,000 or a $100,000 or a $250,000 contract, that's where big ARR numbers start racking up, and organizations want to talk to a human in order to navigate that.\n\n(00:26:34):\nSo, PLG is great for landing and permeating an organization and there's a bunch of great... Craft invests in this like crazy, so Scratchpad is a great example of very bottoms-up. Atrium's pretty bottoms up, as well. It's like, I don't know, what is the Silicon Valley joke, middle out or whatever, because we land with sales managers and SDR managers. What you're doing is you're solving the problem that the user has, but the problem is the user doesn't necessarily have large budgetary authority, so you can get them stoked up, but then you've got to talk to the person who's got the purse strings, and so that's going to require sales. That's okay.\n\nLenny (00:27:13):\nJust to punctuate that, basically 100% of B2B companies end up building a sales team?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:27:20):\nI would say that's the case. It's more of a question of when versus if, so even the really famous ones like Atlassian. Atlassian, they had a sales organization, they just didn't call it a sales organization and they went pretty far without a lot, but instead what they did was they just priced the product breathtakingly low. I think developer tools can oftentimes do this, where because developers are pretty technical, they can adopt product, they don't need handholding in order to adopt a product that is complicated enough to be valuable. Datadog's a good example or New Relic or AppD, but even those guys very early on had meaningful sales organizations. There's a lot of reasons why Datadog ended up winning that market, but their sales organization is no joke. Even developer tools, you might think, cool, well, the developers can just swipe their credit cards. Yeah, they can, but then you're going to be eventually capped there. Look at Snowflake. Snowflake has, I don't know, 500 salespeople, you're going to need a sales org.\n\nLenny (00:28:28):\nLet's shift a bit to talking about just how to get better at sales, at the scale of sales. I think it's interesting because you don't have a sales background and so you've had to learn how to do this and you did a lot of research and building your business, you've had to get really good at sales. So, maybe a first question, what's the number one tip that you have for getting better at sales?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:28:50):\nThe first chapter of Founding Sales talks about what I call sales mindset changes. Because I think the big thing is it's just so weird, it's just such a weird shift in behavior. Because if you think about it as a product manager or as an engineer or whatever, how many people do you interact with day-to-day? Oh, 6, 10 maybe.\n\nLenny (00:29:10):\nNot too many.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:29:11):\nIt's always the same people and so it's super comfortable, whereas in sales or anything customer facing, what ends up happening is you're meeting multiple new humans every day, if you're doing it right, and that just is such a mindset shift. You're not going to be able to remember everybody. You're going to have to write it all down. You're going to have to use the CRM for that. You're in the starting blocks on the track. You're in the starting blocks and you have 90 seconds or a couple minutes to form rapport, to make somebody feel like they should trust you and they want to be honest with you. You have to be very focused on activity orientation, whereas engineering and product management, there's does a lot of super deep work.\n\n(00:29:52):\nIt's like Paul Graham's Maker versus Manager Schedule. Salespeople have manager schedules, interestingly enough, where what you're doing is you're constantly contact switching, an ideal salesperson's calendar or a founder who's doing sales is 2, 3, 4, maybe 5 customer-facing meetings a day with different humans. And then moreover, then you're having incremental interactions with those folks later on, like later that week or the next week or what have you, so then you have to keep continuity of these multiple parallel conversations. It's a totally different set of skills and so it feels super weird to start out, but what ends up happening is it's just a skill. You just start doing it, you start doing it, you start doing it, and you just become used to it, you become calloused. You're like, \"I'm incorrigible now. You put me in an elevator, I can talk to anyone.\"\n\n(00:30:43):\nSo, one, just recognizing it's going to be a pretty big mindset change, and then the second thing you can do is then once you know that there's going to be a mindset change, is you can focus in on making those behaviors be better. So, as an example, one of the things I challenge my staff to do is I call it turbo rapport, it needs a better name. But think about people that you interact with in the world who maybe are a little shields up, they're probably used to interacting with people who are not going to be super nice to them, maybe it's bartenders or a flight attendant or a barista, or fill in the blank. Think about how quickly you can become friends with them, how you can break that down, because that's going to be a really good skill for you to have when you're interacting with a prospect.\n\n(00:31:31):\nAnd then what that's going to allow you to do is then ask them candid questions about their current situation that either, A, they may know about or, B, you ask provocative questions that make them think about the world in a way maybe that you want them to and realize that they have pain they didn't want or didn't know that they had. My friend, Brett Burson, had this great tweet one at one point where he said, \"Think about the things that you do in your day-to-day that are like a pianist, like a piano player, playing scales like, 'Da, da, da, da, da, da.' What is the version of that for selling?\" That's rapid rapport building, asking good questions, asking follow-up questions, being willing to ask uncomfortable questions, all those sort of things, and asking for money and then shutting up and waiting for them to answer, all these are very uncomfortable things, but the more you do them, you'll just get good at them.\n\nLenny (00:32:31):\nThis episode is brought to you by Merge.

Can you talk a bit about that?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:33:44):\nI think this is like the, remember the modern sales versus old-school sales thing?\n\nLenny (00:33:44):\nMm-hmm.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:33:50):\nThe old-school sales thing is like, \"I'm going to sell something to a mark,\" or the best example of this, \"That guy's a great sales guy, he can sell ice to an Eskimo.\" It's like, \"Man, if you're selling ice to an Eskimo, you're an asshole. What is wrong with you? They don't need ice,\" unless they're visiting Southern California. So, as a seller, the way that I like to frame it to people is that you're a consultant that has a particular predilection for a given solution, your solution. Use Atrium as an example. Atrium's minimum ICP is probably SDRs plus AEs in an organization should probably be at 10 all the way up to 300. So, if someone shows up and they're like, \"Man, I've got to get really good at sales, I need to buy your software, Pete,\" and I'm like, \"Cool. How many salespeople do you have?\" They're like, \"I have one.\" I'll be like, \"Man, I'm not going to sell you Atrium. You're just going to be unhappy, it's going to be dumb, it's going to be a waste of our customer success resources, you're going to churn,\" all those sort of things.\n\n(00:34:56):\nBut if instead what you're doing is you're saying, \"Hey, I'm going to go out in the market and I'm going to find the people that have a high proclivity that our technology solves and then I'm going to talk with them about how they're solving that problem right now, and ideally, through a series of questions, I'm going to reveal that to them that they're doing it probably not great. And then once I've revealed to them the fact, through this directed questioning, what's known as discovery, that they have this high magnitude problem, that it is causing them lots of money, that it is a pain in their ass, and then I reveal to them that there is a better way of approaching it and magically enough, I happen to be a representative of that solution,\" well, now that's an ideal transaction and everybody wins. And then scale that up across an entire economy and you can see why I was saying that sales is the grease that makes the economy work like that and also importantly, brings new technology to the market in a way that makes everything better.\n\nLenny (00:36:01):\nIf someone's listening to this and they're like, \"I want to get better at sales, what's one thing I could do differently tomorrow, this week, to improve my ability to sell my product?\" What would that be?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:36:12):\nThere's the non-complicated version and there's the complicated version. The non-complicated version would just be just walking down the street, make eye contact with everybody, and then every person that you stop next to at Starbucks or the crosswalk or whatever, just strike up a conversation with them, figure out a mechanism by which you can start a conversation with them. Compliment their shirt or their shoes or remark on something. Don't use the weather, because that's lazy, but figure that out, so that's the first version. Probably the more sophisticated version is just be very, very tight on your ICP, just be very, very, very crisp around who has your problem and why. Being more crisp around that and then having that understood is a great way of making sure that you're not wasting time on people who don't have your problem and that you're doing more of those loops with people who are right in the white-hot center. So, one is a behavioral thing and one is a more thoughtful thing.\n\nLenny (00:37:07):\nThat's great. Can you actually explain ICP briefly, because a lot of people may not know that term?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:37:11):\nThank you. So, ICP stands for Ideal Customer Profile. Actually, it's important to think about there's two things in a B2B sales motion, there's the characteristics of the account, which is the company that's going to buy, and then there's the characteristics of the human and the personas that you're going to be interacting with. Let's use Amplitude as an example. Amplitude's ICP would probably be organizations that make software products, that probably have at least a couple of product managers, because if there's a single product manager, it might be too much, they might be at the point where they don't need a full-blown enterprise analytics suite, and that's probably it. And then on the human side, who are the people who participate in that conversation? Well, the product managers are going to be the ones who are going to be the users, but engineering is probably involved in order to make sure that Amplitude can talk to the cloud data warehouse and so on and so forth, and then moreover, the person who owns the budget might be the VP of product, not the product manager, or it might be the VP of engineering or the CTO.\n\n(00:38:18):\nSo, those three different folks that we talked about there, it's different humans. Ideal customer profile is understanding what those parameters look like for looking at an organization in order to say, \"Man, that's an awesome op, let's go get in front of them,\" versus, \"Eh, I don't know if that's a very good opportunity, maybe let's pass on that,\" and then the personas are, \"Great, that's an awesome op right there. I know that I'm going to have my first conversation with Lenny, but with an intention that I'm eventually going to get to the VP of product at Airbnb, and that's Suzy over here. And then once we get validation from her, then I know that the VPE over here is Frank,\" and knowing who the personas are. So, that's what ICP and personas are.\n\nLenny (00:39:06):\nAwesome. There's a template that you've created that helps you lay out your ICP, so we'll try to link to it in the show notes. I have to find it again.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:39:13):\nNice. Sounds good.\n\nLenny (00:39:15):\nSo, we've talked about founder-led sales and how founders should be starting sales, we've talked about just how to get better at sales as a founder, as anyone. I want to talk now about hiring salespeople.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:39:27):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:39:28):\nGreat mug, by the way, Coffee is for Closers. I love it. Can people buy that online or is that just a one-off?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:39:36):\nThis is a Modern Sales Pros mugs. I think we have a bunch of Yetis that we give away for Atrium, as well, but we're big onto sales jokes here because you have to... We stole this from New Relic, being very user-centric in your swag, so I've got my Sales Nerds jacket on here, I've got my Let's Get It hat here, I've got my Coffee is for Closers mug. These are all inside sales jokes that maybe your audience won't necessarily get, or maybe they will, but our audience very much gets them. They're like, \"Oh man, your hat's so funny. Can you send me one?\" I'm like, \"No problem. You should buy our software.\"\n\nLenny (00:40:11):\nLove it. So, hiring salespeople, we've talked a bit about a lot of these things, like maybe when it's time to hire a salesperson when you're closing a fourth or fifth of your opportunities when this while loop is kicking in. So, in terms of the who to find for this first sales role, and you mentioned that VP of sales are often let go, it's a very high rate of not working out, is that true?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:40:33):\nYeah. Again, this is mapped out in the Founder-led Selling presentation and then also in Founding Sales, the book. Generally, what you want to do is you probably don't want to start with a VP of sales to start, a sales leader, and there's a couple of reasons why there. Even if you figured it out yourself, that's required, you have to get to that minimum sufficiency of 10, 20, 30 customers yourself first. But then the reason why I advocate for folks to hire a couple of sellers or a couple of AEs to start is because, again, you have that software in your brain. Unfortunately, there is no GitHub for sales motions, and so it's in your brain, it's in your documents, et cetera, and so now, you're going to teach these other folks. So, what you want to do is you want to hire a couple early-stage pioneer sellers to take that sales motion.\n\n(00:41:30):\nThe downside of seeking to hire a VP of sales or a head of sales, or what have you, who actually is a head of sales is coming out of an organization where maybe he or she is a manager of managers or manages eight reps or something like that, is that person hasn't been selling for a hot second. I think actually Jason Lemkin had a pretty funny tweet about this the other day where he was like, \"Hiring the VP of sales who's been there and done that before, why exactly does she want to do it again?\" Like, \"Oh, you scaled up a Datadog or Figma or whatever, you should come to my crappy little startup,\" it's like, \"I'm professionally rich.\" So, instead, the great folks to look at are the deputies or those early-stage sellers.\n\n(00:42:18):\nSo, the example I always use here, my last software company was in recruiting, so if you have a new recruiting technology, my buddy, Troy, runs this recruiting software company called Guide. They make this really cool, guided, hey, hiring process for candidates, whatever, but they sell to recruiting organizations. So the early-stage sellers that he would be interested in would probably be early people at Lever or Greenhouse who sell to the same persona, probably around the same average selling price, but ideally, not an AE who joined Greenhouse last year or two years ago.\n\n(00:42:59):\nGreenhouse just has a phenomenal sales organization, their sales leadership is absolutely fantastic, the gentleman who's the CRO over there is a good friend of mine, Sean Murray. But early-stage selling takes early-stage sellers or people who have been there, because you're not going to have all the collateral, slides and scripts and whatever aren't going to be all buttoned up and with a bow around them, and so looking for those early-stage, grimier, grittier sellers is a more effective way of going about that. Those are the folks that you want to look for once you've gotten to that statistical significance of your own selling capacity.\n\nLenny (00:43:37):\nTo make that just even clearer, the suggestion is if you're, say, a Series A founder, what's a profile of a person you look for? You said it's a deputy at a successful sales org?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:43:48):\nI'll give you a couple examples. I don't know, say you're doing some sort of design tool, I would go look at the Figma sales organization and I would look at some of the earlier sellers who were there maybe two years ago or three years ago or what have you, maybe you could consider getting a sales manager there who's not super far from selling. A great example of this is there's this woman, Marissa Fuhrer, who works at Figma, she's absolutely fantastic. She works on the enterprise team there and she was at Dropbox previously as a seller for a long time.\n\n(00:44:24):\nShe would be a great profile for someone who's not too far from having sold and is willing to roll up her sleeves, but ideally, that would probably be the person who you'd want to hire after you've hired those couple of sellers and gotten them to success. Because the other thing, too, with Marissa, she's probably going to look at your organization and be like, \"Cool. Prove to me that your product fits the market, because I don't want to necessarily take a bet on you,\" and then you would say, \"Well, in addition to having a 25% win rate with me, I have these two sellers right here and they both have 20% win rates and you can see that they're both closing $50,000 of bookings a month, all I need you to do is scale it up.\" In which case, that early stage head of sales is like, \"Let's do it.\"\n\nLenny (00:45:10):\nShe's about to get a bunch of LinkedIn requests.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:45:13):\nShe's great. This is one of the things that we really love at Atrium, is we have really great customers. We're creating a new category of software and so it's one of those things where more advanced, more modern sales managers and leaders really get it, that's how it always is in category creation. But when you find the people who really get it and really get it, they turn out to be awesome. That's one of the things that just makes startups fantastic.\n\nLenny (00:45:40):\nWhat's a sign that maybe it's not working out when you hire your either first salesperson or maybe first five, what are signs? Because you said it often does not work out, what are early signals like, \"We should rethink this\"?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:45:56):\nThis is another reason why it's really important to do it yourself to start, but presuming that you've been able to close business on a reliable basis, again, with arm's length prospects, it can't be Lenny's mother-in-law buying my software-\n\nLenny (00:46:13):\nHuge fan, for real, actually, she is.\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:46:17):\nGod bless, but she's not ICP for Atrium. This is the danger of doing revenue trades in your accelerator or whatever, it's not real. So, if you have done that and you've sold 20 or 30 deals, you know it can be done, we have an existence proof of this. So, if someone else can't do it the way that you do it, and this is why hiring two folks to start is effective, you don't want to hire just one, maybe three, but four, it's like, \"Ugh, that's a lot to manage,\" at least to start. So, if you have done that and the person, their win rates are poor or their activity levels are poor, things like that, those are usually indicators that it's not work out, that they're not getting those second dates, they're not getting those third dates, but importantly, they have to have the materials in question.\n\n(00:47:11):\nDid you create the slide deck? Did you take people through and did you give it to them? Did you take all the discovery questions that were in your brain and write them down into a Google Doc or a Notion page or what have you? Do you have a demo script for them? If those things are not present, then probably no one's going to be successful, or at least they're going to have to rederive all that stuff that you already did. But if you have all those precursors and it's not sticking for someone, that's probably a good leading indicator that they're not going to work out\n\nLenny (00:47:38):\nHow much time do you give these folks before you make a decision?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:47:42):\nThis is why it's so, so, so important to look at leading indicators. This is something that we just think about all the time here at Atrium, from a instrumentation and data-driven sales management, is if someone's not having customer-facing meetings, if they're low activity, you're never going to win anything. If you have a 50% win rate on two opportunities in a month, that's probably still not going to be super helpful unless you have a very, very, very high deal size. So, looking at those leading indicators like, \"Are they having first meetings? Are they having second meetings? What does their email volume look like? Are they progressing things through, are they getting things to proposal, and then eventually, are things closing?\"\n\n(00:48:24):\nI do a bunch of masterclasses for Atrium on data-driven sales management and one of them is on ramping. It's called Ramping For Success, I forget the name of the masterclass, but looking at those leading indicators like opportunity inflow, \"Is a person putting meetings on their calendar, are they progressing them? Are they being active in the meantime?\" Those are all really good leading indicators. If somebody's not getting first meetings on the calendar, you know within a month, it's like, \"Cool, this isn't working out.\"\n\n(00:48:54):\nNow, if they're not getting to second or third meetings, but they are getting those first meetings, well, now you know you've got a different problem, which they're getting those first dates, but they're not getting a second date and they're not getting a second date the same way that you were, maybe that's a coaching issue or maybe it's just a behavioral problem that's that you're not going to be able to surmount. But the point is having instrumentation on the most leading indicator possible gives you eyes onto whether or not things are working or not and you can make judgements fast, because the worst possible situation is nine months in, you're like, \"Man, it's not working.\" It's like, \"Man, I bet if you looked at the leading indicators, you would have known two months in this wasn't working.\"\n\nLenny (00:49:33):\nI like that you gave us a bottom end of the range like, \"In a month, you should be able to know, a lot of times.\" What would be the max by which like, \"If things are going okay, by six months, it's probably going to be good,\" or what is that timeframe?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:49:46):\nOh, where you know you're successful?\n\nLenny (00:49:48):\nYeah. It sounds like maybe from a month to some future month, this is a period where you can get a sense of this person is going to work out. What's that range, in your mind?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:49:58):\nIt's almost like you're continuously monitoring. In the first month, maybe you spend that time onboarding the rep, teaching them, going through mock discovery conversations, mock demos, et cetera, having them ride along with you. In the second month, we would expect them to have 10 first meetings or maybe 20 first meetings and we would expect 50% of those to get to the second meetings, and we would measure those things. In the third month, we would expect some subset of those first meetings and second meetings that happened in the second month to get to a proposal, to get to a commercial conversation, and then maybe we would expect some of the deals in that month to close to win, or maybe the next month.\n\n(00:50:38):\nIt's essentially like you're looking at the leading indicators in the appropriate timeframe, such that if someone is in month three and they're getting a bunch of their deals to proposal, you can't declare victory yet because the money is not in the bank, however things are looking good. So, if you get to month four and lots of things are getting to proposal, but nothing's closing in month four and nothing's closing in month five, you still can't say \"Olly olly oxen free,\" you should still be very concerned. But if the leading indicator is at the right level for the right period or right interval in ramp, then you can feel confident, but not declare victory yet.\n\nLenny (00:51:20):\nGot it. Something that this is reminding me of is we are chatting ahead of this call and you mentioned that working from home is really bad for salespeople, in your experience. Can you talk about that?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:51:31):\nIt's primarily bad for junior salespeople. Senior salespeople have been selling out in what's known as the field for a long time, but when you think about the behavior that we're talking about, which is learning, so what needs to happen? The new sellers, they need to learn the sales motion and then they need to be audited, instrumented, so the faster the loops are on that, the better off you're going to be. If the loops are once a day of listening to their calls or maybe even a longer interval, then just the correction loops are just going to be way too slow, versus if you're sitting next to somebody or you're sitting amongst three or four people and listening to all their calls concurrently and then they get off of a call and it's like, \"Hey, that was really good, correction here, correction here, correction here, correction here. Here, run it back to me.\"\n\n(00:52:28):\nNow, the loops, the speed with which you're able to update their software and make sure that the sales motion is running appropriately on them, is quite high. In early-stage startups, that's the only thing that matters, it's a race against time to make sure that you get to success, so you can raise your next round of financing or get to profitability or what have you, and so having asynchronous distance is really problematic for that, especially for junior folks, like SDRs, junior AEs, all of that, it really is problematic. Once that sales motion is baked and can be distributed, that's potentially a different situation, but very early on, having someone being able to sit side-by-side with your sellers, t's hard to beat.\n\nLenny (00:53:17):\nSo, what's the solution, if you're starting, now, a B2B company, your advice is, \"Don't be remote, work in an office\"?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:53:25):\nMy point of view on that is, especially at early stage, from a founder's standpoint, being shoulder-to-shoulder with your co-founders certainly, but even a founder who has a couple of sellers that they're working with, being side-by-side with them in order to help them learn faster, teach them more, have accountability, and then have training loops is really what you need to do. Because the alternative is there's a whole generation of SDRs who are, it's kind of like learning loss, if you will, there's a bunch of 24 year olds who have never learned the skills that are needed at the same way, at the same clip, that they would have sitting amongst 10 others with an SDR manager sitting in the middle of them, or an AE manager sitting in the middle of them.\n\nLenny (00:54:20):\nAny last pieces of wisdom before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:54:24):\nI think probably the biggest thing is, the thing that I just like to encourage founders and product managers and what have you, is just don't be afraid of sales. There's a lot of people out there who would love to tell you a story that it's magical or like, \"Oh, you've got to be a born seller,\" or things like that and it's really not. Those people are just talking their book, if you will, and so just getting good at those behaviors, it's going to benefit you in a myriad of ways. Even if you don't want to necessarily be an early-stage founder, even as a product manager within an enterprise organization or even a consumer organization, selling behaviors and good communication and persuasion and always thinking about what's in it for them, et cetera, those are really good skills for internal selling, for external selling, if you want to interface with customers, et cetera. All these skills are very important and impactful for a myriad of personas.\n\nLenny (00:55:19):\nAmazing. Well, with that, we've reached the very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you, we're going to go through it pretty fast. Are you ready?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:55:27):\nI am.\n\nLenny (00:55:28):\nQuestion one, what are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:55:33):\nThe books that I recommend the most, there would be The Goal by Eli Goldratt. There are two books that inspired Atrium, one is the Goal, which is essentially is a novelization of the Toyota lean manufacturing system, so it's a process engineering book written as a novel, it's really fantastic. Sales organizations are just revenue factories, so if you want to think about systems thinking and processes, but in a way that's not a textbook, it's absolutely fantastic.\n\n(00:56:01):\nAnd then the other one is a book by Bill Walsh called The Score Takes Care of itself. Bill Walsh is a really famous football coach for the Stanford Cardinals and the San Francisco 49ers and he just broke down how you can't worry about the score in the football game, you can only worry about the things that are in front of you, that you can control, and that if you do a high quantity of high-quality actions, whatever your position is, as a quarterback or a linebacker running back or whatever, then the score will take care of itself. That's very applicable to sales, as well, if you focus on those leading indicators and make sure that you're doing it in a high quantity of high quality way, then the score will take care of itself. So, those are two great books I like to recommend to folks.\n\nLenny (00:56:41):\nFavorite other podcasts?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:56:42):\nOh boy, I don't listen to too many. I listen to Lenny's and I listen to the All-In Podcast, just so I can get my fill of doom and gloom.\n\nLenny (00:56:52):\nAnd knowledge, with this one. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:56:57):\nI've got a five-year-old, so we're all Disney all the time, so I think probably the one that's been on repeat recently has been Encanto. There you go.\n\nLenny (00:57:07):\nLove that one. Favorite interview question that you like to ask folks?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:57:12):\nSo, I'm going to change this up on you, it's less about interview questions. One of the things I'm a really big fan of is job simulation, especially in sales, and so I'm a big fan of doing screens, so we actually have a written screen that we do with folks, where it's the Google Doc that has a dozen or so biographical questions that we allow people to answer. You'd be shocked at how well it screens people, 57% people won't do it. These are not complicated questions, it's like, \"Lenny, tell me about something that you've built that you're proud of,\" it's a dozen of those questions. So, one, you can filter out people who are not serious, you can filter out people who have low levels of give a shit. You also can see whether or not people can communicate in a compelling fashion with a beginning, a middle, and an end. You can also see their attention to detail, whether or not it's ridden with typos or they forget to answer some of them or what have you. So, it's not an interview question thing, but that's a huge hiring hack, from my perspective.\n\nLenny (00:58:10):\nThis is a form that folks fill out when they're trying to apply to work at Atrium, is that right?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:58:14):\nYeah. Or it's just something that for all my portfolio companies, as well, that people just use it. It's a Google Doc and you just clone it, give it to them, \"You have edit rights, let me know when it's done.\" You'd be shocked, people are like, \"Oh, I didn't forgot to do it.\" Great, you told me everything I need.\n\nLenny (00:58:35):\nAmazing. Final question, do you have a favorite story of you or a salesperson closing an awesome deal, something that seemed impossible, something that you're proud of?\n\nPete Kazanjy (00:58:47):\nThere's a gentleman in our sales organization named Sean, who was an early seller here, he's now a sales manager, he is absolutely fantastic. I think one of the things that early-stage founders and also sellers have to remember is you're, generally speaking, not going to close the deal on the first time through the pipe. As we discussed earlier, if you have a 30% win rate, that's pretty great. If you have a 20% win rate, that's pretty solid, but that still means that four out of five are not going to close, but the next time around, they might, so win rate on the second time through the pipeline.\n\n(00:59:21):\nSo, Sean closed, one of our biggest customers is a company called GRIN, they're absolutely fantastic. They make influencer management software for brands, very cool stuff. I think Sean probably ran three or four ops with them before we were able to get a toehold in the account a couple years ago, they were much smaller, and so now, I think they have 100 SDRs and 80 AEs that are being managed using Atrium. So, I think there's a good lesson there, which is it's not necessarily going to be the first time through the pipe and it's maybe not the second time, but you just have to keep pushing that boulder up the hill and eventually, when you do, good things happen.\n\nLenny (00:59:59):\nWhat a great lesson to leave us with, very empowering. Pete, this was everything I hoped it would be. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, more about Atrium, the book, and then how can folks be useful to you?\n\nPete Kazanjy (01:00:12):\nI'm pretty easy to find online, I'm the only Pete Kazanjy in the United States, as far as I can tell. Google will autocorrect my name if you Google it wrong, so that's pretty helpful. Find me on LinkedIn, find me on Twitter. You can also find Founding Sales at foundingsales.com, as Lenny notes. The whole book is available online as hypertext, you can buy a physical copy, as well, but the reason why my wife put it into a Squarespace site was because we wanted people to be able to search it and come back to it and use it as a reference and so on and so forth. And then in terms of how folks can be helpful to me, if you work for an organization that has between 10 and 300 salespeople and you're looking to manage them better via metric, make them more efficient, that's a big watch word these days, is efficient sales organizations through better management, Atrium is fantastic for that. Atriumhq.com is the domain, but you can also just Google Atrium sales and we'll be the top result, as well.\n\nLenny (01:01:13):\nAmazing. Pete, thank you for being here.\n\nPete Kazanjy (01:01:16):\nIt was awesome. Thanks, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:01:18):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How to be the best coach to product people | Petra Wille (Strong Product People)\n\n## Transcript\n\nPetra Wille (00:00:00):\nGetting promoted is way harder if you're not good in telling stories and rallying the team behind the shared goal and all these kind of things, and you usually achieve this through good storytelling techniques. And in some teams, I've seen the product person not being really, really good at it, but then the whole team helped creating these stories and stuff like this. So you definitely could compensate to some extent, but I would consider it a bit of a career staller if you don't get to a decent level of storytelling and to a decent level of public speaking.\n\nLenny (00:00:35):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my aim here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Petra Wille. Petra is an independent product leadership coach and author of Strong Product People. And for the past 10 years, she's been helping product teams boost their skill sets and up their game. Alongside her freelance work, Petra organizes events in Hamburg, Germany, where she's based, and does a ton of one-on-one coaching, and speaking, and writing.\n\nLenny (00:01:03):\nIn our conversation, we focus on three things. One, how to become the best coach for PMs, which is really important if you're a new PM manager, and even if you're not a new manager. Two, how to become a better storyteller and why that's important for leaders at every stage of their career. And three, why finding a PM community is so valuable and how to go about finding one. Petra is awesome, and it was such a fun chat. And so with that, I bring you Petra Wille.\n\nLenny (00:01:32):\nHey, Ashley, Head of Marketing at Flatfile. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?\n\nAshley (00:01:40):\nAt least 40%.\n\nLenny (00:01:42):\nAnd how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?\n\nAshley (00:01:44):\nWell, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n\nLenny (00:02:04):\nI am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n\nAshley (00:02:19):\nTotally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. That's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.\n\nLenny (00:02:36):\nIf you'd like to learn more or get started, check out Flatfile at flatfile.com/lenny.\n\nLenny (00:02:43):\nThis episode is brought to you by Mixpanel, offering powerful self-serve product analytics.

Such an honor to be here on a Friday night.\n\nLenny (00:03:43):\nFriday night your time, Friday morning my time. Thank you for making the time.\n\nPetra Wille (00:03:47):\nOf course.\n\nLenny (00:03:48):\nYou're a product leadership coach. Can you just talk about what you do as a product leadership coach and then also just a bit about the numbers of PMs you work with, the number of companies you work with, the impact you had, just to set a little bit of context in your background?\n\nPetra Wille (00:04:01):\nHow I usually describe it is that I work with people leading product people, so that's the product leadership level that I'm looking at. So that might be a CPO in a smaller startup or a product director, a product team lead, these are the folks that I'm usually working with for the last four years, I'd say. And before that, I coached product managers, so IC level product folks. And before that, I did a lot of product discovery coaching for teams and whole product organizations. And you asked about how many people I may have influenced. That's a real hard question so to say. So in one-on-one coachings, that's what I know. I coached around 130 people so far over the last few years, which is already a lot. Most of them have, yeah, 10 to 20 sessions with me. Some really stick with me over the years so they have more sessions.\n\nPetra Wille (00:04:55):\nSo that's that. And then I have group coaching sessions and corporate and then public setups. And that's, I would say, another 150. And it's all product leads. So usually, those people are working with a team of 10 product people and there are some ripple effects. So I think I have an impact on their lives as well if I'm coaching their boss or the line manager so to say. Plus, the teams that I work with as a discovery coach, plus the people that read my book and hopefully are using some of the techniques. And in the end, yeah, I did a bit of the math and I think it might be around 50,000, 60,000 people. If we look at it from the product leadership to IC level structure, yeah, that might be the impact. So that's a pretty impressive number.\n\nLenny (00:05:35):\nWow. That is an impressive number. And I always love chatting with folks that do the work you do because there's such a unique insight into working one on one with PMs that are trying to get better and understanding what trends are happening across PMs at different companies and different countries and things like that. So I'm excited to dig into a bunch of stuff.\n\nLenny (00:05:53):\nThe other thing that I love about where you're focused, there's a lot of people that focus on ICEPMs and there's a lot of people that focus on senior leaders, VPs, CPOs. And I love that it feels ... And correct me if I'm wrong, but you are focused on this middle layer of first line managers, directors.\n\nPetra Wille (00:06:08):\nExactly, yes.\n\nLenny (00:06:08):\nWhich I feel like is often the most important and influential layer of a company because they're the ones doing a lot of the work at making a lot of the decisions day to day.\n\nPetra Wille (00:06:16):\nThat is the case. Plus, at least with a lot of clients that I'm working with, they are not trained product people. So they often come from a marketing background, or a business background, or from the data background, so to say, or the engineering background, but they often never have worked in a product management role. So they're missing a lot of basic product management practice and a lot of empathy for the struggle of the product people to some extent. Plus, how should you help people grow if you have no clue what their role actually is all about? So that's what I actually like to help them with, to get this clarity on a strong compass how the best product organizations and product managers should be working.\n\nLenny (00:07:02):\nJust to go a little bit on that tangent because that's an interesting point you just raised. When you work with folks that are not product people and that end up leading product people and trying to better product, what's the thing they lack most, the skill or the understanding of product? If you had to think of one or two things that these people are like, \"Okay, they totally missed this part about product management, about building product.\"\n\nPetra Wille (00:07:23):\nOne thing that has made me sense out the most is I see product people on the IC level have to go through some of the struggles on their own, even if our product community has some best practices to it. Because as the line manager has no clue about the product community out there and the craftless product management, they often struggle to point them in the right direction to say, \"Hey, I think that's a problem somebody else already had. So maybe you could watch a talk or read this blog post or there's a book about this particular thing and then go try it.\" So that's the first thing. So product people IC level often have done to learn a lot of things on their own, so to say, because nobody's curating their progression for them to some extent. So that is one thing.\n\nPetra Wille (00:08:13):\nAnd then I use this metaphor of the eight-legged creature because people tend to talk about T-shaped employee profiles, but T-shaped is so not enough for a product person, right? We want them to understand underlying problems of the business and the users finding solution for those, getting things out of the door with the team, doing a lot of product discovery, looking at the data, how people are using it, iterating on the products. So there's so many things that we want them to be good at and to understand that and the complexity that the role actually brings with it. That's sometimes hard for people that have never worked as a product person to really understand. So, yeah, if I would need to pick two things, then that's maybe the two biggest differences.\n\nLenny (00:08:56):\nThe first one is such a great one. It comes up a lot on these chats of just how much of getting better product is just doing it. You can read all the books, you can take all the courses, you can read my newsletter, you can read your book, which we'll talk about, but there's only so far you'll get without actually just doing it and just failing, doing great things that succeed. And it takes years, right? It's not like something you'll do six months, \"All right, I'm feeling really good about being a product manager.\"\n\nPetra Wille (00:09:20):\nYeah, I totally agree. I so often have said the sentence of, it's not a role, it's a career being in product and, really, there's so many things to learn and so many things to get good at. Yeah, I totally agree.\n\nLenny (00:09:32):\nYeah, crazy ass role. Speaking of your book, you wrote a book, it's about product leadership and coaching, and we're going to touch on some of the things you wrote in the book, but can you just briefly describe the book that you wrote, who it's for, what it's about?\n\nPetra Wille (00:09:42):\nIt's quite a niche book, right? So it's focusing on people managing product people, so product leads and then the people development part of their job. So it's not another book talking about how to come up with a great product strategy. There definitely is a chapter on that to some extent, but it's more how you coach those things. So it's not so much about how you do these things on your own, it's more how you could help product people to understand hypothesis-driven product discovery a bit more, or how could you help them think about team motivation, or how could you help them get better and giving feedback, all these kind of things.\n\nPetra Wille (00:10:20):\nSo this book has this meta level of helping product leads to develop their product folks. And that is actually what the book talks about in five different parts. And I think 28 chapters if I get it right.\n\nLenny (00:10:35):\nWow, it's a lot of chapters. What is it called? Where can people find it? Just while we're on this topic and then we'll get into some of this.\n\nPetra Wille (00:10:41):\nIt should be available on Amazon and it's Strong Product People: A Complete Guide to Developing Great Product Managers. That's actually the title and the subtitle, so to say.\n\nLenny (00:10:52):\nAwesome. Strong Product People. Okay. I read parts of the book, I looked at a lot of the stuff that you write online and some of your videos, and there's three things that I want to spend our time together on to dig into. One is what you just talked about, how to become a better coach to product managers for PMs. Two is storytelling skills. You have a lot of great stuff on just becoming a better storyteller. And then three is how to find great community to become a better PM. Does that sound good?\n\nPetra Wille (00:11:18):\nYeah, that sounds amazing. That stood up.\n\nLenny (00:11:21):\nOkay, great. Awesome. So the first topic, basically, the premise of your book is just how to become a better coach to product managers. And for me, actually personally, the biggest inflection in my career was having an awesome manager who helped me become a better PM, and that was the point in my career where I really accelerated. And so I fully buy into the power of having a great manager and a coach, and oftentimes those aren't the same people. And you have these five ingredients that you have to be the best coach to product managers.\n\nLenny (00:11:52):\nAnd so just to start, what are these five ingredients? What do you have to get right to be a great coach to PMs?\n\nPetra Wille (00:11:57):\nYeah, I'm glad you're asking. So I was already referencing to number one. And number one is really having a solid definition of what a good product person looks like in your context. So what is your definition of good, so to say? And a lot of the product leads that I'm working with have this as an implicit feeling based, experience-based thing. They can talk about some of the aspects, but it's often the case that they not have fully reflected on what a personality traits that I want to see in product people that are hard to develop while I'm coaching them, and what are skills, and know-how, and capabilities that I want to see in the product people that I'm working with. And some are super good and have it all written down, but most of the product folks that I'm working with haven't. So that is step number one is doing this reflection.\n\nPetra Wille (00:12:54):\nThen step number two is having a clear idea where every PM currently is in their current career, in their situation, life in general, all these kind of things. So put the pin on the map, so to say, and then think about what is your vision for them in the future, so how good could it get? And I usually encourage product leads to think bigger than their current role at the current company because that's the longer term thing. And then even more important is what I call the next bigger challenge.\n\nPetra Wille (00:13:27):\nSo what is the next bigger challenge I would love to assign this product person to if I could because I know that would help them to learn a new skill or to, yeah, again, you know how, whatever it is, right? And creating such a list once a quarter, for example, you block yourself an hour in your calendar, you write down the names of your direct reports, and then you just think about, \"Okay, what would be this next bigger challenge for them?\"\n\nPetra Wille (00:13:53):\nIt's not always the case that this comes around the corner the next day. Sometimes it takes a quarter or two or three, but if you wrote it down, you will see this opportunity and then you could assign this person to the opportunity and really help them grow substantially over time. So that's number two. Then, hopefully, you share this vision you're having for them with them and do a bit of an alignment session because it's not always that they have the same things in mind. Maybe your vision for them opens up their thinking and reflection a little bit more, but you have to have this conversation where you actually see them, and that's a lot of encouragement and bringing out the best in them and these kind of things. Then it's definitely a development plan, but I think that's more on them than it is on you because you don't get the apps from other people's branches.\n\nPetra Wille (00:14:45):\nSo you cannot really help them develop, but you could remind them of going to the gym, for example, which would be step number five, by the way, that's the follow-up. But the development plan is something where a lot of product managers need help with because that's the inspirational part, that's situational part. That's where you could help them to really see some of the differences between your definition of good and their current profile, and maybe they need to get better in prioritization, maybe user interviewing is something they want to get better at. And then you could help them defining steps that they could take small things that they could learn. Maybe it's a book, maybe it's giving a presentation at a conference, maybe it's reflecting on your way of prioritizing, and then look at what others are doing. So whatever it is, that is something you could help them with.\n\nPetra Wille (00:15:30):\nAnd then finally, it's the follow-up. That's sometimes just a nudge every once in a while at the water cooler to say, \"Hey, how is it going with your personal development plan?\" And some really need the weekly reminder and some maybe need even a daily email, whatever it is, ask them how they want to be reminded of the personal development and how you could help them and the system while doing that because they still have a day job, right? So the development will never be the number one priority, and it shouldn't.\n\nLenny (00:15:58):\nAwesome. So just to summarize really quick, I have the list here in front of me. One is have a clear sense of just what it takes to be a competent PM in your role. Two is an idea of where that PM is today and one thing they could do to improve. Three is a shared vision of how they'll take that next step. Four is having a development plan of how they can move towards this vision. And then the last piece is a commitment, just following up with them and making sure they're staying on top of this.\n\nPetra Wille (00:16:23):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:16:23):\nWhat's interesting about this, just looking at this, it feels a lot like a roadmap and a strategy and a vision for a product. The definition where you're today is the problem, idea of where you're going to go next is like a strategy, and then there's a vision of where you're going to go together and then you check in. So it's these standups. Do you think of it that way at all or is that just something I'm noticing?\n\nPetra Wille (00:16:42):\nI think about it that way as well, even to an extent because so many companies are lacking the real strategy bit, right, and it's similar with the people development strategy. That is something that I see not being present in so many environments as well. So even that similarity is a given, I'd say. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:17:00):\nWhich of these do you find is the most lacking usually or slash where do you think the biggest ... If someone were to just like, \"I want to be a better manager,\" where would you suggest they start? Is it right at the top, figure out what a great PM at this company is?I'mq\n\nPetra Wille (00:17:14):\nThat is a great question. No, I usually advise people to start with the development plan because even if you have never done the assessment and even if you don't have your compass, your definition of what makes a good product manager, you usually have an idea or they have an idea of what they want to learn next or where they want to get better at. So I said they say something like my storytelling capabilities are maybe not as good as they could be or prioritization is people are constantly complaining behind my back that they don't get the order of the things in my backlog or whatever it is, or they think my opportunity solution freeze, and suck, or whatever it is.\n\nPetra Wille (00:17:55):\nAnd you could use that and start helping them creating this development plan. That's not a structured assessment, but that's a perfect start. And then it's obviously the follow-up that makes a big difference and that just takes so little time from the product lead, the small notches, that's super easy. And these development plans, I usually tell people to create a new one with a new headline or topic once a quarter or every four months. So that is not a massive time invest as well. So that would be my suggestion for where to start, if that helps.\n\nLenny (00:18:29):\nYeah, I love that advice because I can imagine a lot of people get stuck in that first one of, \"I don't know all of the things that I need to know about what a great PM right now is.\" So that's a nice simple way to start.\n\nPetra Wille (00:18:38):\nAnd there is another aspect to it. A lot of product leads try to create their compass. And while they do so, they think about, \"Maybe I should have an aligned version with my peers.\" So the other product leads in the company. And then we're talking about the career levels and all these things and often takes ages until something is coming back from HR or you have a unified version. So that is something where I usually say, \"No, start with your own personal team because the folks in your team usually just have you as a line manager. So grade your compass and encourage your peers to grade their compass and, a bit down the line, it might make sense to harmonize some of that, but it's better to start helping your product folks and giving them some orientation than being totally paralyzed by the fact that it's not a compass that is used in the whole company.\"\n\nLenny (00:19:31):\nI want to talk about this compass and how to figure out what a competent PM is. And I know you have a framework around this and I have some stuff I'll actually share, too. But on this latter piece of checking in the development plan, I wrote about this once, but I'll share it here briefly. Something that I did with my PMs that was so effective was every time we did a performance review, every six months, we had a performance review, we put together a Google Doc with all of the things that we agree they should be working on and we pick, say, five themes or three themes, and then we pick very concrete things they should do over the next six months that will help them develop these things.\n\nLenny (00:20:06):\nAnd then more importantly to your last point is we did a monthly coaching session where we looked at the status of each of these things. So there's a color code for each of these 10 things that we all agreed you should be doing these things over the next six months and we checked in how they're going, so that the next performance review, it's not like, \"Oh, I forgot all these things.\"\n\nPetra Wille (00:20:24):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:20:24):\nIt's all like, \"Oh, yeah [inaudible 00:20:25].\n\nPetra Wille (00:20:26):\nYeah. Yeah, exactly. And really, all of us know consistency beats intensity. So, really, the smaller time investments on a weekly basis and that applies for the PM's time investment in learning new things and it applies to the product leads investment and helping their people to grow. I think for both parties, it's more likely and more pleasant if you have small chunks of people development in your calendar. And that's why I like your story, right, because you were focusing on regular check-ins more than into the big bang 360-degree reviews.\n\nLenny (00:21:00):\nAnd it builds on what your point of the development plan is something the person develops like, \"Here's what I believe I should be working on.\" And it's not like you inform it a bit and give them feedback and maybe this isn't or maybe [inaudible 00:21:12] this other thing. But, yeah, the fact that they own it, I think, is really powerful.\n\nPetra Wille (00:21:16):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:21:16):\nGoing back to knowing what is a competent PM at a company. Something I want to ... I'll make sure to include in the show notes for this is I actually did all this research on the career ladders at all of the biggest tech companies. So I have the spreadsheet that it's public of just the skills that every company evaluates your PMs by, but most companies don't have. They're not great. So say your company doesn't have a career ladder competency framework leveling thing, what do you suggest folks do to help figure out what is a competent PM here at our company?\n\nPetra Wille (00:21:50):\nI'd say use one of the assessments that are already out there. Maybe we can include this as well. I wrote a blog post where I put all the ones that I'm aware of into, so there's the PM Daisy and, obviously, Marty Cagan has an assessment, and I created a framework called the PMwheel and there are a few others in there. Go find one that is close to what you actually think a good PM should look like and then customize it. Don't use it just by copy paste because sometimes you have just rather technical PMs in your organization and then all these assessment points about user interviews and discovery are maybe not that applicable in your situation, right?\n\nPetra Wille (00:22:33):\nSo use one template that is close what you want to achieve, heavy customize it because it is really a great inspiration to see, \"Oh, these are all the things that other people think a PM should be doing.\" Or maybe you could merge one or two of those and tailor it to your needs. So that will be my first suggestion. Plus, reflecting on the personality traits because I think there are some things that you better hire for and that are super hard to develop in a corporate environment. So for me, that, for example, is curiosity. I think product people need to be curious about the world, how it works, about things, no matter the topic.\n\nPetra Wille (00:23:14):\nThe best product people that I know, whatever the topic is, they're interested and tell me more about it. So that is, for example, there's something I would always check when hiring product people because I know it's hard to build that muscle or empathy, definitely something that I want to hire for. I know that I can help them develop this muscle a bit more and stepping into shoes of users, and stakeholders, and colleagues easier. But still, if there is, yeah, not a decent level of empathy built into this person, then it's nearly impossible for me as a product lead to help them get towards a seasoned level. So that's another important thing. Think about personality traits and think about skills and know-how and to think about skills and know-how. Use some of the already established assessments.\n\nLenny (00:24:03):\nSo we will try to link to as many of those that you mentioned in the show notes. Maybe talk about the PMwheel, which is the framework that you suggest for folks to understand, just like what are all the skills that a PM needs to have.\n\nPetra Wille (00:24:14):\nIt's hard to talk about that really briefly. So I split all the things that PMs usually do in eight buckets, so to say. And it starts with our day able to understand the underlying problems that users and the company actually is having. Are they good in finding solutions to those problems? Then they do some planning parts. Are they able to maybe come up with a roadmap or with good goals that are aligning the team, these kind of things. And it's get it done that's already able to actually deliver the thing to work with the team that's maybe writing backlog items and all these kind of things.\n\nPetra Wille (00:24:51):\nThen it's listen and learn. So are they able to really gather a lot of data these days and then look into what customers are actually saying. So the qualitative and quantitative aftermath of stuff going live. And are they able to iterate on the solutions that they shipped?\n\nPetra Wille (00:25:07):\nAnd then it's another three buckets that are a bit out of the PM process, which is team. So do they know about how teams actually are different from working with individuals? Do they think they have to motivate a team? Can you motivate a team? So this whole teamwork part. Then it's personal growth. I put it on my PMwheel because I want that to be part of every conversation that I have with my PM. So that's why it's on the wheel. And then last, but not least, it's agile because when I was still coaching PMs, I often found that they never reflected on the underlying basics of agile ways of working. So they often never heard about the agile manifesto, or agile values, or agile principles, no matter what framework they're using. But I think that is key. So that's bucket number eight.\n\nPetra Wille (00:25:57):\nAnd every of those buckets comes with at least 15 framing questions. So is this person good at doing this? Is this person good in doing that? And it hopefully gives you a really nice and well-rounded picture of where this person currently is. And I usually advise people to do a self-assessment, then ask their line management for an assessment, and ideally some of your team members because they have a different perspective on you as a product management personality as well.\n\nLenny (00:26:27):\nSo folks who want to see that, maybe they Google PMwheel, Petra, and also link to it. How did you develop this? I managed it and came from talking to a lot of PMs and just like, \"Here's the things that I see again and again PMs need to be good at to be successful.\"\n\nPetra Wille (00:26:42):\nYeah, it was actually ... That would have been pretty cool. It was more the personal need of me starting off as a product coach. And you had this sense of, \"I need this compass,\" because how should you start a coaching conversation. I first have to learn about what is their perception about them and their capabilities in there and the help. And then I can help them work on some of the things they want to work on. But it is often that coaches come totally unprepared to the coaching, especially when the companies actually are paying it for them and to some extent forcing them into the coaching. And then they're just like, \"Okay, they told me to show up. Petra, what should we do in these sessions?\" And then that's why I created the PMwheel to have these first conversations about where they think we should invest more time in our coaching sessions. So that's how I created it.\n\nLenny (00:27:35):\nCool. Coming back to just the bigger question, we've been talking about just how to become a better manager lead, a coach to your product managers. It's interesting how simple it is. The way you frame this in your writing is it's like five ingredients to be the best coach your PMs have ever had. And if you look at this list of things to do, it's very straightforward and not a lot of work. Figure out what they need to do to be successful, where are they now, align on that with them, and then just give them some things to focus on to move closer to where they need to be. That doesn't take a lot of time.\n\nPetra Wille (00:28:11):\nYeah, I totally agree. The book talks about some more aspects, actually. So that's more or less the first two parts of the book. And then there is more on onboarding and hiring, create product people. There is a lot more. So that's actually the biggest part about how to coach certain concepts of today's product management industry, so to say. Hypothesis-driven product development, for example.\n\nPetra Wille (00:28:38):\nHow do you explain these concepts to people that are not yet familiar with these things? And really, it helps product leads to reflect, \"Okay, what are the small things that I could help them to get better at certain things?\" Because that's actually where a lot of the magic happens. We tend to read all the books and we tend to know all our thought leaders and all these kind of things, but our product people often need super practical advice. So maybe it's really something like explaining them the Eisenhower matrix for getting better time management because they never heard about anything that could help them prioritize their tasks because that's the reality that we find in a lot of the companies, right? So that big part of the book is really this, how do you really help them understand the small tasks and things that the daily work requests them to do.\n\nLenny (00:29:31):\nI think a lot of that I find is when you need something, that's the time to find it, and introduce it, and read about it. There's so much content.\n\nPetra Wille (00:29:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:29:41):\nI'm guilty of this. Just there's a lot of stuff to read and listen to as a PM. And I find you don't need to be listening to and reading everything all the time. It's just like, I need to figure out how to prioritize. Let's see what's out there that's awesome. And maybe save it for the future, but there's so much stress, I think, that goes into like, \"Oh my God, I got to read everything all the time.\"\n\nPetra Wille (00:30:00):\nYeah, I totally agree. I think two weeks ago, one of my coaches told me that he stopped reading a lot of books and consuming a lot of content and he instead dedicates the whole year to using one methodology or book. So in that case, pick Teresa's Continuous Discovery Habits and that's what they read over and over again for the whole year. And I think it's an interesting way of looking at things.\n\nLenny (00:30:30):\nThat is interesting. That's a very committed, better pick the right book that are or whatever [inaudible 00:30:35].\n\nPetra Wille (00:30:35):\nYeah, that she has said is true. Yeah. But maybe some of your colleagues pick another book and then you can just share what you learned, and what works better, and a bit of a community thing.\n\nLenny (00:30:44):\nOh, we're going to get to that. I like that. Before we get to retelling topic, is there anything else you want to share along the lines of the folks are just like, \"I want to become a better coach to my PMs?\" Any other thoughts you want to close with?\n\nPetra Wille (00:30:57):\nYeah. One easy tip is get yourself a list of great questions that you could ask in one on ones if you don't have the time to prepare. That will be one of my tips as well. There's several great coaching books out there. Some of questions are in my book as well. Yeah, just find some coaching questions, make your small compilation, and then really see what resonates with your team, and that often is a bit of a health check. So how are you doing? What would make you more successful in the role that you're currently having? All these kind of things could be helpful.\n\nLenny (00:31:38):\nDo you have any other examples of those? That's actually useful and just a few more examples of coaching questions.\n\nPetra Wille (00:31:44):\nYeah, it really depends. So what I find super helpful is a list of emotions because people tend to find it really hard to talk about how they currently really are. And I don't know why this is the case, maybe it's stress, maybe it's not feeling comfortable to talk about this with your line manager, which is another topic, and bringing us back to the topic of company culture. But that, for example, is something that I always have handy. And if I have this notion of, \"Okay, this person maybe really needs a hack to some extent,\" then this conversation about, \"Hey, look, there is this list of 30 emotions, where do you think you currently add and why and could I help you with that?\" So that could be something. And then there are ... I think you talked about Mochary the other day, right?\n\nLenny (00:32:31):\nYeah. That episode just came out.\n\nPetra Wille (00:32:33):\nYeah, exactly. And he has a great framework as well. I would need to look the questions up, but maybe we put them in the show notes as well. That's a bit of in-house check as well and huge. First of all, it's five easy assessment questions for your folks. And then it's more of, \"Okay, if you're ranking yourself a six, how could I help you to make it a seven?\" So it really focuses on incremental improvements, not crazy stressing everybody out improvements, not, \"What could I do to make it a 10?\" It's more really, \"How could I improve your situation? Really build rapport, really be there for your product folks.\n\nPetra Wille (00:33:11):\nAnd I think creating this list of coaching questions as a go-to list could improve the quality of your one on ones because, let's face it, we often run into those ones. Either we ditch them or we run into those ones completely unprepared. And a development plan could help and a prepared list of coaching questions could help to make it way easier. And for your PMs to feel more valued.\n\nLenny (00:33:37):\nThat's a great callback to the Matt. And by the way, his name's France, Matt Moshary, instead of Mochary. The C-H was like a sh.\n\nPetra Wille (00:33:44):\nI see.\n\nLenny (00:33:44):\nYeah. Now, we know.\n\nPetra Wille (00:33:46):\n[inaudible 00:33:46] learn something. Now, we know. That's good.\n\nLenny (00:33:49):\nYeah. And you pointed out in his curriculum, he has a bunch of questions that you mentioned about where are you at one to 10 on this thing and then how do we get you to ...\n\nPetra Wille (00:33:56):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:33:57):\n... eight or nine. So we'll link to that in the show notes also. So many more things to read from this podcast.\n\nPetra Wille (00:34:02):\nSo many things to link. Sorry.\n\nLenny (00:34:06):\nGood God, poor listeners.\n\nLenny (00:34:06):\nThis episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build powerful AI-powered features in your audio or video products, then you need to know about AssemblyAI.

That's assembly ai.com.\n\nLenny (00:35:17):\nWell, let's get to a happier, simpler topic, maybe not, storytelling. So just setting context. It feels like as a PM, also as a founder, also as just a leader of any kind, you're always told you need to be a great storyteller. That's a big part of leadership. Be a great storyteller because that gets people excited and onboard with your building. But it feels like I've heard so many things about becoming a better storyteller. There's always feels great when you're reading it and then you get to a deck you're starting or a meeting you're about to run or a doc and like, \"Shit, how do I make this a good story?\" I need some conflict maybe and a ... I don't know, there's a hero's journey, there's all these things that you're like, \"I don't know, I don't know what I'm doing.\"\n\nLenny (00:36:02):\nSo I guess just a broad question. Say you're PM who wants to get better at storytelling, do you have any things you would suggest that are just concrete things someone could do today, tomorrow, this week to become a better storyteller, to level up their storytelling skills?\n\nPetra Wille (00:36:18):\nYes, I think I would love to mention two things. So first of all, people that's starting, often they are getting a better storytelling journey. Often totally underestimate how many time actually great storytellers are investing in creating the stories and making sure they can share the story in nice ways and formats. So that's maybe the first tip, you have to plan to put in a lot of work to create your story.\n\nLenny (00:36:46):\nAnd when you say a lot of work, what are you thinking? What's an order of magnitude of time depending on the scale of the story or a deck, or?\n\nPetra Wille (00:36:55):\nRule of thumb. So I think if you ... Let's say you want to explain the rest of the company what you and the team are up for the next three to four months, so to say. Then I think that's two weeks of work, not eight hours a day, obviously, but two weeks of work, maybe one or two hours a day to really carve that story and think about different audiences and different framings of, when am I able to tell the story? And that is actually, I think, a rule of thumb of time investment. So it takes time because people often think, \"I don't know, you just get better overnight in telling great stories.\" It's just not how it works. So you have to practice and you have to put in a lot of work and time to come up with a logical, compelling, motivating story that then lasts for longer than a week or two. So that's a lot of work.\n\nPetra Wille (00:37:48):\nAnd then the other tip would be really make sure that you're using language that speaks to the heart and the minds of the people because we constantly tend to use too much of our business lingo and it's banner blindness. Some of the words that we're using people totally overhearing them because we're using them so often. And it could be even things like product discovery. So maybe your company is already so fed up with all your product discovery stuff that you should start using different terms. Even if then, say, hypothesis-driven product management, it's more or less the same thing, and maybe it's even too complex. Maybe you can find something simpler and say, \"We need to learn something about this particular thing,\" because studies show that's a scientific background. Stories really have an impact on our brain.\n\nPetra Wille (00:38:45):\nSo hormones get released depending on how the story is actually formed, if they have cliffhangers or if it's really like, whoa, with the hero and think, \"Where is it going to take him\", or something like that. And that releases, yeah, hormones in your brain and that only happens if you're using natural world, so to say. So you could talk about smell, and sense, and how people feel, and how their life would be better if this product would be out, all these kind of things. So really make sure that you think about that really speak to their minds and to their hearts and remove all your three-letter abbreviations and all these kind of things, which is something that everybody says as well. But it is way harder to do it when you really start to create your story to remove all these terms. And that takes a lot of time, yeah, as well. So you have to really put an effort into the don't use too much [inaudible 00:39:46].\n\nLenny (00:39:47):\nSo the first point, which I love, is you think people are just good at this and naturally great at telling a great story. But a lot of it is ... Right. Some people are ... You do it enough and you're like, \"It'll be quicker probably.\" But for most people, it's going to be just put in the time and it gets better and better and your story merges, you practice.\n\nPetra Wille (00:40:04):\nYeah. And it's a cultural thing. So I really find in average Americans, for example, being better at it than most of us Europeans. And I think that's because even in your school system, it seems to me, I don't know, you tell me if that is the case, but storytelling and being in front of a class or something like this is something that is encouraged and valued already, where at least when I was at school, this was not part of the whole system at all. So really late it was part of what we did, but not from an early age. So it's just not something, yeah, that we trained in or that we used to. So sometimes even speaking in front of 30 people, people are freaking out because they never did that. So that's their cultural differences to that definitely as well.\n\nLenny (00:40:57):\nSpeaking of the idea of speaking in public and being nervous and that kind of thing, which I always get really nervous speaking in public and people don't think that when they hear me and other folks that are publicly speaking, but it's like freaks me out every time. Do you have any advice for people that want to become better public speakers/be less nervous speaking publicly?\n\nPetra Wille (00:41:20):\nI was really bad in [inaudible 00:41:21] as well, I have to tell you. And it's still not something that I love, but I know it's part of the work that we do.\n\nLenny (00:41:30):\nYeah.\n\nPetra Wille (00:41:31):\nAnd so the easiest way is to get in front of really small and super friendly audiences. So that is, I think, the first starting point. And I don't know where that is. That could be your team, that's a super small audience, usually five to 10 people, or maybe you pine with your company of 80 people or 120 people, maybe the company all-hands is already something where you could actually speak. That was my first time and I had to speak in front of the whole company at a company all-hands around 90 people back at the time. And I only had to give a brief update on what we did the last two weeks and it was like five minutes on stage, but it freaked me out.\n\nPetra Wille (00:42:14):\nSo that's where I'm coming from and it really helped me to start small. Then product tanks, for example, this local product community meetups totally helped me because friendly human beings and not too many of them. So sometimes they're just 30 people attending and then you in the summer, not so many people are coming, so why not giving a talk there? So really start small and then grow the audience over time and always make sure, because that helped me a lot, to get feedback from strangers and peers if possible. Because the peers tend to give you the harsher critique, so to say, where the strangers are more polite, but they're not so familiar with the work you do or with the story that you want to tell so they can spot some gaps in your storytelling technique or something like that.\n\nPetra Wille (00:43:07):\nSo that is something that helped me a lot to always have this friendly soul in the front row, where I know I get some feedback from later on. Plus, then having complete strangers and there's always somebody coming up after the talk, right, so they could be your first person giving you some stranger feedback, so to say.\n\nLenny (00:43:25):\nWhat about if you're just about to give a talk and you're like, \"Oh my god, I'm so nervous,\" do you find anything that helps you get over that?\n\nPetra Wille (00:43:33):\nI think the two things that work well, it's either the Superman pose, so that is one thing. If you're standing like this looking straightly up, that is one thing that helps many people. It's not my preferred one. And then the other one is a bit of the gorilla thing, just like tapping here. There is ... I don't know what's the English-\n\nLenny (00:43:56):\nVagus, the vagus nerve.\n\nPetra Wille (00:43:57):\nNo, it's not the vagus nerve.\n\nLenny (00:43:57):\nOh, a different.\n\nPetra Wille (00:43:58):\nI think it's thymus.\n\nLenny (00:43:58):\nOkay.\n\nPetra Wille (00:43:59):\nI need to look it up. And if you just, yeah, hit that softly for some time ...\n\nLenny (00:44:07):\nYeah, I can hear it.\n\nPetra Wille (00:44:07):\n... then, yeah, that bumps your energy level, so to say. So that helps me. And again, friendly faces front row. So find people that you like and respect and that you know have the spark in their eyes when you start talking. That definitely helps as well.\n\nLenny (00:44:24):\nDo you suggest doing these moves in the bathroom where no one can see you, or?\n\nPetra Wille (00:44:29):\nYes, backstage. You're doing those ones backstage. And think about what you're wearing because if you're wearing something like that and do this before you enter the stage, people might see that.\n\nLenny (00:44:38):\nThey might love that.\n\nPetra Wille (00:44:38):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:44:38):\nJust come out beating your chest. It's a power move.\n\nPetra Wille (00:44:38):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:44:39):\nDo you think it's important for PMs and leaders in general to get great at public speaking or do you think it's okay if they are just okay?\n\nPetra Wille (00:44:53):\nIt really depends. So I think not being able to speak publicly and to bring your point across ... Because a lot of people do public speaking, but they never bring their point across. So if you want to achieve both things, I think it is a career solo if you can for a product person. Can do the IC level product management job, but getting promoted is way harder if you're not good in telling stories and rallying the team behind the shared goal and all these kind of things. And you usually achieve this through good storytelling techniques.\n\nPetra Wille (00:45:33):\nAnd in some teams, I've seen the product person not being really, really good at it, but then the whole team helped creating the stories and stuff like this. So you definitely could compensate to some extent, but I would consider it a bit of a career solo if you don't get to decent level of storytelling and to a decent level of public speaking. So, yeah, I think it's important.\n\nLenny (00:45:54):\nWho's the best storyteller PM that you've met and what made them great?\n\nPetra Wille (00:45:59):\nThat's another hard question. So who had the biggest influence on me was definitely Jason Goldberg. He was my former boss and he was the first person that came into the startup that I was working for back at the time. And he was really the first person who entered every stage that he could find to talk about the things that he wants to achieve with us as a product team and as a product organization. In a way, it was really motivational, so it really helped me to experience that and how he was using this product, evangelizing techniques, yeah, to actually really tell the whole company what we're up for currently and what the problems out there he thinks are worth solving. So that was definitely an inspiration.\n\nPetra Wille (00:46:47):\nAnd then I think another great speaker is definitely Hans Rosling. He's no longer with us. That's sad. But he gave great TED Talks, really data-heavy TED Talks because they often hear from product people, yeah, but the work we do that's so boring, how could we make a great story out of that? And I think Hans Rosling showed over and over again that you can. So that definitely is an inspiration.\n\nPetra Wille (00:47:14):\nAnd then on a totally different note, I love spoken word poetry because it really talks to the heart and minds of people. And in my coaching, I usually send people off to the TED Talk from Sarah Kay, which has the nice title, If I Should Have a Daughter. And that really helps people to understand, \"Ah, okay, that's how you could be playful with words.\" And that's what happens to me personally and to my body and to my emotions if I listen to something like that. So that's maybe three things I could be mentioning.\n\nLenny (00:47:49):\nHans Rosling's the guy with the world poverty charts and ...\n\nPetra Wille (00:47:54):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:47:54):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nPetra Wille (00:47:57):\nOn world and data.\n\nLenny (00:47:57):\nRight.\n\nPetra Wille (00:47:57):\nNow, his son is, I think, in charge, but, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:48:00):\nCool. I'm excited. I'm going to watch that one again. That's a good reminder. Maybe just another question around storytelling. Say you're a PM and you're about to start a document or a deck and you just want it to be a good story, what are two or three things you should just do to set yourself up for success?\n\nPetra Wille (00:48:17):\nYeah. First of all, don't sit in front of the blank page for too long, just start drafting something. I think there's a lot of beauty in story as a design tool, so to say, because it's even easier to change a story than it is to change a prototype, right? So even before you put something in writing, you could start talking about it and see how it lands and then tweak it. And I think that's the first thing, get going.\n\nPetra Wille (00:48:43):\nAnd then the other thing is go start talking about your story, go test it, see how it resonates, and then tweak it. And maybe you could use one of the proven story structures, find the one that helps you most. Really, even if it's super boring, but I'll use this hero's journey a lot where I think about, should I put the team in the heart of the story? Because if it's a story that should help me to motivate the team or to inspire the team to actions or something like that, then maybe it's nice if I put them in the center of the story and make them the heroes and talk about the demons and monsters they have to fight to once arrived at this brighter future.\n\nPetra Wille (00:49:25):\nAnd maybe some other times, it makes sense to put the user there and really talk about how their world and lives would have improved once this product is out and available. Or maybe it's even a feature that we're talking about or a bigger redesign or whatever you're currently working on, right? But you could use this proven story structure and see what are the things in there. So the call to adventure, what is the call to adventure? What is this bright future? And it helps you to start and to get going.\n\nPetra Wille (00:49:55):\nAnd then I usually advise people to have the story handy in various formats. So spoken that you could actually talk about it. Written, because we all tend to work in remote or asynchronous environment. So just a recorded video maybe. Yeah, it's good, but maybe a written version of it is nice as well. And the next one is an illustration that helps you making some of the core points of your story visible to the audience. And that could be a whiteboard drawing, a flipchart drawing. It could be a bigger, maybe it's five slides with emotional pictures on it or whatever it is, but be visual with your story as well.\n\nPetra Wille (00:50:37):\nAnd then you should have it ready in three different formats in a super short 75-second elevator pitch version. In the six minutes, I can do this before we actually start planning version. And ideally, I have to go to the company all-hands and have to talk about what we will look into for the next four months. And that's maybe an 80 minutes version. And 80 minutes is the length of an average TED Talk, and there is a reason for that. It has to do with attention spans and all these kind of things. So that's why I advise people to use this three length.\n\nLenny (00:51:14):\nAn example you're using there is a PM designing the vision for their team potentially or their strategy for the next, say, six months, right?\n\nPetra Wille (00:51:21):\nYeah, exactly. So we don't need to create this complicated story for the next sprint, I'd say. That's too much of an effort, maybe waste of time. You need to look a bit further out to make it worth spending a lot of time on creating your story.\n\nLenny (00:51:38):\nIf you had to pick one book or resource that helped you become a better storyteller or that you found other people coming back to that helps them level up their storytelling skills, what comes to mind? I'll share one first as you think about that. There's a recent book that you wouldn't think would be good at this, but it is really good at helping understand how to tell a story. And it's called Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit. And it's by ... Yeah. And the title alone is a great lesson, which is, nobody wants to read your stuff. Yeah. But the premise of the book is how to make it so that people find it interesting and useful. It's by Steven Pressfield who wrote The War of Art and Bagger Vance and all these things. So it's one of his new books, I think. So that's what comes to mind.\n\nPetra Wille (00:52:22):\nThat's pretty cool.\n\nLenny (00:52:22):\nWhat comes to mind.\n\nPetra Wille (00:52:23):\nBack in the day when Marty Cagan was my product coach, he made me read Selling the Dream, which is the Macintosh story on product evangelizing by Guy Kawasaki. And it didn't help me to become a better storytelling, but it helped me realize that it's really important that I work on that skill. So that is actually the trigger and material that helped me is basically everything from Nancy Duarte and Duarte Inc. So there are even leadership books about rituals and how to ignite the spark in all the people you're having. So they're talking a lot about the leadership aspect of storytelling, but they have something for the IC level as well, 72 rules on storytelling and all these kind of things. And I have a lot of free material. I know it's not a book, but they have several books and that was great material that helped me to become better.\n\nLenny (00:53:16):\nMan, the show notes on this episode are going to be out of control. It's going to hit some limit for [inaudible 00:53:20].\n\nPetra Wille (00:53:20):\nYeah, maybe we're ... Yeah, the longest show notes ever. Sorry.\n\nLenny (00:53:24):\nOh my God. Yeah, it's going to be rough. I'm actually going to try to get Nancy Duarte in this podcast.\n\nPetra Wille (00:53:29):\nOoh, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:53:30):\nSo that's a good ... That's-\n\nPetra Wille (00:53:31):\nSay hi if you do. Yeah, I'm a fan.\n\nLenny (00:53:34):\nOkay, I'll do that. I'll do that. Okay. So getting to our final topic, which is around community. You're a big fan of finding community and just the power of being in a community, and I know you've done a bunch of research there, you're just like pumping your fist as we talk about this. I love it. So tell us why you're such a big fan of the power of community for product managers in general.\n\nPetra Wille (00:53:54):\nAgain, the starting point was a rather egocentric starting point because I'm constantly thinking about, how could I scale the work that I do because I still see so many companies not getting a product coach or I still see so many companies where people development is not a priority, all these kind of things. And at some point, I thought, if the line manager is not taking care of the personal development, who could? And I talked to several of my colleagues about the question and, at some point, somebody said, \"Yeah, that's what community of practices are often used for.\" So that's where a lot of people get their inspiration. And basically, I reflected on my career. And early on, I was in a super engaging product organization where, really, we tried a lot, we shared a lot. A lot of the things that we tried didn't work at all, but others really fell on fertile grounds and we could learn from each other.\n\nPetra Wille (00:54:55):\nAnd we invested quite some time in this sharing, but everyone got better over time because of this community being present. And so I decided to make this my topic for this year's research, so to say. And I was talking to a lot of my clients and former clients, \"Hey, are you running a community of practice? If you don't run a community of practice, why is that?\" Often, they have never considered running one, they don't know where to start. So that's another problem, obviously. And at some point, I decided to conduct a survey to see if random strangers can tell me about their companies and their community of practice. And it was super interesting as well.\n\nPetra Wille (00:55:34):\nFor example, I found that oftentimes there is a bit of a community of practice internally, but they never heard about external product community. So they never heard of your community or to raise this community or mind the product or any of those external communities. And that is shocking to an extent as well because we're all so friendly human beings, happy to share what we learn, and they don't have to go through the same things over and over again. So that's why I think it's a super important question and I would love to help a bit more companies to start a community of practice or to mature the community of practice that they're already having.\n\nLenny (00:56:14):\nWhat impact have you seen folks get when they join or find a great community? And then what are communities that you find are most useful? You mentioned ... And I want to get your advice on what I could do to make it even better, but maybe those two questions. What impact do you find when you find a great community and then what are some that you [inaudible 00:56:31]?\n\nPetra Wille (00:56:31):\nOne impact, definitely, is stickiness. So people tend to stay with companies where they're learning and growing and can, yeah, get to mastery, so to say. Hello, Daniel Pink. So that is really something that people are thriving for, and if they find this in a company and a product community of practice could be a big part of that. So that is one impact.\n\nPetra Wille (00:56:59):\nThen the other impact, there's less people development on the desk of the product lead if there is a good product community of practice. So product leads, your life will get so much easier if there is a product community of practice. And it's actually a pretty cheap way of doing people development because trainings are expensive, conference tickets are expensive, getting external product coach, expensive. But helping people to learn from each other by making room for that and giving them a bit of time to reflect and to share what they're learning, that's rather cheap. So I think that is the benefits that I see.\n\nPetra Wille (00:57:40):\nTraining budget impact. People tend to stay with the company a bit longer. Leadership wise, it's less a time that you have to invest in people development. And then it's just fun for a lot of people. That's another uptake, I'd say.\n\nLenny (00:57:54):\nWhat are signs that the community that you're in, say, you found?You mentioned a bunch that I think are awesome. Teresa's community, we'll talk about my Slack a little bit. Mind the Product.\n\nPetra Wille (00:58:02):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:58:03):\nWhat are signs that the community you're in is good with your time? Something you should stick with versus like, \"Nah, get out of there.\"\n\nPetra Wille (00:58:10):\nThat is actually a good question. So I would say, if it helps you with networking, that is really something good if you meet nice, interesting people. So that is one thing I would love to mention. And then if you're learning something new every now and then, maybe not every day, maybe not every week, but every now and then, there should be some real nuggets where you think, \"Oh, this is making my life easier,\" or \"This is super interesting. I would never ever have stumbled upon this thing without the community.\" So learning something new and then reflecting on how much you already learned about a certain topic or know about a certain topic, which is contributing to the community.\n\nPetra Wille (00:58:55):\nYou could be a community moderator, you could be somebody organizing some of the rituals, you could be somebody just sharing what you learned. So I think that is something that could be in a good community that is possible at least to share that everybody's sharing and that there's mutual trust and then it's often just, if you enjoy being part of this community. That's, I think, another super important thing to look into. Do you like the people there? Do you like to hang out with them? Do you think they're kind, lovely human beings? And is there some level of activity in the community because there's too many dead ones out there, more or less? And I think these are the things that I, yeah, would use as a benchmark.\n\nLenny (00:59:37):\nWhen you're talking about this, initially, I was just imagining online communities, but there's also, obviously, offline communities probably somewhere in your local city.\n\nPetra Wille (00:59:44):\nYeah, product things.\n\nLenny (00:59:44):\nRight. Just like ... Yeah.\n\nPetra Wille (00:59:46):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:59:46):\nYeah. So I think ... I don't know if people thought that when I was talking, but, yeah, there's probably meetups happening in your city with product managers that are meeting each other every week, every month maybe.\n\nPetra Wille (00:59:55):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:59:56):\nThat sounds awesome. And I love your point about the why of the community versus a course versus reading lots of books. It's really affordable to join some product community, especially if it's online.\n\nPetra Wille (01:00:09):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:00:10):\nAnd the ROI could be really high.\n\nPetra Wille (01:00:11):\nYeah. And it brings so much clarity in your thinking if you're sharing some things you learned with the community that this is a massive uptake as well, so give back. That really makes sense for you personally as well.\n\nLenny (01:00:27):\nSo you mentioned my Slack community. So if folks don't know this and they're listening, basically, if you're a paid subscriber committees letter, you get access to the Slack and there's about 10,000 people in there, mostly PMs and founders and growth leaders, and it's pretty damn incredible. It's probably the thing I'm most proud of of all the things I've done over the last few years around this newsletter and podcast.\n\nLenny (01:00:48):\nAnd so if you're not in there, you should definitely check it out. It's thriving. There's meetups happening all over the world every month. There's a mentorship program, there's mastermind groups, all kinds of stuff. And you're familiar with it. And so I just wanted to ask you while I have you here, do you have any advice for how to make this community even more great?\n\nPetra Wille (01:01:06):\nThat is not an easy question. First of all, congratulations. I really think it's a massive achievement to start such a community and to really have such a vibrant community because I know it takes a lot of energy investment at first to get it going and then a lot of energy to keep it on a certain level, so to say.\n\nPetra Wille (01:01:29):\nYeah. What I found helpful is I have this community canvas that I use when I'm working with clients and some of these things require workshops to some extent. So it helps to reflect on what is the purpose of the community and that changes over time with the community members that are currently part of this community, right? So that is not a stable thing. So sometimes everybody has to pause for a second and then think about what is the purpose of this community, what are our values, and how will we define success?\n\nPetra Wille (01:02:05):\nIt's pretty boring, I know, because it sounds so, so familiar with what we do in product management, but I think it applies for product communities as well. And then you need to find good rituals and rhythm, and you, Lenny, were already talking about some of the ones you are using. I know, for example, what Teresa is doing in her community. I interviewed her this year, so there is a blog post on that online as well where she talks about what she tried, and what did work, and what did not work. So I think that is important.\n\nPetra Wille (01:02:36):\nThen maybe not so important for your community. Well, let's see. Let's discuss, let me hear what you think, which is incentives and sponsoring. So how do you, yeah, value contribution? Are you giving back? Is it a kudos mechanism or is it something where people really earn badges of honor or earn time, earn more training budget. That's what a lot of companies do, right? If you're playing an active role in the community, then you get more training budget to spend or something like that, or they grant you time to do so. So if you say like, \"Hey, I want to be part of this product community, could I travel a quarter or something like that because I want to go and see those people?\" That is something that people do. So incentives and sponsoring, then it's roles. And that will be interesting in your case as well. Is Lenny the center of the community?\n\nLenny (01:03:34):\nYeah, I try really hard not to do that, actually.\n\nPetra Wille (01:03:36):\nYeah, right. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:03:36):\nThat's a [inaudible 01:03:36] try to not be the beacon of all answers. The actual goal of the community was I will not have all the answers. Let's just bring a bunch of smart people together that are already there's this interesting filter of who pays for content about product and growth and stuff.\n\nPetra Wille (01:03:52):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:03:53):\nFilter's really interesting. So the whole idea was get out of the middle of this thing and let people help each other and it's worked out really well.\n\nPetra Wille (01:03:59):\nYeah, because that's what I would say after doing all this research, it's not sustainable if the whole community is on the shoulders of one, two, three people. So you need to distribute the workload and you need to distribute this responsibility because sometimes even things like, yeah, policing the community is not a pleasant job. And if there's only one person dealing with all of these things, then it's not really community because then it's a bit organized like a company in this pyramid scheme.\n\nPetra Wille (01:04:30):\nSo I think more of it as circles, different circles of interest, and then building bridges between them because maybe not everybody in your community is interested in the same topics, but maybe they are the smaller circles of 10, 15 people interested in this one topic, 10, 15 people interested in this other topic. You may be connecting the dots, you may be giving a bit of impulse and inspiration, but maybe other people are doing the exact same thing, sharing their best reads and their worthy to watch videos, and all these kind of things. So content and curation, definitely, is another thing that you should think about and reflect on once in a while.\n\nLenny (01:05:08):\nCool. Thanks for the advice. Curious is so important. Especially early on, I found keeping the signal to noise high always. And especially early on, it was a really prayerful. So there's a lot of focus [inaudible 01:05:19] detail oriented about it all.\n\nPetra Wille (01:05:21):\nYeah. Plus, a lot of communities that I see use engagement as a success metric, and I'm actually not sure if this is a good success metric. So as you say, signal versus noise is maybe the better success metric, which leads us the down the rabbit hole of how to [inaudible 01:05:38]. But, yeah, engagement is maybe not the predominant success factor for a community.\n\nLenny (01:05:44):\nYeah, that's interesting. You also said it's a lot of work. And just to give some shout-outs to folks that help me run this community that we have, I couldn't do this without them. Trey, who leads the community. Keani who-\n\nPetra Wille (01:05:54):\nHello, Trey.\n\nLenny (01:05:55):\nHello, Trey.\n\nPetra Wille (01:05:56):\nI know Keani.\n\nLenny (01:05:58):\nKeani curates the best conversations in the Slack every week and then shares them in this bonus email, Community Wisdom.\n\nPetra Wille (01:06:04):\nNice.\n\nLenny (01:06:04):\nAnd then Ria, who's been helping out run the meetup program. And then Jess who's helping with our mentorship program and a few other things. So that's the core team that helps this whole thing run. Thank you to them all.\n\nPetra Wille (01:06:15):\nThank you. And it's super interesting that you're sharing that because companies often don't want to invest in, yeah, full-time community manager is maybe the wrong word because that not necessarily has to be a full-time role, but there need to be some people that really have a decent amount of time to invest in running this community because otherwise it's not working. And I still think it is still cheaper than sending everybody to trainings and conferences all the time, and it has a lot of, yeah, ripple effects and network effects.\n\nLenny (01:06:48):\nWell, guess what, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.\n\nPetra Wille (01:06:51):\n[inaudible 01:06:52].\n\nLenny (01:06:52):\nSo I'm going to ask you a few questions. Whatever comes to mind, let me know. We'll go through it pretty fast.\n\nPetra Wille (01:06:57):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:06:57):\nAnd are you ready?\n\nPetra Wille (01:06:58):\nI'm so ready.\n\nLenny (01:06:59):\nSo ready. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nPetra Wille (01:07:05):\nThe Art of Thinking Clearly by Dobelli. It talks about human biases in a really nice and illustrated way. Then what I use a lot in my coaching practice, especially with senior executive, is Outcomes Over Output because it's a super strong concept, I'd say. And then maybe I want to mention two books that are not yet written, but two concepts that I hope will make it into books, and one is Martin Eriksson's Decision Stack. And then there is another book about public speaking that hopefully might come out if some people are supporting it on Kickstarter. And that is called Present Yourself, a public speaking book.\n\nLenny (01:07:42):\nAwesome. If you can sign a link to that, we'll include it also in the show notes.\n\nPetra Wille (01:07:45):\nOf course.\n\nLenny (01:07:46):\nThe record ...\n\nPetra Wille (01:07:47):\nShow notes, hello.\n\nLenny (01:07:48):\n... longest-ever show notes. Speaking of that, what's another podcast that you love?\n\nPetra Wille (01:07:52):\nI love the Product Experience podcast. And if you're able to speak German, then there is one that is called [foreign language 01:07:58]. That's a nice interview series.\n\nLenny (01:08:02):\n[foreign language 01:08:02], I like that. I do not speak German, but I thought it'd be fun to listen to, anyway. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've enjoyed?\n\nPetra Wille (01:08:11):\nMaybe New Amsterdam. I loved it. That's actually a medical director, Matt, and he's finding very unconventional ways to solve problems and I think he's a great leader, so maybe that's a nice framing for watching the show.\n\nLenny (01:08:26):\nWhat was it called? New Amsterdam?\n\nPetra Wille (01:08:27):\nNew Amsterdam.\n\nLenny (01:08:28):\nSweet. What's a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask when you're interviewing folks?\n\nPetra Wille (01:08:32):\nDefinitely the tell me about the last time. So tell me about a time when you did your last round of user interviews. Tell me about your last time when you onboarded a new colleague because I think as a user interviewing this, tell me about the last time you really, yeah, sparks nice conversations and interviews.\n\nLenny (01:08:54):\nWhat are five SaaS tools or products that help you do the work that you do now? And if there aren't enough of those, just great apps that you love right now.\n\nPetra Wille (01:09:04):\nI'm totally not into product management SaaS tool these days because as I'm just coaching people on hourly basis, I'm no longer the one looking into the SaaS tools they're using. So that's quite a tough question. Things that I use a lot in my personal work is rather boring stuff like bookkeeping software and time tracking [inaudible 01:09:25]-\n\nLenny (01:09:24):\nWhich ones? That's interesting.\n\nPetra Wille (01:09:27):\nHarvest is what I use for time tracking and bookkeeping, and I love that. It makes my life easier since a few years already. And then, yeah, new banking apps that are coming up that I'm using for my accounts. One is Qonto, I think it's a German bank, but they really did a great job in the user experience, super seamless in the apps and all these kind of things. Yeah. So that's two cool products that I love to use.\n\nLenny (01:09:54):\nGreat. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader, influencer-type person?\n\nPetra Wille (01:10:01):\nAs I'm a conference organizer as well for a conference that was called the Product Engage here in Hamburg, that is the super hard question for me to ask because so many people have been on that stage, that I would consider being a thought leader, they would maybe not consider them being a thought leader. I think the thought leader thing is pretty hard anyway, so there's so many different voices in our industry. And I think looking at the guest list of your podcast actually is a very good start when you think about thought leaders and getting more inspirations because they are ones that we know and some hidden gems on there.\n\nLenny (01:10:37):\nGreat answer. Great answer. Petra, thank you so much for doing this. We've hit the record on show note length, I guess, so that's a milestone. Congrats.\n\nPetra Wille (01:10:48):\nYes, thank you. Was a pleasure.\n\nLenny (01:10:51):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks finding online if they want to learn more, reach out, maybe work with you and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nPetra Wille (01:10:58):\nOoh, interesting. Yeah, the first one is easy, LinkedIn, Petra Wille, you can find me there. And then there is my website, Petra-W-I-L-L-E.com. That's my website. And how can listeners be helpful to me? Whew, that's a tough one. I think it could be mutual beneficial if you are a product manager IC level and you would love to get better supported in your personal development and go by my book and just hand it to your manager, if that's appropriate. Or just put it on their desk and just forget that it's there and hopefully they read it or something like that. I think that is how I would love to answer the last question.\n\nLenny (01:11:40):\nRemind folks what the book is called and they can find on Amazon [inaudible 01:11:43].\n\nPetra Wille (01:11:42):\nStrong Product People.\n\nLenny (01:11:46):\nStrong Product People. Go check it out on Amazon.\n\nPetra Wille (01:11:48):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (01:11:48):\nPetra, thank you so much for doing this.\n\nPetra Wille (01:11:50):\nLenny, was a pleasure.\n\nLenny (01:11:52):\nIt's my pleasure.\n\nLenny (01:11:54):\nThank you so much for listening.
