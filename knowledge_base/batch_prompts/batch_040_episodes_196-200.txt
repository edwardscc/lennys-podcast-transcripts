The big investment in the contrasting story. I'll tell you a dirty little secret. I can get my husband to do chores for me on the weekends with a real quick, what is, what could be new bliss. So, the ability to just have that contrast as a framework in your brain during a meeting, on a phone call, any moment of influence, like literally it works. It works in any format.\n\nLenny (00:00:29):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products.

Nancy, welcome to the podcast.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:03:31):\nThank you for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny (00:03:33):\nHow many presentations have you helped craft at this point, both directly and indirectly?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:03:38):\nThat's a great question. People know I'll like take a swag at data and pretend it's real. So, I had a president who took us a whack at that number in, it was 2014, and he said at that time it was 225,000, and that was almost 10 years ago, so I can't even tell you, I mean we stopped tracking, but it's a lot. I mean, in 35 years we have thousands of projects we open and each sometimes has two to a hundred presentations in it, so it'd be hard to tell.\n\nLenny (00:04:13):\n200,000.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:04:15):\nHe said 250,000, but that was 10 years ago and I didn't do the math. So, when my team questioned it, I'm like, oh, Dan did the math. They're like, \"Oh, then it's accurate.\" Because they thought I was just making up this number. I'm like, no, no, we actually went in and looked.\n\nLenny (00:04:31):\nOkay. I was not expecting it to be that large. That's insane.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:04:34):\nIt's so funny because I have the whole history of the Silicon Valley in a way. It's like every little startup and then they grew to massive brands like Cisco and you could actually look at the rise and fall of all these companies. And then I actually have all the decks. I still have a lot of these archives, so I could actually verify that number exactly.\n\nLenny (00:04:52):\nOkay, well this next question's going to be extra hard then. Of all the presentations you've worked on, which one stands out to you as the most memorable or most impactful?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:05:02):\nI mean, it has to be Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth. It kind of hit the world in a season where nobody really knew or had an example of a really well done presentation. So, it came out before TED Talks were even out on the web, and so people had never seen someone tell a data story and stand in front of data and the scale in 90 foot screen, but we had worked with him for five years before an Inconvenient Truth. People think he went from vice president to this presenter and I didn't work with him. I let my team work with him. So, they were the ones jetting around jumping backstage at Oprah. They loved it. It was a real peak season.\n\n(00:05:40):\nBut the thing actually that was most memorable is we work with these 20 some year old CEOs here in the Valley and they tend to show up and act like they know better than someone who's been doing this for so long. And what was so interesting about this large figure politician communicator is the team would sit in a room and say, \"Hey, we think you need to do this way. We think you needed to convey it this way. We think it should be visualized this way.\" Or whatever it was we were proposing. And he would literally pause and touch his chin and really think, and really consider that we might actually be experts.\n\n(00:06:18):\nAnd more times than not he would adopt the way we said it should be done. And so I think as the customer who actually probably had some of the most power in the whole world to thoughtfully defer to us as experts was delightful customer and consulting experience. I mean, I remember when they called me to say it was going to become a movie and that it had gotten funded and I started to get the information. They wanted us to do a lot of work to get it movie ready. And I'll never forget, I said, \"Wow, that's going to be a lot of work we'd have to do for free, and who's going to go see a movie about a slideshow anyway?\" That's literally what I said. So, yeah, I just didn't believe it would become what it became. So, the whole process was amazing.\n\nLenny (00:07:05):\nDid you expect the impact of what happened after that presentation or was it just like, oh, we got this one job we got to do, let's just get through it and then move on?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:07:14):\nWell, we've been doing it for five years. I think the strategy, whether it was intentional or not, I don't know. So, he would go city to city to city, because he was traveling for five years seeding, like planting seeds for a groundswell, and he went into, he would go to the Stanford campus invite the Bay Area Elite, and it was always private and it was always VIP. And so he did a really good job for five years, traveling, traveling, traveling, traveling and really delivering that talk. And I think that created a desire. I don't know that it would've gotten that much traction. I don't know if people already didn't know about the presentation and hadn't already seen the presentation and they brought their friends to the movie, is how I kind of picture at least that part happening.\n\n(00:07:59):\nAnd he was generous, Lenny. I mean, at the end, when he traveled around for those five years at the end, he always had a slide with our name on it and would thank us if you're in the audience. I mean, super, and paid, mostly paid for what we did that we did give a lot of our own time. But yeah, super generous and yeah, movie became what it was. It was a bit of a surprise. It was good. The movie was good.\n\nLenny (00:08:24):\nIt was good. It also makes me think about a pattern that I often see of it wasn't just one presentation that changed everything. It was, you said five years of prep ahead of that, and you always see these wow overnight success stories and you always find, okay, it wasn't actually that.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:08:42):\nYeah, and he did a good job after, once it got traction, we built a whole training program where he could fly people out to his place in Tennessee and start to train people. So, it almost became a train the trainer and he could sanction you as a ambassador for it. So, it was just the way the whole thing kind of unfolded and scaled and then got traction was lovely.\n\nLenny (00:09:03):\nSpeaking of impressive clients, I only learned this recently, but Apple has been a client of yours since the day you were founded as an organization. Is that right?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:09:12):\nYeah, it was. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:09:12):\nOkay. How did you land that initially? And then also just what have you learned from that experience that's informed your approach to presentation, design, communication, and how you work with clients?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:09:22):\nI love that question. So, yeah, I had a real job. I was working my real job and my husband had bought a Mac and he's like, \"I think this is a business. I think it could be a real business.\" And he was an illustrator, wasn't a designer, but he had been a fine artist. And he's like, \"Look, I can draw.\" Of course it's all pixelated and bit mappy. He goes, \"Look, I could draw lines in here.\" And if I could show you his art studio, his work is just gorgeous. So, he's definitely a fine artist. And he's like, \"I think this is a business. I think this could be a business.\" And I'm very pregnant. We were talking about that earlier. I am very pregnant with my son and I'm like, \"Dude, you're going to go get yourself a real job. I don't want you playing around with this little Mac thing.\"\n\n(00:10:02):\nAnd he begged me twice in our marriage. He literally has gotten on his knees and to try to get me to see his perspective begged me. He's like, \"Just read a Mac World magazine, just read it through once, and if you still don't think this could become a thing ...\" Because I was working on a mainframe, I'm like, I work on a real computer. So, what happened was I made some phone calls. I called NASA and I called Tandem, which is now HP, and I called Apple and we won contracts at all three brands at the same time. And back then our company was called Duarte Desktop Publishing and Graphic Design.\n\nLenny (00:10:36):\nOh, wow.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:10:37):\nI know, I know. And we slipped in. When you talk about a product lifecycle, very early, everything was still bit mappy, was not attractive. Most people as users didn't know how to typeset, didn't know how to do columns, didn't know how to make in this tool at all. And there's about an 18 month window in the life cycle of the Macintosh where graphic designers refused to use it, refused. It's a toy, it's ugly, it's bit mapped. Nobody would do it, a font like that. We use Linotype. It was very, the snobby kind of, we won't touch it. And that's right when we entered right then went and checked out books at the library on type setting, we tried to figure out what we could do, what could we do with this tool, and then the rest was kind of history. And so that's how it started and the timing and just kind of pushing the tool that nobody was that interested in that we're in the design community. It was small adoption.\n\nLenny (00:11:36):\nSo, that's interesting that it was cold emails basically are cold reach out just like, \"Hey, we want to work with you.\" Yeah, that's an awesome [inaudible 00:11:42]-\n\nNancy Duarte (00:11:42):\nCold calling. Cold calling, yeah, it was.\n\nLenny (00:11:45):\nWhat did you take away from that experience that kind of informed what works and doesn't work in presentations?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:11:51):\nPresentations used to be 35 millimeter slides in an old carousel. In fact, that's what Al Gore had when he showed, he was like, here's my slide carousel from the seventies. It was just how it was done. But Apple was the first company to hook up the computer to a projector at scale. Now the projectors at these big venues like San Jose Convention Center, I mean it was huge and it was risky. So, because we were first in, they pushed us to start to do the presentations in this tool and it was black and white. Everything was black and white when we first started. And then we started to push and push and push from how we illustrated things in the tool, how we would colorize clip art. I mean, I'm talking like clip art packages just came out and they're like, \"Hey, grab these, colorize them.\"\n\n(00:12:32):\nAnd so it was a really momentous moment to win them as an account. And I remember the tool had started to really take off and it was ugly. You can call it fugly, I don't know what you want to call it, but everyone who made slides did it so poorly, just so poorly. And we were kind of pushing the boundaries of it to make it look attractive. And there was a sales conference in 1992 in San Francisco and the leader of sales at the time was kind of a creative savant of sorts. And I remember he's like, \"I don't know how you're going to do it, but I want you to take the whole slide.\" This is when slides were basically teleprompted covered in text. If you could stick a piece of clip art on it, you were lucky. And he said, \"I want you to just make the whole slide, it's just covered with the word big in hot pink. And I want the background black, because when this slide pops up in all pink big, I want it to actually light the faces of the people in the audience.\"\n\n(00:13:26):\nAnd it was like I didn't know how to, we couldn't do that. We had to go into free hand, convert it to this, do these six steps, and then we came up with a small JPEG at the time or png or something and we scaled it up. So, it was still kind of pixelated. And I remember I was in that hall during the rehearsal and the production team gasped. Couple people squealed. They're like, \"Who did this? I mean, it was just the word big in magenta pink.\" And I just remember thinking, this is how it's supposed to be done. Putting the tool in the hands of the masses kind of destroyed the medium itself.\n\n(00:13:58):\nAnd I feel like the first 10 or so years I was in business, it was reshaping this medium that ran amuck when it got into the hands of the users, it just went completely the opposite way that it was supposed to. So, it's weird to say that was a real defining moment for me to say, wait, we can do this different and we can return to how they used to be done when they were 35 millimeter slides. So, that's one story. And then I think we're very good at mapping to the brand requirements. So, we take this tool, whatever the tool, we have all our brands use different ones. They use Slides, Keynote, they use PowerPoint. We use whatever tool the brand wants and we push it in each medium. But we take their brand guidelines and really push it into the spoken word medium where when they stand up on a stage, it's cinematic. The visuals can become an experience in itself.\n\n(00:14:57):\nAnd I remember when Apple came up with the Think Different campaign. Steve Jobs was just back and my designer, everyone Photoshop was new. And everyone's doing these beveled backgrounds with tons of crap on the background. And I walked by, I'm like, \"No, oh, we can't have a blue frame looking photo frame to for the Think Different campaign. This is not going to work.\" And so I remember looking at all the posters and remembering the Alfred Hitchcock ones. It had these particulates like these particulates, and it was just shadows.\n\n(00:15:34):\nAnd I found a stock video that Adobe had made at the time, and it was just particulates floating through the air at the angle and we stuck the six color apple on top of it. That was so revolutionary back there to push the brand and get out of the way every, the whole world was making these hideous templates. So, there are these moments that pushed the company forward because of an idea that I knew would not be okay for the Apple brand, therefore it shouldn't be okay for any brand. And I think those are just a couple stories of how to really push the medium in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. The audience just likes it better when it's really clear what you're supposed to focus on. We love that brand. We love it.\n\nLenny (00:16:22):\nOkay, so let's get a little tactical, because you're talking about some very specific things that you've found to be working. So, everyone listening to this podcast has probably heard many times it's really important to be great at presentations that there's so much power in storytelling and communication, all these things. And they probably read a bunch of books and blog posts and watch videos of how to give a great presentation. But myself, and I feel like most people sit down at a deck when they're about to present to an all hand, say a week later or are going to do a meeting. And I'm always just like, okay, what do I do? Okay, there's like a beginning, middle end, they should have some kind of problem. And it's always like, I don't know what I'm doing. So, if someone were to just be listening to this podcast and they're like, I'm going to write a post-it to myself of three bullet points of things that I should remember when I'm starting a deck, what are those three bullet points?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:17:11):\nYour audience is the hero. That was in my TED talk from 2011. I would say it's infuse your talk with story. And I would say it is asking yourself, can they see what I'm saying? Those would be the three tips other than starting with empathy. I mean that that's, well, audience is the hero, is the empathy centric approach.\n\nLenny (00:17:33):\nLet's dive into these then. And I was actually going to ask around empathy, and it feels like that comes up a lot in your recommendations to people's empathy is kind of the heart of your methodology of telling great stories, telling great presentations. So, let's spend a little time there. Why is that so important and what does that actually look like in practice?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:17:50):\nEmpathy is important to Duarte, everything we do is empathy first. And some of it comes from my own childhood story a little bit. I was raised by a clinically narcissistic mom and narcissist are missing the empathy gene. So, I feel like that void of not having it modeled for me is why I keep clawing at empathy as being important. And I think a lot of people listening might work for a boss that does not have empathy, that isn't other centric, that doesn't think before they talk and all of those things. And I was raised by someone like that. And so every single book and every single model that I ever make has empathy at the core because you have to have to think about who am I speaking with, especially in communication, who am I speaking with? And so when I went on my journey through storytelling, I figured out that I thought, okay, the presenter's the hero, for sure the presenter's the hero, they're the central figure. They're talking the most. They're well lit, they're up on a stage.\n\n(00:18:48):\nSo, when I started to look at all the archetypes, that's where I landed. And then I was like, oh my god. When I got to really digging into the mentor, I realized it's really the mentor in myths and movies that's the presenter and who really holds the power in the room of a presentation is the audience, the audience gets to make a choice if they accept or reject your idea. So, the balance of power is with them and not you. So, it really is the role of the presenter to be the mentor. And in myths and movies, the mentor comes alongside the hero. In other words, the presenter should come alongside the audience and help them get unstuck or bring a magical tool. So, I think Obi Won Kenobi's a great example.\n\n(00:19:32):\nHe did two things for Luke Skywalker. He gave him a light saber, which was for his outer journey, the physical journey he was doing, and then an inner tool, which was the resolve, which came to him through the force. So, when you're speaking to an audience, they're going to have an internal conflict that you have to give them something to soothe. And then you're asking them to therefore go and do this thing, take this action, do this call to action. That's asking them to physically do something or physically change in some way. So, they're not going to do that for you if you haven't empathetically thought about how hard what you're asking them is going to be for them to do. And so you have to change your mindset when you're starting to build your deck to think about who am I talking to? How am I going to help them get unstuck? And that's just a super foundational principle in everything we do.\n\nLenny (00:20:29):\nWhat is an example of that in practice as we go through these? Because this is really great of that implemented the deck that we know about maybe?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:20:38):\nOh, that we know about. So, I could talk about our own internal ones. Most of what we do is under MSAs because they're fantastical brands. So, in my own company, before I do a presentation that's going to require goals or them reaching goals or we do an annual vision talk, we do a listening tour first. So, some of it's based in survey, some of it's based in interviews. And we feed that information up and then we compare it to what we're going to ask them to do. And we do some gap analysis. We literally, there's some actual questions you can ask yourself, which are somewhat classic design thinking kind of questions about where they're at. And then what we do is I create a real rough cut or the exec team creates a real rough cut and then we invite the next level of leaders in and we do a fake, I mean the slides are ugly, we don't spend time on the slides.\n\n(00:21:31):\nThis is about the message and maybe a model or two or three that we're going to go through to feel like it may amplify or make the message more concrete. And then they get feedback and that's when it's hard. It's hard to go from rough cut, here's what we're going to say to making it absolutely resonate. And then we deliver it after all of that work has been done, then we share it to the company. So, we go through that knowing that's the hardest presentation I deliver all year. I used to travel and speak and be a public speaker, but it's my own internal ones I have to take more time with.\n\n(00:22:05):\nSo, when I travel and speak, they're like, oh my God, I love your models. Oh my gosh, can I get a picture with you? But when I'm standing in front of my own team, they're like, I wonder what she's going to say, because she's about to either make my job harder or she's going to change my priorities. They come in more skeptical. And we definitely have nailed the annual kickoff meeting. Definitely have nailed that. And then we do quarterly updates to that annual kickoff meeting. And it's a cadence and people get enthused and we're kind of killing it right now.\n\nLenny (00:22:40):\nYeah, that's what it feels like from the outside. I'm just thinking about the pressure to create presentations within Duarte Design. If you think about your job as hard, creating a deck for your company, imagine that.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:22:52):\nPresentations in front of presentation experts is like-\n\nLenny (00:22:55):\nOh my god.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:22:56):\nAnd I get nervous. I get really nervous because I have one slide that's kind of flawed or I say um or I pace too much. You lose a third of your team each time. They're such experts. So, it's hard.\n\nLenny (00:23:10):\nI want to walk through these three bullet points. So, the first is make the listener the hero of your story. And that comes from being empathetic and understanding their challenge. So, if you're trying to do that, what are signs that you're doing it well or not well? Is there the way the flow of the story start? Is it the here's the way it starts? Or what should people identify of I'm doing this well or I'm not doing this well?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:23:31):\nIf the audience is the hero, you would see visible signs that they get it. People would come before I did a really good talk and people were tweeting saying, \"Hey, come to this talk. It's really good.\" So, you'd see a reaction. You know you've done it well if you're infusing your talk with story, which is the second bullet by utilizing story structures. So, when I say storytelling, I'm talking about an anecdote. When I say story structures, I'm talking about this format of a three act structure of storytelling that goes back tens of thousands of years, which is fused into the brain like FMRI machines now you can see them while a story's being told and the science is beautiful, if you're telling me a story and I'm listening, our brains are firing in the exact same order, in the exact same place. So, it has power to align our brains.\n\n(00:24:26):\nAnd so by implementing attributes of story like a beginning, a middle, and an end, and we have method for that. And in also incorporating the rise and fall story kind of builds tension and releases it. And that's why we love it so much is we escape through someone else's messy middle and conflict and problems like it's messy and then it resolves. You build the tension and resolve it. And that's what a really well structured presentation can do. It can pull on that rise and fall in a way that creates longing.\n\n(00:24:58):\nSo, story creates longing. It helps people long for something they'd never wanted before because if the future is told in the shape of a story and they see this alternate future, so many people escape through sci-fi. They escape through movie making into these future worlds. And so picture that you could verbally paint a picture of this future state and then you could bring your whole audience to this future state in an amazing way using this cadence of rise and fall. That's how you can incorporate story into a presentation where you need to influence others, actually really can be beautiful when it's done well.\n\nLenny (00:25:38):\nAnd so you gave a TEDx Talk on this exact topic. And so I want to go deeper here. And you kind of shared this very visual way of thinking about a great story where it kind of goes up and down and up and down these teeth almost. Can you actually talk about-\n\nNancy Duarte (00:25:51):\n[inaudible 00:25:51] pumpkin teeth. Yeah, it does.\n\nLenny (00:25:54):\nCan you share what that structure visually looks like? And we'll share a link in the show notes of what that actually looks like and then just why that is so impactful and important.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:26:02):\nYeah, I love that. So, I went on a three year journey through story and I knew that the greatest speeches overall time did have that rise and fall and rise and fall. But it wasn't one single story. It had a whole lot of other very important information, but it still did this rise and fall and risen fall. So, I am not a digital native. I took a quarter inch graph paper and I would listen to all kinds and map out, took the words. When I analyzed Steve Jobs's iPhone launch speech, I did it all by hand. I wrote every word I did quarter inch graph paper. I needed to know, I needed to see it the way I work, which was analog. And so at first it was zigzaggy and I realized, wait, you can't map something over time and have it be a zigzag.\n\n(00:26:49):\nThere was too much data lost. So, to verbally describe it, you could picture a line at the bottom of your screen and that line going left to is what is. And you need to set up every talk by stating what is. And then it moves straight up and you move to what could be come back down to the bottom line again say what is, back up, what could be, what is, what could be, what is, what could be? And then at the last what could be you state the last horizontal line is what we call the new bliss. So, this motion of traversing between what is, what could be, what's is, what could be, what is, what could be, that sense of longing for the future, it makes people leave their current state or the status quo or our current reality and makes them long for this future state by using contrast.\n\n(00:27:37):\nSo, that rise and fall of hey, here's our current problem, here's a solution, or here's the state of the union. But we imagine it could look like this. There's so many different ways to build that cadence of contrast that's so lovely. I mean it really works. I think the talk came out in 2011 and the amounts of notes and emails of things people have accomplished by changing the structure of their presentation has been really astounding.\n\nLenny (00:28:09):\nThe State of the Union is a really interesting example because I'm trying to imagine this and presentations I've seen and that totally resonates of just like, here's the problem we're having and here's where we're going to go. Here's another problem we're having. Here's what I'm going to change.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:28:20):\nSteve Jobs was great at that. When he launched the iPhone speech, he always did, here's the state of the company, here's how we're doing. Oh my God, our stores are more full than 10 Mac world expos. He always did a setup of what was going on. And then he did a really rapid what is, what could be when he started to compare the iPhone to the Blackberry. It's like, look how much it sucks now that you've seen what we're doing. It's just what is, what could be, what is, what could be. And so I took all the classic speeches, historical speeches, everything, presidential speeches and knew that if I could find a pattern in Dr. King and Steve Jobs's iPhone launch speech that was the same, that had the same type of nature of cadence and pulsing to it, for lack of a better word, that I knew I had solved it using story. It was a really great moment to finally draw that out on my quarter inch graph paper.\n\nLenny (00:29:19):\nI love that.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:29:19):\nIt was awesome.\n\nLenny (00:29:22):\nI feel like there's just so much opportunity for primary research that still I feel like that's why my newsletter does well is I just spent the time doing that work that you're describing of watching a thousand interviews and then just distilling, here's a takeaway here.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:29:34):\nPattern finding, that's an interesting point. I worry sometimes with the emergence of new technologies and stuff, the ability to be able to sit and think, synthesize and all of that is because a human's going to come up with different insights and synthesis than any future machine can do. So, I think it's fascinating that you do that so well and it really shows that.\n\nLenny (00:29:34):\nWow, I appreciate that.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:29:59):\nYeah, you're really putting your mind and heart into it all.\n\nLenny (00:30:02):\nEnough about me, I'm thinking about, but I appreciate it, I'm thinking about product managers and founders maybe listening to this and they're like, oh man, every time I do a deck, I need to create this whole story and this up and down thing. In your experience, when do you go that far to create? Is this when you have an epic important presentation, you think about a story structure like this, or is there always a way you should put this into your presentations of some kind of story with this contrast?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:30:31):\nIt's interesting question. I think a lot of people think that the only time you really need to present well is when you have a big stage talk and you make the big investment in the script, the big investment in the contrasting story. But I'll tell you a dirty little secret. I can get my husband to do chores for me on the weekends with a real quick, what is, what could be new bliss, kind of just that first bit, what is, what could be new bliss. It's like even the very, very short talk that Abraham Lincoln gave in the Gettysburg address, it was basically a funeral, it was a eulogy. And back then eulogies used to be two hours long. It was an Aristotelian structure and he only had a couple hundred words, so there's no pictures of him giving it because it was so short, so tight and done.\n\n(00:31:16):\nThey were setting up the cameras, still thinking they had tons of time. So, the ability to just have that contrast as a framework in your brain during a meeting, on a phone call, any moment of influence, getting the husband to do some chores for me, literally it works. It works in any format. And I think the investment that you make in the longer form or when it's a huge audience, you add the visuals, you really hire the speaker coaches, you really make that moment. And there's these moments that breach above all other moments where you really have to nail it just in basic conversations, in a moment of influence. If you practice it enough, it'll live in your head as a mental model for when you're in a situation where there's influence in the air that you could do.\n\nLenny (00:32:07):\nHow do you actually do it with your husband if you could share for helping you do the dishes?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:32:11):\nWell, I won't get graphic about what the new bliss might be, but early in our marriage we figured out that, not early, I actually spent almost in the only the last 10 years we've been married for 40. And we realized that when we tangle it's usually only about process. So, the gaps are if I ask or he asks me to do something or we start to kind of pick on each other, it's because the way I'm executing something is different than the way he chose to execute it. And so it'll be anything from like, \"Why are you chopping onions like that?\" He'll say to me. And now I'm like, oh, we have a process gap. \"Do you want to chop the onions or do you want me to chop them my way?\" So, for the what is, what could be new bliss, it happens all the time.\n\n(00:32:59):\nSo, he needs a lot of context. He's a detail-oriented person and I've started to learn with him that my what is needs to be quite a bit longer than sometimes I have patience for as I start to frame, \"Oh hey baby, I need you to take the dog over to the dog care.\" I don't start there. I start with, \"Oh my gosh, tomorrow I've got back to back meetings, in fact, I'm going to be on Lenny's Podcast right about here. And that's when she's whiny. And what's going to happen is if that doesn't happen, I'm going to have to reschedule next week and next week it's just loaded up. And you know how it is when I'm stressed out at the end of the day and I'm kind of hard to deal with and I say, well, what could be, the doggy place, she was loved it last time she was spooning with a red cavalier king spaniel and loved it.\"\n\n(00:33:46):\nIt's like that, I have to unpack it a little bit more for him. And then the new bliss could be any sort of marital promise you want it to be, but I just have to unpack the current state a little bit of the process, and then I state what could be. And it's funny because acts of service like that, like him taking the dog to the doggy daycare for me or is I feel loved. So, when someone does something generous with their time for me, it's how I feel loved. And so there's a whole lot there in shaping how you communicate with someone. Empathetically at my company, everyone knows each other's love language. They know that this person feels more appreciated when they get a written note. This person feels more appreciated when they get a gift and everyone knows that. So, that's just baked into our, I don't know, our marriage, our company, just how it rolls.\n\nLenny (00:34:43):\nI imagine people listening to this podcast were not expecting marriage advice. And so I love that. I'm going to try.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:34:50):\nYou can scrap that if it doesn't work the process tip though is good.\n\nLenny (00:34:52):\nThis is going to be the best part. This is going to be the whole podcast is just the segment. Just joking. But this is really good advice. I'm going to try to use it myself. So, the structure, I think it's even easier to think about this less as story, infused story. For me it's more this, what is, what could be, what is the ideal bliss, that's almost the simpler way to think about it. The story is this like, oh my God, I got to think of a story.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:35:17):\nIt has a beginning, middle, and an end. So, the first, what is is the beginning. The middle is the messy middle. That's where you're trying to contrast and show them that it's messy. It might be hard, it's worth it. And then the new bliss, you end with what in western cultures, where's like a happy ending. So, the new bliss is just imagine a world with your idea adopted, and then you paint a picture of that world poetically or pragmatically, and it works. It definitely works.\n\nLenny (00:35:41):\nOkay, this is really great. So, just to recap, point one is to make your listener the hero of the story and come at it with empathy. And I was actually thinking the Think Different campaign is an excellent example of that because it's about you thinking differently and being this incredible creative. And then item two is infuse your presentation with story and this what is, what could be new bliss. And then, okay, and number three, what was number three again?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:36:09):\nOh, it was ask yourself if they can see what you're saying. Can they see what I'm saying would be written on the note?\n\nLenny (00:36:16):\nI love this. Okay, let's talk about that. What does that mean and how do you do that?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:36:20):\nYeah, so for people to see what you're saying, that you have an opportunity to use visual tools like the presentation software, you have opportunities to have live sketchers sketch it while you're talking. There's so many ways you can help people see what you're saying. I would contend that you can use something in your talk that gives people something they'll always remember. We call that a star moment. And it could be a piece of dramatic data where the big numbers put up there. It could be an evocative story, it could be a beautiful picture. And one of the things that happens really well, especially with tech companies, is demonstrating through a picture so you can get alignment. So, the concept of a diagram when you describe your product that you're working on, is this thing inside of it, outside of it attached to it, is it on it is above it, especially architecture slides or just how technology works as something flows through a complex system.\n\n(00:37:20):\nWhen people can see that and it accompanies your verbal narrative, they can actually understand what you're conveying and move on. If you only had a verbal narrative, it wouldn't work as well. There's a lot of times though, where you don't have the support of a presentation or slides. You could be at a dinner table. If you're in a interesting conversation and you want someone to see what you're saying, that's where you pull out the napkin and you draw it. So, you could both see it, in meetings sometimes someone will just walk right up to the board and draw something. And my team, especially my design team is so good at this because they'll just stand up and say, I want to draw for you what I see, because we're about to prepare them to present to an audience. When you verbally said that, I saw this, was that your intent?\n\n(00:38:03):\nAnd then the room will stand up and we'll start all co-creating a graphic so that everyone sees the exact same thing, the exact same steps, the exact same insights in the order. So, nobody leaves with a question in their mind. And that's just so important for there to be an alignment around what is this? What are we all fighting for? What are we all living for? What are we all working for? And those moments of alignment are so, so important. And I'm a leader who sees things in the air. I just see it. And to me, my pattern finding nature, which you're like that too. I could see these patterns and to me, I see a whole scene and I could see it all clearly, but when my team's trying to look at the same thing, they might see 22 mosaic tiles out of a massive mosaic beautiful picture.\n\n(00:38:53):\nI see the final beautiful picture, but I've only served up a little tiny mosaic tile in a few places. And so I even have to be better about really bringing it to earth and saying, oh, here's the seven steps to get to this amazing outcome. Sometimes we see things so plainly in our mind's eye, and I was working with a really famous, powerful CEO and as she was talking, it's like, yeah, I could see her. I was watching her hand motions too, and she was like in this thing and she's moving her arms around in a distinct way and I said, I can tell you you have a picture in your mind's eye.\n\n(00:39:31):\nLet me draw for what I, and I did the same thing, walked up, drew had this, had this, had this. And she's like, \"Exactly.\" And we were brought in because nobody could articulate at all what she saw in her mind's eye. And so that was a massive program to be rolled out to the entire retail. It was like a hundred thousand retail workers needed to understand this graphic and the whole process she was trying to roll out wasn't getting traction. So, the minute people could see what she was saying, then it had all the breakthroughs that needed to happen around that program.\n\nLenny (00:40:04):\nThat reminds me of when I was working on the super host program at Airbnb. I don't know if the story will be of any interest to anyone, but I just remember I had this very clear handset of motions that described the strategy of the super host program. And then my friend's like, you should draw this on a slide-\n\nNancy Duarte (00:40:19):\nYou should draw it. Unless it's such a powerful hand gesture, right? Yeah, you could do that because your body is visual. And the other thing we try to get our customers to do is, if Dr. King had slides that day of the I Have a Dream speech, it just wouldn't been as beautiful. His words painted the pictures in our mind's eye. And so when we can have the slides off so people are focused on the verbal stream and what's coming out of your mouth that is such a powerful moment is to not have any visuals supporting you. So, they're a hundred percent focused on your body, how you're showing up and on the words coming out of your mouth and they're verbally seeing what you're saying versus actually pictorially seeing what you're saying. It's good.\n\nLenny (00:41:03):\nI like the idea that people are not staring at me and I prefer them distracted with a slide and I want to talk about nerves and stuff presenting in a bit. But that's interesting. So, you were talking about very kind of some concrete tips for slides and something I've heard a lot is when you're sharing a deck internally or talking an internal meeting, it's really powerful to just have obviously just a quick image thing, but then also the title of the slide is the point you want them to get from that slide. Is that something you recommend? And then generally any just very tactical advice on how to make a slide effective?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:41:35):\nYeah, the concept that each slide should make one point. So, your whole presentation should be grounded in what we call the audience journey, which is the big idea where you're trying to move them from where you're trying to move them to. Then a big idea is what is your point of view and what's at stake if they do or do not adopt it? That's the organizing mechanism for your whole deck. And then each slide itself that supports that one big, big idea, each slide itself should make one point in support of that big idea. People can't process too many things at one time, so depending on where you work, some people want something that's not the key insight at the top of the slide, some people do. So, some might want the action to be taken or some might want the dreamy future state to be clear.\n\n(00:42:22):\nSome consulting firms where the slides are much denser because they were paid millions of dollars to make a big old deck. Some of them are like, \"Oh, it always belongs in the lower right corner.\" So, it's kind of a little bit up to the brand and everyone believes it belongs somewhere else. If you're making what we call a slide doc, which I think your listenership would be interested in, presentations go from big staged event to in a meeting where you're trying to persuade your peers too. Can I make a presentation I can just circulate on email and everyone gets it? Well, that's called a slide doc. You put more words, you put stronger picture. You could have a hundred page appendix and maybe the front of it's only five slides, but everything they need to see your thinking, it follows behind it.\n\n(00:43:08):\nAnd you could circulate those and people read it. You write full sentences, you write full pros. It's kind of like the six page memo that's so popular to Amazon, but we contend that the F words and pictures, the six page memo is better. So, how do you send a memo around without the help of a presenter? And that's on one extreme. And those are called slide docs that you build in presentation software. And then the other extreme is I'm on a massive stage somewhere and there's all kinds of usage in between. And so I think the one idea per slide is important. And then this guiding principle, don't make a single slide unless it supports the one big idea of your whole talk. That's another principle for slide making, because most people go back to some sort of repository in some data store somewhere and they dig through old crappy slides and see if they can assemble something super quickly.\n\n(00:44:01):\nAnd that's a cop out. Most of the time if you really think empathetically about your audience, going to the repository might get you halfway there, but you should be modifying and mapping all of the content based on who you're talking to and especially if it's high stakes. And sometimes you're speaking to an audience that wants high density slides, because that's how they communicate in their culture. And if you showed up with cinematic stage ready slides, they'd laugh you out of the room. And so you really got to, I mean, you got to know your audience, you got to know how they communicate, who they talk to and map to that.\n\nLenny (00:44:39):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage.\n\n(00:45:16):\nEppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basically through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports, test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning plans. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10 x your experiment velocity. What's your take on the Minto Pyramid principle? I don't know if you think about that. Yeah, because there's a recommendation of just start with the conclusion and then explain why. And you're saying sometimes that's effective, sometimes not. Maybe in [inaudible 00:46:00]-\n\nNancy Duarte (00:45:59):\nSometimes it's effective. So, the Minto principle is amazing. She's got the, was it horizontal and vertical thinking? So, your main segues or your main section head should add up and then all the slides should support it. And then also how the construct of it is and when you state the conclusion first, that's a great thing to do with execs. It's a great thing to do when you are fundraising. There's a certain type of an audience that works for, and there's other audiences where they really need to be taught to long for this future state and you need longer to unpack it. So, one of the reasons you would start with the conclusion is especially in a funding round, now my version of a conclusion or result or is different than how she describes it. Because I would say you start with the new bliss. So, if you're trying to raise funds, you would say, I am going to share with you something today and you share how your solution increases human flourishing.\n\n(00:47:02):\nIt needs to be tied to the humanness and the big problem you're going to solve and how humankind will benefit. Well, that's different than just a consultant would show up and say, hi, I have this 800 page deck and the results of it are this. Let's unpack it. It's just a completely different motion and we use a three act story structure that's quite a bit different too. But that work is solid and it was based kind of like my work, her work was based in going super deep in McKinsey's thinking over time, whereas my work is going laterally across the 35 highest performing brands in the world that have been our customers. So, I went laterally across all those brands and then come up with solutions that are based, foreign story and are based in a bit of a broader application across companies that I have tons of respect for that body of work.\n\nLenny (00:47:57):\nAwesome. And willing to, I wrote a post about this whole concept for folks that want to dig deeper. Maybe one more question around tactical slide stuff, and I know this is, people ask you about this stuff all the time, but I can't help it. I guess just any other tips for just like you're sitting there trying to create a couple slides. What else maybe people should keep in mind to make it effective and let's say this is for a small meeting kind of thing.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:48:18):\nYeah, that's a good question. I think that if do some thinking first, if it's important, if it's an important point of the meeting, my team is taught to just kind of sketch, change your environment up a little bit. A lot of people will fire up the deck, which is very linear. It's like make one slide, second slide, third slide. So, just think and plan for a minute. And we tend to draw up storyboards. It's like, okay, the first point, the second point, the third point or the just think first. It can be analog or digital. Put a page in front of all your decks. It's just boxes. Just get the narrative right. And then when you actually open up the software, that's where you have to think about, what's the slide type that will convey this the most? Is it a table? Put a table. Especially for program managers, you have to convey dense project information, program information, product information, and that comes with density.\n\n(00:49:12):\nSo, if you're in a room with your peers and everyone in the room is a team and everyone has their own shorthanded and way of working, put that common slide up there. That common slide for that team might be dense to the outside world, but everyone's used to using it so there's no harm in using a commonly known, commonly acceptable framework or slide or table or Excel spreadsheet because you're aligning around a process. And so don't feel like every needs like cinematic pictures of kittens because that's not going to get you anywhere. You're trying to move an objective along, and that does mean that your slides might be more dense and sometimes internal slides have a lot more important information that needs to be on it to kick a product along or kick a process along.\n\nLenny (00:50:00):\nYou were just talking about process and that is a great segue to a question I wanted to ask is just what does your process look like when you're working with a company to help them craft an awesome presentation?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:50:10):\nYeah. Yeah. It's funny because I don't have to do this much anymore. I haven't done it for about 15 years, which is nice. I have a gorgeous team of strategist, writers, conceptual thinkers, beautiful design.\n\nLenny (00:50:22):\nI was curious.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:50:24):\nCoaches. Yeah, I know. I get coached. It's fun. I definitely, my books look awesome, not because of me, but because I'm followed around by people that do really gorgeous work. But the phrase that we use internally and sometimes with customers is we make presentations the way Pixar makes movies. And that's very similar to the way we get somebody that has this high stakes moment where it's a big deal in this moment. You have to win in the moment to push things along. And so we do, we literally craft a narrative, craft the big idea, craft the script and visualize certain moments. We start to map it out, we start to chunk it out.\n\n(00:51:05):\nAnd then big models sometimes when you're really making a revolutionary model, one that could drive all the web assets, a lot of that stuff people don't realize actually happens in the presentation first as an idea. So, sometimes we'll start working on some of the key models right away too, and we start to circulate that around the company, because everyone has to build consensus around it. So, sometimes there's multiple motions happening at the same time. Let's sketch this. You go away, you work with this department, you try to get this settled, you get that set, you get this.\n\n(00:51:36):\nAnd then it gets reassembled at the end. And then the narrative is where you work all the kinks out and then when they stand and deliver, it's like, yes, it's the voice track that all the process supported. And then other times we're building a report in a slide doc, or there was a time where we had a head of a multinational company that will remain nameless and the guy that was head of all of India was going to come over here and petition the CEO for a hundred million dollar budget.\n\n(00:52:09):\nIt's not trivial. And he comes, is like, \"Okay, I need your help with these five slides.\" And he just sends us the five slides and we're like, \"Well yeah, a hundred million. That's kind of a lot. You really want to put technology between you and the CEO. Do you really want to sit side by side and both be looking at a computer in this moment where it's like you're petitioning him for, that's a lot of money.\" And he's like, \"Yeah, you're right.\" So, what we did is we made a mental model he could hold up in his head and the structure was so simple and clear. And then there was three moments where we're like just, I don't know, just grab a piece of paper or go to a whiteboard and just start to draw in front of him. Let him see your eyes, let him have eye contact.\n\n(00:52:46):\nLet him see your passion. Don't be dispassionately looking at this computer. And he did it and he called us and he's like, \"I got a hundred million bucks.\" So, it's just those moments where you have to realize, wait, wait, wait, wait. Do I need a deck? Who am I talking to? And should is this a cookie cutter thing? And does the same process work every time? No. So, every time we solve something it's very different and we try to make it unique to the presenter and the audience that they're speaking to.\n\nLenny (00:53:18):\nAlong the same lines, a lot of presentations now are actually remote and on Zoom and virtual. What do you recommend to people in terms of how they present and put presentations together being remote?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:53:28):\nYeah, it's funny, we spent a lot of time coaching people to look in the camera. So, while I've been talking to you, I'm not actually looking at your face. I'm looking at the little dot at the top of my screen and my camera. And not a lot of people can do that. So, it's gotten to where I can see that little white glowing dot and my heart warms, I know you're there, I feel you. I can get sensations in my skin when I know I'm talking to someone that I adore or admire. And that took a long time to get there. And I was presenting remotely pre COVID. So, a lot of our coaching was about eye contact and doing that. The other thing that happens is people don't see our hands anymore. They're under the table. They can't see how much space in a room we're taking up.\n\n(00:54:15):\nThey can't see a lot of the characteristics that are common in communicating. And so there's a lot of coaching around presence and how do you have presence in a room? How do you even get the microphone away from someone that's remote and all those kinds of things. And a new study just came out, I just came across my desk today and it said that soft skills really suffered. And the people who did it right say and looked at the camera, they don't have good eye contact skills anymore. When they are looking face-to-face in someone's eyes, it's like, oh, they're not used to it. It's been so long.\n\n(00:54:50):\nAnd then the other thing is, where do I sit in a room who's got the position of authority? Just kind of some classic things that convey information in real life. So, it's interesting, it peaked and now people are going back to the office some. A percent are back in the office. And now we have this weird place where it's, oh, it's half in the office and half people are remote. And the people that are remote are having a hard time getting their voices heard because the people in the room consume most of the air. So, it's kind of going through this undulating life cycle of new communication skills people need while they're remote. It's all changing.\n\nLenny (00:55:34):\nI'm glad that I was not a PM in this remote world to be honest. I never experienced it, but I have a lot of empathy for being a product manager in this remote work world. Feels like the job got a lot harder.\n\nNancy Duarte (00:55:44):\nIt did. I think it did.\n\nLenny (00:55:46):\nYeah. So, let's talk about nerves and stage fright. So, I hate public speaking. I get extremely nervous people. They may not feel this when they watch me, but it's not my natural state. You work with a lot of people that I imagine are like, oh my god, I'm so scared to give this presentation. What advice do you give them to help them through that and feel more comfortable?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:56:06):\nYeah, I think people who are more thoughtful and contemplative about speaking have better content. They tend to really think through stuff than someone who's like, I got this. I'll just wing it. I'll just walk on the stage. Anyone who's like, tells me I am a nervous presenter, I'm like, you have probably got gorgeous content in your heart that the world needs to hear, because usually they are really deep and thoughtful. Like you already mentioned, you're a pattern finder and you like to do thoughtful work. And so it's hard. My husband is actually a brilliant communicator, just getting him to feel like he wants to take up the space. He's a better communicator than I am. And so what happens is the reason you get scared, it's a fight or flight instinct. For some reason stepping out on that stage, you feel your body and your mind and your psyche is feeling threatened like you would be attacked by an animal.\n\n(00:56:56):\nThat's literally what's happening. And so you couple things you could do. You can actually sit in one of the seats of the auditorium and just sit there and look at the stage, look at the setting so you can imagine yourself on it. But then picture yourself as that friendly face, the one that's happy to see you, the one that's delighted that you're speaking. And then as you're standing up, remember that you saw yourself sitting there smiling and very happy. You have to change your visual model that people's faces will be scowling, they'll be judging you, they'll be doubting you. All of those things are only in your head because getting you out on the stage to be able to start to expose people to this amazing content you have, the biggest battle is to get you out on this stage and delivering it.\n\n(00:57:47):\nAnd I asked a bunch of people once, I did a survey of all these public speakers and was like, how do you prepare? How do you prepare? What's your pre-talk ritual? And some of them were like, \"I play heavy metal music and I skip around the entire convention center, just get all fired up.\" I'm like, \"Wow, I have to calm myself down because I already have over to the top energy.\" So, I literally find the dark. I don't go to the green room, that stuff. I don't like to hear gibber jabber. I have to be focused on my content. And so I find the darkest corner of the backstage and calmly sit and just breathe. I just breathe. Sometimes if I'm nervous, if there's someone real famous in the audience, I have a little list playlist of funny things that people sent me, but I never watch. And that way right before I walk on stage, I chemically, my whole body chemically shifts from nervous to laughter. And that really helps me too, because it's chemical and you have to train your chemistry a bit.\n\nLenny (00:58:46):\nI really like that tip. What are these funny things you watch if you-\n\nNancy Duarte (00:58:50):\nIt's like YouTube things, TikTok things. Just things that I tag and I try not to watch them or things that make me laugh. There's this dorky low watched video of a guy with tin cans wrapped around his waist and he plays them. And my husband walks around the house like him and making the noise and I could probably sing the beat if I had to. And so sometimes I just play that, because it just transports me home, because a lot of times I'm presenting away from home and it just makes me laugh at my husband who's hysterical. So, it's just random things, but if you laugh and somehow can transport yourself outside of the fear of walking out there, it helps reset you before you walk out on stage.\n\nLenny (00:59:39):\nI really like that. Is there anything else just off the top of your head that just like right before you go on stage that you find to be really effective? So, watching funny videos, I love that. [inaudible 00:59:47] use it. Anything else?\n\nNancy Duarte (00:59:48):\nI breathe. I think I've learned a breathing pattern. I take a deep, deep breath and then I take that one while my lungs are full, I take another gulp of breath and I have to let it out real slow. But when I got the feedback that my friend and some people get over their fear by headbanging to heavy metal, so I'm not saying that's not the wrong thing. So, I thought, well, maybe I should try that before I do a talk. And so I literally didn't do that. But I stretched, I jumped a little, just low jumps, put my arms real big up in the air. And then I walked on stage and I happened to be speaking at a massive medical company, like big brand. And I finished my talk and my assistant got a call and they were like, \"We're little worried about Nancy. We think she might need to see a doctor. She could never control her breathing and we're really concerned.\"\n\n(01:00:38):\nAnd it was just because I just pumped myself up a little bit. So, I don't do that whatsoever anymore. I went back to my calming, contemplative, meditative pre-talk ritual. So, for some people, literally I do encourage people to try headbanging to heavy metal. It might work. It's just a matter of what you need. And nobody would guess that I'm not one to dance around or pump myself up, but I am not, I have to calm myself down. It's the opposite.\n\nLenny (01:01:09):\nAwesome. Just a few more questions.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:01:12):\nSure.\n\nLenny (01:01:12):\nSo, you wrote a book called Illuminate and something that stood out to me from that book is this idea of a torch bearer and torch bearer leader. Can you just talk about what that is and why that is important in power?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:01:22):\nYeah, I loved writing that book. Co-author Patty Sanchez, a hat tip to her. So, to come up with this book, we knew that there's one presentation, there's a single presentation, could be on a stage, could be in a meeting, just updating people on a project status. And we knew though that every presentation usually is part of a larger movement where you're trying to move people in mass to this alternate future. So, we studied movements, we deconstructed the largest movements. We met with Marshall Ganz at Harvard to say, \"Hey, could this be true?\" Because he studies movements. It was so fun. And then movements have a five act structure. So, picture, there's this moment where you have to verbalize the dream like, hey, we're going to head to this new place and this is what I have to do at my kickoff meetings. It's like imagine this place in the future that we're headed to.\n\n(01:02:15):\nSo, it's five steps, it's a five act story structure, if you want to call it five acts. It's dream, leap, fight, climb, arrive. So, the torch bearer, the reason we called that is the leaders know where they're headed, but they might not ever see it super, super clearly. And we chose a torch because a torch, if you're in a cave and you have a torch, you only see about five, eight feet around you, but it's enough to dissipate the fear of the people following you in. And so nobody sees the future clearly. Nobody has that kind of level skill. All we know is I need to traverse this direction to be at the right place in the future so all my staff is safe, all are, we stay a leader in the industry. That's all I know. And as we start to head there, there's these moments of communication you need to do, which is, hey everyone, here's the dream. Here's where we're headed. That's the dream phase.\n\n(01:03:09):\nThen there's this moment where they either choose to jump in and go with you or they choose not to. You could talk about Frodo like Sam and only a few hobbits followed him. And so it's like people select to commit this journey. That's the beginning of your movement. But then the middle is the messy middle of a story. We call it the fight and climb phase. So, what happens is they commit to your idea, they commit to your program, your project, and they're like enthused at first. And then they go into the state of, oh my God, this is harder than I thought. It's a long slog. This climb is getting exhausted. I don't know if I have this much fight in me to make this all work, not fight with each other, but like, oh my God, I'm having to overcome this roadblock and that roadblock and we have to go get that budget.\n\n(01:03:53):\nSo, it's just, it's like a fight, climb, fight, climb, fight, climb. And then ultimately you arrive. Each one of those five phases you need to use speeches, stories, ceremonies and symbols at each phase to give the people traveling with you the emotional fuel they need to keep going, to keep seeing that idea become realized. And it literally is about fueling the right emotions with speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols while you're moving people toward a bigger initiative. So, it's bigger than just one presentation, it's multiple presentations, multiple stories, multiple ceremonies. So, I loved that book. People are really feeding off of it right now because leading change has been nonstop. It's just been change, change, change the last especially few years.\n\nLenny (01:04:40):\nChange is the only constant like they say.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:04:42):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (01:04:43):\nI really like this metaphor of the torch giving you a sense of, as a leader, you can see some portion around you, but you're not going to see the entire cave necessarily. That is really interesting. Maybe a final question very tactically is I give an interview where you shared that you had kind of two videos, one where it's very informal, you're just standing in front of whiteboard in jeans or something, just talking about some about data, I think in presentations. And then you had a similar video where it was very well constructed, high production value, and the informal video did a lot better. Is that something you're seeing? Just that kind of content ends up being more successful and why do you think that is?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:05:21):\nI think video content, production quality now isn't the expectation for it being high quality. It's just completely shifted over the last five, eight years or so as everyone's an expert and can show up as an expert. There's a big difference to me about showing up as a keynoter, which is like, I'm going to stand, I'm going to look right. I'm going to have this eye contact, I'm going to nail it. My slides are gorgeous, I'm driving the industry. And for people to think that our explanations of things needs to be done as a stand and deliver keynote, that's just not true. So, I experimented with that and I had some videos I had done, and one of them, like you said, was me looking in the camera. I even had HD makeup, a film crew. I was well lit, I looked amazing. I mean, I did look amazing and it was polished.\n\n(01:06:09):\nI delivered it really well. And then I thought, because on LinkedIn I post a lot, that's where my primary channel is, and I thought what would happen if I just posted a rando shot of me? And I'm maybe airing on a little bit like orange, I look a little Trumpian, a little bit orange. It's not color corrected, but it's super informative, really full of information. And that was my highest viewed video so far. And I realized that it's like people want the content and we do as a presentation company, I have to nail it maybe more than others, but it doesn't have to be fully video edited, infographics spinning, swooshing things forward and swooshing things back.\n\n(01:06:50):\nThat kind of nature of it is not necessary to get the message across. And so we actually have a whole process and program we're rolling out where you're going to see a lot more video from us, partially from that insight, but partially because my team, I have a team of experts, they have a lot of great things to share, and so I'm trying to give them, I'm trying to make it be like Duarte does not equal Nancy Duarte. I'm trying to make it so it's like so many experts work at Duarte, you got to watch any video from any of them is where we're moving at Duarte. They're freaks of brilliance and just experts. They're world class experts. So, that's what we're trying to do.\n\nLenny (01:07:27):\nI feel like you have a similar challenge to me where I named my newsletter, Lenny's Newsletter.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:07:32):\nYeah, same thing.\n\nLenny (01:07:33):\n[inaudible 01:07:33] talk about that.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:07:33):\nSame thing.\n\nLenny (01:07:33):\nYeah, can never be anyone else. It's a challenge, but yeah, don't know, it worked out. Okay. Actually, real final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Have you seen examples of product managers specifically telling really good stories?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:07:46):\nThe product management process has multiple phase. There's the creative explorative process all the way through to getting it produced. And I think story can take you along in each phase. So, there's example, which I read about, I wasn't actually even part of, but Brian Chesky at Airbnb, there was a whole article where he unpacked this moment in their product development cycle where they decided they would take a walk in the shoes of their customer and they hired a Pixar illustrator to illustrate each scene as the team's like, okay, okay, they said this is her name. And they were like, okay, what happens? Her alarm goes off. Okay, what happens next? What happens next? Okay, now she's decided she needs to book something. What does she do? She wants to do that. They realized from this little walk in the shoes of their customer just this day in the life, which is a classic storytelling method for any product, they realized that they had their strategy wrong, that they needed to move as soon as possible to a mobile first strategy.\n\n(01:08:46):\nAnd it was just because they actually thought about, okay. She goes, brushes their teeth, they do this. They were just literally walking through the life of their ideal customer and that was when they realized they had it all messed up. But the other phases, after all this work people put into product and the making of the product and the managing of pushing it through. We have a large client that makes shoes or athletic things. I love telling stories, but I can't say this. And there's this moment where we get brought in and could you please train our product people in story? We're like, \"What's the big problem?\" They're like, \"They'll spend a year or two on a shoe and be like, chunk, put it on the table. And they're like, what do you have to say about it?\" They're like, \"It's red.\" And it's like all these years of investment, all these years, they couldn't unpack any sort of story or any sort of reason or even their passion for why they chose red.\n\n(01:09:41):\nAnd it was like, here's my shoe, it's red. And so this ability to move things along by adding meaning or why and then wrapping it in a story actually can get a product chosen or rejected or there's just so many examples of different spaces in the product cycle that could benefit from a really well told story from, like I said, how the products innovate in the roadmap all the way through to what gets accepted. And then the big reveal, you think about even all the big Apple launches, it's about a big product reveal. It's about revealing this thing that had been hidden for so long and it's another moment to tell amazing stories. So, that's kind of a little bit of an insight on the product side of how to use story.\n\nLenny (01:10:27):\nThe Airbnb example is an awesome example. It's all true. When I joined Airbnb is actually right there in the process of doing that.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:10:34):\nI love that.\n\nLenny (01:10:36):\nAnd they ended up drawing these key frames of the journey as you described, and they put it right in the center of the office. Here's the journey of a host and a guest that's like 12 frames of that journey. And that actually became the strategy of the company is let's pick six of these frames and make them awesome. And that's what we're going to do.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:10:36):\nThat's awesome.\n\nLenny (01:10:54):\nMake booking experience awesome. Make the arrival experience awesome. So, there's a lot of truth to that.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:11:00):\nAnd it was visualized, right? The vision was visualized like what you're saying we're headed in the future. And it was super clear. I love that story. So cool you were there.\n\nLenny (01:11:09):\nYeah, it was very cool. And they actually were very mobile. You could grab one of these drawings and bring it to your desk and how are we going to make this moment better this week?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:11:17):\nThat's awesome.\n\nLenny (01:11:19):\nAnd it was actually indeed, Pixar storyboard artist that they hired for a year. That was his job. Draw these key frames.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:11:25):\nOh, that's amazing.\n\nLenny (01:11:27):\nAnd it connects so directly with your point about empathy. That was the epitome of empathy. Here's what the guest and hosts are going through, and here's where we can do better.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:11:37):\nYeah, it's amazing. Yeah, it does tie together.\n\nLenny (01:11:40):\nIf folks want to look this up, by the way, we'll link in the show notes. If you just Google Snow White Airbnb, you can watch a video of how they all kind of came about this. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you if you're ready.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:11:54):\nYep, I'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:11:56):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:12:00):\nI think I always classically recommend the gospels because there's just so much love and groundbreaking thinking there. And then for people who do wind up taking an interest in story, I think one of the best books, if you want to pick that up, is Chris Vogler's, The Writer's Journey, where he took Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey, made it 12 Steps, and he was a Disney story analyst. So, it's just really classic body of work that had really helped people get their minds around story and the archetypes.\n\nLenny (01:12:30):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:12:33):\nIt's my little sinful pleasure. It's way into K drama, Korean drama. Don't even ask me how, but I'm way into that. I've seen almost all of them now. I'm at the bottom of the barrel of them.\n\nLenny (01:12:44):\nIs there a favorite?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:12:45):\nNo, my husband just watched one. It's called Business Proposal, and he watched it with me and he's like, oh no, now I'm going to be hooked too. They're just real. They're just cute as a button. And they have a longer arc. They're like an epic length tail. They drop in 12 part seasons or one season 12. Anyway, don't even get me started. It sounds dumb, because I like the epic tales and the dramas, but they're cute.\n\nLenny (01:12:45):\nI love it.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:13:07):\nThey're just cute.\n\nLenny (01:13:08):\nThis is great. Getting very real. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask people that you're hiring?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:13:14):\nOh, favorite interview question. We ask a lot about who they are. So, we use psychometrics a lot here, and we really understand who they are, and we actually ask people to tell a story. And if that's uncomfortable or those psychometrics are uncomfortable, they're not really a fit, because we are a systemic story culture, and we define empathy at the company as know yourself, accept yourself, kind of work on yourself, and then adapt to others. So, if people aren't open to really understanding how they show up then and then adapt and change under our care, then we don't hire them.\n\nLenny (01:13:51):\nWhat is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:13:55):\nI'm excited about a tool I just paid for last week. It's called writer.com. So, it's built on multiple language models and including, it's going to be trained on our own, all my IP, all my books, every blog post, it'll learn the voice and it'll use my own kind of language model to help us write faster. So, we put really good prompts in and we get a really good product out. So, I'm super excited about that.\n\nLenny (01:14:17):\nI'm actually an investor in that company, so this is great to hear.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:14:20):\nOh yeah. That's awesome.\n\nLenny (01:14:21):\nWriter.com. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your approach to developing presentations that has had a big impact on your ability to execute and get them out?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:14:33):\nYeah. I think there's the biggest roadblock for so long that made things painful was the edit cycles. How do we do a round with a client? Then you have multiple version, then you have version control. So, we've come up with this annotation system, so everyone on a project knows exactly the status of that slide, and there's no way really to check slides in and out. And so we've come up with this amazing, beautiful, very visual process where everyone knows the exact status of the slide, and it's really easy. You could put it in thumbnail mode and be like, hmm, we're 80% complete. Everyone's going to focus on just these two things. So, that part of the process, especially enterprise at scale where 20 or 30 people are contributors to a deck. That process we made is the clients are really liking it.\n\nLenny (01:15:14):\nTo leave people with one final tip to give better presentations. What would that be?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:15:18):\nTo become a better presenter, pick a topic you are passionate about, something where you're like, oh my gosh, I've got to see this happen. And pick that topic and be so passionate about it. Work on that talk or stand up at a volunteer thing and really work on something that makes you feel passionate. And then in the future when you're presenting something that you're not passionate about, everything you learned will apply to a business presentation, but you're going to have that feeling. You're going to know what it's like to present from your soul and from a place of passion and the great presenters tap into that passion point and pull from that, and that's what makes them a great presenter on other topics, that they might not be as passionate about.\n\nLenny (01:15:58):\nNancy, I so appreciate you making time for this. It's been an honor.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:16:01):\nYou're amazing.\n\nLenny (01:16:02):\nEverything. You're amazing.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:16:03):\nYou're amazing.\n\nLenny (01:16:05):\nYou're amazing. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they'd like to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nNancy Duarte (01:16:12):\nOh, they can find me at duarte.com. There's also a duarte.com/nancy where I've got a ton of free stuff where you could find a lot of the things I've talked about. I'm on Twitter @NancyDuarte, and I do connect to everyone who connects to me on LinkedIn, which is kind of fun. So, I think, how could they be useful to me? I think it will cure so many problems if everyone became a really good communicator, so you can help me by working hard on your communication skills, working hard on your clarity, and making everyone around you much happier people.\n\nLenny (01:16:47):\nWhat a beautiful way to end it. Nancy, again, thank you so much for being here.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:16:50):\nOh, you're amazing. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (01:16:52):\nWe're amazing. Let's end it.\n\nNancy Duarte (01:16:52):\nWe are. Let's just say it.\n\nLenny (01:16:56):\nAll right. Bye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Meta’s head of product on working with Mark Zuckerberg, early growth tactics, and more | Naomi Gleit\n\n## Transcript\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:00:00):\nI really believe in frameworks for things that helps drive extreme clarity. I work on a lot of different projects. A lot of times I'm ramping up a new project, I'm like, \"Where can I learn what I need to learn about this project?\" I ask five different people, get five different answers. That is unacceptable. Of course, I'm sure there's hundreds of docs associated with the project, but there needs to be one canonical doc. Everyone should know exactly where the canonical doc is. That's the one place I can go to get all the information I need about a project and it will link to all the other docs, things on the canonical doc are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):\nToday my guest is Naomi Gleit. Naomi is head of product at Meta. Other than Mark Zuckerberg, she's the longest-serving executive at Meta. She joined what was then called Facebook as employee number 29 and has been at Meta for almost 20 years. She's seen the company scale from 30 employees to the one and a half trillion dollar business that it is today. Naomi does very few podcasts and interviews and so I was really excited to chat with her and have her on this podcast. In our conversation, we dig into the many lessons that she learned from Facebook's early and legendary growth team, her superpower of taking really complex and gnarly problems and projects, simplifying them and delivering results. We also get into leadership lessons she's learned from Zuck, including his recent transformation into possibly the coolest CEO in tech. Also, why PMs are the conductor of product teams, some very tactical tips for running meetings, writing docs, working out, getting better sleep, and even how to get more protein in your diet.\n\n(00:01:31):\nThis was such a fun conversation and such a wide-ranging conversation and whether you are in product or growth or any other tech function, you will get something useful out of this conversation. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Naomi Gleit.\n\n(00:01:56):\nNaomi, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:02:00):\nThanks so much for having me. As I told you earlier, I refer your podcast all the time and so I can't believe I have the opportunity to actually talk on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:08):\nWow, I'm so flattered. I never get tired of hearing that. Appreciate you sharing that. I want to share a couple of tidbits about you because it's pretty crazy when you see this list. Okay, so you are Meta's longest serving executive other than Mark Zuckerberg. You're employee number 29 at Facebook. You've been there for over 19 years. Sorry, at Meta, formerly Facebook.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:02:35):\nI do that all the time. That's what happens when you've been at Meta for 19 years is you can't get the name right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:42):\nOkay, good. I won't feel bad about that Then and then the last thing is just you've been at the center of some of the most foundational products that Meta and Facebook have worked on, including working on the early growth team and thinking about the early growth strategy. Basically you've been there from employee number 30 to today, a one and a half trillion dollars company, one of the largest companies in the world today. Very few people have ever seen this sort of growth and scale from the inside.\n\n(00:03:09):\nFirst of all, I guess let me just ask this, do you ever reflect on this and just realize like, \"Holy shit, what a journey I've been on. How wild.\"?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:03:16):\nIt is a great question. I would love to say that I reflect on it. The truth is I think I barely have time to reflect right now. I'm thinking about all the things that I need to do on my to-do list, so I'm pretty in it still. Even after 19 years, I am really focused on the work that I need to do. I do honestly have moments where I get to reflect. For example, on this podcast. Sometimes people do ask me and I think especially as I approach the twenty-year milestone, my twenty-year Faceversary, I'm sure that will give ample opportunity for me to look back.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:55):\nSuch a classic product manager answer. I have too much to do-\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:03:55):\nToo busy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:59):\nI have to think about this. Yeah, I got to hit some goals here.\n\n(00:04:04):\nThis episode is brought to you by Pendo, the only all-in-one product experience platform for any type of application.

I want to start by just how you actually landed at Meta as employee number 29, which is a life-changing decision and a life-changing role and I want to learn if there's something folks can see about what you did that might be helpful to them when they're trying to find a place to work and your story, I was reading about the story and it's super interesting. You basically wrote your senior thesis at Stanford about why Facebook was going to win and why it was going to beat its competitors and the competitors cited I've never even heard of, so it's interesting that that was the competitor at the time. Could you just share the story of how you landed as employee number 29 at Facebook, now Meta?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:06:54):\nFacebook as part of being an academic, researching Facebook, also being a Stanford student using Facebook. I was like, \"I really want to work here.\" Facebook had just moved to Palo Alto. Mark had driven across country I guess, and arrived in Palo. Alto opened up an office at 443 Emerson Avenue or Emerson Street. It was right above the Jing Jing's Chinese restaurant in downtown Palo Alto and I just went to the office sort of cold called the equivalent of just walking into the office and seeing if there were any available jobs. There were not. I think I did that maybe five to 10 more times.\n\n(00:07:31):\nEventually, there was an opening to interview for Sean Parker's personal assistant. He was at the time I think the president. I did interview and I did not get the job. A few months later I found out about a marketing role that was available. And one interesting thing I haven't really talked about was I got an offer from Facebook. I also got a competing offer from LinkedIn, and so at that time I made the choice to go to Facebook because I was interested in the social networking aspect of it. Why was I so bullish on this website at the time it was www.thefacebook.com. Why was I so excited about this thing?\n\n(00:08:12):\nI think it's because I definitely saw that there was product market fit. I saw that students at Stanford were obsessed with it, but it also had a long list of colleges that were really excited and on the waiting list to be accepted onto Facebook, and so there was this product market fit piece and also a huge demand from other audiences, other colleges, but our younger brothers and sisters were also sort of interested about Facebook and it seemed like it had this much broader appeal. So that's what happened. I got the marketing job. Cheryl also talks about when you are on getting a rocket ship, don't ask what seat. That was my foot in the door and here we are 19 years later.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:02):\nI was just going to say that that's such a good example of what she recommends of if you can get a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask which seat. And I love the Sean Parker piece. I did not know that. That's hilarious. What a different life would've been if you got that job and went down that track.\n\n(00:09:18):\nSo a couple of takeaways here for people that are trying to pick where to work, what I love about your story is one is you just had so much. You just had confidence that this business would work and you just knew that you wanted to get on this rocket ship. You saw attraction. So that told you I guess that added to this confidence that this was going to work out. And then you said that you walked into the office kind of cold, not even cold emailing or calling, but cold arriving. Five to 10 times you said?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:09:45):\nYeah, it was pure just refusing to quit. I think I just walked into the office, I talked to the person at the front desk, \"Is there anything that I can do?\" They weren't hiring non-technical people. I didn't have a computer science degree. I wasn't technical. I had this bachelor of arts degree and that's why the personal assistant in the marketing role eventually did open and was something that I thought I could be qualified for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):\nCool. I think that's such an empowering lesson of if you look at someone like you and they're like, \"Oh, she was so early at Facebook, how lucky,\" clearly wasn't luck. You knew you wanted to work at this company. You put a lot of effort into making it happen no matter the job. I think that's a really good takeaway and lesson. So if there's a company today that you are excited about that you're just like, \"This is going to be a massive success,\" what I'm hearing is just do everything you can to try to land a job there and eventually you'll be in a role you actually want. It doesn't have to start there.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:10:41):\nWhen I got to Facebook, I knew I wanted to build. As someone who wasn't really technical, I wasn't going to be an engineer or a coder. I wanted to work with the engineers and the coders to build products. I thought product management was the right function for me, and so my dream was always to be a PM and it wasn't luck as to how I ended up becoming a PM. I sort of took the same approach showing up at the office asking if there were any roles.\n\n(00:11:08):\nBy then, we had moved to 156 University and all of the PMs and engineers worked on the second floor, and I was working in marketing, like I mentioned, and I worked on the third floor and all the business functions worked on the third floor, and my goal was to be a PM. I ended up going, sort of the analogy, I went to the second floor most days after work, asked if there were any projects that I could help out with.\n\n(00:11:34):\nIt was very early days. There was always more to do than people to do it. And so eventually I picked up a few projects, helping with program management, giving my product feedback, and by the time that I actually applied formally to be a product manager, I had been doing the job voluntarily, almost informally for a few months.\n\n(00:11:58):\nAnd I remember this because I had a seat on the third floor. I picked up all the stuff on my desk, put it in a box, walked down to the second floor once I got the job to become a PM. And when I got to the second floor, I distinctly remember everyone on the second floor standing and clapping. And so it was a big standing ovation. I'll never forget, Boz was there, by the way. I know Boz has been on your podcast, but even Boz was there sort of standing and clapping. And so I guess to the lesson that you were trying to extract from my story, I do think I sort of tried to create the luck by not giving up and just repeatedly cold calling or cold showing up or cold volunteering until I sort of was able to make it happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:51):\nAmazing. Again, very empowering. It's not just like, \"Oh, there's these people that just get lucky they land this PM job.\" It's like you landed at the company. I want to be a product manager, which is interesting. Most people don't grow up in I want to be a product manager. That's like a rare thing people even want, especially that early on. So it's interesting that you already knew that, but you basically did the job. You did the job of PM before you had the job, and by the time you actually asked for it, you've been doing it for a long time and you could show, \"Hey, look, I'm actually good at this. I can do this job.\" Awesome.\n\n(00:13:22):\nBy the way, I love the Boz connection. I'm finding that Boz is connected to the most guests of this podcast in so many different ways.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:13:29):\nReally?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):\nCurious. Yeah, like Ami and-\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:13:32):\nOh yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:33):\nAnd a few other people. It's just interesting. There's a Boz spiderweb of connections throughout this podcast so far. Okay, so I'm going to fast-forward to today. So your role today is head of product at Meta?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:13:46):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:46):\nWhat does that mean? What do you do at Meta today? How would you describe your role?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:13:52):\nThere are a few thousand PMs at Meta. They do not all report to me. I would say a few hundred of them report to me on the teams that I directly manage, but I feel responsible for the entire PM community at Meta. There are things that we do centrally, things like PM performance, PM culture PM onboarding and training, and that's the kind of thing that I look out for.\n\n(00:14:16):\nObviously I wanted to be a PM. Head of product is my dream job. I am deeply supportive of the PM function, and so I really care and I think PMs are a huge point of leverage in a company for how we can actually get stuff done and help accomplish the company's goals. And so I sort of focus on PM as a really important exponential lever for doing that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:45):\nI love that. Okay. I'm going to come back to what you've learned about what makes super successful PMs, what makes you really successful. I want to take a tangent to Zuck.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:14:54):\nPlease. Yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:56):\nSo you've known Zuck for over 20 years at this point, and I just have to ask a few Zuck questions because people are always curious to learn from what has worked so well for him. The first question is just there's been a pretty profound transformation in Mark over the past few years, both in terms of how he leads and also just in his coolness and vibe factor. What are your thoughts on just this transformation and how he's been able to pull it off?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:15:22):\nSo I've always said that there is the biggest gap of anybody I know between what people think of Mark and who Mark really is. And so I think this is the Mark that I've known for the past 20 years and the world is finally getting to see what I've been lucky enough to see. And that gap that we've talked about is really starting to close.\n\n(00:15:46):\nHow did we get here? I always say Mark is a learn it all, not a know-it-all. He is the fastest person at upskilling of anyone I've ever met. He used to do these annual challenges. One year I did them with him, it was learning Chinese, and within a year he was able to basically achieve an eighth grade fluency in Chinese. And that's just one example. Obviously, he's gotten incredibly great at guitar, MMA, a lot of his passions, but he's also gotten a lot better at some of the professional skills. And I think negotiation, public speaking is one of those. I think before in the early days, it just wasn't something that he was very comfortable with. He's talked himself about coming across as a little scripted. I think he was not confident and pretty careful about how he showed up and he's upskilled here. He's just gotten a lot more comfortable, and so people are able to see who he really is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:44):\nHe was also like, I don't know, 20 something when he started Facebook and now he's running a 80,000 person org. I could see the emotion habits.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:16:52):\nYes. I think he might've been 19 or 20 when I came.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:56):\nOh God, that's insane. So yeah, I could see why someone would change. I was at the Acquired podcast Chase event with him being interviewed, and he's just such a cool dude now. He just has these big shirts with his own letters on it, his own phrases, his chain. What a cool dude.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:17:16):\nHis long hair.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:17):\nHis long hair.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:17:18):\nHis watch. Yeah, I was at that event too. I thought it was great. I think, yeah, that's the no gap between who Mark is and what the world sees.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:30):\nI love that. Is there something about Zuck that you know that most people don't know? Something that would surprise us?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:17:37):\nThe one thing I would say about Mark is I think people know he's married. He has three daughters. He's a really great dad, he's a really great husband. I would say he's also a really good friend. Maybe that's something that I can sort of speak to from experience. He's just an incredibly thoughtful friend. There was a period in my life, I think it was 10 years ago when I was going through just sort of a really hard time. I had come out of a breakup, but Mark saw that I was having a hard time. He asked me if I wanted to volunteer to teach a class in East Palo Alto after their school day.\n\n(00:18:15):\nAnd in retrospect, it's pretty funny, but Mark and I taught a class about how to build a business. So you had the CEO of Meta teaching this class to a bunch of middle school students, and we got really close to them through that process. We made some really important mentorship connections. For years, we met with them. I think we still continue to, even though they've now at this point graduated from college and have real jobs.\n\n(00:18:43):\nBut one of the lessons that we taught during that class that I remember Mark distinctly writing on the whiteboard, or not the whiteboard, there actually was chalk, it was with chalk on a chalkboard with the four life lessons. That was one, and I kept these for myself as well, love yourself. Two, only then can you truly serve others. Three, focus on what you can control. And four, for those things never give up.\n\n(00:19:12):\nAnd that was sort of his life lessons, four steps to how to approach life. And we actually made stickers for these four steps that the students could actually put on their composition notebooks as a reminder. And I think obviously that has really helped me over time, but I think that in that you can see some of what I think we all see in Mark, for example, for those things never give up. He has that aspect of him and it makes sense. For me number three is really the hardest, which is focus on what you can control. I think I probably think I can control more things than I actually can.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:53):\nSo do we all. I love that he was sharing that in a class on how to start a business, this life advice.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:20:00):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:02):\nOh man, that's amazing. I want to chat a bit about, so at this point is 86,000 employees, something like that. That's what I found online. So he has to run this massive org as this CEO, one person. I know that one way that he does this, he has something called a small group. Is that the term?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:20:24):\nYes, small group.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):\nOkay, cool. So he's got the small group that he calls it and it's essentially is like core execs and this group meets regularly, and that's kind of how he's able to manage the entire org through this small group. For people that are struggling to run an increasingly larger org, are there any tidbits from how Mark and the small group operate that might be helpful to folks?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:20:47):\nSure. So I think the first thing is small group is sort of the leadership team. It's the leaders working on the most important projects at the company, sort of independent of reporting structure and stuff. It's like who are the leaders on the big most important projects or functions? They will be represented in small group.\n\n(00:21:08):\nWhat makes this group unique? A lot of them are people like me, people that have been there for a very long time. So I think the tenure of small group is really rare. Why I think that's important is you have a lot of people that are motivated by mission rather than climbing the corporate ladder at this point. And so there are a lot of what I call disagreeable givers.\n\n(00:21:34):\nSo just to back up, I don't know if you've heard this framework, but I think I learned this from Adam Grant during an executive learning and development session, and he was saying that if you think of a two-by-two, there's people who are agreeable and disagreeable, and then there's people who are givers and takers.\n\n(00:21:52):\nAnd the most dangerous kind of person to have in an organization is an agreeable taker. And what that means is an agreeable person, super nice, everyone likes them, really easy to get along with, but they're a taker and maybe their motivation is more self-interested rather than what's best for the company, which is how I would define a giver. And the most precious person in an organization is the disagreeable giver. Those are the people who are really motivated to do what's best for the company, but they can be a little bit disagreeable in the sense that they may not say what you want to hear. They may push back on things, they may fight for things. And so I think small group is characterized by a lot of disagreeable givers and I think that's really important for an organization.\n\n(00:22:41):\nOne thing I think Mark has done really well in general is just have a culture, including on his leadership team, of people who give him feedback. I think a lot of times as you get more successful or as you have more fame or if you have more wealth, you lose having an accurate feedback loop. And people may not want to be a hundred percent honest with you for various reasons. And Mark has tried to ensure that he himself has an accurate feedback loop, or we as a company have more of an accurate feedback loop by surrounding himself and our leadership team and creating a culture of giving direct and honest feedback. So that's some of the unique properties of small group.\n\n(00:23:25):\nFrom a process perspective, we have one weekly sort of strategic meeting. It's more open-ended, there is time for discussion. It's longer and it's sort of more unstructured. We also have one weekly operational meeting, which is highly structured where we go through all of the priority projects. The person who owns each of the projects will actually speak to the weekly updates for that project. And it's very operational and tactical.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:55):\nAwesome. I just love this name, small group. It's just like a cozy name. It's not like executive staff or ESA after all these terms people always use. And that's just our small group.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:24:07):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):\nAnd then this framework you described, it sounds a lot like radical candor of challenging directly, but caring deeply.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:24:16):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:16):\nWhere being disagreeable, but being constructive and additive. Is that the term? What was it? Disagreeable, but?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:24:23):\nA giver.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:24):\nGiver? Yeah.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:24:25):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:26):\nOkay. That's great.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:24:26):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:28):\nIf there's nothing here, totally cool. But is there something that you changed Mark's mind about? You've talked about he's good at seeing new data and being like, \"Oh, okay, I see, I see.\" Or is there anything that you were successful there that is an interesting story?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:24:42):\nOne of the things that we did in the early days on the growth team, because I'm not sure that necessarily when we talk about this sort of legacy or the history or the lore around the growth team, and this may not be a direct answer to the question, but it didn't really necessarily-\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:25:00):\nAnd this may not be a direct answer to the question, but it didn't really necessarily come from Mark. Mark wasn't like, \"You guys should create a growth team. Here's how you should operate.\" And so I think in some ways we established and grew a growth team and Mark got on board or saw the value in it and was a huge proponent of it, but I'm not sure it necessarily originated with him. And indeed, I think sometimes the focus on being so data- driven might've been something that myself, Alex Schultz, Javier Olavon, these are some of the original people that were on the growth team and that my closest coworkers now may have really pushed on and highlighted the value of for Mark. I'm happy to talk about the growth team, which is something I get asked a lot of questions about, if you want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:53):\nYeah, I'd love to. That's exactly where I was about to segue since you brought that up. So the Facebook growth team, it's a legendary team. I think it was probably the first real growth team in tech. The team developed some of the most core growth levers and techniques that companies use today, and so I'm really excited to chat a bit about this and what you learned from that time. One thing I wanted to start with is there's this legendary activation metric that you all had, the goal was to get, I think it was seven friends in 10 days or something like that. Is that a real thing? Is that what you guys actually did? Anything more there for folks that are like, \"Oh, we got to come up with something like this\"?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:26:30):\nSure. So yes, seven friends in 10 days was a thing. 10 friends in 14 days was also a thing. They're the same thing, they're just different points on a retention curve. I would say the key insight here is when we started the growth team, I think we were pretty focused on acquisition. We had a notion though of growth accounting, which looks at what's our net growth every day? And that would look at the number of new users that registered minus the number of users that actually went stale. So after a 30-day period, that's how we define it, they no longer logged in. And then plus the number of users that resurrected, which is after 30 days they came back. And what we found was the churn in resurrection lines were actually much larger than the new user line, which implied to us that retention and driving those two lines was actually our biggest lever to drive net growth.\n\n(00:27:22):\nAnd so while we were focused on acquisition, a lot of our focus shifted to be around engagement and retention. How do we drive engagement and retention? We look at the variables that correlate most with that outcome. What we found was friending. And so those two magic moments, having seven friends in 10 days or 10 friends in 14 days really just map to when we feel like your likelihood of being a retained user goes up because you've seen the value in Facebook. And it makes sense, Facebook is much more compelling if you have 14 friends. And the other thing around 10 or 14 days is we wanted it to happen quickly, we wanted to have you experience the magic moment soon after you had registered on the site to prevent you from churning and then us having to resurrect you again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:17):\nOne of the most interesting lessons from this activation metric that people talk about, because right now everyone's like, \"Yeah, of course retention is what you need to focus on. That's what product-market fit is.\" I think right now that's what everyone knows. I love that you guys basically figured that out, was one of the first times of, \"Here's how we understand if our product will last and how to grow retention because it matters most.\" And retention cohort curves I think was one of the innovations y'all thought about early of just like, \"Here's how we track retention, people joining at a certain time, how long do they stick around?\"\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:28:48):\nTotally. And that was Danny Ferrante who really came up with the growth accounting framework, which I guess is quite obvious, but the plus new minus stale plus resurrected. The thing that I feel like may be valuable for PMs and is one of my Naomi-isms is I think what the growth team really pioneered was being data-driven and product-driven, especially in an area that was historically more of a business function. So I think at that time a lot of the growth in new users was expected to come from marketing or comms, whereas the insight that we had is actually the product is the biggest lever to drive growth, and that means we should have a product and engineering team working on optimizing things like the registration flow, the invite flow, the new user onboarding, getting you seven friends in 10 days.\n\n(00:29:43):\nOne of my Naomi-isms is really understand, identify, and execute. That framework came from 2009 where the growth team at the time, it was fledgling and it just started, was focused on only instrumenting data. And Alex often wears a shirt that says, \"I guess when you can know.\" We just didn't have the data that we needed to make informed decisions to know really what were the biggest levers to drive growth. And so in 2009 in January, we basically stopped doing anything on our roadmap except data instrumentation. And that's when we instrumented every step of the registration flow, instrumented every step of the news or onboarding experience. We knew where there was drop off. And so we understood, which allowed us to identify what were the key opportunities to drive growth and maybe, hey, it's increasing friending in the user experience or 20% drop off on registered users at the email confirmation step, how can we address that? These are the opportunities that we identified and then we would execute by building products.\n\n(00:30:50):\nSo having this data-driven product-driven approach to what I think historically was more of a business responsibility at a company was sort of the special sauce of the growth team. We eventually extended that approach. I think that approach started with the growth team, but we extended to other areas. So for example, one of the projects that I took on after growth was social impact. And instead of what I think a normal company might do, which is start a corporate social responsibility wing, we decided, no, we're going to take a data-driven product-driven approach to driving social impact. Instead of having a foundation that's distributing money, we're going to build a product that actually raises money from our community. And many years later we've raised billions of dollars from the community for charity. So that's sort of the approach that I think is unique about the growth team that expanded to other areas and that I think that the company in many ways has taken to most of the problems that we face.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:55):\nThat's such a good point. And I almost took that for granted, but there was such a huge shift that y'all started from moving from marketing being the driver of growth to product and data and experiments and all that stuff. And so I think that's such a good reminder that, fun fact on the social good team, I'm really close friends with the designer that was on my team, his name's Mickey. He was on that team for a while and really enjoyed and yeah, really enjoyed working with you. Fun fact.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:32:22):\nOh, that's so great. I remember Mickey, what is his last name?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:26):\nSettler.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:32:27):\nOkay. Yes, I definitely remember this, yes. And social impact is just one thing that I think I'm really proud of. And again, remember social impact used to be a business thing. You would create this corporate social responsibility part of the company that was very separate from the product and engineering team.\n\n(00:32:48):\nAnother thing that we did in the early days was there was a juncture where it was like, \"How are we going to translate this site?\" And I think we could have taken more of a non-technical traditional approach and had professional translators translate the entire site into the different languages, and instead sort of what the growth team suggested was why don't we build a version of Facebook that allows you to make translations in line? And so the community of people using Facebook at the time who actually knew the product the best could actually insert translations and there was a whole system that we built around how to up-rank the best translations and down-rank, sort of like Wikipedia. And to this day, we have over 100 languages supported. So we're always trying to find these product technology solutions to these sort of traditional problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:39):\nI totally remember that, where it's like you ask your users to help translate the site.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:33:43):\nYes, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:46):\nI want to come back real quick to the activation metric because it's something that a lot of people somewhat misuse and think maybe incorrectly about. So to come up with an activation, as you described, you basically figure out what's the regression of if someone does X, retention increases, and so let's focus on getting them there. And a lot of people struggle with coming up with that metric. Do you have any thoughts on just how important it was to have that very specific activation milestone of seven exact friends in exactly 10 days versus the value of just having anything that is a rallying point for everyone to focus on and drive?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:34:19):\nI think the majority of the value is in the latter, is just having extreme clarity around the goal and that allowed everybody to work towards optimizing the same goal. You're right, we did sort of just pick a point on the curve. I think it could have been any of those. And indeed, as part of preparing for this, I was like, \"Was it seven friends in 10 days?\" I had to go back and I asked a few people that I worked with back in the day and they were like, \"Well, I thought it was 10 in 14.\" I mean, I think it doesn't matter, it's just that we picked one of them and what mattered there was we had the same goal, what mattered was that it was a retention goal or an activation metric.\n\n(00:34:59):\nAnd one of the most important things that actually came out of having that goal was building a new user experience. Believe it or not, when we first launched Facebook, I wasn't around then, but in the early days of when it was just a college site, we didn't need a news or onboarding. We didn't need to explain to people that they had to find their friends. They were sort of automagically connected to everyone on the college campus and sort of knew how to use this product, it felt very intuitive. Again, we were college students building a product for other college students. They were sitting next to each other in libraries or at desks and sort of through osmosis understanding how the product worked.\n\n(00:35:38):\nIt was more when we launched the ability for teens to register and then work networks, and then in 2006 open registration where we started getting all kinds of people with any email address, before it was .edu or a microsoft.com email address that was required in order to sign up for Facebook and then anyone with any email just could register including people like my dad and my grandma that we realized, wow, in order to get people to this magic moment, how are we going to do that? What's the most effective way that insight resulted in building a new user experience? I remember it was just like step one, upload your profile picture. That was really important so people could find you and know who you were. Step two, find your friends. That's where a lot of the contact importing and people you may know and, \"Here are other people at your school and here are mutual friends.\" That step in the news or experience ultimately became one of the most important drivers of that activation metric that we talked about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:40):\nI love that you shared that, such a recurring theme on this podcast, the power of onboarding, the value of investing in onboarding and the ripple effects of opportunities there. I love that you also were kind of like the first like, \"Onboarding, that's a thing, we need onboarding.\"\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:36:55):\nI know. I mean, I remember the day where I was like, \"Do we need to explain to people how to use this? Is it not obvious?\" And it's like my dad's like, \"I don't understand this whatsoever.\" My dad would go on to become Facebook's biggest power user because I always beta tested everything with him. But that was not obvious to us at the time in 2006 that we had to explain to people how to use Facebook.\n\n(00:37:25):\nAnd again, remember that it's fun talking about this because obviously the product has evolved so much, but the principles are relatively the same. It was thefacebook.com, eventually it became facebook.com, but eventually we built a mobile app and then it was mobile first product, and then it was about mobile photos, and then it was about mobile videos. So over time, the technology has really changed, but the core use case that we really need to educate people on, which is how to connect with their friends on Facebook and whatever iteration or product is the same. And so obviously we still have an onboarding today and it's relatively the same principles, like get a profile picture and find your friends.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:12):\nAlong those same lines, just maybe a last question around the growth stuff that you worked on for folks that are thinking of driving growth, working on onboarding maybe specifically just are there any lessons from things that worked super well when you were looking to accelerate growth of the Facebook early on that you think people are maybe sleeping on as lepers and tactics that worked back then that might still be really powerful today?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:38:36):\nWell, definitely the understand, identify, execute. I would just ask yourselves, do you have the data that you need to know what you need to do on growth? And if not, definitely take the time to instrument that data.\n\n(00:38:49):\nThe thing that, I think we were relatively lucky, I talked about why I was bullish on Facebook in 2005 even was because there was product-market fit. And so for us growth, as much credit as we give to the growth team, I'm actually not sure how much credit we deserve and how much incremental growth we drove above and beyond the fact that this was a product that had product-market fit and we benefited in a huge amount from having high demand for the product.\n\n(00:39:23):\nSo at every step, and I talked about the growth team, the projects that we were working on were really at a high level around removing barriers. There were macro barriers, like the first project I worked on was high school students on Facebook, which is an interesting story in and of itself because at that time we almost created a separate website called Facebook High just to keep them separate from the college students. But at that time we were like, \"No, this is one graph. This is one community. College students have friends and people they're connected to of all different ages. Why bifurcate the graph?\" And obviously we've maintained that principle ever since.\n\n(00:40:04):\nBut it was about removing barriers. So you had to be a college student, then you had to be a high school student, then you had to be in a work network, then you had to have any email address. One of the next projects I worked on was not everyone has access to a smartphone, how can we remove the barrier of having access to a smartphone and building more of a rich Facebook experience for someone that was using a feature phone or a lower-end device? Internet.org, what about removing the barrier of having access to the internet or being able to afford a data plan? And so those are the macro barriers that thematically the growth team has worked on.\n\n(00:40:40):\nWhat I would say is maybe applicable is really the micro barriers. All of the work that we did on growth around optimizing the flows were really about removing micro barriers. One of the things that I thought was just so elegant was after we did that 2009 instrumentation of all the flows, the product flows relevant to growth, what we found is 20% of people aren't actually confirming their email. We tried sending them an SMS, so maybe they would confirm the SMS instead. What we found was a lot of people are actually still clicking on notifications that they're getting, but because it wasn't the specific confirmation email, we weren't able to confirm the account.\n\n(00:41:21):\nAnd so what we did was allow people to get notifications even as an unconfirmed account, and then if they clicked on any of those notifications, that would count as an account confirmation as well because they proved ownership of the email. It's just removing a micro barrier of having to go find the confirmation email, click it before you can do anything on the site. So I do think we've been relatively lucky in having a lot of high demand That meant that we could focus on just removing micro barriers. And then on the growth team, a lot of the iterations and optimizations were about removing just sort of friction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):\nI love that framework of micro barriers and macro barriers, just thinking about ways to make this accessible to more people and also just helping them get through the flow faster. I also love your point about how a lot of growth teams get a lot of credit for growing a business when really in many ways it could have done really well even without that team potentially because product-market fit was so strong. I think about this with Airbnb honestly as just such after it gets to a certain point, such good product-market fit that who knows what would've happen if there was no one working on growth? It probably would've been okay for a long time.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:42:27):\nTotally. And then maybe where we do sort of see the impact is maybe something like the translations thing that we talked about. With the macro barrier, removing the language barrier, and so maybe the approach we took meant that we supported 100 plus languages instead of whatever the professional translators, we have the long tail of languages so that last person who's still speaking a near extinct language can still use Facebook. But yeah, I think that's right. I sometimes think that maybe some of our efforts were really more on the margin of a bigger trend around product-market fit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:06):\nFinal little thing I would just want to highlight again that you said that I think is so important, and I've always thought is true and I love that you confirmed it, is that the activation metric that you all rallied around the biggest value of it wasn't this is exactly the right regression connection to retention, it's more that we have something we are all going to focus on, and that is where most of the impact comes from is let's get more people to that point, whether it's perfectly right or not, it doesn't really matter.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:43:32):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:32):\nLove that. And I think that's really freeing to a lot of people because they're like, \"Oh, we don't know if we're going to be as perfect about this versus let's just drive some growth and get people who are good enough thinking on that.\" Okay, great.\n\n(00:43:45):\nYou mentioned Naomi-isms, I want to segue to that. So let me first read a quote. So I asked Adam Mosseri, who is Head of Instagram, what to ask you. I know you guys work together on a bunch of stuff. Here's how he described you, \"Naomi is called the conductor here at Meta. She has an incredible ability to handle the most complex projects and problems and bring the right people together to simplify and solve them. She is very firm yet kind. Her standards are extremely high, and she sets the bar.\" Also many other people that I messaged said very similar things about you, about how you're incredibly good at taking very complex problems and getting shit done, getting them done, simplifying them and getting them done.\n\n(00:44:27):\nSo I want to spend some time understanding what you've learned about how to do this well. What are the skills you've collected that allow you to take really complex problems and get to a solution, stay kind but firm and take on these really hard challenges? So maybe just broadly, I'm curious, what are some of these skills that you have built that allow you to do this?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:44:51):\nYeah, well also that's very kind of Adam. I adore Adam obviously, he is one of the tenured people in small group and I've actually gotten the opportunity to work even more closely with him than usual. We recently launched something called Teen Accounts and Adam and I worked very closely on that.\n\n(00:45:10):\nIn terms of how I do the things people say that I can do, I really rely on Naomi-isms. Like I said, and actually I refer your podcast out a lot because there isn't just a PM university that I can send people to, there isn't a formal training that people can get to become a product manager, and that's where Naomi-isms came from. It was stuff that I learned on the job from other people, including from Adam, that I found myself repeating over and over again. \"A good PM looks for a way to make that more efficient,\" for me, that was writing them down, people started calling them Naomi-isms. I started sharing them internally. And then I think two years ago, I also started sharing them externally.\n\n(00:45:52):\nAdam referred to me as a conductor, that's one of the Naomi-isms, in my role as Head of Product, I want to educate the PM community about what is PM? It's the most common question I get from PMs and non-PMs, \"What do PMs do? What makes a great PM?\" And what I say is a PM is a conductor. It's as though the team that you are a PM on is an orchestra. There are many different functions in your team that includes legal policy, comms, data analytics, engineering, design, much like there are many different instruments in an orchestra. And as a PM, your job is to make sure everyone's playing their part correctly, every section in the orchestra is playing their part, but at the same time, they're playing together, they're unified in the music that they're producing and that they're playing at the right tempo.\n\n(00:46:48):\nAnd a lot of times I think people use music analogies or vocabulary to describe the work, and that includes things like people being in harmony, like a good team, a good PM, a good orchestra is in harmony, they're in sync, they're at the right tempo, they have the right cadence. That's sort of how I imagine what a PM does at work. Important characteristics are the PM is not the star of the show. Indeed, conductors don't even say anything during the performance. And also, I would at the same time give PMs little metronomes and conductor wands. This was something that I used to do when we were smaller., Just to sort of take the analogy way too far.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:29):\nThat's so funny. You actually gave him conductor wands and metronomes?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:47:32):\nOh yeah, just to wave around. Yeah, I love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:35):\nI would love a conductor wand.\n\n(00:47:38):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo.

I think our jobs are super hard. Extreme clarity means everyone's on the same page. It definitely doesn't mean that they all agree with each other, but they just have the same understanding of the facts. So we can disagree, but we all believe in the facts, which is that there's A, B, C, our options are X, Y, Z and here are the trade-offs 1, 2, 3. That kind of shared understanding is what extreme clarity is.\n\n(00:49:36):\nThat came from a place of just being in many meetings, on many emails, in many situations where I felt like we actually agree on something, the nature of this conflict is a result of misunderstanding. And that seems like an incredible waste of time. And so we want to have extreme clarity so we can just focus our conversations on things when we actually agree, not when we are misunderstanding each other. There are a lot of tactics that I use to drive extreme clarity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:03):\nYeah, I was going to ask how you do that, that sounds great.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:50:00):\n... Tactics that I use to drive extreme clarity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:03):\nYeah, I was going to ask how do you do that. That sounds great. How does one get to extreme clarity?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:50:07):\nSo another name I'm using is canonical everything, so that includes canonical nomenclature, I often talk about canonical nomenclature. One way to ensure extreme clarity is we have the shared vocabulary. I've been in a lot of situations where people are using the same or different words to describe the same or different things, which results in talking past each other. One of the most egregious examples of this is when I was working, I was in a conversation around how our reviewers and global operations were performing, and we were using consistency and accuracy interchangeably. Consistency refers to how often different reviewers agree on the decision. Accuracy refers to how often the decision is correct according to ground truth. Those are very different things. We don't want to optimize for consistency because you could be consistently wrong. We want to optimize for accuracy.\n\n(00:50:56):\nAnd so that is what canonical nomenclature is literally writing out all the words in their definitions, so when we communicate, we are using the same vocabulary. I really believe in visuals. I think sometimes just having a conversation or a big meeting where people are talking, I'm just not very auditory, I'm a very visual person, it's hard for me to follow along just by listening. I will often have a visual in a meeting. I will leverage that visual to literally real time edit what is being decided. For example, if we have multiple options, I will edit the slide that's being projected to say, \"We decided on option one, here are the next steps, 1, 2, 3.\" A lot of times people are saying, \"That's not what I heard. I heard this as a next step, or I heard that as a next step.\" I love that because that avoids leaving the meeting and being like, \"I don't know what we agreed to. I heard this, you heard that.\" No, actually we haven't agreed upon set of decisions and next steps that we all real time edited and looked at together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:54):\nJust to double click on that one real quick, so what you're describing for the visual is you're presenting here's our options, here's our three options on a slide. You all decide we're going to go with option two, you edit the slide with a star, here's what we chose, and then maybe change some stuff. And this is exactly to your point of extreme clarity, people can see clearly this is what we're choosing. If they disagree and don't realize that's what's happening, it'll be really clear.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:52:17):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:18):\nAwesome.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:52:19):\nAnd one thing people make fun of me a lot for that I think is just a great example of extreme clarity is I never use bulleted lists because you can never refer to a bullet. I always use numbered lists because you can always in the visual in a meeting as referenced in number two, I have feedback on that, versus the third bullet, two up from the second, whatever, that is not extreme clarity. So it's very, very small tactical things to bigger things like canonical everything. But I can be a little bit strict.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:54):\nI love that very tactical tip and that is awesome, that's exactly the stuff I look for. Is there any other very nuanced tip along those lines that is helpful in extreme clarity or canonical everything?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:53:09):\nCanonical everything... And stop me if I'm getting too wonky, I can really get into this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:16):\nWe got a ways to go.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:53:18):\nWhen I had a face bursary, along the years people have given me posters and the posters say these Naomi-ism, so extreme clarity is one, canonical everything is another. I think people really associate me with canonical, canonical, canonical. I always want a canonical doc. This came from a place of me I work on a lot of different projects, a lot of times I'm ramping up mid-project, I'm like, \"Where can I learn what I need to learn about this project?\" I ask five different people, get five different answers, that is unacceptable. Everyone should know exactly where the canonical doc is. That's the one place I can go to get all the information I need about a project and it will link to all the other docs. Of course, I'm sure there's hundreds of docs associated with the project, but there needs to be one canonical doc, and that canonical doc really has to have the basic information that you need to know.\n\n(00:54:05):\nFor any project, the basic information that you need to know is what are the discrete areas of work, I call those work streams, this is pretty obvious. Who are the owners on those work streams? So for every work stream there's an owner. Again, it seems pretty obvious. Sometimes I'm like, \"Who's owning this?\" And it's like people don't know. That's why I think it's very important to have a single-threaded owner. We used to call this a directly responsible individual or a throat to choke. We obviously don't say that anymore. Single-threaded owner, every work stream has a single-threaded owner. Sometimes work streams are really big. You have sub work streams underneath them. Everything canonical needs to recurse, so you should have an owner or an STO for the sub work stream. The other things on the canonical doc are what is the process by which the people on this team work together.\n\n(00:54:54):\nI hate pairwise conversations. I feel like they're a waste of time. I feel like you could have four conversations with four different people or one conversation with all four people. Everyone has the same context. Ideally there's a visual in that meeting and you real time edited it, there is extreme clarity. The canonical doc will have what is the canonical meetings that people have, what is the canonical email list that you're going to use, what is the canonical workplace chat. Let's not reinvent the same audience 10 different times with different permutations of the people on the working team. Let's just have one canonical chat. And then often the canonical doc will have the canonical nomenclature. I really believe in frameworks for things that helps drive extreme clarity. A framework is best understood when there's a visual representation of the framework in my mind, and so we'll have canonical visuals and that's what I mean by canonical everything. So anytime I start on a new project, everyone knows to send me the canonical doc.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:52):\nI love this. If you come into a that you've given that's really gnarly and complex, what do you find are the first couple things you do that make a big dent on helping everyone align and understand what happens, what they should be doing and what they should be prioritizing?\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:56:12):\nA lot of times I'm simplifying. A lot of times there isn't a canonical doc and so I'll go through the process of creating that, but I think that really falls under the simplification thing. I often go into a project, everyone's operating at a PhD level, I'm coming in at a kindergarten level, and so I need to understand... It's almost like all of this complexity we're at a PhD level, I need to create the curriculum, go back to basic building blocks for the kindergarten level, how do I explain that and understand this project at a kindergarten level. It doesn't mean I want to oversimplify, that's not what a simplifier does. They're not oversimplifying, but what they are doing is identifying the most basic building blocks of a complex problem and then unfolding, or revealing or building on top of them additional complexity and details as you go along.\n\n(00:57:06):\nAnd so sometimes I talk about a school pyramid, but I need to establish the kindergarten curriculum and then the elementary school curriculum and then the high school curriculum and then the college curriculum, and then we can operate at the PhD level. But oftentimes people on the project are at really different levels of understanding or complexity. And until we have what we call the school pyramid, the curriculums for every level of the project, it's really hard to make progress. A lot of times that process of simplification will often identify what are the most important things to deal with on the project.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:48):\nAnd so what I'm hearing is when you come into a project and the way you simplify is you start putting together a doc that describes these things you're talking about, here's the work streams, here's the owners, here's the process, here's our canonical meeting style, and that reveals here's what matters most and where there's confusion.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:58:07):\nYes, yes. Yeah, that is. And a lot of times what needs to happen in the project is sometimes there's a strategy or an execution issue and sometimes there's a people or a process issue. I would say 80% of the time I think it's a people or process issue. And that refers to not having the right people on the project, or having the right people but not having the right process by which they work together, a strategy or execution issue. When we get to that, I first try to tackle those or in general I think it's really important to have perfect execution. I want to make sure a project is perfectly executing, because only then can we really reevaluate whether or not this strategy is right or wrong. We're in the worst of all worlds where we are imperfectly executing and therefore, at the end of the day, the project might fail, but we don't know why.\n\n(00:59:02):\nIs it because the strategy was right or wrong or is it because the execution was poor? The ideal case is the strategy was right and you perfectly executed on it. The next best case scenario is the strategy was wrong, but you perfectly executed on it, because then you learned the strategy was wrong. Revamp the strategy and try again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:22):\nYou're really in the PM part of my brain. I feel like most PMs listening are like it has clean documents, really simple processes, there's one person to charge, it links to everything. It just feels good.\n\nNaomi Gleit (00:59:34):\nTotally. And, again, sometimes I feel the need to defend that the process is not for process' sake, it's ultimately to help us all move faster and work better. So hopefully that comes through. But I deeply believe that it is through this approach that we can move faster. And you have to prove that nobody wants more process and more meetings and more, but my goal is that with this we're actually simplifying process and getting less meetings and just making things clearer and ultimately moving faster.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:08):\nI'm going to read another quote from another one of your co-workers, Charles Porch, he's vice president of global partnerships at Instagram and he basically said what we've been talking about, some of the biggest strategic bets and biggest swings Meta has made have had Naomi at the helm. No one can hurt cats, drive clarity, and get to outcomes more seamlessly than she can. She's legendary within Meta for her canonical documents.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:00:33):\nGreat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):\nMaybe just following this thread a little bit further, what's the gnarliest project that you've worked on that would be a good example of you coming in and helping simplify and get it over the finish line?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:00:47):\nWell, Charles may be thinking of the most recent project that we worked on. I don't know if it's necessarily the gnarliest, but it's definitely one of the most cross-functional projects that I've worked on before. Basically every team at the company in some way works on youth. And last week we actually launched teen accounts, which was a very complex project. Again, it involved the Instagram team, the central youth team, the different teams working on various aspects of this, every function, legal policy, comms, marketing product. And I think we definitely leveraged a lot of these Naomi-isms. And just to give you a sense of what teen accounts is, it was basically putting all teens into the safest settings by default on Instagram. And the reason I'm working on this, I work across multiple teams at Facebook, so obviously Adam is the head of Instagram and I work closely with him on this, like I was referring to yesterday.\n\n(01:02:02):\nBut this is something, these teen accounts, is something that we are thinking about how we expand to the other apps that we have, including Facebook and WhatsApp and Threads. And I tend to work on projects that are across our family of apps and future platforms, and that's why I was involved in this. But basically what teen accounts does is put teens in these safest settings. It's super focused on trying to address parents' biggest concerns around their teens on social media. This has obviously been a really big topic. We've had a lot of these features and tools. What this launch did is simplify things, standardize things, and add a lot more functionality that gives parents control.\n\n(01:02:42):\nI think the thing you really need to know is that for under 16-year-olds, if they want to change any of these defaults, they're going to have to get their parents' permission. And so it's interesting that we're really going to create an incentive for teens to get their parents involved and to actually set up parental supervision, especially because one of the default settings is a private account. So there's tens of millions of teens that currently have public accounts today that we are going to automatically transition to private accounts unless they get their parents' permission to stay public. And so it's a relatively big shift, fundamental change for how Instagram works for teens, and I would say one of the more complicated projects that I've worked.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:28):\nYeah, and it just launched, right?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:03:30):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:31):\nAs a new father, I'm excited for you all to be working on these sorts of things. I don't need it yet, but I'm glad it's going to be there. And it's funny how Meta and Facebook is in this world where people complain about teens using social media and then you work on making the product better for teens and kids using social media, and then it's like, \"Facebook's getting teens on social media.\" There's no way to make it feel good to people. No matter what you do, people are going to complain. That's what-\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:04:00):\nTotally. And I think the goal of this launch was to orient ourselves and really there's a lot of complaints, there's a lot of different voices. I think we just are focused on parents. We think parents know best. Every kid is different and parents know their own kid the best. So that has been our north star in terms of the approach here. When I talk about teen accounts, as product people I think one thing that you would appreciate is the thing that I think is really important when it comes to teens on the internet is really having an understanding of how old someone is when they're using our apps. And it's important that we know how old they are because then we can put them in an age-appropriate experience. So now we have teen accounts, we want to put all teens into teen accounts.\n\n(01:04:49):\nWe all know sometimes teens lie. That's been the biggest feedback that we've been getting is teens are really smart, they're going to find workarounds, they're going to be creative, they're going to lie about their age. And as a product person, the way that I think this should really work is that instead of everyone entering... Teens use, on average, 40 apps, instead of Instagram and the other 39 apps that teens use trying to verify the age of the person using their app is for two companies to do this, which is Apple and Google, they do collect the age, they should make that available to developers. And we ask for information from the device all the time with user consent, can Instagram have access to your camera, can Instagram have access to your location information? Apps should be able to ask, can Instagram have access to your birthday? And that would, I think, elegantly from a product perspective, from a simplification perspective, from a privacy preserving perspective and what's easiest for parents, that would be the right product solution to solve this problem around age that we're all trying to grapple with right now.\n\n(01:05:56):\nAnd there's a lot of stuff that we're doing. Part of the reason that this project was so complicated, and I mentioned the age team, is we're building classifiers to try to predict how old people are based on not just the age that they've stated, but based on who they're talking to, what kind of content they're looking at, what the age of the people they're connected to is, do we think that this is actually an adult like they say, or is it really a teen. And so we're doing a lot to try to predict age or prevent people from lying about their age, but I think this would be a really big win for the industry.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:31):\nMakes sense to me.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:06:33):\nOkay. Thank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:38):\nSo to close out this portion in this chapter of our conversation on Naomi-isms, I know something else that you're really good at that I've heard from a few people is running meetings, something that a lot of people always want to get better at. Any tips? What have you learned about running a great meeting?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:06:54):\nA meeting is a high value and it's high cost amount of time, and then I want to make sure it's as productive as possible. What I will do is send an agenda 24 hours prior to the meeting. That agenda will include a pre-read. I've talked to people who if the pre-read is not attached to the calendar invite or associated with a meeting at least 24 hours in advance, they will cancel the meeting. That just goes to show we want everybody in the meeting to have full context, have read the pre-read. Often what will happen in the previous 24 hours is because we're all sending pre-reads on Google Slides, there will be a lot of conversation and questions that get hashed out leading up to the meeting. During the meeting, like I said, I think it's really important for a group of people to be looking at something and anchoring people on something.\n\n(01:07:48):\nIf somebody joins the meeting, say, five minutes late, they should know exactly where in the agenda you are in the meeting and what is being discussed based on catching up from the visual that's being projected. Usually a meeting can be and hopefully a meeting is really either is a decision meeting. So if there is a decision, I need three options and I need a recommendation that should hopefully help focus the meeting. And then, like I said, I will real-time edit the visual such that we document and have extreme clarity on what is the option that we agreed on and any next steps that we also agreed to.\n\n(01:08:28):\nAfter the meeting, anyone who wasn't in the meeting, that's fine because within 24 hours post-meeting I will send the notes, reply all to the meeting invite and send the notes. So just tactically, I use the calendar invite as the canonical unit by which to handle all of this communication because a lot of times meetings are one-offs, there isn't an existing email or chat thread that maps perfectly to the audience of the meeting, so for me that is the meeting or the calendar invite. So I'll click on the calendar invite, reply all, include the pre-read, pre-meeting, and then do this reply all again post-meeting 24 hours with the notes and the decisions and the next steps.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:11):\nI love this. So many very specific tactics here. I love it. This is food for my brain. I love the always have three options and a recommendation, that's such a simple thing to recommend, but such a powerful way of operating as a PM, just like, \"Here are the options, here's what I recommend, here's why.\"\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:09:29):\nOh, one thing I forgot that I learned from Guy Rosen, he is our chief security officer, is when you have three options and a recommendation, in terms of evaluating the options, I don't love pros and cons. It's a flat list of text. It's hard to just get the big picture from that. Oftentimes we'll use a traffic light. That means that the three options are three rows. The columns in the table will be criteria by which to evaluate the options. Those could either be functions. So for example, if I have three options as the rows, column one could be the legal perspective, column two could be the policy perspective, column three could be the privacy or product perspective. Alternatively, the columns could map to different criteria like what we're optimizing for. So it could be the user experience, it could be the engineering feasibility, it could be the internal complexity, whatever are the criteria should be laid out in the columns.\n\n(01:10:31):\nAnd then obviously it should be color-coded, red, yellow, green based on how it stacks up against those criteria. And what this allows is to get back to the point of the visual is you can quickly look at the three options, see where's the most red, and rule that out. Ideally, the recommendation has some combination of the more green or yellow than the other options. And then obviously within these cells you can spell out the specific rationale for the coloring. But I think this is a really good way to run a meeting and just create extreme clarity around how you're evaluating the options in a way that a flat list of pros and cons just doesn't.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:12):\nWhat other podcasts would have this level of detail of how to run a discussion on a decision? And this is exactly what people want to hear, so I love it. So product market fit for listeners of this podcast. I love it. I love it. And obviously the reason this is more effective is it's not just like, \"Here's a quick sentence on the pro and con.\" It's like, \"Here's what I actually think this is good or bad for the things that matter to the business.\"\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:11:39):\nThat's exactly right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:40):\nSo that makes tons of sense.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:11:41):\nIt also gives people a framework to plug into. A lot of times the creation of a pre-read for these discussions involves many different people from many different teams and functions. If you have a traffic light, they can own filling out their cell, they can own the rationale behind the legal position on option one, two, and three. And, in general, I'm super into frameworks that allow people to plug into and clearly represent their point of view.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:08):\nI love it. Final question, completely different topic. I saw a Wall Street Journal story about how you exercise and your exercise regimen, and how important that is to your life and career. Now, most people don't have a Wall Street Journal story about their exercise regimen, especially a tech worker. And I know this is just important to your work, and they wrote that this basically helps you become better at your job. Any advice there for folks that want to lean into exercise, exercise more for how to actually do that? Because your advice is this actually makes you better at work and life.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:12:44):\nPeople are always like, \"What are you training for?\" And I'm like, \"I'm training for life.\" I have four musties, it is eat, sleep a long time, and exercise. Those are the things that I need in order to perform. And the other areas of my life seems pretty obvious, but until recently I actually did not prioritize sleep. My boyfriend is actually super into sleep and we have the Eight Sleep, we have eye masks, we have blackout shades, we have good sleep hygiene, and so I'm getting much better at that. But exercise is something that I've always been on top of. Alone time is also a musty for me because I'm an introvert, I need that time to recharge, otherwise I think I get weird around people.\n\n(01:13:28):\nIn terms of how I prioritize it, it's a non-negotiable or table stakes, every morning I have to work out. I am also lucky enough to work in an environment where I can wear workout clothes to work, which I often do. I think working out is sure the hour of the day that I'm doing my exercise, but I also view, like I said, life is a workout, performing at work is a workout. I need to be able to move. I need to feel comfortable. It's very physical, I think, especially if you're trying really hard to be a conductor, and I'm running around with a metaphorical conductor wand, I need to be able to move. A while ago, and that's what the Wall Street Journal article was about, I set a goal of doing five pull-ups. I'd read somewhere in an article that less than 1% of women can actually do. I think having a goal is really helpful.\n\n(01:14:22):\nThat's something that I worked on, and anyone can do this truly if you train for it. I think it's potentially more technique for me than strength per se, and I worked up towards that goal. I think exercise, in addition to all of the physical benefits, primarily has a mental health benefit I think for me. And also there are just a lot of lessons that I think I take from exercise. For example, I think being able to do five pull-ups taught me I can do hard things in this really narrow, measurable way, which gave me confidence in other aspects of my life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:01):\nI had a friend who her goal was...\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:15:00):\nAnother aspect of my life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:02):\nI had a friend who her goal was do one push-up.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:15:06):\nOne push-up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:06):\nShe's like, \"I want to be able to do one push-up\" and that was really motivating to her. And then she finally got there and then she could do more.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:15:12):\nThat's awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:13):\nYeah, similar. I have so many notes here as that you were talking. The other is sleep advice. So eye mask. I have an awesome eye mask that I'll recommend in the show notes. It's funny.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:15:23):\nPlease.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):\nWhat is that? Of all the things I've recommended in all the various places I get the most comments about, \"Thank you for this very specific eye mask. It changed my life.\" It's like WAOAW, it's one Tim Ferriss has often recommended.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:15:36):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:37):\nW-A-O... I'll link to it in the show notes, but it's-\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:15:39):\nOh, great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:41):\nWAOAW, let me look it up real quick 'cause people are going to be like, \"Oh, I got to get it.\" WAOAW eye mask.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:15:46):\nThe one that we have has cushions around the eyes such that it's not flush against your eyes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:54):\nYeah, this is the same. Okay.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:15:55):\nOh great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:58):\nW-A-O-A-W sleep mask on Amazon. It's 13 bucks and amazing. My wife and I both sleep with these eye masks. It's ridiculous until you're like, \"I can't sleep without one now.\"\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:16:10):\nTotally. Well there's a lot of research that even ambient lighting results in lower quality sleep. So I think that's why the blackout shades and the eye mask just help ensure it's truly dark.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:20):\nYeah, I was just watching a podcast and the advice there is even your smoke alarm with a little light is too much light. You need to cover that up to create real darkness and why not just wear an eye mask? You don't have to worry about any of that.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:16:35):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:36):\nOkay, and then one thing I didn't mention when you're talking about the conductor, the PM as a conductor, that's exactly the metaphor I've always used my entire career when people ask me about what is product manager? So we're alike.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:16:46):\nReally?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:47):\nYeah, I have all these slides of here's the PM and it's like a symphony and the conductor standing there.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:16:52):\nLenny, do you know how happy that makes me? Because I feel like sometimes people are like, \"That sounds crazy,\" but the fact that you actually came to that same conclusion makes me... Why did you come to that conclusion? I'm just curious\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:09):\nBecause as you said, the PM's not making the thing. They're just helping each of the people who are the most talented at their very specific skill do the best possible work and their back is to the audience. They're trying to stay out of the way even though they come in, everyone claps for them, the outstanding event, and then in theory they could step in a little bit to help out when they can pinch it on design here and there and research here and there, probably not engineering. So those are the reasons and they're not in charge. The chair wind violinist is the actual person that's making the music and the best at this thing.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:17:48):\nIt's so great to hear somebody else talk about this too. Thank you. And I think that that is really how I view my role and what I do and I think maybe just hearing you talk about it reminded me why I think I put so much emphasis on just elevating the people on my team and the people around me and candidly, one of the development areas for me, and it could be downstream because I do have this analogy of how to be a PM, is that the growth feedback or the constructive feedback for me is really learning when to lead from the front more. Maybe when to be less of a quiet conductor that's really elevating the first chair violinist and be more front facing.\n\n(01:18:39):\nI think a lot of my approach and my leadership style is really leading through the people on my team and helping grow them. And a lot of times I think that they're dedicated, they're experts, they know particular areas. Obviously as a head of product, I manage a portfolio of different projects of which each of them has the incredible leader on it. And so oftentimes I'm just really trying to lead from behind and help them be as successful as possible. But there is a time and a place when maybe that silent conductor needs to take more of a vocal and front facing role.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:16):\nI know exactly what you mean. I had the same problem when I was a PM because there's always this fear that PMs in charge and telling everyone to do. And so I had the opposite of like, \"Okay, and that's not me. I'm going to just let you do the things you think are best and I'll just make sure the best ideas come to the surface,\" and I have to learn exactly the same thing. Sometimes people just want you to point them in the right direction and make the decision in the end. And the best PMs are people that have the best opinions about what is going to work, how intuition of what users need, have strong product sense and all that stuff. I've had this post that I'm trying to work on along these lines where there's this reaction to PMs aren't the CEO of the product.\n\n(01:19:56):\nThey're just like... No, don't call yourselves that. I think it's the opposite. I think PMs actually should think of themselves as the CEO of the product, not in terms of they are in charge and can fire people and manage people, but they're the closest heuristic for what the CEO and the founder wants. They think of what does the business need, what is going to help the customers, what's going to help us grow? And I think the PM is the closest to that role and so I think it's important to think of that role as that even though you're not technically in charge.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:20:25):\nAnd maybe you could call it something different, but I totally agree with that sentiment. I think we were trying to push against the criticism that PMs were bossing everybody around, but actually I think you-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:42):\nThere's baggage there.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:20:43):\nThere's baggage there. I call it, there's something called the great non-technical. There was a period of time at Facebook where I think the PMs really had to prove their value to the engineers and show that we were not slowing things down with all this extra process. You can imagine an engineer hearing me talk about how to run a meeting and all the canonical docs and just be like, \"What? This sounds terrible.\" So yeah, we had to prove that, but I actually do think the PM is the closest to really channeling what the CEO or the founder wants. Another thing that I've worked on and that I'm working on is really developing a much stronger first-party perspective. It's not enough for the PM to run this people in process that we talked about. Obviously I love that stuff. I lean that way, but at the end of the day, a PM cannot outsource their perspective or delegate their thinking through people and process.\n\n(01:21:46):\nAnd so for me that has been a learning curve and I am trying to, as someone who's very consensus driven, I want to hear all the different opinions from all the different people. I can still do that. I can still through people in process talk to all the different folks working on a project, hear their first party perspectives and then use all of that to synthesize my own because it will be unique given my role on the team and just what I'm trying to optimize for and really make sure that I both develop that first-party opinion and communicate it clearly. And like you said, the best PMs I think can do it all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):\nJust to follow this thread, one thread further, because this is something I think a lot of product managers work on and are told to work on, is there anything you've found to be helpful in building this skill in yourself that might be helpful to folks that are working on it?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:22:39):\nI'm lucky enough because I have a big team. I have someone who helps me schedule my time and I used to goal that person and goal our work together on just being as efficient as possible. But now what I am goaling that person and what we're trying to accomplish here is giving me as much time to develop a first-party point of view. And so what is the most effective way to do that? And for me it is having two to three hour blocks of time where I can actually sit, think, have space, but maybe something that's different about me than other people is its very, very helpful for me to talk to maybe one or two people, not be in a big meeting with 40 people, trusted people.\n\n(01:23:28):\nI have an incredible person on my team that I talk to that I think really helps me clarify my thinking. And so to go back to the beginning, just I'm trying to find blocks in my day that I can spend time thinking and also within those blocks, they don't have to be alone time. They can also be scheduling my chief of staff and my head of data to bounce ideas off of as a sounding board because that is the process that I know best for me in terms of really developing a first party perspective.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):\nSuch a good tip. It makes sense if you're just spending all your day coordinating in meetings, checking things, reviewing things, you have no time to actually think about what you think is the right move and answer and strategy and next step. And so that's a really good tip. If you're finding that you don't have time to think about what you think is the right solution and the right strategy and the right product decision, fine, just block time to think about this stuff. I have these deep work slots in my calendar. I've written about this a few times where it's three hours and the invite, I don't know if you can do this these days, but it was just, if you book time during the slot, I will slap you. Nobody did.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:24:42):\nThat's amazing. And I think for me, some people might need three hours on their own. I think for me, and I don't know about you, talking things through with one or two people really helps me as well. So sometimes it was almost quite challenging for me to think of going into a room by myself for three hours and then I was just going to figure it out on my own. This is like, and I don't know how people help people think strategically the best, but it doesn't have to necessarily be alone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:16):\nThat's a great tip. Just have a sparring partner.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:25:17):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:17):\nSomeone who is just interested in exploring ideas and not just have a clear agenda. I love that. Okay, Naomi, I love this tangent we went on as we were wrapping up.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:25:29):\nI know, totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:30):\nThat was amazing. There was a lot of good stuff that we covered there, but I know you have to run. So before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that we haven't covered that you wanted to cover or share?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:25:42):\nHonestly, I think I just did it. I didn't even realize I wanted to talk about that, but it just all came out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:47):\nI love it. I love that. Those are the best nuggets. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:25:54):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:55):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:25:59):\nI really love narrative nonfiction, so I like the Eric Larson books. They're a very compelling and page turning way to learn about history. I recently read Devil in the White City and there was also one about Churchill's first year by Eric Larson. Another book that just the canonical book that I often recommend is Sapiens. I think he's a great example of what we talk about when we talk about simplifiers. He took a very complex subject, which is all of human history and tried to pull out the nuggets. I think his thesis that what differentiates humans from other forms of life is really our ability to tell and believe in myths or stories, and he cites money and religion as examples, but also there's a graphic novel version of Sapiens and so he almost has the PhD level and then he literally has the high school level, which is a graphic novel version.\n\n(01:26:57):\nHe also has Unstoppable Us, which I think is a kid's version, and so clearly here is someone who is a master. There's a James Clear thing that a friend, Shirley, told me about where it's like if you're a beginner, you have ignorant simplicity and intermediate has functional complexity, and then a master of a topic has profound simplicity. And that's what I feel like Noah Yuval Harari really has because he can go all the way up and down this cool pyramid in terms of explaining this really complex topic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:31):\nWhat I heard about him is that he goes on a one-month meditation retreat every year where it's just him silent meditation retreat, and people ask him, \"How do you have time to do that when you have so much work to do?\" He's like, \"The only way I'm able to achieve these books where I synthesize all of human history into a story is because I do that. Because I can clear my mind and just be.\"\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:27:53):\nAnd Lenny, to our previous conversation, that is how he himself is best. That's what he needs to do. I might need two to three hours a day and a sparring partner, Noah Yuval Harari needs a month in silent meditation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:07):\nGreat point. Everyone has their own way of unlocking their brain. On Devil in the White City, a fun fact. When I read that, I was like, \"I need to go to Chicago and see the stuff that they wrote about in this book about the World's Fair.\" And so I went to Chicago and-\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:28:21):\nYou did?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:22):\nBecause of that book, yes.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:28:25):\nWow. Have you read the Splendid in the Vile?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:28):\nYes. That was the-\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:28:29):\nChurchill.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:29):\nAbout the Telegram, right? Yeah. Right?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:28:32):\nOh, no, it was was Churchill's first year, but he has like six books. I haven't read all of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:37):\nOkay. I think it was either that one or it was something about a telegram. I did read... It was less good though, is was what I find. I found the Devil in White City was-\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:28:43):\nThe best.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:44):\nWas the best. Amazing. Okay, we'll keep going. Second question, do you have a favorite movie or TV show you've recently watched that you really enjoyed?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:28:52):\nWe just watched Shogun. I thought it was really good. Have you seen it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:57):\nI have, yes. I loved it. Very gruesome but amazing.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:29:01):\nYeah. I was. I had to cover my eyes for some of it. And then we also, the movie that we just watched was Dune Two. Chris Cox, who's our chief product officer, actually recommended that as one of the best films that he's seen recently, and I really trust his opinion on that. So we caught up by watching Dune One and then watched Dune Two, and it was really good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:21):\nI watched that in IMAX Theater in San Francisco, this insanely large screen and highly would recommend that. I don't think it's still out there. Yeah. [inaudible 01:29:30] ridiculous. Amazing. I think there's another one coming someday.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:29:34):\nOh yeah, yeah. Dune Three.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:36):\nDune Three. Just keep them coming. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:29:46):\nWell, I'm going to check out that eye mask thing that you recommended, the WAOAW thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:49):\nThat's it.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:29:51):\nI know it's super expensive, but have you tried the Eight Sleep?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:56):\nI have. My wife doesn't love it. She doesn't like the noise. It's like a very slight noise when it starts up, but it wakes her up, so we don't have it anymore.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:30:07):\nAnd I noticed that too. I think maybe they just released the latest edition. One of the features that is the killer feature for me is that it does a vibrating alarm so that when I wake up at 6:00 A.M., I do not wake up everyone in the house at 6:00 A.M., and so it's a thermal alarm. It makes the bed on my side hotter and it also slightly vibrates underneath my ear to wake me up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:32):\nIt's under your ear. I remember vibrating my whole part of the bed. I wonder if that's a new feature.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:30:37):\nMaybe this is like... I'm on version three, maybe there's a version four. I don't know. Maybe that was version one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:43):\nYeah, that's so funny. A nice thing about my life right now is that because I have no meetings or boss, I don't need an alarm.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:30:52):\nThat's awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:53):\nHowever, it's amazing. However, we have a young kid and he wakes up at 6:00 to 6:30, so that's my alarm usually.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:30:58):\nOh, and then the other thing I wanted to mention, I don't know if you have this problem, but I'm trying to get a hundred grams of protein every day. I think a lot of my friends and I are focused on protein consumption right now, and so my trainer who helped me actually do the pull-ups and the push-ups started a protein products company called Promix that I really love, and he has this Rice Krispie treat thing that I usually eat every morning and gives me 15 grams of protein.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:30):\nI just bought that.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:31:32):\nWhat?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:33):\nYes, I was reading, Kevin Rose had his favorite, his health stack, and I don't know if that's the brand, but it's exactly a Rice Krispie thing with 15 grams of protein. So I'm pretty sure that's it.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:31:45):\nI'm pretty sure that's it, because the Rice Krispie part of it is very unique, so let me know what you think. I really like the chocolate chip flavor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:52):\nI hate them and I love them, so that's a really good tip. I just saw a funny TikTok where it's like I never thought when I'd grow up in be an adult, I'd be thinking so often about protein and how much protein I should be eating.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:32:05):\nMaybe this is 40, I don't know. I'm not sure for me, but yes, I've been thinking a lot about protein. The other thing I really like is canned seafood, which has a lot of protein. So something called Fish Wife has, it's just Hipster, like Chicken of the Sea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:23):\nOh yeah, they're very cute. Yes. My wife gets those. Another protein tip, they were a former sponsor, but no longer, but it's an amazing protein tip. Maui Nui venison beef sticks. It's 10 grams of protein and it's a delicious venison beef stick.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:32:39):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:40):\nThere we go.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:32:40):\nLook at what we've become Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:45):\nJust protein obsessed. It's just going to be so protein rich. Amazing. Okay, what else we got here? Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find helpful in working life?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:32:56):\nLast month we were watching, or I guess two weeks ago, we were watching the US Open and we discovered that as people come through the hallway to come onto the court to play, the players all passed the Billie Jean King sign that says Pressure is Privilege. And I really loved that because I think just with the Teen Accounts launch and just a lot of the more public facing stuff that I have done recently, I do, like we talked about, get nervous, and I think Pressure is Privilege just reminds me that a lot of this stuff is a really incredible opportunity that I have and to be grateful for it. I can still be nervous, but also recognize and be grateful for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:48):\nI love that. Just to remind yourself that you're lucky to be feeling this pressure because that means something is important. Slightly different version of that is Zuck at the event in the Chase Center that you were also at had the shirt that said in Latin-\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:34:02):\nLearning through suffering.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:04):\nLearning through suffering. Perfect.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:34:09):\nLearning through suffering. I like that one too. I mean, I think he spoke a little bit about this being an entrepreneur is really, really hard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:23):\nThey had the Jensen line about people asked him if he'd start Nvidia again, and his answer was like, \"If I knew how insanely hard and stressful this was, I would not.\" Very, very honest. Okay. Last question. So Charles, your former colleague, told me that you're an incredible surfer-\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:34:42):\nOh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:43):\nAnd that you design your life almost around where and when you can go surf.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:34:47):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:48):\nAny story or lesson or I don't know, takeaway from surfing and the impact that's had on you? Lessons about surfing?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:34:58):\nSo I think surfing and life have a lot of parallels. It is an incredibly mental sport for me. The biggest thing that I can do to improve my surfing is to improve my confidence. And so when I'm going for a wave, a lot of times I will hesitate or pull back or. Instead, the best thing that you can actually do in that situation is stand up into your fear, is to ride the wave. That is the safest thing you can do. That is the thing that you're actually supposed to do, but on every dimension, that's the right thing. And so it's almost, I guess the motto there is stand up into the fear when you're going, you're about to catch a wave and actually the things that you can do when you're afraid, for example, like I said, pull back or throw your board are actually quite counterproductive and actually unsafe and could lead to more injury. And so it's just another reminder that you really need to commit. Stand up into your fear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:04):\nI love it. Stand up into your fear and pressure is a privilege and learning through suffering. Naomi, this was so much fun. I'm so happy that you agreed to do this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you a line? Where they find Naomi-isms, and anything else you want to point folks to and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:36:21):\nSo believe it or not, I have Naomi.com. I know Boz has Boz.com. I bought that URL, I think maybe 20 years ago, 15 to 20 years ago from a farmer actually whose wife's name was Naomi rather, and his wife was not using it. And so I got it for quite a steal. And I'll just say that I've had other famous Naomis, much more famous and much more well known than I, who would like to have Naomi.com make offers for this URL. But I really like having just a home on the internet where I can put my Naomi-isms. They're also available on Instagram, Naomi Gleit.\n\n(01:37:03):\nHow can listeners be useful to you? I think Lenny, I mentioned this before we got on the call, I don't tend to do that much public speaking or talking about Naomi-isms. I did some of it two years ago when we first launched but I, as a result of being on the podcast and stuff, would love to do more of this. And so I think any feedback on what listeners would like to see or hear from me, questions that would give me a reason where I felt like it would be useful for me to do more on Naomi-isms would be super helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:37):\nSweet. So if you have any of those, leave them in the YouTube comments is usually the easiest place for folks to leave that. Naomi, thank you so much for being here. This was so much fun.\n\nNaomi Gleit (01:37:45):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:47):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:37:50):\nThank you so much for listening.

I see companies do this, where they labor over designs and features. And they build this perfect product that's delightful to use. And then pricing's sort of plucked out of thin air, and then they don't revisit it. This was Evernote. It was many, many years before we went back and overhauled the pricing. So, think about your pricing just like you do your roadmap. Every 6 to 12 months, there's probably something meaningful that you're launching for users. So, treat that as an opportunity to revisit your monetization strategy and making sure you're compensated appropriately.\n\nLenny (00:32):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny. And my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing product. Today, my guest is Naomi Ionita. Naomi was one of the first early leaders in product life growth and monetization, having built early teams and infrastructure over a decade ago at Evernote. She was also an early contributor to Reforge when it was just getting started and helped create some of their early programs. She's also VP of growth at Invoice2go. And currently, she's a full-time VC at Menlo Ventures.\n\n(00:59):\nIn her work as a full-time investor, she gets to see what works and doesn't work across many companies. And one area that she spends a lot of time on is monetization, when it's best to start charging for your product, how to decide what to charge, and how to evolve your pricing. And that's what we spend the bulk of our conversation around. We also touch on a really interesting framework Naomi has been developing that she calls the Modern Growth Stack, which is essentially all the areas that new starter products can help take the load off your plate and help your product grow. Naomi is awesome, and I'm excited to share this episode with you. With that, I bring you Naomi Ionita right after a word from our wonderful sponsors.\n\n(01:36):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro. Creating a product, especially one that your users can't live without, is damn hard. But it's made easier by working closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and being able to iterate quickly. That's where Miro comes in. Miro is an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I actually used Miro to come up with a plan for this very ad. With Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming with sticky notes, comments, live reactions, voting tools, even a timer to keep your team on track.\n\n(02:10):\nYou can also bring your whole distributed team together around wire frames where anyone can draw their own ideas with the pen tool or put their own images or mock-ups right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks. Want to see how I use Miro? Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny to see my most popular podcast episodes, my favorite Miro templates. You can also leave feedback on this podcast episode and more. That's miro.com/lenny.\n\n(02:47):\nThis episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful, and beautifully designed. Not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart. The other day, I started a home project and immediately opened up Notion to help me organize it all. Learn more and get started for free at notion.com/lennyspod. Take the first step towards an organized, happy team today, again, at notion.com/lennyspod. Naomi, welcome to the podcast.\n\nNaomi Ionita (03:45):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (03:46):\nDid you know that you're one of the very few VCs that I've ever had on this podcast, and so you're basically representing VC kind here? How do you feel about that?\n\nNaomi Ionita (03:54):\nWow. Well, thank you. I think early growth folks like us have a unique bond and a lens on startups and investing. So, my operating background is something I lean on every day and has actually informed a lot of the thesis areas where I spend time now as an investor. So, hopefully, we'll bring it all together in that capacity.\n\nLenny (04:15):\nAwesome. That's exactly what I was just going to say, so I'm glad that you covered that. And so that's a good segue just to... Let's get into your background briefly. Can you talk about some of the wonderful things that you've done in your career both at Reforge, which you'll touch on, and growth stuff, and then your VC life now?\n\nNaomi Ionita (04:29):\nPerfect. So, I'm a partner at Menlo Ventures. I focus on early-stage SaaS from seed to series B. I started my career in engineering and consulting before getting into tech back in '06. Fell in love with product. Did some new product development at a big media company before business school. And while at business school, I spent time at the Design Institute at Stanford. So, this was an opportunity to kind of bridge my analytical background with this refreshing view on human-centered design and learning from the founder of IDEO.\n\n(04:56):\nSo, brought that with me then to Evernote back in 2011, early days over there. I was there from about 10 to 100 million users. And over that arc, I shifted from more of a core product role to starting our growth product function. This was super organic. I started just collaborating with colleagues from across the business, come up with hypotheses, do user research, run experiments, drive metrics. This was a new way of building product back then. This was a decade ago, so the acronym PLG had not been coined yet. And I really just thought of myself as a user and data-driven product person.\n\n(05:33):\nAfter Evernote, I joined a bootstrapped mobile SMB company called Invoice2go. It was the top-grossing business app at the time. There, I built teams across product, data, growth engineering, design and research, and again, focused on product-led growth and monetization. Over those two jobs, I found myself doing a lot more advising and speaking on the side on these topics. And my board members used to farm me out to their companies to help their founders think through things around product growth and pricing and various topics like that. And Reforge came together at the same time, so I would come in and speak on topics through that community. So, that really accelerated my transition into venture. I realized how much I love having that portfolio view of the world and helping founders look around corners. So, I think it's an incredible privilege to get to do the work that I do.\n\nLenny (06:22):\nOne thing you mentioned is Evernote. I don't know how much you can talk about this, but they just got sold, right? Someone bought Evernote. And if I think back to Evernote, it feels like they could have been Notion, which is killing it right now. Any thoughts on what maybe they missed and didn't turn into Notion along the way?\n\nNaomi Ionita (06:39):\nYeah. We're going to clear some cobwebs here. It's been a while. But one challenge that Evernote really struggled with was this evolution from single-player to multiplayer to team to enterprise. It's a chasm that a lot of bottom-up SaaS businesses struggle to cross. Evernote was philosophically antisocial. It was meant to be your second brain, kind of your personal tool. And I think that capped the company's growth potential. I always used to say you can't retrofit collaboration. You have to be collaboration-first. And a lot of companies now really take that for granted. But back in mid-2000s, this was kind of a new way of building product. And so we missed that bridge.\n\n(07:20):\nIf companies do that well, it benefits every metric. That bridge from single-player to multiplayer. Acquisition goes up. You grow organically through referrals and shared workflows. Retention goes up because now you have these shared workflows that are incredibly sticky. Employees are accountable to each other to say, \"This is how work gets done.\" Design in Figma, roadmap planning and ticketing in Jira are linear. It just becomes the default platform. And modernization goes up. Revenue scales with usage. And so the more people using it, the more they use it. You start tripping the wire on paying more and more over time. And so Evernote really struggled in crossing that chasm from the prosumer tool of choice that employees wall-to-wall were using, but never became this larger high-ACV contract from a sales perspective.\n\nLenny (08:06):\nYeah. It's always easy in hindsight to see what could have been better, what could have worked out, what didn't work out. So, what are you going to do? You mentioned monetization. And I know that you spent a lot of time with founders working on pricing, monetization, especially using monetization as a lever for growth. And so I want to spend some time there to pick your brain about what founders and growth teams can do and how they should think about monetization in terms of growth.\n\nNaomi Ionita (08:06):\nPerfect.\n\nLenny (08:31):\nAnd then you also have this cool concept that you've been developing that you call the Modern Growth Stack, which is kind of this play on modern data stack. And so I want to spend some time there.\n\nNaomi Ionita (08:40):\nPerfect.\n\nLenny (08:40):\nCool. So, to dive into that first topic of monetization, if you think about when you're starting a company, what are some of the biggest challenges you face? Start building a product, especially a B2B product, I always think about pricing and trying to figure out how much to charge, how to charge, your pricing model, how to evolve your pricing, when to charge, all these things. And so I know that you work with founders helping them figure these sorts of things out. And so maybe a first question here is just what do you find startups most often miss or get wrong when they're starting to think about monetization?\n\nNaomi Ionita (09:12):\nThere's a lot to cover here. I'll cover a few missteps that I think are most common. One is waiting too long to monetize. Another one is underpricing. And this isn't just setting the base price too low, but it's also leaving money on the table by not offering different plans to cater to different segments. And the third one is all too often with pricing, people set it and forget it. So, this idea that when your product development work is never done, neither is your pricing, and you need to combat that along the way. So, those are three areas I think we can cover here.\n\n(09:47):\nMaybe starting with one, I can jump right in, I think waiting too long to monetize. The beginning of a startup's journey is all about creating something of value. Right? That's the whole point. Hopefully, founders have some unique market insight or some authenticity around a pain point and some novel solution that's going to change the world. So, that business value is really critical. But the other side of the same coin is being properly compensated for that value as a business. I understand the vulnerability of being a new startup. You just want people to use your product. And I view that early free beta user feedback loop as an R&D cost to make sure you're building the best possible product and that they're driving a lot of value.\n\n(10:28):\nBut I see companies way too long to make that shift from building a product to building a business. And I think that's the true signal of product-market fit, is ultimately having people open up their wallets and pay you, so looking for people to get to that end goal. And so again, these things aren't mutually exclusive. You're going to create business value, but you're going to be compensated for it and prioritize your roadmap over time so that you're building based on what people actually want and are willing to pay you for.\n\n(10:55):\nSo, when you don't monetize, I think you're doing yourself a disservice. The things that I see as the pain of leaving money on the table, you're inadvertently cheapening your product. People attribute a lower dollar value or a $0 value to what you've built. You're missing out on critical feedback loops to understand what people are willing to pay. And you're shooting your future self in the foot because this is the other problem, is at some point you're going to start charging, and you're going to experience some backlash. So, it's nice to get ahead of that. A few things to think about, kind of food for thought around delaying and kicking the can down the road from a monetization-\n\nLenny (11:29):\nSo, just to reinforce that, your general piece of advice is if you're building a B2B product, start charging immediately. Don't give it away for free. At least have some... You could probably give it away for free but make it clear, \"We're going to charge you this much soon.\" How do you think about that?\n\nNaomi Ionita (11:45):\nYeah, I don't think those are mutually exclusive. So, this isn't to say that I don't like freemium models. Evernote was the darling of freemium over a decade ago. So, I'm still a big believer in that. It's more a question of where you put the paywall. How much do you give up for free? And then how do you price and package a paid version of your product? So, freemium is all about getting that top-of-funnel excitement, getting people to build habit formation. You're collapsing time to value. You're building habit formation. You're building all these champions to use your product. But the idea is to shepherd them along into a paid version of your product and to, again, not delay the idea of, \"What should our premium features even be? What should that paid plan even look like?\" Again, going back to the misstep at Evernote, I think there was always a premium plan, but it didn't really bridge into enterprise. So, we can talk more about that.\n\nLenny (12:35):\nThis is kind of a tangent, I know, because you have these two other pieces of underpricing and setting it and forgetting it. Been talked about, but do you have any advice for deciding what goes into freemium and what-\n\nNaomi Ionita (12:44):\nIf it gets you to the aha moment, that path to habit formation, that has to be free. That's the core utility of your product. And so the idea is that in that first session or first day, someone's getting to see the delight and saying, \"Oh, my God. I'm never going back to the old way. This is how X gets done.\" If you're looking for some virality or network effect, that's the other thing. Your free users, you might not be getting revenue from, but the idea is that they help you manage CAC. So, these are folks that are driving organic growth for you and helping reduce the incremental cost of your next set of users. So, that's another part of the math equation to think about in giving up revenue.\n\nLenny (13:23):\nYou also have this model that you didn't mention that you mentioned in a previous chat we were having offline of this idea of day one versus day 100, stuff people need on day one versus what they need down the road. Do you still believe in that? And what should people know about that?\n\nNaomi Ionita (13:36):\nI do believe in that. That was tied to... We had done this experiment at my last company, Invoice2go, where... Typically on the demand curve, the higher you raise the price, the average revenue per user or ARPU, the lower the conversion rate. So, these things are inversely correlated. And we were able to do this rebalancing of our pricing and packaging so that we actually doubled our upgrade rate from our starter plan to our pro plan.\n\nNaomi Ionita (14:00):\n... We doubled our upgrade rate from our starter plan to our pro plan while also increasing the price of the pro plan. So, to actually get twice as many people to upgrade while paying something like 30% more for that new plan is pretty rare to get the compounding benefits of that. And what we did was thought a lot about what is a day one premium feature? What is a premium feature that you can get value from the very first time you engage with the product? That's different than your day 100 features. Those are the ones that represent more advanced functionality. Maybe they're ones where the value is derived from having a certain scale of data in the platform.\n\n(14:37):\nAnd so, those you shouldn't waste cognitive load for your users to have to even understand or try to appreciate when they're first getting going. Push those into a more advanced pro version of your product, and monetize them down the road through an upsell. So, big believer in how do you really keep pricing simple? And we've all seen those SaaS pricing pages where there's a laundry list or just a gnarly matrix of features and functionality. So, do what you can to think about that journey for a user and how they're going to continue to increase value with your product over time, and how you can map your pricing and packaging against that journey.\n\nLenny (15:13):\nI really like that framework, because it's so straightforward and simple. As you use it, you'll need more enterprise features innately, because you're sharing it more widely. Your head of security's going to be like, \"What are you doing with this thing?\" Your finance team's going to be like, \"Oh, how do we pay for this thing?\" And so, that's a really nice simple way of thinking about what to put in freemium in your free plan versus not. So, glad we touched on that. Okay, so we were going through the three things that companies and founders do wrong when they're starting to price. And so, the first you said was they go too late and I tangentized us, so I'll give it back to you to keep going through this.\n\nNaomi Ionita (15:53):\n[inaudible 00:15:53] This is by far the most common issue. And so, one framework I like to use here is matching price to value. When you do that, you create alignment with your user. So, this entails picking the right value metric. So, this is the unit of value that they derive from using your product, and it creates this natural escalator, because as people use it more, you get paid more over time. SaaS was historically built on a seat based model. That's been historical SaaS pricing. And now with the rise of PLG, we've seen more of these usage based approaches gaining speed, so that's pretty exciting to see. Whether it's number of API calls or messages sent or terabytes of storage used or words written, this usage-based approach really matches price to value over the lifetime of a customer. The other thing that happens when you match price to value is it helps you understand who you're building for, and it lets you target different customer segments.\n\n(16:46):\nIn doing that, you're able to better serve each segment, but you're also able to maximize revenue for the business. Evernote always had a business model. From its beginning, it had $45 a year for an annual subscription. And this set the foundation for the company and tens of millions in revenue, early revenue growth, but the approach was suboptimal. So, as a growth team, we started doing surveys. I was really curious to understand why people converted from our free version to our premium subscription. And one of the most popular answers without fail was, \"Well, I just feel guilty. I use it so much. I get so much value from it that I just feel obligated to pay.\" And take that in for a second, because if guilt is one of the main reasons why people are paying you, then your free version is too good, and you are leaving money on the table.\n\n(17:36):\nSo, a single premium tier is often a mistake, and you're going to be leaving money on the table for specific segments, and it's important to drill down and understand who those are. Our additional research helped us understand that brand-new users with low perceived value of Evernote looked at it like their Apple Notepad app that was pre-installed on their device. And so, they couldn't understand the idea of paying $45 for Evernote. But then we talked to avid users, and these were people that were cross client using it on desktop and mobile, every device they had. They were using it for work and personal, they were leveraging OCR capabilities and the web clipper, and it was truly their second brain. They could not imagine life without it. And these people were floored that they were only paying $45 a year. They told us that they were getting hundreds of value from Evernote.\n\n(18:28):\nHere, the perceived value for avid users was far outpacing what we were asking from them. And this intuition and research really led to a bifurcated strategy of having different plans for different personas based on the value they got from the product and their willingness to pay.\n\nLenny (18:45):\nThat makes sense. When I heard you say that it costs $45 for a year, that sounds way too low. So I could see how that sets the pattern for Evernote just not making enough money over the long term. Cool. And then the third was that you don't evolve your pricing, right? That's like the third biggest mistake.\n\nNaomi Ionita (19:03):\nYes. So, do not set it and forget it. I see companies do this where they labor over designs and features, and they build this perfect product that's delightful to use, and then pricing plucked out of thin air, and then they don't revisit it. This was Evernote. It was many, many years before we went back and overhauled the pricing. So, think about your pricing just like you do your roadmap. Every six to 12 months, there's probably something meaningful that you're launching for users. Treat that as an opportunity to revisit your monetization strategy and making sure you're compensated appropriately.\n\nLenny (19:33):\nWhat advice do you have for founders around just how to decide in your initial price? Clearly Evernote didn't get that correct, and I'm sure you've learned a lot from that and then other companies you've worked with. How do you actually decide what to start charging?\n\nNaomi Ionita (19:45):\nYeah, there's a full pricing process here, so I'm happy to walk through it. The idea here is understanding who your customers are, why they pay you, what is it that they want or value, and how much are they willing to pay you. I'd encourage you to put together a pricing committee. This is not a single-threaded exercise that lives in one department or another. This very much is a cross-functional exercise. If you are a PLG company like companies I worked at, this was the product growth org that I ran. So the combination of PMs and data scientists, folks like that to iterate on pricing. If you are an enterprise SaaS business, of course, sales and finance and rev ops play a role. Think about who that committee should be at your company, and commit to being that cross-functional team that really owns and iterates on pricing over time.\n\n(20:31):\nThen, they are responsible for talking to customers. This is by far and away the most basic thing you can do to just increase those feedback loops and understand how much you can push the envelope on pricing. You do that with surveys, with interviews, there's some questions that we like to use around understanding the relative prioritization of features. Going back to that laundry list of features and matrices on a pricing page, it's very rare that people convert equally across all of those features. There's typically one or two that are the main points for conversion. So it's good for you to understand the relative rank there and how to reconcile some of your pricing and packaging accordingly. So, we would make a list of our features that we had and maybe new things we wanted to build and have people rank them as a must-have, nice to have, or not necessary that help us understand the relative prioritization.\n\n(21:23):\nYou can also get at it with a hundred point question where you give users a hundred points and say, \"Spend them across these different features.\" And the more points you give a feature, the more value you're assigning to it. This is to get to the demand or the features and functionality that you've created. It's step one. It's understanding what people will actually want and making sure that they're not just saying everything but the kitchen sink, but they're actually getting a good sense for what's most important to them. And then the other side is understanding their willingness to pay. I'd say the easiest on-ramps here for companies to start digging into that is to use Van Westendorp's method here. I don't know if you're familiar with that. You're nodding a little bit.\n\nLenny (22:05):\nYeah. Yeah. Comes up a bunch on this podcast.\n\nNaomi Ionita (22:08):\nOh, great. So I might be repeating myself here, but...\n\nLenny (22:10):\nNo, this is great. This is how we learn. We hear it again.\n\nNaomi Ionita (22:13):\nIf you take the packages that users designated as nice to have and must have, you make that collection of features in the survey, then ask them, \"What's such a cheap price that you start to question the quality of the product?\" Ask them, \"What's a good deal or sounds like the right price for this package?\" Ask them, \"What's expensive, but they would still pay?\" So you're starting to get to that level of discomfort. And then ultimately, \"What's prohibitively expensive? What would people just say, 'Okay, that's it.' You've crossed the line of how much I'm willing to pay here.\" And by plotting those four curves, you start to get a sense of how to inform your pricing. That's a great way to marry the questions around demand and then the questions around willingness to pay.\n\nLenny (22:52):\nAwesome. I wish that survey name was simpler to say, because I can never remember exactly to pronounce it, but you got it. So Van Westendorp.\n\nNaomi Ionita (22:52):\nYou got it.\n\nLenny (23:01):\nSo, say that you got a price, you launched with something. How do you think about and how do you suggest folks experiment with pricing changes? And then, what impact have you seen from making a pricing change, either in terms of revenue or growth? Because I know you work with a lot of startups on these sorts of things, so I'm curious. How big of an impact can you see from pricing changes?\n\nNaomi Ionita (23:22):\nOh, it can be huge. Our friends at OpenView do a really good job of pumping out content and doing these great SaaS benchmarking surveys. They did something recently that showed that roughly half of companies that instituted a pricing change saw at least a 25% increase in ARR. So that's a pretty massive step function improvement in your revenue from something that doesn't require massive technological overhaul. I find that most companies regret not doing it sooner. ProfitWell is another group that I have friends at and have a lot of respect for them and the content that they've put out. They did a survey once on I think it was over 500 SaaS companies, and they looked at for a 1% improvement on acquisition, retention, and monetization, how did it impact a company's bottom line? And they found that the impact with an improvement on monetization was 4X that of acquisition.\n\n(24:13):\nSo, this idea of how can you efficiently improve your business monetization is really underappreciated as a growth lever. Definitely something people should be thinking about. That's part of my goal of doing this podcast, is making sure founders are compensated in a way that they deserve. So, let's hope everyone makes a little more money after today. And I've seen a lift upwards of 10X on revenue, but it's sometimes hard to parsh just the pricing change, because usually it can be coupled with big product changes, a rebrand, a lot of PR, the launch of a new plan, like a team or an enterprise plan. So, it's hard to sometimes understand just the pricing change in isolation, but it really can be pivotal.\n\nLenny (24:54):\nCool. And when you think through the pricing changes that you've seen, is the impact often from raising the price just broadly? Is it segmenting more intelligently? Is it changing freemium versus paid? Is there a bucket you think of, like \"Here's generally where the biggest impact ends up being?\"\n\nNaomi Ionita (25:13):\nYeah, it comes from doing it holistically. I think it's very rarely as impactful if you just pick a new price or just launch a new plan. I really think of it as rebalancing pricing and packaging overall. So it's doing this whole exercise of understanding what people actually want, what their willingness to pay is, and mapping it to that user journey like we talked about from single-player mode to multi-player, that first other person you connect with and have a workflow with, spreading it to your whole teams and ultimately spreading it wall to wall across an organization. So it's a longitudinal view of the user lifecycle and thinking about your whole business model holistically.\n\nLenny (25:53):\nI don't know if you can talk about any of these, but is there a company or an example that comes to mind where you did a pricing change and just talking about what they changed just to make this even more concrete?\n\nNaomi Ionita (26:02):\nI have a specific story there with one of our companies, Envoy. This is a fun one. He was just getting started. This is Envoy, the visitor registration tool that I'm sure a lot of people have used, especially before COVID.\n\nLenny (26:16):\nProbably mostly in SF, so I imagine folks in other countries don't know about it. Maybe describe it.\n\nNaomi Ionita (26:20):\nYeah. So, if you visit an office instead of just signing in to that piece of paper in the lobby with your name and your email address and what time you checked in, it is a digital iPad based way of checking in and sharing information with the person you're visiting. And so, in talking to Larry and getting a feel for his evolution around pricing, he tells a story that I love. He was meeting with a big hospitality company, and the conversation was going really well. This prospect was really leaning in and excited about using Envoy, and the conversation shifted to pricing. So in that moment, because Larry was feeling some good vibes, he decided to 10X the price that he was typically charging people. So, just in the moment he decided to just go for it. Go out on a limb, and ask for 10X the typical price.\n\n(27:13):\nAnd in that moment, the exec said, \"Okay, sure. Sounds good.\" Not a minute of hesitation, not a second of hesitation. And what he learned in that moment was that, one, he was wildly underpriced. It was very clear that he hadn't even thought about what the ceiling was. But the truth was he probably could have pushed it even further, considering there was no hesitation. So, what I encourage users to do, especially in these enterprise conversations, is to continue to ask for more, to understand where the upper bound might be, and to understand that it's okay sometimes to lose some deals due to price. Something on the order of 20 to 30% is reasonable so that you can get a sense for where the limit might be. The vast majority of companies are definitely undercharging like we discussed. So, go out on a limb like Larry at Envoy, and you can see that sometimes you can...\n\nNaomi Ionita (28:00):\n... like Larry at Envoy and you can see that sometimes you can 2X, 4X, even 10X your price.\n\nLenny (28:07):\nThat's an awesome story and it touches on exactly what you said where people often underprice. I imagine it's strategically smarter not to go straight to 10X and maybe go two or three X until people start pushing back because you lose a lot of data there. But that's one way to just zoom to an answer.\n\nNaomi Ionita (28:22):\nYeah, they're all feedback loops, so I think there's some incrementality to it. But you got to understand who these different segments are, and if you don't have enough data points, it's hard to really understand how to continue to optimize.\n\nLenny (28:33):\nAny other tips that you want to leave listeners with around pricing or monetization, or even testing pricing? Anything there before we shift to our second topic?\n\nNaomi Ionita (28:43):\nYes. So we talked a bit about research methods and different surveys you can do to help inform your pricing. And with Enterprise, it's all about continuously asking for more. But if you're a PLG company and you have a public facing pricing page, I'd encourage you to experiment. This is something people shy away from, and frankly, there haven't historically been great tools for companies and infrastructure to be able to do this work.\n\n(29:08):\nSo at Invoice2go, we invested very heavily in some internal pooling. We had a whole metering and human management and experimentation system in-house. It was a big growth engineering undertaking. And with that we tested different value metrics. We tested different quota limits, price points, promotions, you name it. We tracked the consumption of our pay as you go model and looped that back into the product so we can nudge users along the lifecycle to get them to convert, or upgrade or renew, once quota limits were reached.\n\n(29:38):\nSo there's a lot there. I'm excited about this new wave of modern tools to actually help you do this and not sync a bunch of engineering time into building something in-house. So that's something we can talk about in a bit. But that investment was very worthwhile. We had huge revenue gains by being able to iterate in a way that was more streamlined.\n\n(29:57):\nThere's some things to watch out for though. It's hard to test pricing. There's a lot of different variables to isolate. So you've got to make sure you're bringing a consistent test experience to the in product experience, your pricing page, maybe mobile app stores or lifecycle emails that you're sending.\n\n(30:14):\nOne trick you can do is we would segment these tests by geo. So we would do some tests in Canada or Australia before rolling out in the US. That was a nice way to just put some constraints around our experimentation.\n\n(30:28):\nAnd the other thing you really have to think about is the long-term nature of pricing experimentation. So knowing if you succeeded and failed often requires understanding the implications on churn. Let's say part of your test is year one discount. You need to understand how users perform in year two and have a sense of the trade-offs around user growth, retention, ARPU. So all of these things are different levers that you want to optimize over time.\n\nLenny (30:56):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.\n\n(31:35):\nBeginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Get started today.\n\n(32:13):\nThere's a question I wanted to ask you, and maybe it's too big of a question to answer simply, but it's this question you just raised of trading off revenue versus growth. That's one of the most common trade-offs founders have to make. Do you have any just general thoughts, advice there? Is there one you should generally index on? What have you seen works best? Which kind of direction should you lean, growth or revenue, for your, let's say, B2B company? Like early stage?\n\nNaomi Ionita (32:40):\nYeah, if you know that you have a bridge to move up market, then giving up the long tail of individual users can be very worthwhile.\n\n(32:50):\nSo I think Figma is a great example of that. This was a company that took a while to monetize. And even having free usage at the individual level, that was the way to just drive insane community and love for this product. Designers around the world just fell for this product overnight. But this idea that once they were using it in a more corporate setting, once they were collaborating with more people across the business, they were tripping a wire to pay. And so what happened there was you had this massive top of funnel of individual users, but knowing that design is inherently collaborative, you're interfacing with engineers, you're interfacing with PMs, with marketers, with researchers, with execs, more than half of Figma users weren't even designers once it was embedded in the enterprise. And so this idea of these compounded growth loops that you got by interfacing with so many different parts of the company and making design truly collaborative and in the browser, they were able to just have this exponential curve on monetization once they shifted into more of a team or enterprise based package.\n\n(33:54):\nSo that's a good example of saying, they were willing to trade off on monetizing the individual because they knew that it would be so sticky and would go so wall to wall within a company.\n\nLenny (34:05):\nGot it. So your feeling is if it's a multiplayer PLG-ish product, you probably want to optimize for growth. Let it just take over and not go charge as much as you can immediately, versus say like a sales led B2B enterprise-y product, maybe they're focused on revenue immediately versus making it feel cheap. Is that right?\n\nNaomi Ionita (34:27):\nAnd I think if you do have a few free users, crafting it as more of a sweetheart discount, like more of a year one discount, but getting paid over time. I mean, again, I am a big believer in having some early users being your design partners and really giving you that tight feedback loop to make sure you're building the right product. So it's not that you should really optimize for revenue on day one. I mean, it is a journey, but I just oftentimes see companies just take too long. Or in Evernote's case, I mean the free version was just too good. So that's just something to consider, where to put the paywall and be really, really strategic about that.\n\nLenny (35:02):\nJust don't optimize for guilt in your paid driver.\n\n(35:07):\nSo you're talking about pricing testing and I was going to ask what tools you found that are useful for testing pricing. And that's probably a good segue to talking about the modern growth stack. Would that fit into this concept of modern growth stack, testing your pricing?\n\nNaomi Ionita (35:21):\nYeah, let's do it.\n\nLenny (35:22):\nOkay, let's do it. So just to set it up, there's this term modern data stack that I think it'd be useful for you to explain because not everyone is aware of that, and you've kind of been thinking more about this adjacent idea of a modern growth stack. So can you just talk about these two things, and then we'll lead to some questions there?\n\nNaomi Ionita (35:37):\nSo the modern data stack is basically a collection of cloud native tools to more easily move and manage data. It consists of a fully managed ELT, data pipeline, a destination for that data. So a cloud-based data warehouse, like a Snowflake or Redshift, data transformation tool like DBT, and then finally a platform for visualization on top, so people can access the data. The play on modern data stack was very intentional. I think of the modern growth stack, or my core thesis area right now at Menlo, as the evolution of what you do with the data. So these are the workflows that the data enables to drive the business forward for product growth and revenue teams like I used to run. It's the modern replacement for infrastructure that teams like mine built or bought. When you're responsible for driving things like activation or monetization or retention, there tends to be a lot of these internal tools that are built because you're really powering cross-functional teams to do this work. It's not mapped easily into legacy departments.\n\nLenny (36:39):\nAwesome. And the general idea here is, there's so many more tools now to help you grow with the data stack. There's just all these tools now that make it so much easier to collect data, use data, make decisions off data, and you're finding the same things happening with growth. What are some of the tools that you found to be super helpful? I know you're an investor in some, you're not a investor in others. It'd be good to just talk about, here's just like a bunch of cool tools and how do they fit together as much as possible to help you grow your startup.\n\nNaomi Ionita (37:05):\nAnd I want to reinforce some different themes before I get into some layers of the stack because I think it's important to frame the benefits of the modern growth stack. So one is data, two is workflow, and three is impact.\n\n(37:18):\nSo starting with data, the modern growth stack companies really are powered by these smart integrations and the automation that you get as a result. So with this proliferation of SaaS, it's created this need for more data access and interoperability. We've all felt that pain of siloed data. Modern growth stack companies leverage reverse ETL companies, like Hightouch or Census, to break down these silos and help companies, or employees across the company, access data and be more productive. So that's a big data theme with modern growth stack companies.\n\n(37:49):\nThe other theme that they unlock is around workflow. Here, it's really the enablement of people and process. So rather than employees sitting in their departmental silos, modern growth stack companies build bridges between them. So by unlocking data access, the business side can often self-serve and be more self-sufficient without relying on an engineer or a data scientist to run queries or stitch together data sets for them.\n\n(38:16):\nThe other thing here is lots of growth work is inherently cross functional. So the efforts to drive growth requires new tools and collaborative workflows like we're discussing. Without purpose-built software, many teams like mine felt no choice but to build in-house. So we spent sacred hours building and maintaining tooling for experimentation, personalization, billing, monetization. These were resources that could have been reallocated to building proprietary features for the business had we been able to buy something purpose-built.\n\n(38:50):\nAnd finally, these products really drive impact. So the idea here is driving hard ROI in the form of cost reduction. So automation means time savings, and oftentimes, that can be mapped directly to cost reduction for a company. But they also help product and growth and go to market teams better engage and monetize customers. So they're driving hard ROI in the form of revenue impact too. I'm really compelled by companies that can drive hard ROI both across cost saving and revenue generation. And I think that ROI story is even more compelling now in a softer macroeconomic climate. You just have to be able to continue to retain sales and pricing power, and I think that's derived from a strong ROI story like I described.\n\n(39:35):\nSo those are general themes and consistencies across the companies that I get particularly excited about. So happy to talk about a few layers in the stack, and I think you might be familiar with a few of these as well, especially based on your growth background at Airbnb and tools that you probably build yourself.\n\nLenny (39:54):\nYeah, exactly. That's what I was going to say, that so many of these things are just coming out of startups that have built these in-house. And then they're just like, \"Hey, I could start a company doing this and provide it to all these other companies.\" And so I just love that there's all these tools coming out that just make it easier to build startups and grow startups, and do less work, and have less people. Just reminds me of the number one app in the App Store at this point. I don't know if it still is Gas, which is just like four people, and it's higher than TikTok and YouTube, and all the things, and Facebook, and it's four people. And so it just shows you the power of what tools can do for you to build new startups and disrupt people, and companies that have been around for a long time.\n\nNaomi Ionita (40:33):\nAnd you have to help companies do more with less now. There's a lot of frozen budgets and that's a good way to break through. So I love that these companies can do that for the buyer.\n\n(40:44):\nSo one that's come up a bit and gotten a lot of airtime recently is product-led sales. This idea of companies that serve PLG businesses and harness the power of all that product usage data to inform the customer facing team around which accounts are most upgradable. It's really free money when you shine a light on an account that nobody was paying attention to and some inside sales team can drive a large account expansion. So I don't know what better ROI you should get than that.\n\n(41:14):\nAnd there's a bunch of companies that are doing this. Endgame happens to be one that I work with. They have customers like Figma, Loom, Calendly. There's other players too. I think Pocus has done a phenomenal job of building content and community to help inform the market around the power of product led sales. So there's just a lot of goodness about all the players in this space really waking everyone up to this opportunity of layering on sales to a product led motion and how to maximize revenue along the way.\n\nLenny (41:45):\nI'm an investor in both of those actually, and I'm going to, just in the show notes, note the one I'm an investor in because I'm investor in a lot of these companies, it turns out. And we've invested in a few, so I'm just going to keep it simple and I'll write in the show notes. Here's ones I'm an investor, just to avoid.\n\nNaomi Ionita (41:59):\nI love that. Double- dipping means you're a believer in the category as well.\n\nLenny (42:03):\nI am.\n\nNaomi Ionita (42:00):\n... tipping means you're a believer in the category as well.\n\nLenny (42:03):\nI am. I love it. There's so much school stuff happening there and I'm really excited. Yeah.\n\nNaomi Ionita (42:08):\nYep. Cool. I think another layer in the stack is experimentation. So this is really critical infrastructure, in my opinion, for these cross-functional product data growth teams to A/B test hypotheses and understand their impact on the business. How do you know if you make a change in the product or your pricing, whether you succeeded or failed without having infrastructure like this along the way? Category creators like Optimizely really paved the way. I was an early buyer of Optimizely and they targeted marketing personas, and it was just game changing to be able to start to A/B test things and bring hypotheses to life.\n\n(42:44):\nI'm also biased as an investor, but some of the modern tools here, like Eppo, which offers experimentation for the modern data stack. So unlike Optimizely, which focused on more kind of click through metrics, Eppo ties directly to the metrics in your data warehouse. So tying an experiment result to things like subscriptions or revenue or margins, really like board level metrics that you're trying to move. They make that full trip really convenient and understand the impact on those business KPIs directly. So it's a lot of automation around the experimentation, results. And analysis they used to live off to the side in Excel or Jupyter Notebooks now is automated away with Eppo. I think you're familiar with that one.\n\nLenny (43:29):\nYeah, we definitely didn't plan this, but Eppo's both a happy sponsor of this podcast. I'm also an investor in Eppo. Go Eppo, but this was not planned.\n\nNaomi Ionita (43:38):\nWell, this is Airbnb roots. [inaudible 00:43:41].\n\nLenny (43:40):\nLove it. It is. Yeah. It's my colleague.\n\nNaomi Ionita (43:42):\n[inaudible 00:43:42] was an early data scientist at Airbnb.\n\nLenny (43:45):\nExactly, I worked with him at Airbnb and he was amazing and I had to invest in anything that he built. He built an awesome thing.\n\nNaomi Ionita (43:49):\nYeah, but exactly like you describe, I love these founders that have steep authenticity around the problem because they built it internally and now they're commercializing it for the masses. And so the story of chain Eppo is a good one on that dimension. And there's other players too. I'm also a big fan of Amplitude and a buyer of that tool as well, and I love a lot of the team there. So if you do not have a data team or a data warehouse and you still want to leverage being able to do behavioral kind of ad hoc analysis or experimentation, that's a great tool for you as well. So a lot of different ways to solve this problem in the market.\n\nLenny (44:22):\nAlso, a happy sponsor, go Amplitude.\n\nNaomi Ionita (44:25):\nCool.\n\nLenny (44:26):\nI love it. This is great. Hitting on all my favorites. Okay, let's keep going. What else have we got?\n\nNaomi Ionita (44:32):\nWell, I talked a lot about billing and monetization, so I'd have to talk about that one. I think platforms for managing, billing and iterating on your pricing and packaging, this is just such a big need. I think these will transform business models. For SaaS in particular, most companies have been seat-based like we described, so the historical incumbents like a [inaudible 00:44:54] really serve that model. But in this shift to more usage based, there's new entrants that are servicing companies in that dimension. And there's also lots of sort of clunky workflows when you think of bridging from engineering to product and growth to finance or RevOps.\n\n(45:11):\nSo there's a lot of just streamlined workflow that these new tools can offer. Some early breakout players in the world of usage-based billing are Metronome and Orb. There's also more room to handle the full monetization infra-layer. So for example, I like how Orb marries the billing component with the data infrastructure to actually inform what your pricing and packaging iteration should be and help you forecast and optimize revenue. So there's other players that are doing different components from this journey of the metering piece all the way through to the experimentation piece, and it's been really, really fun to get to know players in that space. And I wish I could have been a buyer of them many moons ago.\n\nLenny (45:57):\nNot an investor in these yet. And so that's cool. Quick tangent, do you have a strong opinion on pricing models, usage based versus seed based versus something else? What's your guidance to founders? Is this the way to go, usually one of them, or is it super dependent? What do you recommend?\n\nNaomi Ionita (46:12):\nYes, this is a similar answer I had before. I don't think that they're mutually exclusive. And so if you look at all the companies that in different pricing models in SaaS, a small sliver less than 10%, around roughly 5% have just pure natural escalator kind of usage-based model. The vast majority have a hybrid approach. And so what I mean by that is they're typically some good, better, best subscription model where there's some consumption component across each tier, like some quota limit for your given value metric. So in Slack there might have been number of messages sent or Dropbox number of terabytes of storage. Invoice2go might be number of invoices. There's some dimension that's been sort of packaged in with a given pricing plan, and once you reach that limit, it is a trigger to get you to upgrade to the next plan over, or sometimes there's overages that you can pay for.\n\n(47:02):\nSo I don't believe that you should just be seat-based or just be usage-based. I think one challenge with purely usage-based models is that's not always how CFOs want to buy. I think buyers sometimes want predictability. They want to be able to budget for your tool, and I've lived that. I remember using tools like Mixpanel and Segment and even Jira to an extent where I was paying a cheap amount to get going, and all of a sudden I realized we had grown quickly and I looked at all of our SaaS spend and I was blown away by how much more we were paying. So it's the other side of this... I'm advocating for people getting paid and compensated for the value that they're delivering, but there can be a breaking point. And so how do you think about packaging a fixed and variable component so that people can more predictably buy your software?\n\nLenny (47:48):\nAny other layers of the stack that you want to touch on slash which would you be most excited about in the future? Do you think people should be paying more attention to that maybe they're not paying attention to?\n\nNaomi Ionita (47:57):\nI mean, I wouldn't be doing my job as a VC if I didn't mention Generative AI right now. It's really having a moment. So there's a bunch of breakout applications there that sit within this theme of the modern growth stack. When you think of using AI to create images or text or code or audio or video, these capabilities change the way teams work. So writing a blog or writing copy for an ad, SDR is doing their work and can outbound sales efforts. There's just a lot of these touchpoints where it's humans kind of tinkering and iterating and laboring over every word. And if the machine, if AI can tell you what's going to be a more performant version of something, that's a very, very hard ROI exercise there. You save time and hopefully you've improved your performance across the various marketing or sales campaign.\n\nLenny (48:48):\nWhere do you think AI will be the most help on growth in terms of growth? Do you have an idea there?\n\nNaomi Ionita (48:54):\nI think what I described around marketing and sales, just because they really touch the dollars. It can be this ROI story around saving time, but also driving revenue. There'll be plenty of really effective examples within things like customer support. I mean the cost savings potential. There's going to be massive. We'll see what happens in engineering, which generating code. I think there's a lot of areas where it is going to touch the enterprise, but from a modern growth stack standpoint, I think something that's really revenue generating and can point to attributable ROI on that dimension is going to be pretty relevant to where I'm spending time right now.\n\nLenny (49:32):\nI'm excited. Any last thoughts before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nNaomi Ionita (49:37):\nI'm happy to hand it over to the lightning round here.\n\nLenny (49:40):\nWell, we've reached the very exciting lightning round. I'm only going to have four questions for you. I'm going to ask them pretty quick. We'll go through them fast, whatever comes to mind. No pressure. Question one, what are a couple books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nNaomi Ionita (49:56):\nMy buddy Madhavan from Simon Kucher's wrote a book called Monetizing Innovation. This is a great read. He and others there have done pricing engagements with hundreds of tech companies, so there's a lot of stories and practical tips there. I often gift that one to founders, so I can't do this whole talk without giving a nod to my friend, Madhavan, and his bible.\n\nLenny (50:19):\nAwesome. I just recorded an episode with Madhavan, and so that's a great pick. Question number two, favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nNaomi Ionita (50:28):\nI have little kids, so I don't know if this is going to be as interesting for folks, but we like Story Bots on Netflix. They're these little cartoon characters that answer kids questions. So people sort of call in and ask questions and they do a whole episode on why is the sky blue? How do airplanes fly? How do I see? And I inevitably learned something from watching those. So those are very kind of playful and educational shows. I critically need a new-\n\nLenny (51:00):\nNo, those are... I don't know the answer to any of those questions. I need to watch this. Okay, so question three. I'm looking at my notes and I've never asked this question before, so I don't know where this came from, but I love it. Who's been the biggest inspiration to you in your life?\n\nNaomi Ionita (51:14):\nI mean, this one's pretty easy. For me, it's my parents. They're from South America originally and lived on three different continents before immigrating to the US for graduate school. It's a pretty cliché American dream, but they came here with nothing. Just this idea of building a family and taking advantage of the educational and professional opportunities in America. They progressed through school and building their career in three different languages with no financial support, no entrenched kind of resources or networks to lean on, and I just can't imagine doing that. Just the stress or cognitive load of kind of restarting your life in whole new geographies and cultures and languages and just betting on yourself and figuring it all out along the way. So my drive has always been rooted in their story and I'm forever indebted to them.\n\nLenny (52:03):\nI need to ask this question more often. That was an amazing answer on the spot. Naomi, we have reached the end of our chat. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, maybe pitch you startup ideas, contact you if they want to ask you questions, and then finally, how can folks be useful to you?\n\nNaomi Ionita (52:23):\nI'm a partner at Menlo Ventures, so you can find more about me in the firm at menlovc.com or else on LinkedIn or Twitter. My DMs are open.\n\nLenny (52:33):\nAmazing. Naomi, thank you so much for being here.\n\nNaomi Ionita (52:35):\nMy pleasure. I look forward to talking to more folks who are building things across workflow automation, data AI, and the modern growth stack. So thank you. It's always a pleasure.\n\nLenny (52:48):\nAll right, DMs are coming in as we speak.\n\nNaomi Ionita (52:50):\nThanks, Lenny.\n\nLenny (52:53):\nThank you so much for listening.

Now, you're the PM of the most consequential product in history.\n\nNick Turley (00:00:05):\nI didn't know what I would do here because it was a research lab. My first task was I fix the blinds, or something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:11):\nWhen someone offers you a rocket ship, don't ask which seat.\n\nNick Turley (00:00:13):\nWe set out to build a super assistant. It was supposed to be a hackathon code base.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):\nWhat was it called before?\n\nNick Turley (00:00:17):\nIt was going to be Chat with GPT-3.5 because we really didn't think it was going to be a successful product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):\nAnd then Sam Altman is just like, \"Hey, let me tweet about it.\"\n\nNick Turley (00:00:23):\nThis is a pattern with AI, you won't know what to polish until after you ship. My dream is that we ship daily.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):\nBy the time people hear this, they're going to have their hands on GPT-5.\n\nNick Turley (00:00:31):\nAbout 10% of the world population uses every week. With scale comes responsibility. It just feels a little bit more alive, a bit more human. This model has taste.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:38):\nKevin Weil, your CPO, said to ask you about this principle of, \"Is it maximally accelerated?\"\n\nNick Turley (00:00:43):\nI just really want to jump to the punchline, \"Why can't we do this now?\" I always felt like part of my role here is to just set the pace and the resting heartbeat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):\nEveryone is always wondering, \"Is Chat the future of all of this stuff?\"\n\nNick Turley (00:00:52):\nChat was the simplest way to ship at that time. I'm baffled by how much it took off, even more baffled by how many people have copied.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):\nChatGPT is now driving more traffic to my newsletter than Twitter.\n\nNick Turley (00:01:02):\nThat is the type of capability that has been incredibly retentive. I've been really excited about what we've been doing in search.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:06):\nCan you give us a peek into where this goes long-term?\n\nNick Turley (00:01:09):\nChatGPT feels a little bit like MS-DOS. We haven't built Windows yet, and it will be obvious once we do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):\nToday, my guest is Nick Turley. Nick is Head of ChatGPT at OpenAI. He joined the company three years ago, when it was still primarily a research lab. He helped come up with the idea of ChatGPT and took it from 0 to over 700 million weekly active users, billions in revenue, and arguably the most successful and impactful consumer software product in human history. Nick is incredible. He's been very much under the radar. This is the first major podcast interview that he has ever done, and you are in for a treat. We talk about all the things, including the just launched GPT-5.\n\n(00:01:50):\nA huge thank you to Kevin Weil, Claire Vo, George O'Brien, Joanne Jang, and Peter Deng for suggesting topics for this conversation.

Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:34):\nVanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:03:41):\nSure. So we started Vanta in 2018, focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications, like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names, like Atlassian, Ramp, and LangChain, start and scale their security programs, and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:12):\nThat is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources, and nobody wants to spend time doing this.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:04:20):\nThat is very much our experience, but before the company, and some extent, during it, but the idea is, with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:36):\nWe appreciate you for doing that, and you have a special discount for listeners. They can get $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny, that's vanta.com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:04:50):\nThank you!\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):\nNick, thank you so much for joining me, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nNick Turley (00:04:59):\nThanks for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:00):\nI already had a billion questions I wanted to ask you, and then you guys decided to launch GPT-5 the week that we're recording this. So, now, I have at least 2 billion questions for you. I hope you have a lot of time. First of all, just congrats on the launch. It's coming tomorrow, the day after recording this. Just congrats. How are you feeling? I imagine this is an ungodly amount of work and stress. How are you doing?\n\nNick Turley (00:05:22):\nIt's a busy week, but we've been working on this for a while, so it also feels really good to get it out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:27):\nSo, by the time people hear this, they're going to have their hands on GPT-5, the newest ChatGPT. What's the simplest way to just understand what this is, what it unlocks, what people can do with it? Give us the pitch.\n\nNick Turley (00:05:39):\nI'm so excited about GPT-5. I think for most people, it's going to feel like a real step change. If you're the average ChatGPT user, and we have 700 million of them this week, you've probably been on GPT-4o for a while. You probably don't even think about the model that powers the product. And GPT-5, it just feels categorically different. I'll talk about a lot of the specifics, but at the end of the day, the vibes are good, at least we feel that way. We hope that users feel the same. And increasingly, that is the thing that I think most people notice, right? They don't look at the academic benchmarks. They don't look at evaluations. They try the model and see what it feels like. And just on that dimension alone, I'm so excited. I've been using it for a while, but it is also the smartest, most useful, and fastest frontier model that we've ever launched.\n\n(00:06:33):\nOn pure SMARTs, one way to look at that is academic benchmarks on many of the standard ones, whether or not it's math, or reasoning, or just raw intelligence. This model is state of the art. I'm especially excited about its performance on coding, whether or not that's SWE-bench, which is a common benchmark, or actually front-end coding is really, really good as well, and that's an area where I feel like there's the true step change improvement in GPT-5. But really, no matter how you measure the SMARTs, it's quite remarkable, and I think people are going to feel the upgrade, especially if they weren't using o3 already.\n\n(00:07:13):\nAnd the second thing beyond SMARTs is it's just really useful. Coding is one axis of utility, whether or not you have coding questions or you're vibe coding an app, but it's also a really good writer. I write for a living, internally, externally. I just wrote a big blog post that we published Monday, and this thing is such an incredible editor. And compared to some of the older models, it's got taste, which I think is really exciting. And to me, that's something that is truly useful in my day-to-day. And there's a bunch of other areas, like it's state of the art on health, which is useful when you need it, but again, the thing you can't really express in use cases or data is the vibe of the model. And it just feels a little bit more alive, a bit more human in a way that is hard to articulate until you try it. So, feel good about that.\n\n(00:08:06):\nAnd yeah, as mentioned, it's faster. It thinks, too, just like o3 did, but you don't have to manually tell it to do that. It'll just dynamically decide to think when it needs to. And when it doesn't need to think, it just responds instantly, and that ends up feeling quite a bit faster than using o3 did. And then maybe the thing that's most exciting is that we're making it available for free, and that's one of those things that I feel like we can uniquely do at OpenAI. Because many companies, I think, if they have a subscription model like us, they would gate it behind their paid plan. And for us, if we can scale it, we will, and that just feels awesome. We did that with 4o as well. So, everyone is going to be able to try GPT-5 tomorrow, hopefully.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:46):\nHow long does something like this take? I don't know if there's a simple answer to this, but just how long have you guys been working on GPT-5?\n\nNick Turley (00:08:51):\nWe've been working on it for a while. You can view GPT-5 as a culmination of a bunch of different efforts. We had a reasoning tech, we had a more classic post-screening methodologies, and therefore, it's really hard to put a beginning on it, but it really is the end point of a bunch of different techniques that we began for a while.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:14):\nCan you give us a peek into the vision for where ChatGPT is going, GPT in general is going? If you look at on the surface, it's been the same idea with a much smarter brain for a long time. I'm curious where this goes long-term.\n\nNick Turley (00:09:28):\nSo, to maybe back up a bit, now, you think of ChatGPT as, \"Is this going to be ubiquitous product?\" Again, about 10% of the world population uses every week.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:37):\nHoly shit.\n\nNick Turley (00:09:39):\nI think we have 5 million business customers now. It's an established category in its own right. But really, when we started, we set out to build a super assistant, that's how we talked about it at the time. In fact, the code base that we use is called SA Server. It was supposed to be a hackathon code base, but things always turn out a little bit differently. So, yeah, in some ways, that is still the vision. The reason I don't talk about it more than I do is because I think assistant is a bit limiting in terms of the mental model we're trying to create. You think of this very personified human thing, maybe utilitarian, maybe a... And frankly, having an assistant is not particularly relatable to most people, unless they're in Silicon Valley and they're a manager, or something like that. So it's imperfect.\n\n(00:10:24):\nBut really, what we envision is this entity that can help you with any task, whether or not that's at home, or at work, or at school, really any context, and it's an entity that knows what you're trying to achieve. So, unlike ChatGPT today, you don't have to describe your problem in menu to detail because it already stands your overarching goals and has context on your life, et cetera. So, that's one thing that we're really excited about. The inverse of giving it more inputs on your life is giving it more action space. So, we're really excited to allow it to do, over time, what a smart, empathetic human with a computer could do for you. And I think the limit of the types of problems that you can solve for people, once you give it access to tools like that, is very, very different than what you might be able to do in a chatbot today. So, that's more outputs.\n\n(00:11:19):\nAnd I often think, \"Okay, I'm a general intelligence. What happened if I became Lenny's intern, or something?\" And I wouldn't be particularly effective despite having both of those attributes that I just mentioned, and it's because I think this idea of building a relationship with this technology is also incredibly important. So, that's maybe the third piece that I'm excited about is building a product that can truly get to know you over time. And you saw us launch some of those things with improved memory earlier this year, and that's just the beginning of what we're hoping to do so that it really feels like this is your AI. So, I don't know if supersystem is still the right exact analogy, but I think people just think of it as their AI. And I think we can put one in everyone's pocket and help them solve real problems, whether or not that's becoming healthy, whether or not that's starting a business, whether or not that's just having a second opinion on anything. There's so many different problems that you can help with people in their daily life, and that's what motivates me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):\nSo an interesting between the lines that I'm reading here is the vision is for it to be an assistant for people not to replace people. It feels like a really important piece of the puzzle. Maybe just talk about that.\n\nNick Turley (00:12:29):\nAI is really scary to people, and I understand there's decades of movies on AI that have a certain mental model baked in. And even if you just look at the technology today, everyone, I think, has this moment where the AI does something that was really deeply personal to them and you're thought, \"Hey, AI can never do that.\" For me, it was weird music theory things where I was like, \"Wow, this thing actually understands music better than I do,\" and that's something I'm passionate about. And so it's naturally scary. And I think the thing that's been really important to us for a long time is to build something that feels like it's helpful to you, but you're in the driver's seat, and that's even more important as the stuff becomes agentic, the feeling of being in control, and that can be small things.\n\n(00:13:15):\nWe built this way of watching what the AI is doing when it's in agent mode. And it's not that you actually are going to watch it the whole time, but it gives you a mental model and makes you feel in control in the same way that, when you're in a Waymo, you get that screen, for those of you who've tried Waymo. You can see the other cars. It's not like you're going to actually watch, but it gives you the sense that you know how this thing works and what's happening, or we always check with you to confirm things. It's a little bit annoying, but it puts you in the driver's seat, which is important. And for that reason, we always view technology and the technology that we build as something that amplifies what you're capable of, rather than replacing it, and that becomes important as the deck gets more powerful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:53):\nOkay. So you mentioned the beginnings of ChatGPT. I was reading in a different interview. So you joined OpenAI. ChatGPT was just this internal experimental project that was basically a way to test GPT-3.5, and then Sam Altman is just like, \"Hey, let me tweet about it, maybe see if people find this interesting,\" yada yada, yada. It's the most successful consumer product in history, I think both in growth rate in users and revenue, and just absurd. Can you give us a glimpse into that early period before it became something everyone is obsessed with?\n\nNick Turley (00:14:24):\nYeah. So we had decided that we wanted to do something consumer-facing, I think, right around the time that GPT-4 finished training, and it was actually mainly for a couple of reasons. We already had a product out there, which was our developer product. That's actually what I came in to help with initially, and that has been amazing for the mission. In fact, it's grown up. And now, it's the OpenAI platform with, I don't know, 4 million developers, I think. But at that time, it was early stage, and we were running into some constraints with it because there was two problems. One, you couldn't iterate very quickly because, every time you would change the model, you'd break everyone's app. So, it was really hard to try things.\n\n(00:15:03):\nAnd then the other thing was that it was really hard to learn because the feedback we would get was the feedback from the end user to the developer to us. So it was very disintermediated, and we were excited to make fast progress towards AGI and it just felt like we needed a more direct relationship with consumers. So we were trying to figure out where to start. And in classic OpenAI fashion, especially back then, we put together a hackathon of enthusiasts of just hacking on GPT-4 to see what awesome stuff we could create and maybe ship to users, and everyone's idea was some flavor of a super assistant. They were more specific ideas, like we had a meeting bot that would call into meetings, and the vision was maybe it would help you run the meeting over time. We had a coding tool, which full circle now, probably ahead of its time. And the challenge was that we tested those things, but every time we tested these more bespoke ideas, people wanted to use it for all this other stuff because it's just a very, very generically powerful technology.\n\n(00:16:04):\nSo, after a couple of months of prototyping, we took that same crew of volunteers, and it was truly a volunteer group, right? We had someone from the supercomputing team who had built an iOS app before. We had someone on the research team who had written some backend code in their life. They were all part of this initial ChatGPT team, and we decided to ship something open-ended because we just wanted a real use case distribution. And this is a pattern with AI, I think, where you really have to ship to understand what is even possible and what people want, rather than being able to reason about that a priori. So, ChatGPT came together at the end because we just wanted the learnings as soon as we could, and we shipped it right before the holiday thinking we would come back and get the data and then wind it down. And obviously, that part turned out super differently because people really liked the product as is.\n\n(00:16:56):\nSo I remember going through the motions of like, \"Oh, man, dashboard is broken. Oh, wait, people are liking it. I'm sure it's just going viral and stuff is going to die down,\" to like, \"Oh, wow, people are retaining, but I don't understand why.\" And then eventually, we fell into product development mode, but it was a little bit by accident.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:14):\nWow. I did not know that ChatGPT emerged out of a hackathon project. Definitely the most successful hackathon project.\n\nNick Turley (00:17:21):\nI like to tell this story when we do our hackathons because I really do want people to feel like they can ship their idea, and it's certainly been true in the past, and we'll continue to make it true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:32):\nIf you don't want to share these things, but I wonder who that team was.\n\nNick Turley (00:17:34):\nThe team is largely still around. Some of the researchers working on GPT-5, actually, were always part of the ChatGPT team. Engineers are still around. Designers are still around. I'm still here, I guess. So, yeah, you've got the team still running things, but obviously, we've grown up tremendously, and we've had to because with scale comes responsibility. And we're going to hit a billion users soon and you have to begin acting in a way that is appropriate to that scale.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:06):\nOkay. So let me spend a little time there. So, I don't know if this is 100% true, but I believe it is that ChatGPT is the fastest growing, most successful consumer product in history. Also, the most impactful on people's lives. It feels like it's just part of the ether of society now. It's just my wife talks to it. Every question I have, I go to it, voice mode. My wife is just like, \"Let me check with ChatGPT.\" It's just such a part of our life now, and I think it's still early. So many people don't even know what the hell is going on. Just as someone leading this, do you ever just take a moment to reflect and think about just like, \"Holy shit\"?\n\nNick Turley (00:18:45):\nI have to. It's quite humbling to get to run a product like that, and I have to pinch myself very frequently, and I also have to sometimes sit back and just think, which is really hard when things are moving so quickly. I love setting a fast pace at the company, but in order to do that with confidence, I need at least one day every week that I'm entirely unplugged and I'm just thinking about what to do and process the week, et cetera.\n\n(00:19:14):\nAnd the other thing is I've never ever worked on a product that is so empirical in its nature where, if you don't stop, and watch, and listen to what people are doing, you're going to miss so much, both on the utility and on the risks, actually. Because normally, by the time you ship a product, you know what it's going to do. You don't know if people are going to like it, that's always empirical, but you know what it can do. And with AI, because I think so much of it is emergent, you actually really need to stop and listen after you launch something and then iterate on the things people are trying to do and on the things that aren't quite working yet. So, for that reason alone, I think it's very important to take a break and just watch what's going on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:03):\nOkay. So you take a day off every week... not off. Okay, that's not the right way to put it. You take a day of thinking time, deep work.\n\nNick Turley (00:20:12):\nI need it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I need to hard unplug on a Saturday, or something like that. Obviously-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):\nOn a Saturday [inaudible 00:20:16].\n\nNick Turley (00:20:16):\nBut it's just not possible otherwise. This has been a giant marathon for three years now. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):\nLike a sprint marathon.\n\nNick Turley (00:20:26):\nSprint marathon, that's right, or interval training, or something. I don't know how to exactly describe the OpenAI launch cadence, but you've got to set yourself up in a way that is sustainable. Even if this wasn't AI and it didn't have the interesting attributes that I just mentioned, I think you would need to do that. But especially with AI, it's important to go watch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:45):\nSo, along those lines, I talked to a bunch of people that work with you, that work at OpenAI. Joanne specifically said that urgency and pace are a big part of how you operate, that that's just something you find really important, to create urgency within the team constantly, even when you are the fastest growing product in history, growing like crazy. Talk about just your philosophy on the importance of pace and urgency on teams.\n\nNick Turley (00:21:08):\nWell, it's nice of her to say that. Two things, with ChatGPT, when we decided to do it, we had been prototyping for so long and I was just like, \"In 10 days, we're going to ship this thing,\" and we did. So, that was maybe a moment in time thing where I just really wanted to make sure that we go learn something. Ever since then, I spent so much time thinking about why ChatGPT became successful in the first place, and I think there was some element of just doing things where there was many other companies that had technology in the LLM space that just never got shipped. And I just felt like, of all the things we could optimize for, learning as fast as possible is incredibly important. So I just started rallying people around that, and that took different forms.\n\n(00:21:55):\nFor a while, when we were of that size, I just ran this daily release sync and had everyone who was required to make a decision in it, and we would just talk about what to do and to pivot from yesterday, et cetera. Obviously, at some point, that doesn't scale, but I always felt like part of my role here, obviously, was to think about the direction of the product, but also to just set the pace and the resting heartbeat for our teams. And again, this is important anywhere, but it's especially important when the only way to find out what people like and what's valuable is to bring it into the external world. So, for that reason, I think it's become a superpower of OpenAI, and I'm glad that Joanne thinks that I had some part in that, but it really has taken a village.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):\nI love this phrase, \"the resting heart rate of your team\". That's such a perfect metaphor of just the pace of being equivalent to your resting heart rate.\n\nNick Turley (00:22:46):\nI actually learned that at Instacart, when I showed up there, because we were in the pandemic and it was all hands on deck. For a while, there was this... I think there was a company-wide stand-up because we disbanded all teams. We were just trying to keep the site up. And for me, I had been used to taking my sweet time and just thinking really hard about things, and that's important, but I really learned to hustle over there, and I think that's come in handy at OpenAI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:12):\nOkay. So, along these same lines, I asked Kevin Weil, your CPO, what to ask you, and he said to ask you about this principle of, \"Is it maximally accelerated?\" Talk about that.\n\nNick Turley (00:23:22):\nThat's funny, we have a Slack emoji, apparently, for this now because I used to say that. Now, I try to paraphrase. Sometimes, I just really want to jump to the punchline of like, \"Okay, why can't we do this now?\" or, \"Why can't we do it tomorrow?\" And I think that it's a good way to cut through a huge number of blockers with the team and just instill... especially if you come from a larger company. At some point, we started hiring people from larger tech companies. I think they're used to, \"Let's check in on this in a week,\" or, \"Let's circle back next quarter to see if we can go on the plan.\" And I just, as a-\n\nNick Turley (00:24:00):\n... on the plan and I just kind of as a thought exercise, always like people asking, \"Okay, if this was the most important thing and you wanted to truly maximally accelerate it, what would you do?\" That doesn't mean that you go do that, but it's really a good forcing function for understanding what's critical path versus what can happen later. And I've just always felt like execution is incredibly important. These ideas, they're everywhere. Everyone's talking about a personal AI, you might've seen news on that and I really think that execution is one of the most important things in the space and this is a tool. So, it's funny that that became a meme. It's like a little pink Slack emoji that people just put on whatever they're trying to force the question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:45):\nI was going to ask, what theme [inaudible 00:24:47]. So, it's a little pink, is there something in there like-\n\nNick Turley (00:24:48):\nIt's a Comic Sans emoji that says, is this maximally accelerated?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:53):\nOkay. And so, the kind of the culture there is when someone is working on something, the push is, is this maximally accelerated? Is there a way we can do this faster? Is there anything we can unblock?\n\nNick Turley (00:25:02):\nYeah. And we use that sparingly, right? Because it needs to be appropriate to the context. There's some things where you don't want to accelerate as quickly as possible because you kind of want process. And we're very, very deliberate on that where your process is a tool. And one of the areas where we have an immense amount of process is safety. Because A, the stakes are already really high, especially with these models, GPT-5 which is a frontier in so many different ways. But B, if you believe in the exponential, which I do and most people who work on this stuff do, you have to play practice for a time where you really, really need the process for sure, sure, sure. And that's why I think it's been really important to separate out the product development velocity, which has to be super high from, for things like frontier models, there actually needs to be a rigorous process where you red team, you work on the system card, you get external input, and then you put things out with confidence that it's gone through the right safeguards.\n\n(00:26:02):\nSo, again, it's a nuanced concept, but I found it very, very useful when we needed and for everything product development, you're a dead on arrival, so it's important to get stuff out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):\nWe got to open source those memes so that other teams can build on this approach.\n\nNick Turley (00:26:16):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:17):\nSo, interestingly with ChatGPT, and it's not a surprise, but not only is it the fastest-growing, most successful consumer product ever, retention is also incredibly high. People have shared these stats that one month retention is something like 90%, six month retention is something like 80%. First of all, are these numbers accurate? What can you share there?\n\nNick Turley (00:26:39):\nI'm obviously limited on what exactly I can share, but it is true that our retention numbers are really exciting and that is actually the thing we look at. We don't care at all how much time you spend in the product. In fact, our incentive is just to solve your problem and if you really like the product, you'll subscribe, but there's no incentive to keep you in the product for long. But we are obviously really, really happy if over the long run, three month period, et cetera, you're still using this thing. And for me, this was always the elephant in the room early on. It's like, \"Hey, this may be a really cool product, but is this really the type of thing that you come back to?\" And it's been incredible to not just see strong retention numbers, but just see an improvement in retention over time even as our cohorts become less of an early adopter and more the average person, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:29):\nYeah. So, that note is something that I don't think people truly understand how rare this is when a product... The cohort of users comes, tries it out and then retention over time goes down and then it comes back up, people come back to it a few months later and use it more. It's called a smiling curve, a smile curve, and that's extremely rare.\n\nNick Turley (00:27:48):\nYeah, yeah. Yeah. There's some smiling going on that's just on the team and I feel like have technology, some of it is not the product. I think people are actually just getting used to this technology in a really interesting way, where I find, and this is why the product needs to evolve too, that this idea of delegating to an AI, it's not natural to most people. It's not like you're going through life and figuring out what can I delegate? Certain sphere of Silicon Valley does that because they're in a self-optimization mode and they're trying to delegate everything they can. But I think for most people in the world it's actually quite unnatural. And you really have to learn, \"Okay, what are my goals actually and what could another intelligence help me with?\"\n\n(00:28:26):\nAnd I think that just takes time and people do figure it out once they've had enough time with the product. But then of course there's been tons of things that we've done in the product too, whether or not it's making the core models better, whether or not it's new capabilities like search and personalization and all that kind of stuff, or just standard growth work too, which we're starting to do. That stuff matters too, of course.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):\nSo, you might be answering this question already, but let me just ask it directly. People may look at this and be like, \"Okay, they're building this kind of layer on top of this God-like intelligence. Of course it will grow incredibly fast and retention will be incredible. What do you guys actually doing that sits on top of the model that makes it grow so fast and retain so much?\" Is there something that has worked incredibly well that has moved metrics significantly that you can share?\n\nNick Turley (00:29:18):\nOne thing we've learned, I'll answer that question in a minute, but one thing we've learned with ChatGPT is that there really is no distinction between the model and the product. The model is the product and therefore you need to iterate on it like a product. And by that I mean obviously you typically start by shipping something very open-ended, at least if you're OpenAI [inaudible 00:29:38] that's kind of a playbook. But then you really have to look at what are people trying to do? Okay, they're trying to write, they're trying to code, they're trying to get advice, they're trying to get recommendations and you need to systematically improve on those use cases. And that is pretty similar to product development work. Obviously the methodology is a bit different, but discovery is the same. You got to talk to people, you got to do data science and you got to try stuff and get feedback.\n\n(00:30:04):\nSo, that's one chunk of work that we've been very consciously doing is improving the model on the use cases people care about. And there's also such thing as vibes because I'm sure you know and that's one of the things that I'm excited about in GPT-5 is that the vibes are really good. So, that too is, we have a model behavior team and they really focus on what is the personality of this model and how does it speak and talk. So, there's that kind of work. I would say that's maybe a third of the retention improvements that we see or so just roughly. And then I think another third is what I would call product research capabilities. They're research driven for sure. They have a research component, but they're really new product features or capabilities. And search is one example of that where if you remember in the olden days, maybe 20 months ago or something, you would talk to ChatGPT and it'd be like, \"As of my knowledge cut off...\" Or, \"I can't answer that because that happened to recently,\" or something like that.\n\n(00:31:00):\nAnd that is the type of capability that has been incredibly retentive and for good reason. It just allows you to do more with the product personalization, like this idea of advanced memory where it can really get to know you over time is another example of a capability like that. I think that's another good chunk. And then the third stuff is the stuff you would do in any product and those things exist too. Not having to log in was a huge hit because it removed a ton of the friction. I think we had this intuition from the beginning, but we never got to it because we didn't have enough GPU or other constraint to really go do that. So, there's the traditional product work too. So, I often think about it as roughly a third, a third, a third, but really we're still learning and we're planning to evolve the product a ton, which is why I'm sure there's going to be new levers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:52):\nYou mentioned something that I want to come back to real quick. You said that it was something like 10 days from Hackathon to Sam tweeting about ChatGPT being live?\n\nNick Turley (00:32:01):\nThe Hackathon happened much earlier and we were prototyping for a long time, but at some point we basically ran out of patience on trying to build something more bespoke. And again, that was mostly because people always wanted to do all this other stuff whenever we tested it. So, it was 10 days from when we decided we were going to ship to when we shipped. And the research we'd been testing for a long time, it was kind of an evolution of what we'd called instruction following, which was the idea that instead of just completing the sentence, these models could actually follow you instructions. So, if you said summarize this, it would actually do so. And the research had evolved from that into a chat format where we could do it multi-turn. So, that research took way longer than 10 days and that kind of baking in the background, but the productization of this thing was very, very fast and lots of things didn't make it in.\n\n(00:32:50):\nI remember we didn't have history, which of course was the first user feedback we got. The model had a bunch of shortcomings and it was so cool to be able to iterate on the model. The thing I just talked about, treating the model as a product was not a thing before ChatGPT because we would ship in more hardware where there'd be a release GPT-3 and then we would start working on GPT-4 and these weird giant big spend R&D projects that would take a really long time and the spec was whatever the spec was and then you'd have to wait another year. And ChatGPT really broke that down because we were able to make iterative improvements to it just like software. And really, my dream is that it would be amazing if we could just ship daily or even hourly like in software land because you could just fix stuff, et cetera. But there's of course all kinds of challenges in how you do that while keeping the personality intact while not regressing other capabilities. So, it's an open field to get there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):\nThat's such a good example of is it maximally accelerated? Okay, we're going to ship ChatGPT 10 days.\n\nNick Turley (00:33:48):\n[inaudible 00:33:48]-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:48):\nHoly moly. We've been talking about ChatGPT. Clearly it's kind of a chat interface. Everyone's always wondering is chat the future of all of this stuff? Interestingly, Kevin Weil made this really profound point that has always stuck with me when he was on the podcast that chat is actually a genius interface for building on a super intelligence because it's how we interact with humans of all variety of intelligence. It scales from someone at the lower end to a super smart person. And so, it's really valuable as a way to scale this spectrum. Maybe just talk about that and is chat the long-term interface for ChatGPT, I guess it's called ChatGPT.\n\nNick Turley (00:34:27):\nI feel like we should either drop the chat or drop the GPT at some point because it is a mouthful. We're stuck with the name, but no matter what we do, the product will evolve. I think that I agree that there's something profound about natural language. It just really is the most natural form of communicating to humans and therefore it feels important that you should be communicating with your software in natural language. I think that's different from chat though. I think chat was the simplest way to ship at the time. I'm baffled by how much it took off as a concept. Even more baffled by how many people have copied the paradigm rather than trying out a different way of interacting with AI. I'm still hoping that will happen. So, I think natural language is here to stay, but this idea that it has to be a turn-by-turn chat interaction I think is really limiting.\n\n(00:35:24):\nAnd this is one of the reasons I don't love the super system analogy, even though we used to always use it is because if you think that way, then you kind of feel like you're talking to a person and GPT-5 it's amazing at making great front-end applications. So, I don't see a reason why you wouldn't have AIs that can render their own UI in some way. And you obviously want to make that predictable and feel good. But it feels limiting to me to think of the end-all-be-all interface as a chatbot. It actually kind of feels dystopian almost where I don't want to use all my software through the proxy of some interface. I love being in Figma, I love being in Google Docs. Those are all great products to me and they're not chatbots.\n\n(00:36:07):\nSo, yes on natural language, but no on chat is where I would describe my point of view. And I'm just hoping in general that we see more consumer innovation on how people interact with AI because there's so many possibilities and you just got to try stuff. That's why chat stuck is we just did it and people liked it. So, I'm hoping that we see more there and we'll try to do our part.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:31):\nSo, you mentioned that you kind of got stuck with this name ChatGPT. Maybe this is part of the answer, but I'm curious just are there any accidental decisions you guys made early on that have stuck and have essentially become history changing?\n\nNick Turley (00:36:45):\nThere's so many and it is funny, because you have no time to think about them and then they end up being super consequential. The day was one, we went from chat with GPT-3.5 to ChatGPT the night before, slightly better but still really bad.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:58):\nWhat was it called before?\n\nNick Turley (00:36:59):\nIt was going to be Chat with GPT-3.5 because we really didn't think it was going to be successful product. We were trying to actually be as nerdy as we could about it because that's really what it was. It was a research demo, not a product. So, we didn't think that was bad. But I think that in the original release, making it free was a big deal. I don't think we appreciate that because the GPT-3.5 model was in our API for at least six months prior to that. I think anyone could have built something like this. It might not have been quite as good on the modeling side, but I think it would've taken off. So, making it free and putting a nice UI on it, very consequential in the way that you take for granted now. And this is why I think that A, distribution and the interface are continuously important even in 2025.\n\n(00:37:48):\nThe paid business, which now it's a giant business both in the consumer space and in the enterprise space. The birth of that was just to turn away demand originally. It was not like we brainstormed, \"Oh, what is the best monetization model for AI?\" It was really what monetization model or what mechanism would allow us to turn away people who are less serious than the people who are really trying to use it? And subscriptions just happened to have that property and it grew into a large business. I think shipping really funky capabilities before they were polished is another thing where that feels like a tactical decision, but it became a playbook because we would learn so much. Remember when we shipped Code Interpreter, we learned so much after we shipped it. Now it's known as I think data analysis in ChatGPT or something like that just because we actually got real world use cases back that we could then optimize. So, I think there's been a lot of decisions over time that proved pretty consequential, but we made them very, very quickly as we have to, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):\nThe $20 a month feels like an important part of this. Feels like everybody's just doing that now and-\n\nNick Turley (00:38:57):\nOn that one actually, I remember I had this kind of panic attack because we really needed to launch subscriptions because at the time we were taking the product down every time. It was, I don't know if you remember, we had this fail whale, there's a little [inaudible 00:39:09] generated poem on it. So, they were like, \"We had to get this out.\" And I remember calling up someone I greatly respect who's incredible at pricing and I was like, \"What should I do?\" And we talked a bunch and I just ran out of time to incorporate most of that feedback. So, what I did do is ship a Google Form to Discord with, I think the four questions you're supposed to ask on how to price something-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:32):\n[inaudible 00:39:32]?\n\nNick Turley (00:39:33):\nYeah, exactly. It literally had those four questions and I remember distinctly A, you [inaudible 00:39:38] a price back and that's kind of how we got to $20. But B, the next morning, there was a press article on you won't believe the four genius questions the ChatGPT team asked to price their... It was like if only you knew. So, there's something about building in this extreme public where people interpret so much more intentionality into what you're doing than might've actually existed at the time. But we got with the $20. We're debating something slightly higher at the time. I often wonder what would've happened because so many other companies ended up copying the $20 price point. So, I'm like, \"Did we erase a bunch of market cap by pressing it this way?\" But ultimately I don't care because the more accessible we can make this stuff, the better. And I think this is the price point that in Western countries has been reasonable to a lot of people in terms of the value that they get back.\n\n(00:40:27):\nAnd most importantly, we were able to push things down to the free tier semi-regularly and we always do that when we can [inaudible 00:40:35], but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:35):\nSo, the survey, just to give the official name, the Van Westendorp survey is how you guys ended up pricing ChatGPT?\n\nNick Turley (00:40:42):\nIt was the top Google result. This was before ChatGPT has real-time information. Otherwise, it could have maybe price itself, but it was Discord plus Google Form plus a blog post on that methodology that got us there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:54):\nThat is incredible. What a fun story. This is the survey that Rahul Vohra at Superhuman popularized in his first- round article-\n\nNick Turley (00:41:00):\nYeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. Definitely don't bring me on here as a pricing expert, I think you have got better people for that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:08):\nWhether it was right or wrong, it is now the fastest-growing, insane revenue generating business in the world. So, I wouldn't feel too bad.\n\nNick Turley (00:41:16):\nNo, it worked out. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):\nIt worked out. And by the way, I'm on the $200 a month tier, so there's clearly a room-\n\nNick Turley (00:41:22):\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:25):\n... [inaudible 00:41:25]-\n\nNick Turley (00:41:25):\nThe story of that one is interesting too because originally the purpose of the Plus plan was to be able to ship first uptime and then be able to ship capabilities that we couldn't scale to everyone. And at some point it got so many people in the Plus tier that had just lost that property. So, the main reason we came up with the $200 tier is just we had so much incredible research that's actually really, really powerful. Like o3 Pro or tomorrow GPT-5 Pro and just having a vehicle of shipping that to people who really, really care is exciting even though it kind of violates the standard way a SaaS page should look, it's a little jarring to see the 10X jump. So, thank you for being a subscriber on that and thank you everyone else who's watching you subscribed to any tier, it's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):\nI'm just going to throw a fishing line into this pond of are there any other stories like this? You shared this incredible story of Chat with GPT-3.5 being the original name, how you came up with pricing. Is there anything else?\n\nNick Turley (00:42:22):\nEnterprise is interesting one too because we've seen so much incredible adoption in the Enterprise and it's sort of objectively crazy to try to take on building a developer business and a consumer business and an enterprise business and all at once. But the story there is in like month one or two, it was very clear that most of the usage was work usage, actually much more than today where you've got so many consumers on the product and it's kind of sort of transcended into pop culture. But at the time it was writing, coding, analysis, that kind of stuff. And we were pretty quickly in organically in 90% of Fortune 500 companies in a way that I had seen maybe at Dropbox back when that was my two jobs ago where we had a similar story. And since then there's been more PLG companies. But the real reason we did Enterprise, remember we were debating should we do enterprise or should we launch an iOS app because that's how small the team was.\n\n(00:43:22):\nThe reason we did is we were starting to get banned in companies because they all felt rightfully or wrongfully that the privacy and deployment story, et cetera wasn't there. So, I was just like, \"Man, we have to do something. We're going to miss out on a generational opportunity to build a work product.\" And we've literally defined AGI as outperforming most humans at economically valuable work or I'd probably [inaudible 00:43:45] that, but I think that's the way we put it. And so, I feel like we had to be present there and it was a fairly quick decision at the time, but it's grown into an immense business. We just hit 5 million business subscribers up from 3 million, I think a month or two ago. So, it is kind of the spinoff that it's taking a life of its own that I'm really, really excited about for [inaudible 00:44:11]-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:11):\nThat is a lot to be handling the platform essentially the API, the consumer product, the fastest-growing, most successful product in history and also the B2B side, which is clearly a massive business. Do you have any kind of heuristics for how to make these trade-offs do all this at once and stay sane and be successful?\n\nNick Turley (00:44:30):\nThat's a good question. And first off, I don't run the developer stuff anymore. We found someone way more competent to do that and he's amazing. So, I still look after the various forms of chat, but luckily you don't have to make that trade-off OpenAI does. And I can get into that too, but it keeps me a little bit more sane. I will say that you kind of have to practice in two different ways when you're building on this AI stuff. One is sort of working backwards from the model capabilities and that is much more art than science, where I think you really need to look at what tech do we have available and what is the most awesome way to productize it? And if you applied to some sort of PM framework to that, I think you would do something horrible wrong. Because if you have tech that's, for example, GPT-5 is really, really good at front-end coding now, I think that means you've got to reprioritize it.\n\n(00:45:27):\nYou got to actually bring that capability to life. Maybe that's making ChatGPT better at vibe coding and rendering applications. Maybe that's more like leveraging the taste of the model to make the UI more expressive. There's a number of things we could do, but you kind of have to replan and reprioritize and that is more important than any particular audience segmentation. It's really just looking at what is the magic thing we have and how do you make it shine. Voice is a similar thing. It wasn't like our customers need voice, they're begging for it or something like that. It was like, \"Wow, we figured out a way how to make these things anything in, anything out.\" What is a creative awesome way to productize that and then we can see what people do. So, I think that's one chunk of it. But then the other chunk of it really is more like classic product management where you need to listen to customers and then when your customers are really different, that can be confusing because ChatGPT is a very general purpose product.\n\n(00:46:23):\nWe see when you look at end users, there's actually an immense amount of overlap in terms of what they want. Primitives like projects or history search or sharing and collaboration, all those kinds of things. They are actually very, very present. Whether or not you're talking to people at work or you're talking to people at home, at school, there's slightly different mechanics sometimes, but they're largely similar investments that I think we can get a lot of mileage out of. And then there's Enterprise-specific work that we just have to do. You've got to do HIPAA, you got to do SOC 2, you've got to do all those things if you want to be a serious player. And those are just non-negotiable. So, it's complex as you correctly identified, but it's kind of the curse of working on a very open-ended and powerful technology.\n\n(00:47:11):\nOne analogy that someone at OpenAI who I really respect, he's like, \"We're kind of like Disney, where Disney has this one kind of creative IP, which is their content, and they have cruises and they have theme parks and they have comics and they have all these different things.\" And I think we have amazing models, but there's all these different ways that you can productize them and we kind of just have to maximize the impact in all these different ways.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:38):\nAs you were talking, I was thinking about how usually horizontal platforms that are just so general and can do so much take a long time to take off because people don't know what to do with them. They're not amazing at anything. And this is an amazing counter example where it took off immediately and everyone figured it out and then over time they figured it out more and more.\n\nNick Turley (00:47:54):\nBut I think the reason why is because it just went live. Talk about another consequential decision actually. We were debating waitlist, no waitlist because we-\n\nNick Turley (00:48:00):\nActually we were debating waitlist/no waitlist because we really knew we couldn't scale the engineering systems. And the fact that there was no waitlist, which no open AI release had worked like that before, ended up being consequential because you were able to watch what everyone else was doing live. So I think when you launch these things all at once for everyone, there really is a special moment where you can see what other people are doing and learn from that.\n\n(00:48:25):\nAnd a lot of that is actually out of product. There's these crazy TikTok posts that go viral and they have like 2, 000 use cases in the comments. And I go through those in detail because it's not like I knew about those use cases either. They're very, very emergent and I just go through the comments and process because there's so much to learn. And for that reason, I think we get to skip the empty box problem a little bit because so much learning is happening out of product as people are watching each other either in IRL or online.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:55):\nThat is so interesting because you think about Airtable, you think about Notion, all these companies, they took years to just build and craft and think and go deep on what it could be.\n\nNick Turley (00:49:04):\nIt's like they compare Airtable, which they had to do templates, they had to do all these kind of things of taking the horizontal product and making it use case driven. They compare it to the Instant Pot, which there's recipes being shared everywhere online. There's this whole ecosystem around it. I think we were really lucky with ChatGPT that that happened where there's just users sharing use cases with other users everywhere. And therefore I think we got very lucky by jumping ahead on that journey.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:40):\nAnd it feels like a quarter there is Sam had big following and everyone would pay attention to something you launch. So that's a really interesting new strategy for launching horizontal product. With a huge distribution channel, just launch it and see what comes up.\n\nNick Turley (00:49:51):\nYeah. And of course I'm actually really excited to take some of that into the product. I think we shouldn't rest on the fact that there's so much out product discovery happening. I actually think for the average consumer, it would be amazing if the product did a little bit more work on really exposing to you what is possible.\n\n(00:50:07):\nI still feel like ChatGPT feels a little bit like MS-DOS, like we haven't built Windows yet. And it'll be obvious once we do, but there's something that feels a little bit like... Imagine MS-DOS had gone viral and you were just trying to hack little conversation starters onto it. That might've missed sort of the big picture in terms of how to really communicate affordances and value to people. And so I think there's actually a ton more product work to do in addition to just seeing use cases spread.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:33):\nAre you able to share just what you think that might look like? This Windows version of ChatGPT?\n\nNick Turley (00:50:37):\nI'll let you know when we figure it out. We're hiring. I think there's so many interesting product problems here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:42):\nOkay, got it. By the way, I also love that TikTok was like your feedback channel.\n\nNick Turley (00:50:49):\nThose common threads, they're just so wild. And also the love that people have for it, the excitement with which you're sharing their product, I feel like it's special that people are so excited to share what they're doing with your product. And I don't take that for granted either.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:06):\nThis episode is brought to you by PostHog, the product platform your engineers actually want to use. PostHog has all the tools that founders, developers, and product teams need, like product analytics, web analytics, session replays, heat maps, experimentation, surveys, LLM observability, air tracking and more.\n\n(00:51:25):\nEverything PostHog offers comes with a generous free tier that resets every month.

I imagine the volume is very high. Do you have kind of a trick for figuring out, \"Oh, here's a new thing we should really think about?\"\n\nNick Turley (00:52:22):\nBefore I built the product team, I actually built the data science team because I was getting frustrated. I was talking to as many users as I could. And my calendar the weeks after ChatGPT, it was just 15 minute user interview the whole week through. It was usually I stopped doing interviews when I can predict what the next person's going to say. That's how I know I've talked to enough users, but it just wasn't happening. I just kept getting new stuff.\n\n(00:52:46):\nSo data is one way out where I think we have conversation classifiers that without us having to look at the conversations, allow us to figure out what are people talking about, what use cases are taking off, et cetera. And I think that's very, very helpful. The quality of the stuff is important for empathy. Even though you're never going to get a rap on all the use cases people have, I still spend a huge amount of my time doing that. And then yeah, things like those TikToks, collections of threads, I think they're really, really useful. It's just fun to watch people talk to each other about the various use cases that they have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:22):\nIs there kind of a new margin use case that you're excited about or is there a really unusual use of ChatGPT that you think about that'd be fun to share?\n\nNick Turley (00:53:30):\nI mentioned this earlier, but I had always conceptualized ChatGPT as a worky product, whether or not you're at home or you at work. I feel like getting help with your taxes is very similar to the types of things you do at work where planning a trip is actually very similar to planning an event for work. So I always felt like, \"Okay, this thing is going to kind of be a productivity tool.\"\n\n(00:53:51):\nAnd I think something has happened, I realized, a few months where that has begun to change and I really do think the fact that you have consumers turning to this thing for day-to-day advice, helping them have better relationships... People talk about how this thing saved their marriage is really exciting to me because they use it to process their own emotions, get feedback on their communication style. They just have a buddy to talk to about really difficult things. And that comes with a ton of responsibility and work that we have to do to make those things like life advice great, but it also is really, really important to me because you can't run away from those use cases. You have to run towards them and make them awesome. And that's part of what we're trying to do. So that emergent behavior is really, really cool.\n\n(00:54:41):\nAnd more broadly, I'm so excited about education. I'm so excited about health. I think it would really be a waste if we didn't take the opportunity of using ChatGPT to really, really help people. And I think we've just begun to scratch the surface on that. So there's many aspirational use cases that I want to make happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:05):\nAlong those lines, an interesting use case I've recently had, I feel like it's going to be really helpful for couples that are disagreeing about something when they need a third opinion. I just had this recently where my wife's like, \"You can't heat a whole thing that you're going to only eat part of in the microwave and then put it back in the fridge.\" It's like, \"What's the problem? I'll heat it up, I'll put it back in the fridge.\" And she's like, \"No, that's really dangerous.\" I'm like, \"Let's ask ChatGPT.\" And that fact that she so trusts ChatGPT now and relies on it throughout the day, it's such a valuable third independent party that we can go to.\n\nNick Turley (00:55:35):\nYeah, yeah, totally. And a lot of those micro-interactions talk about interesting product work, right? Those are micro-interactions that are important. Did it definitively weigh in or did it help you guys think through that disagreement and solve it on your own? I think those details actually matter a lot and it's where we're spending a bunch of time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:54):\nAlong those lines, there was this whole launch of the very sycophantic version of ChatGPT where it was just, \" You are the best person in the world. Everything you tell me is amazingly correct.\" Are you able to tell us just what happened there?\n\nNick Turley (00:56:08):\nYeah, we have all kinds of collateral online because we really felt like we should over-communicate on how we discovered it, what we did about it, et cetera. So I encourage people to check that out. We have a whole retro on that model release.\n\n(00:56:24):\nBut basically what happened is that we pushed out an update that made the model more likely to tell you things that sound good in the moment, \"You're totally right. You should break up with your boyfriend\" or something like that. That's just really dangerous. We took it more seriously than you even might expect because again, at current technology levels, you can kind of laugh about it. Maybe it's like, \"Ha-ha. This thing's always complimenting me. I thought it was just me. I saw all those comments online.\" But it actually is really important to make sure that these models are optimized for the right things.\n\n(00:57:01):\nAnd we have an immense, I think, luxury to have a mission that affords us to really help people, a business model that does not incentivize maximizing engagement or time spent in the product, right? So it's really important to us that you feel like this product is helping you with your goals, whether not that's your current goals or even your long-term goals.\n\n(00:57:25):\nAnd oftentimes being extremely complimentary with the user isn't actually in service of that. So we instilled new measurement techniques. Whenever we put these models in contact with reality and we learn about a problem, we actually go back and make sure we have good metrics for this stuff. So we measure sick efficiency now with every release to make sure we don't regress and actually improve on that metric. GPT-5 is an improvement, which is really exciting for me, but we have more work from there.\n\n(00:57:54):\nAnd more broadly, it caused us to articulate our point of view. I actually spent a bunch of time on a blog post that we just published on Monday on what we're optimizing ChatGPT for. And it really is to help you thrive and achieve your goals, not to keep you in the product. And so there was a bunch of good outcomes from that incident. It's a good example of how contact for reality is not just important for the use cases, but also for learning what to avoid because you would've never discovered this issue purely in a lab unless you actually heard from physicians.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:26):\nI am excited to read that blog post then. I was going to ask you this. Just like how you-\n\nNick Turley (00:58:29):\nYeah, have your feedback on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:31):\nYeah. I guess is there anything more there of just how you... Because this tension is so difficult, helping people feel supported, but not just letting them believe everything they want to believe. Is there anything more you can share there? Just trying to find that middle ground.\n\nNick Turley (00:58:43):\nIncentives are important. There is a famous saying, \"Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:48):\nCharlie Munger maybe?\n\nNick Turley (00:58:49):\nYeah, I think that's where it came from, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):\nYeah.\n\nNick Turley (00:58:52):\nYeah, I think that's very, very important. So I would take a good look at our mission, our business model, the type of product we're trying to build. And I really think that ChatGPT is a very special product because I think in vast majority of cases, it makes you leave it feeling better or not worse and feeling like you're achieving something you're trying to do. So I think that those incentives really matter because it helps you reason about, \"Okay, when there isn't behavior in the wild, that's not good. Was that a bug or was that by design? And with [inaudible 00:59:29] I can very much say that to us that's a bug.\n\n(00:59:31):\nAnd then on the forward-looking work, there's so many kind of challenging scenarios to get right. And you could easily run away from these use cases. Like you and your wife going to this thing for input on a relationship, a question or a dispute, you could very easily run away if you were totally risk avoidant and say, \" Sorry, I can't help you with that.\" I think that's what most tech companies do when they hit a certain scale, they run away from these use cases. And I think it's a lost opportunity to help people.\n\n(01:00:08):\nSo we want to run towards these use cases by making the model behavior really, really great. That can mean connecting you with external resources when you're struggling. That can mean not directly answering your question, but instead of giving you a helpful framework in the case of like, \"Should I break up with my boyfriend?\" ChatGPT should probably not answer that question for you, but it should help you think through that question in the way that a thoughtful companion would. So I think it's really important to do the work because I think the upside is immense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):\nThat is a really profound point you're making there, that if most companies, if their users want to ask them something risky like getting medical advice or, \"Should I break up with my partner?\" or, \"what should I do with this big problem I have?\"\n\nNick Turley (01:00:51):\nI feel like we would have immense regret if you had a model that was state-of-the-art on health bench, which is, GPT-5 is a state of the art on a bunch of these medical benchmarks, and you didn't use that to help people, you just disabled that use case because you wanted to avoid all possible downside. I think the duty is to make it awesome and to do the work, talk to experts, figure out how good it really is, where it breaks down, communicate that. And I think this technology is too important and has too much potential positive impact on people to run away from these high stakes excuses.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:27):\nAnd fast-forward to today, it's saving lives regularly. It's probably saving relationships regularly. Such a consequential decision, which I imagine was made early on.\n\nNick Turley (01:01:36):\nYeah. We're just at the beginning of watching how this stuff can transform people. It's incredibly democratizing. If you compare, you roll out of this with the roll out of the personal computer, computers were so scarce when they first came out. And this stuff is ubiquitous in a way where you have access to a second opinion on medical stuff, you have access to a relationship buddy, you have access to a personal tutor on literally any topic that makes you curious. It's really, really special that we get to do that. Unique point in history.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:15):\nLet me zoom out a bit and talk about OpenAI and just product in general. So you've worked at traditional, let's say traditional product companies, Dropbox, Instacart. Now you're at OpenAI. What's maybe the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned by building products from your time at OpenAI?\n\nNick Turley (01:02:33):\nEach time I always tried to pick the maximally different job whenever I made a job change. So after Dropbox, I was craving a real world product because it was just so different than working on SaaS, et cetera. And after Instacart, I was craving on working on something that intellectually was interesting and had this kind of invoked the nerd in me. And so I've always looked for things that are really different.\n\n(01:02:59):\nAnd then once I showed up at these places, I tried to understand what makes that place successful, what is truly the thing that they cracked and how we can lean in that into that even more.\n\n(01:03:11):\nI think I spent a lot of time thinking about this with OpenAI, especially after ChatGPT. Before that it was kind of a moot point because we didn't really have much revenue or products or anything like that. There's a few things that come to mind that have driven many decisions. One is the empiricism. We talked about that a bit. The fact that you can only find out by shipping, which is why maximally lean into that. And that's a huge part of why we ship so much.\n\n(01:03:46):\nOne of them is that amazing ideas come from anywhere. The thing about running a research lab is you really don't tell people what to research. That's not what you do. And we inherited that culture even as we become a research and product company. So just letting people do things who have amazing ideas rather than being the gatekeeper or prioritizer of everything or something like that has been proven immensely valuable to us. And that's where much of the innovation comes from, is empowered smart people on any function really. So that was a good inheritance from what I think made OpenAI successful and makes us successful.\n\n(01:04:23):\nThe interdisciplinariness of really making sure that you put research and engineering and design and product together rather than treating them as silos. I think that's the thing that has made us successful and that you see come through in every product we ship. Like if we're shipping a feature and it doesn't get 2X better as the model gets 2X smarter, it's probably not a feature we should be shipping. Not always true. SOC 2 doesn't get better with [inaudible 01:04:48] models, but I think for many of the core capabilities, that's a good litmus test.\n\n(01:04:52):\nSo I've always found you really have to lean into why is this place successful and then maximally accelerate that, so to speak, because it's what allows you to turn something that feels like an accident into something that is a repeatable label.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:07):\nSo you talked about this kind of collaboration between researchers and product people. And you've been at the beginning of ChatGPT from day one to today, from zero to 700 million weekly active users. Not just registered users, weekly active users. How have you approached building out that team over time?\n\nNick Turley (01:05:24):\nOne of the other inheritances of being in a research lab is that you take recruiting really seriously. That's something that AI labs know every person matters. But many tech companies that go through hyper growth and they kind of lose their identity, they lose their talent bars, they just have chaos. So we've always had this tendency to run relatively lean.\n\n(01:05:51):\nSo it is a small team that is running ChatGPT. I take co inspiration from WhatsApp where it was a very small team running a very global-scale product. And then more importantly, you have to treat hiring a little bit more like executive recruiting and less like just pure pipeline recruiting where you really need to understand what is the gap you're trying to fill on each team, what is the specific skill set and how do you fill it.\n\n(01:06:17):\nTo give you an example, I'm a product person at heart, but sometimes a team doesn't need a product person because there's already someone doing that role. In many cases, we have a really talented engineering leader who has amazing product sense, or we have a researcher who has product ideas. And in my mind they can play that role. And maybe we have something else missing instead. Maybe we need a little bit more front-end or something like that.\n\n(01:06:41):\nIn other cases, maybe what you're missing is incredible data scientists. So I really like to go through every single team and figure out what is the skill sets that that team needs and how do you put it together from principles rather than just assuming, \"Hey, we're going to do a bunch of pipeline recruiting for all these different roles\" and then people will find a team later. So I think that's always felt really important to me. And it's the way that you keep your team really small, yet super high throughput.\n\n(01:07:08):\nIt also allows you to hire people who I think Keith Rabois calls us like barrels, I think. [inaudible 01:07:15] barrel's an ammunition where he thinks... I think this comes from him, but the idea being that sort of the throughput of your org depends on how many barrels you have, which is people who can make stuff happen. And then you can add ammunition around them, which is people helping those people. I think that's been really true for our recruiting too where we try to maximize the number of empowered people who can ship because that's how you have a small team and still get the ton done.\n\n(01:07:43):\nSo there's a couple of things, and I spent a lot of time on vibes too with each team because I think one of the things that is challenging when you try to do research and product together is that the cultures are different. People have different backgrounds. And I think to make that go super well, you need to spend time team building and making sure that people have a huge amount of trust for each other's skill sets, feel like they can think across their boundaries. I really believe that product is everyone's job, for example. And for that reason, the recruiting doesn't stop when the people are on the door. It actually starts because you have to start making the teams awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:24):\nIs there something you do with team building that would be fun to share? Just like something you do to create [inaudible 01:08:28]?\n\nNick Turley (01:08:28):\nI just love whiteboarding with teams. I just love getting into a generative mindset. It breaks down everything. So that's the thing that I try. It's not particularly creative, but I found it to be a universal tool where the minute you can get people to stop thinking about what's my job versus the other person's job and more like we're all in a room trying to crack something together, that is incredible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):\nYou mentioned this idea of first principles. This came up actually when I talk to a lot of people about you, is this something you're really big on. A lot of people talk about first principles, most people are like, \" I don't really understand,\" or they think they're amazing at thinking from first principles. Is there something you can share of just what it actually looks like to think from first principles as maybe an example that comes to mind where you really went to first principles and came up with something unexpected?\n\nNick Turley (01:09:15):\nYeah, this is not something I'd ever say about myself. It's nice that someone else would say it, but it's a mysterious thing. Yeah, I think you just really got to get to ground truth on what you're really trying to solve. For example, as I mentioned with the recruiting thing, I'm not dogmatic that you have to have a product manager and an engineering manager and a designer or whatever. We're just trying to make an awesome team that can ship. So in that case, first principles means just really understanding what we actually need and what we're missing rather than applying a previously learned process or behavior. So I think that's a good example.\n\n(01:09:54):\nAnother good example of I think being first principles in this environment is, does this feature need to be polished? We get a lot of crap for the model chooser, and I own it. I've tried to say that to everyone who will listen. For those who don't know model chooser, it's this giant drop down in the product that is literally the anti-pattern of any good product traditionally.\n\n(01:10:16):\nBut if you are actually recent from scratch, is it better to wait until you got a polished product or to ship out something raw even if it makes less sense and start learning and getting into people's hands? I think a company with a lot of process or a lot of just learned behaviors will make one call, which is, we have a quality bar when we ship, and that's what we do. If your first principle is about it, I think you're like, \"You know what? We should ship. It's embarrassing, but that's strictly less bad than not getting the feedback you wanted.\"\n\n(01:10:51):\nSo I think just approaching each scenario from scratch is so important in this space because there is no analogy for what we're building. You can't copy an existing thing. There is no, \"Are we an Instagram or are we a Google or a productivity tool or something like that?\" I don't know. But you can learn from everywhere, but you have to do it from scratch. And I think that's why that trait tends to make someone effective at OpenAI, and it's something we test for in our interviews too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):\nSo this theme keeps coming up, and I think it's just important to highlight something that you keep coming back to, which is this trade-off of speed and polish and how in this space, speed is more important, not just to stay ahead, but to learn what the hell people actually want to do with this thing. Is there anything more that you think people just may be missing about why they need to move so fast in the space of AI?\n\nNick Turley (01:11:46):\nYeah. I mean, the boring answer would be, oh, it's competitive and everyone's in AI and they're trying to compete each other. I think that's maybe true, but that's not the reason that I believe this. The reason really is that you're going to be polishing the wrong things in the space. You absolutely should polish-\n\nNick Turley (01:12:00):\nYou're going to be polishing the wrong things in this space. You absolutely should polish things like the model output, et cetera, but you won't know what to polish until after you ship. And I think that is uniquely true in an environment where the properties of your product are emergent and not knowable in advance. And I think that many people get that wrong because they think the best product people tend to be craftspeople and they have a traditional definition of craft. I also think it would be easy to use all what I just said as an excuse not to eventually build a great product. So I often tell my teams that shipping is just one point on the journey towards awesomeness, and you should pick that point intentionally where it doesn't have to be the end of your iteration at all. It can be the beginning, but you better follow through.\n\n(01:12:50):\nSo we've been doing a bunch of work, especially over the last quarter of really cleaning up the UI of ChatGPT. I'm really excited to do the same for the sort of the response layouts and formats next. Simply because once you know what people are doing, there's no excuse to not polish your product. It's just really, in a world where you don't know yet, you might get very distracted.\n\n(01:13:09):\nSo it's situational. Again, you kind of have to be first principles about it. But I do think using velocity, especially early on, as a tool... Actually this has been said about consumer social for example. It is not the first space where people have said, \"Hey, you just got to try 10 things because you're probably going to be wrong.\" So I don't think this has never existed before as a dynamic either, but I do think with AI, it's important to internalize.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:32):\nAnd there's also an element of the models are changing constantly and so you may not even realize what they're capable of, I imagine.\n\nNick Turley (01:13:38):\nTotally. The models are changing and the best way to improve them, whether or not you're a lab or actually just someone who's doing context engineering or fine-tuning a model maybe, you need failure cases, real failure cases, to make these things better. The benchmarks are increasingly saturated. So really you need real-world scenarios where your product or model is not actually doing the thing it was supposed to do, and the only way you get that is by shipping, because you get back to use case distribution and you can make those things good. And therefore, it's actually the best way to then go articulate to your team, especially your ML teams, what [inaudible 01:14:17] climb on? It's like, \"Oh, people are trying to do X and the model's failing in ways. Why? Now let's make those things really good.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:23):\nThis point about failure cases makes me think about something that both Kevin Weil and Mike Krieger shared, which is that evals are becoming a huge new skill that product people need to get good at because so much of product building is now writing evals. Is there something there you want to share?\n\nNick Turley (01:14:41):\nMy entire OpenAI journey has been this journey of rediscovering eternal product wisdom and principles in like slightly new contexts. So I remember I started writing evals before I knew what an eval was because I was just outlining very clearly specified ideal behavior for various use cases until someone told me, \"Hey, you should make an eval.\" And I realized there was this entire world of research evaluation benchmarks that had nothing to do with the product that I was trying to make. And I was like, \"Wow, this might be the lingua franca of how to communicate what the product should be doing to people who do AI research.\" And that really clicked for me.\n\n(01:15:23):\nAnd at the end of the day, it's not that different from the wisdom of, you ought to articulate success before you do anything else. It's just a new mechanism for doing that. But you can do it in a spreadsheet, you do it anywhere, and I really wanted to mystify it for people who hear that term. It's not some technical magic that you have to understand. It's really just about articulating success in a way that is maximally useful for training bots.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:50):\nAwesome. I have a post coming out soon that gives you a very good how-to for PMs have how to write evals.\n\nNick Turley (01:15:56):\nI would love to read it. And I hope you agree with what I just said because maybe there's [inaudible 01:16:02] to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:02):\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. And now there's all these tools that make this easier for you.\n\nNick Turley (01:16:04):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:04):\nOkay, so this basically backs up this point that this is just a very important skill that product teams and builders need to get good at.\n\nNick Turley (01:16:12):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:13):\nOkay. Just a few more questions. I know you have a lot going on today. One is that this trend of ChatGPT being a big driver of growth for traffic to sites, for products. For example, ChatGPT is now driving more traffic to my newsletter than Twitter, which completely shocked me. I just was looking at my stats, I'm like, \"What the hell? This is not something I knew was coming.\" So just I guess thoughts on the future of this, how you think about just ChatGPT driving growth and traffic to products and sites?\n\nNick Turley (01:16:48):\nI'm really excited about it because in the same way that I find it dystopian to talk to everything through a chat bot, I also find it dystopian to not have amazing new high quality content out there. And for that reason, I talked a little bit earlier about search and have that solved a really important user problem early on because you had this knowledge cutoff thing and you suddenly could talk about anything. Very obvious in retrospect. A, it wasn't just a user problem, it was an ecosystem problem where the original ChatGPT, it didn't have outlinks, it would just answer your question, it would keep you in the product. And even if you wanted to keep reading or go deeper, there was no way for us to drive traffic back to the content ecosystem. And I've been really excited about what we've been doing in search, not just because it gives people more accurate answers, but because it allows us to surface really high quality content, like this podcast, to people who want to see it.\n\n(01:17:47):\nAnd of course there's so many interesting questions about, well in the Google era, there was the search engine optimization and there was clearly understood mechanisms of how to show up and get more traffic. So I get a lot of questions from people, like, \"What is the equivalent of that? The AI era, if I'm Lenny and I want to 10X the traffic to my podcast, what do I actually need to do?\" And the truth is we don't have amazing answers there simply because the way to appeal to an AI model ideally is the same way that you would appeal to a real user, because the model's supposed to proxy the interest of the user and nothing else. At least that's how I want our product to work. And for that reason, my advice is super lame, which is make really high quality content, which is not as actionable as I think people making content would ideally like. And I think this is why we have more work to do because maybe there's a better mechanism or protocol that we could come up with.\n\n(01:18:42):\nBut I'm excited this is driving meaningful traffic for you, and I hope that other people making great content start to feel this way because, again, it's a very new scenario.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:52):\nThere's two acronyms people have been using for this specific skill of AI driven SEO. I think one is AEO, which is answer engine optimization. The other is GEO. I forget the G one.\n\nNick Turley (01:19:04):\nGenerative... Yeah, I don't know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:06):\nGenerative, yeah, AI optimization.\n\nNick Turley (01:19:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:08):\nDo you have a favorite of those two? [inaudible 01:19:10]-\n\nNick Turley (01:19:10):\nNo, no. I try to shy away from these terms unless they become inevitable just because I'm not entirely sure yet if that should be a concept or not. Again, I think ideally, ChatGPT understands your goals and therefore understands what content would be interesting to you. And the content creator's job is to share enough information and metadata about that content such that the AI model can make a user-aligned decision. And therefore, I'm not sure if giving this thing a name and making a thing is what we should be doing or not. I'm very eager to learn from folks making content about what this could look like because. Again, we're still working through.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:59):\nAlong these lines, another question people think about is you have GPTs, which are kind of these custom GPT apps that you can build to answer very specific use cases. There's always this question of, you're going to build an app store where I can plug in my product into ChatGPT, monetize that. Is there stuff there that you could talk about that might be coming someday?\n\nNick Turley (01:20:19):\nGPTs are cool. They're kind of ahead of their time in the sense that we built that kind of concept before you could really build very differentiated things. At least in the consumer space, your learning GPT is going to be pretty similar to what the model could already do out of the box. So it's mainly a way of articulating a use case to people, but it doesn't have enough tools yet to make something that feels like an app, so to speak.\n\n(01:20:47):\nDifferent in the enterprise by the way. We're seeing a ton of adoption of GPTs there because just every single company has very bespoke business processes and problems, etc. And it's a really, really useful tool there. They also have unique data that they can hook up to these things that it can retrieve over. So we've seen a lot of success there.\n\n(01:21:05):\nI think the idea is the right one, and I think we're going to figure out a good mechanism for it. Because when you have so much capability packed into AI, it feels really powerful to allow people to package that up in ways that have a clear affordance, a clear use case, and are differentiated from each other. I also would love it if you could start a business on ChatGPT. I think there really is a world where, as this thing hits a billion user scale, it can get you distribution, it can get you started on making something in the same way that people built on the internet and there was entirely new businesses to be built.\n\n(01:21:41):\nSo I think we'll have more to share there in the future. GPT's was an early stab. And I'm just excited to evolve the thinking there as the models get good and our reach increases as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:51):\nAmazing. That is really cool. I'm really excited to see what you guys do there. Okay. Completely different direction. Something that I know about you is you studied philosophy in college.\n\nNick Turley (01:22:02):\nI did.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:02):\nComputer science and philosophy, right? A combo.\n\nNick Turley (01:22:05):\nYeah. I started as a philosophy major and took one coding class because I really liked logic, and programming was most similar to that. And then I fell in love with coding and then eventually computer science, and I just kept doing more and more of it. But until then, I'd never really thought of myself as a technical person, so it was kind of a late discovery in my life that I'm very grateful for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):\nWhat an incredible combination for someone leading this product [inaudible 01:22:30].\n\nNick Turley (01:22:30):\nIt's true. It is really coming in full circle in a way that I couldn't have predicted. The amount of questions you have to grapple with are truly super interesting. And philosophy, it's not a traditionally practical skill, but it does really teach you to think things through from scratch and to articulate a point of view, and I think that has come in handy numerous times.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:51):\nIs there a specific philosopher or school that has been most handy to you, or is there more just the general [inaudible 01:22:57]?\n\nNick Turley (01:22:56):\nOh, there's so many.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:56):\nokay.\n\nNick Turley (01:22:57):\nI wrote my senior thesis on whether and why rational people can disagree, which also comes in handy when a lot of people with very different values have opinions on your model behavior or on how things should work. So I really like 20th century analytical philosophers. It's kind of dirty stuff, but I don't know if I have a favorite. It's too many to count. But that's the kind of stuff I like. And some of it ends up being quite analytical. You have let P be this theory of love and let Q be this other theory of love, and then you do some sort of symbolic manipulation. So it is just as much a brain thought exercise as it is... Or it's much more that than practical, but it taught me how to think in a way that continues to be pretty valuable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:48):\nIncredible. What a cool combo of skills and background. Last question before we get to very exciting lightning round. So you were a product leader at Dropbox, then Instacart, now you're the PM of arguably the most consequential product in history. How did you land in this role? What was the story of joining OpenAI and taking on this work?\n\nNick Turley (01:24:10):\nEvery single career decisions I ever made, including my first one out of college, was just figuring out who are the smartest people I know that I want to hang out with and learn from, and can I work with them? And I don't know how to vet companies, I don't know how to really logically think through what space is going to take off or something like that, but I just do feel like I have a sense on people. And for Dropbox, I followed the head teaching assistant for a class that I was TA-ing. And for Instacart, I followed some of the smartest product people I knew. And for OpenAI, the person who recruited me, Joanne, I had messaged her about getting off the DALL·E waitlist and she said, \"Only if you interview here.\" So she turned it into a reverse recruiting thing.\n\n(01:25:02):\nAnd initially, honestly, I didn't know what I would do here because it was a research lab and I was a product person and they said, \"Don't worry, we'll figure it out.\" And they were sort of being cagey. And I thought they were being cagey because it's OpenAI and they can't share anything, but they were being cagey because we actually just didn't know yet at the time. So I showed up and I did everything under the sun and it definitely wasn't product. It was like, I think my first task was fix the blinds or something like that. And then I started sending out NDAs for people because they needed some operational help. And then I started asking, \"Wait, why am I sending out NDAs? Oh, so we could talk to users.\" And I was like, \"Talking to users, that sounds like the thing I know how to do.\" And I quickly stumbled into doing product work, and then eventually leading a bunch of product work. But it was organic by just showing up and doing what had to be done because, again, the company I joined was not a product company by any.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:00):\nWow. This is such a good example of, I don't know if you think of it this way, but when someone offers you a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask which seat. [inaudible 01:26:07].\n\nNick Turley (01:26:08):\nYeah, so I didn't know it was a rocket ship. I kind of got nerd sniped is what I would describe it as. Where as I prepared for the conversation to get off the DALL·E waitlist really, I just started reading about the space and that piqued the philosophy brain and then also actually the computer science brain. I was like, \"Wait, this is cool.\" Then I started reading all the academic papers of that era. So it was intellectual itch and the people, but then I stayed for the product opportunity, obviously. Post ChatGPT, when that took off, realized that we'd built a rocket ship where we'd launched it while building it, maybe is the analogy. But I can't say that it felt like a hyped job or anything like that when I applied.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:00):\nSo a lesson there is, as you said, follow the smartest people you know. There's also just this thread of follow things that are interesting to you. Just you playing with DALL·E led to this opportunity.\n\nNick Turley (01:27:10):\nYeah, yeah. And actually that's something we still test for is curiosity is an attribute that we think matters so much more than your ML knowledge. I'm not making a comment on research hiring. I think you do need some ML knowledge, I'm afraid. But for product and engineering and design people, and those kinds of functions, I actually think that if you are just curious about the stuff works, it doesn't matter at all if you've never done it before. In fact, if you were to filter for people who've done it before, you would have a very narrow filter of very lucky people rather than necessarily the best people you can get. So I think we've scaled that. Certainly what got me here, but I think it's actually, just generically, been a good predictor of success at OpenAI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:50):\nNick, I told you I had a billion... I said I had 2 billion questions to ask you. I feel like I've asked a lot. I feel like I still have a billion left. But I know, you told me right after this you, have a big GPT- 5 check-in that you got to get to. So-\n\nNick Turley (01:28:01):\nWe got to ship.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:03):\nWe got to ship. Better ship now that this is recorded and we're putting this out.\n\nNick Turley (01:28:08):\nThis is true. [inaudible 01:28:08].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:09):\nThis is the forcing function. Okay, so before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share, leave listeners with, think is important to share?\n\nNick Turley (01:28:20):\nI try to share a little bit about how I made decisions because I hope to... I'm not that far out of school. I relate a lot to people who are coming in the job market, who are trying to figure out what to do with their life right now. And I feel very confident that if you surround yourself with people that give you energy and if you follow the things you're actually curious about, that you're going to be successful in this era. So my parting advice to folks really is put yourself around good people and do the things you're actually passionate about. Because in a world where this thing can answer any question, asking the right question is very, very important. And the only way to learn how to do that is to nurture your own curiosity. So it worked for me and it's the one repeatable thing that I can share. Everything else is luck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:15):\nThis is counter to what a lot of people are doing right now, which is follow the money. Where can I make the most? How do I grow this thing and make $100 million? All these people that are getting these crazy offers were not planning to make a lot of money doing this.\n\nNick Turley (01:29:27):\nIt's quite interesting to see that stuff play out because I think all these people entered school for genuine reasons. They were excited about the space, they were researching it, they were pursuing knowledge, and I'm happy that that's being rewarded. And I don't know what the rewards will look like in the future, especially in a post-AGI world. But I just a feeling that if you follow that advice, you'll end up okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:54):\nWith that, Nick, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nNick Turley (01:29:59):\nSure, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:00):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nNick Turley (01:30:04):\nIn the product space, probably things like High Output Management or The Design of Everyday Things, or those kind of classic type things because I think they're extremely applicable in AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:13):\nWe talked about philosophy. I don't know, is there a philosophy book you're like, \"Here's the one to read if you're getting into this.\"\n\nNick Turley (01:30:17):\nOh man. Anything by Rawls and Nozick. I like the political stuff. I think it's really fun. That is a type of thing I recommend. I don't think there's a practical reason to read that stuff, but I will nerd out about it with you. So at your own peril.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:32):\nDo you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed? If you've had time to watch anything.\n\nNick Turley (01:30:36):\nI think you've got to do a little bit of sci-fi to be in this space. You shouldn't copy any of it, but I think you learn from it. So regularly re-watch Her and Westworld. Severance was great. I think that's the stuff that, when I have time, I'll meddle with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:56):\nThat is awesome. I love that those are the two. Of all the sci-fi movies, those are the ones you resonate most with and find most interesting and valuable.\n\nNick Turley (01:31:03):\nYes, but that's probably my own limitation, so I'm sure there's more to discover.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:08):\nBy the way, have you read Fire Upon the Deep, that sci-fi book?\n\nNick Turley (01:31:08):\nNo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:13):\nOkay. I don't know if you have time to read this book, but I think you would love it. It's such a good-\n\nNick Turley (01:31:16):\nOh, man. Okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:17):\n... AI oriented sci-fi space opera sort of book.\n\nNick Turley (01:31:20):\nGreat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:21):\nYeah.\n\nNick Turley (01:31:22):\nI'll check it out, thank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:22):\nOkay. Off tangent.\n\nNick Turley (01:31:22):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:26):\nOkay. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nNick Turley (01:31:29):\nI actually don't. I am at extreme capacity. It's kind of interesting. API developers ask me like, \"Hey, are you going to copy all of our products?\" It's like, I actually just do not have time to follow up what's going on outside of OpenAI because the pace here is so, so intense. So don't have good recs for you, I'm afraid.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:54):\nThat's a comforting answer, I think, to a lot of product companies. Go figure. Nick has no time to even listen to our stuff. Oh man. Okay. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself using when things are tough, sharing with friends or family that other people find useful?\n\nNick Turley (01:32:10):\nBeing the average of the five people you spend the most time with is a thing that I really internalize, both in my personal life, where there's people who give me energy and who lift me up and make me a better person. My fiance is one of those people, but there's many people in my life. But then there's also just, at work, there's the equivalent. And again, that's how I've made all the career decisions. It's like who do I want to learn from? So I apply that principle constantly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:36):\nFinal question, everybody I talked to told me that you are a very good jazz pianist. You have won competitions. I think you were planning to do this as your main thing and then you somehow took the side quest.\n\nNick Turley (01:32:47):\nYeah, I chickened out that at the very last minute, but I was going to go to school for music. And that's still my, hopefully, chapter two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:55):\nWow. I love that that might still happen.\n\nNick Turley (01:32:58):\nMight still happen. Now I'm in some for fun bands and we will kick from time to time. It's like the one thing I can do when I'm otherwise super tired and can't think anymore because it balances me out in good ways. But yeah, hopefully I'll get to do more of it in the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:16):\nIs there any analogs between music and your job? Anything that you find-\n\nNick Turley (01:33:20):\nYeah, actually. I feel like you could think of software development as, or being a product person, as you could be a conductor of an orchestra or you could be in a jazz band. And I think of it as a jazz band where I don't believe in the idea of everyone having this set part that they have to play and me kind of telling people when to play. I love how in jazz, or other forms of improvised music, you're kind of riffing off of each other and you listen to what one person played and then you play something back. And I think that great product development is like that, in the sense that ideas could come from anywhere. It shouldn't be a scripted process. You should be trying stuff out, having fun, having play in what you do. So I use that analogy a lot. For those who like music, it tends to resonate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:13):\nNick, I am so thankful that you made time for this. I know today is insane. Tomorrow's going to be even more insane for the entire world. They have no idea what's coming. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if you want them to find you online? Where can folks find GPT-5 potentially. And then just how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nNick Turley (01:34:31):\nJust use the product. You don't even have to pay. Should be your default model starting tomorrow and just use it and don't think about models anymore. Unless you want to and you're a Pro user, in which case you get all the old models. So rest assured. And useful, honestly, I learned so much from people at large and ChatGPT users, et cetera, so just keep doing your thing. I am watching and learning, and I appreciate all the feedback. So I'm sure after we fix the model chooser, you guys will roast me for something else and I'll take it. So keep it coming.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:05):\nAmazing. Nick, thank you so much for being here.\n\nNick Turley (01:35:08):\nThanks for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:09):\nAnd good luck tomorrow.\n\nNick Turley (01:35:10):\nThanks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:11):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:35:13):\nThank you so much for listening.

And I was not surprised. I actually overlapped with Nickey at Airbnb, where she had a legendary reputation as a PM who everyone loved, but got shit done. Before Airbnb, Nickey worked at Etsy for over seven years where she went from being a forum moderator to director of product management. Then she went on to work at Airbnb for a couple years.\n\n(00:00:31):\nAfter leaving, she went on to be VP product at The Wing, and is currently a director of product management at Duolingo. In our conversation, we cover how to set vision, translate that into goals, and then how to execute on it, making your strategy actionable, and keeping your teams aligned and focused, designing your product review sessions, how to maintain product quality, and what skills have most contributed to her success in her career. I hope that you enjoy this conversation with Nickey Skarstad.\n\n(00:01:02):\nThis episode is brought to you by Mixpanel, offering powerful self-serve product analytics.

I am really excited for our chat and to get to learn from you. So welcome.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:03:28):\nThank you. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:03:30):\nMy pleasure. Today, you are director of product at Duolingo, which is an awesome product, and something that I used to use. I'm not learning a language currently, but I know where to go if I were to. Can you just talk about how you got into product, and then a bit about just your journey from that point to where you are today?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:03:48):\nYeah, so it's been a long, meandering journey, which is fun. And so I've been in technology roles now for 12 years. I've been in PM roles, actually product roles, for 10. I'm starting to be the person with experience in the room, which is really fun and kind of daunting at times. But how I got my first role in product was I was at Etsy in 2010 is when I joined. And I joined them, I'd say it was post-product market fit, but before they truly started to really grow and scale. And I actually joined them on their community team. So I worked as a forums moderator, and then as a seller education specialist. Yeah. Spent a couple years doing that. And then through that process became sort of one of the internal voices that had a really good understanding of how their customer, one of their core customers, their sellers, were actually using their product.\n\n(00:04:38):\nAnd the VP product at the time, his name's Mark Headland. Hey Mark, if you're listening. Was like, \"Hey, Nickey, you're in all these product meetings. Have you thought about being a product manager?\" And at the time I was like, \"Oh God, no. Never.\" I was like, \"No. Technology what? Engineering? I'd have to work with engineers? I know nothing about engineering.\" And so I was very imposter syndrome-y about it. And he gave me a little nudge, and was like, \"I think you'd be really good at it.\"\n\n(00:04:59):\nAnd so I tried it. And I started as an APM. And I was at Etsy for around, I think, it was seven years total, and spent the majority of time actually in PM product roles. So I left as a director of product. And for most of my time there, I worked on the seller side. So it was all seller tooling, working with sellers to figure out how they could grow and scale their businesses. And it was an awesome, wild ride. But that was my first role in product. And then I went on after that into several other product roles as well.\n\nLenny (00:05:27):\nYeah, let's get into it. Where'd you go next?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:05:29):\nSo after seven years at Etsy, I was kind of getting the itch to try something new. When I took a step back and was like, all right, what do I want to do next? I really loved the marketplace component at Etsy. And I don't know if this is just says something about my personality, or actually probably your personality too, is marketplace product is really hard, right? You have this constant balancing of both buyer and seller sides or both sides of the marketplace. And I really liked that. And it was something that I was good at.\n\n(00:05:54):\nAnd so I was like, all right, where else could I go that's interesting or having a moment? And I was like, Airbnb. Has to be Airbnb. I was a huge fan of their product. They were also post-product market fit. But sniffed around, ended up basically getting an opportunity to join the experiences team. And I joined that team when the product had just launched. So they had done sort of their early thinking, the existential thinking. Had a brand new product in market, and then I joined the team.\n\n(00:06:18):\nAnd so I was the first boots on the ground product manager, and really helped that team figure out how do we get product market fit? And then how do we start to think about how to scale it, which was, you can imagine, experiences is interesting because it is a very nuanced product in that, and this is similar to Airbnb if you work on homes as well, but part of it is building the digital experience that someone will interact with when they're booking an Airbnb experience. And the other part is actually influencing the live event experience that you will experience when you actually join an event or an experience.\n\n(00:06:52):\nAnd I think that layer of abstraction for me was really fascinating, and something I've learned a ton about is it's not just influencing the digital product, but it's actually the consumer experience when their boots around the ground. And that is another layer of complexity. And so that was super fun. I was there for about, I think, a little over two and a half years. Started as a PM. I think I got promoted a couple times. Left as senior product lead, I believe was my title. And forever grateful for that experience because I learned a ton about product market fit and also product quality.\n\nLenny (00:07:23):\nIs there anything else you took away from that experience? Because I was at Airbnb at the same time. We never really got to work together. But I just heard amazing things about you on the experiences team. And experiences was a wild ride, from what I understand. Is there anything that you took away from that experience that kind of has stuck with you as a PM?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:07:39):\nYeah. So part of it is more of just the way Airbnb works is something that I think I use every day in my job, which is just truly thinking about product quality and the end consumer experience. And Airbnb does not ship product if it is not good. And even if they're trying new things, they are obsessed with the end consumer experience. And I learned so much from that line of thinking because just, if it shipped, it was really high quality. All the edge cases had been thought through. And the experience I had before that was definitely we were shipping things more quickly, things weren't always perfect. And it's not to say that everything Airbnb ships is perfect, but I think that obsession with the end consumer experience really influences the quality of their product suite and is something I try to bring to my job today because no one does it better, in my personal opinion.\n\nLenny (00:08:28):\nI'd love to unpack that a little bit. There's kind of two questions in my mind. Is there an example of that at Airbnb where it's just like, okay, here's how they keep quality so high? And then do you have any advice for just how to do that as a company?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:08:40):\nYeah. So I don't think that's easy for sure. One of the things Airbnb did for experiences is we had this balancing metric, which was basically using the review rate as sort our end all, be all top line goal. So you can imagine a business like that. Obviously we needed to have revenue kind of moving through the platform, and we cared about high level bookings. But really at the end of the day in the beginning, we were obsessed with making sure every person who booked actually had a good experience when they showed up to experiences.\n\n(00:09:08):\nAnd so especially if you are building early product, really thinking about how can you pick some good quality metrics that might actually balance or conflate with growth metrics, and use that as sort of your north star because it really helped the whole team to understand what they were actually trying to do at the end of the day. Growth was important, sure. Obviously we needed to grow for a lot of reasons. But the most important thing was that the actual customer experience was great. And I know Airbnb does that in other places too, but that really was experience's top line goal was our review rate and quality and it trickled down for sure.\n\nLenny (00:09:43):\nHow did they operationalize that? Because it sounds great. Cool, let's make sure everything, all the reviews are five star. How do you build that into the way the team operates and tracks their success?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:09:53):\nYeah. So a big part of that was actually operational, which was just making sure that hosts who weren't meeting those specific rigorous standards. There was a lot of coaching and education that was happening. Some of that was in the product and some of it wasn't. It was something that was discussed at all of the meetings that we had across everyone's teams, right? Everyone understood that it was important. And so I think that really impacted both the ops team as well as the product team who are literally building the product that would bring that to life. And I think just thinking from, especially if you're a founder and you're thinking about building your sort of early metrics, there's a lot of ways to really make sure your team really understands what that means.\n\n(00:10:33):\nAnother thing we did a lot on the experiences team is we just dogfooded all the time. And so we were lucky in that it's a really fun product to dogfood. We were taking experiences all over the world all the time. But it really helped because you would know right away when you showed up to an event, if you were going to have a five star experience or if it was not going to be great. I mean that really helped us too because then we would go back to the teams and be like, \"All right, we were just in San Francisco. We were on an experience last night, and it did not go well. What do we do about it?\" So there's lots of ways to do it. But dogfooding is a good one.\n\nLenny (00:11:02):\nI know Brian is infamous for texting the team anytime anything isn't working right in the product. And I know he was very intimately involved in experiences. Is that something you've learned to do just to kind of like, \"Hey team, I found a big problem. Let's fix it.\" Or do you try to avoid that and not create that stress?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:11:20):\nI mean I think sometimes that can be a healthy stress if you do it in the right way. The nice thing I think is just making autonomous teams that feel like it is their goal to bring that quality experience to life can help you avoid some of that. But I do think that pushing teams to use the product so they firsthand experience when it is not great is a really good way to give teams sort of the motivation to act on fixing things like that. But I don't know that I text people, but I'm on Slack all the time. So if anything, I'm going to Slack you.\n\nLenny (00:11:49):\nGreat. Okay. Maybe one more question on this topic because it's so interesting. So on experiences you measured, I imagine, percentage of trips that were five star. Are there other quality metrics that you've used at other companies that you found helpful for keeping track of product quality and maintaining product quality?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:12:03):\nYeah. So another one that we used at Etsy, which was an interesting one, is we realized that, so one of the pieces of product that I owned was the onboarding flow. So it was onboarding new sellers specifically. And you can imagine if you're owning that flow, you're just going to be like, all right, we just need a ton of sellers, and we need them to open their shops right away. So we started and we went down that path. And then we realized we actually tanked a couple of downstream metrics that we didn't really understand at first. And those metrics were basically getting sellers to a first sale. So we opened up a lot of shops, but they actually weren't successful when they were on the platform, and they weren't successful in a certain amount of time.\n\n(00:12:37):\nSo we did a lot of unpacking of what happened there, why did we do that, and actually does that matter? And the end answer was, yes, it matters greatly. When Etsy sellers are opening their shop, it's really important that you get them a sale right away because it's a huge motivator, right? If you make a sale in your first day, you're like, \"Oh wow. Okay, this is a thing. I could make money doing this. This is exciting. I get to ship something to my buyer.\" If it takes you seven days, you start to be like, \"Oh no. I'm not good enough. I'm terrible at this.\" 10 days, into 30 days, it really impacts people.\n\n(00:13:06):\nAnd so we actually put more friction in the onboarding flow to help to start to solve for that. So we actually slowed you down. We made you be more thoughtful about what you were listing. And by doing that, we actually helped you get to a first sale faster. And so that was another good example of a quality metric that we used, which was, I think it was first sale in seven days. I might be wrong. But something along those lines. And it actually conflated with the high level growth metrics, but it was a huge quality predictor, and it was really important for long term seller success.\n\nLenny (00:13:32):\nSo interesting. That's such a good topic. And I feel like we could explore that for an hour, but maybe for a little bit longer. Was that metric the metric that you used to measure supply growth at that point? Or was it alongside just general growth?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:13:45):\nYeah, it was alongside general growth. It wasn't our top, top OKR. But it mattered because, again, it's sort of like you think about these things a bit as a seesaw, right? We basically were balancing our growth with making sure people were successful. And the more equilibrium you had there, the better it was for their overarching marketplace. And it's similar if you think about experiences too, right? Where, all right, you could just be growing, but people are having a terrible experience. So how do you balance those two things? And if you can get those two things in balance, you're going to cruise, and you're going to be more successful longer term.\n\nLenny (00:14:14):\nGot it. At Airbnb when I was working on supply growth, our main goal for the supply growth team was similar. And that was actually the goal we had, which is new listings that got their first booking. We only counted listings that had one booking as new supply. Everything else didn't really count. Because we knew that if it got booked at least once, at least it's got some level of quality and people want that place, and it's valuable to the marketplace. Okay. So you were at Airbnb, and where'd you go next?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:14:40):\nYeah. So I went to a startup. And for lack of a better way to describe this, they were basically kind of building a marketplace as well, but it was more of a marketplace of ideas. And I hate when people say that, because I think it's cheesy, but it's true. They had physical co-working spaces, and they were trying to take some of the magic that was happening in their spaces. So people meeting each other, networking, people getting funding for their startups, et cetera. And they wanted to bring it online and they wanted to try to scale it so it wasn't constrained inside of their four walls. So I helped them basically come up with a longer term strategy, start to figure out how to unpack that, and get product market fit. And then also just build a technology team around trying to solve that.\n\n(00:15:16):\nAnd so that started late 2019. And then I was out for a bit, had a baby. And came back and then COVID happened. And they were a physical co-working business. That was where their majority revenue came from. And so COVID was pretty horrible for what they were trying to do. They also had some other cultural issues, and so the whole thing kind of paused/fell over. So I actually spent a year hiring a team and then had to lay them off, which was a great lesson in leadership. I'm not going to lie. I learned a lot about how to lead in that experience.\n\n(00:15:49):\nBut after that, and it was COVID, I had a eight month old, and so I spent time actually just vibing with my kids, which was kind of fun. And then ended up going to Shopify after that. And so I was looking for a more bigger scaled, not startup, and was trying to find something a little bit more something where I could be longer term and was more excited about, and took a platform role at Shopify. And so that was really interesting in that I had, honestly, for the most part spent the majority of my career in super consumer facing roles. And the role that I took was more platform.\n\n(00:16:20):\nAnd I realized that, honestly, pretty quickly after I took the role, I was like, oh, good to know. I didn't really understand what this job was and now I know what it is, but it does not give me energy. And so I felt like I had a lot of red energy every day. And so I made a call pretty quickly to bounce, which was actually another good learning experience. I think I've gotten a lot. As I've advanced through my career, have learned a lot about what gives me Nickey Skarstad energy and have been really prioritizing that, especially in a post-COVID world.\n\n(00:16:46):\nAnd so left Shopify, and made my way to Duolingo. And so Duolingo has been super fun. I've been there since September of 2021. And in the process of helping them kind of think through a zero to one product challenge, something that's newer. Can't really talk about it unfortunately, but has been another sort of product market fit thinking exercise. It reminds me a little bit of some of the work that I did on experiences. And so it's been actually pretty challenging. It's super fun. So I'm also having a great time here as well.\n\nLenny (00:17:12):\nAmazing. The companies you worked at is incredible and there's so much I want to explore there. Going back to Shopify briefly, a lot of PMs, I imagine, are trying to decide should they stay where they're at? Should they go explore other places? So you said the thing that kind of pulled you out there was just the platform role didn't feel like a fit for you. Do you have any advice for folks on just how to know if a role or a company isn't a fit for them?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:17:37):\nYeah. So I think I really learned that while I was there, and also I want to make sure I actually had a great experience at Shopify and I think it is an awesome company. I would highly recommend people work there, especially if they like platform product work. One of the things I did when I was like, I don't know if I love this is I actually went through my calendar and I changed the colors of all of the meetings on my calendar to red, yellow, and green after I had the meeting. And I looked. And basically if it was yellow, I was like, okay. It was a fine meeting. My energy was baseline. If it was red, I was either bored or I was stressed, or I was not having a good time. And if it was green, it gave me energy and I felt excited and I wanted to keep working on that.\n\n(00:18:17):\nAnd when I looked back at the last few weeks, it was almost all red and yellow. And I was like, okay, this is really from an energy standpoint, I don't think I love this. And so I would say think about the work that you're doing and that lens. Get really good at figuring out what are the things that you love most about being a product person, and how can you optimize your next role for those things that you love?\n\n(00:18:39):\nWe should talk a little bit more about this, but each company has a very different product org. And the day to day of your job as a product manager, depending on where you go in the product that you're building, is very different. And so really thinking through what that work looks like, what their process is, who your end consumer is, what will the actual work you be doing every day, what will that be? And if you can get really clear on that, and then get clear on what gives you energy and what you love, it makes it a lot easier to figure out where you should go next.\n\nLenny (00:19:04):\nWow. I love that tactic. I've never heard of that. Just going back to the meetings that you have in measuring, just reflecting on how much energy that meeting gave you. Great tip. Thank you for sharing that. And I'll also double down on Shopify is an amazing place to work. Just to make that clear. It's probably one of the few places I recommend PMs go try to work at.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:19:23):\nYeah. I think especially if you're newer in your PM career, they just have a really great organization. And I think it's a great place to learn how to PM. Also their product, it's a huge scaled product. And so it's complicated to build in. So I think it's a great place to really understand second order systems and systems thinking. And especially if that type of work gives you energy, I would recommend that people look for jobs there. But again, get really good at what you love. And I think what I've realized longer term is I really like the zero to one early stage. How do we get product market fit? And how do we really think through the early experience? And Shopify is at a very different stage than that. They're doing that in a couple places for sure, but that's not their day to day. And so that was interesting.\n\nLenny (00:20:06):\nYeah. That makes a lot of sense. Going back to what you just touched on, the idea of product org and structure and how different companies build product, there's kind of two ways to approach this and take whichever direction you want. Which of the companies you've worked at did you enjoy most, and that's kind of stuck with you as a way you want to build product? Or just like, how would you approach building a product org in cross-functional teams versus not, and reporting lines, things like that? What do you recommend there?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:20:34):\nYeah. So I feel like you're asking me to pick a favorite child, which especially as a mother, that's hard to do. But no, I don't know. I feel like I've learned things from a lot of these different places and it's hard to choose. I think some of my early work at Etsy was very formative, and it was where I learned how to be a product manager. And so I feel very proud of that. I also think Etsy was out there building in public. I'm literally doing air quotes right now. I know you can't see me.\n\nLenny (00:20:57):\nI can see them.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:20:58):\nBut they were doing that because they had such a passionate, involved, engaged early community that they could not just ship things and have them land well if they did not involve their community early. So they were doing prototyping, beta testing, and basically getting people to try things and give feedback on things. I honestly, I think before a lot of people were, and that was something at the time that was really interesting and has really stayed with me, it's how to work with community and how to build community around the product that you're building.\n\n(00:21:25):\nBecause at the end of the day, especially when it's early days, it really helps scale, get people to evangelize what you're building, help teach other people how to use it, things like that. And so I learned how to do that at Etsy. And I think that was super formative. And then also just Airbnb, what we talked about before, and just deeply baking in product quality and the end consumer experience into everything that you're building is also something I literally apply every day. So if I had to choose, it would be those two places, but I plan on continuing to learn.\n\nLenny (00:21:54):\nInteresting. Both very community driven businesses.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:21:57):\nTrue.\n\nLenny (00:21:58):\nAnd then in terms of how they structured their org, is there anything there about just here's what I've learned works best for how to build product teams, structure product teams, that stuck with you?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:22:07):\nYeah. So I think there's kind of two overarching popular organizational modes for product org specifically. There's either the functional organization where everyone in the product team will report up through either a VP product, or a chief product officer, or something along those lines. And I think that actually really works in certain circumstances and is great. And typically how that works is you'll have your product partners, your trifecta, if you will, you have your design partner and your engineering partner, they will typically also report up into functional leadership. I think in bigger organizations that really works well, especially when you have orgs that need a lot of development in the function. So you'll have a lot of either APMs or product managers who are newer in their career and need a lot of support in development. And I think those functional ways of building makes sense. When I was at Etsy, that was the way that the reporting structure was and it made a lot of sense.\n\n(00:23:00):\nAnd then on the flip side, actually, when I was at Airbnb, because experiences was this new pretty nascent business opportunity, it had a GM structure. And so basically the whole product org that worked on experiences laddered up into a business leader and that business leader managed all of the functions. So they were the manager of the operations team, the marketing folks, product, and whatever. And I actually think that really worked for team like experiences at a company like Airbnb because what it did is it gave the leader of that business a ton of autonomy to really figure out what does this business need to be successful? And they didn't have to rely on, I guess they did in some ways, but not 100% rely on the larger company's resources to get the work that they needed done.\n\n(00:23:44):\nAnd I actually think that had they launched experiences inside of the Etsy style of organizational structure, it never would've succeeded because it had such a unique business need, and it needed its own process and ways of building product, et cetera. And because they sort of, hate to say wall it off, because it wasn't fully walled off, but because they gave it its own space and its own structure, it allowed it to succeed because they were able to fund it in the right way, give it the resources that it needed, et cetera.\n\n(00:24:14):\nSo I've seen those two types of models work. And I think if I was a founder and I was building my initial product org, how I would think about it was basically what are we trying to build? What is the product? And then what type of process do we need to put in place for us to figure out how do we build it? And then what type of people do we need? And then really taking a step back to really figure out, all right, organizationally, how do we shape this so we can make sure that those people have autonomy and they have what they need to just be able to cruise? So I honestly don't think there's a right way. I know that's a non-answer. I think it really depends on what you're trying to build and the stage at which you're at.\n\nLenny (00:24:48):\nIs there a default approach you'd suggest, just like most often you should go to the GM model, or most often you should just go with this cross-functional team?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:24:58):\nYeah. I mean, I think especially if your business is new, going functional makes sense because you don't necessarily have a lot of organizational complexity. Airbnb at the time we were there, Lenny, was a huge company, right? It had tons of different teams that were trying to tackle many different problems. So that GM model made a lot of sense because it again was able to take a specific business opportunity, give it the resources that it need, and give it space to run. When your company's smaller stage, I think that matters less. Typically, especially if you're working on solving similar problems as an organization, functional makes a ton of sense. Because then you're also thinking more holistically about, all right, how do we build the right product development process across different functions to make sure that we are, to use a bad metaphor, it's like the symphony metaphor. You have all these different instruments that need to figure out how do we play together at the right times? And I think that functional way of working actually allows you to do that really well.\n\nLenny (00:25:52):\nThis episode is brought to you by Unit. What did Gusto, Uber, Shopify, and AngelList all have in common? They've all decided to build banking into their product. According to AngelList's head of product, \"Banking makes every single feature more interesting. With it, our platform functions as financial mission control for our customers. Without it, we're just another software tool in a big messy stack.\" Embedding banking into your product, not only adds differentiation, but also helps you acquire, retain and monetize your customers.\n\n(00:26:21):\nUnit is the market leader in banking as a service, combining multiple bank partners with a developer friendly API to empower companies of all sizes to launch accounts, cards, payments, and lending in just a few weeks. Unit is trusted by leading brands, such as AngelList, ID, Invoice2go, and Roofstock. To hear more about how Unit enables companies like yours to build banking, visit unit.co/lenny to request a demo or to try their free sandbox. That's unit.co/lenny.\n\n(00:26:54):\nSomething I learned at Airbnb and from many other companies at this point is there's never going to be the one right way to structure, and companies bounce back and forth between them. Like Airbnb, for example, has moved from GM model to functional reporting lines back to GM. And so things change and you try some, see how it goes, adjust, optimize for the biggest opportunity. And then you'll probably change it six months later.\n\n(00:27:18):\nI asked a few people that know you and that worked with you questions that they think I should ask you. And one of the questions that came up most often is around how you set vision, translate that into goals, and then execute on those goals. And I know that's something a lot of PMs want to get better at and something that a lot of PMs aren't great at. And so can you just share any thoughts, advice, stories around that and how you do that well?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:27:43):\nYeah. Well one, I want to know who you talked to. That's terrifying. Hopefully they said good things. You don't have to out them.\n\nLenny (00:27:49):\nUnnamed sources. Unnamed sources.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:27:51):\nYes. Well I'm glad to hear that because that actually is some of the work that I honestly love the most. And when I look at my calendar, those are moments where I am green energy. And so I have some first principles that I like to apply when I'm thinking about setting high level vision and strategy. And the first is make sure that you pull in your people and your team. I've seen a lot of director level people through my career who will try to work on strategy in a vacuum alone. They'll write a document and they'll be like, \"Okay, team. Here's what we're doing. Here's our strategy.\" And it never goes well. And it doesn't go well. It might be the right strategy, but because you did not bring people along on that journey to come up with it, they did not feel like they had a hand in crafting it themselves. They are often not bought in, and getting people to buy in when they haven't been involved is very challenging and time consuming. We don't got time, right?\n\n(00:28:40):\nAnd so I think that's my first principle is just bring along the team. And I think there are ways to do that where you're not voting on strategy. You should not be voting. I think good product work is often not democratic, right? You need a clear leader who understands a lot of the signals and understands the larger competitive marketplace that can make decisions. And I think, especially when you're thinking about strategy, it's great to get input, but ultimately at the end of the day, you should have one person who is responsible for it.\n\n(00:29:06):\nAnd the other thing is a lot of times people don't really talk to leadership or the larger business leaders to get organizational context that helps them come up with the right strategy. They'll sort of build something in a vacuum, and then they'll come up with it and they'll get a ton of feedback from people across the org that were like, \"Oh, this conflates with our strategy. We're doing this, and it's very similar.\" Or, \"Our structural platform actually does not have the capability for us to do that thing.\" Whatever. And so just make sure that you're talking to people. And also all the way up to the CEO, and making sure the founder and the CEO is very bought in because ultimately, at the end of the day, they're choosing to resource what you're working on and are going to help you meet what you need. So those are some of the foundations for good vision and strategy work.\n\n(00:29:51):\nAnd then kind of zooming down into the weeds, I really like the vision mission strategy pyramid. I think might be a little tired. I like to think it's wired. But yeah. So if you just think about a pyramid shape, at the top is vision. Below it is mission and strategy, and then objectives. And this is a very simple framework. You honestly just Google vision mission strategy objectives, and you'll see it in Google image results. And all it is really is thinking about hitting those specific notes and thinking about them top down. So where do you need to go long term? What is the long term vision of what you're trying to do? In 10 years, if you could zoom up and look at what an ideal path for you would be, what is that? Write it down.\n\n(00:30:32):\nAnd then you start, as you go down the pyramid, you get clearer and basically you bring things down to your moment in time more clearly. So if you're thinking about your mission, all right, it's another level of abstraction of how do we make our vision come to life. And then you get into strategy. All right, how do we actually pick apart what we think is going to need to happen for us to actually be able to execute on that vision? And then your objectives can be OKRs, or whatever sort of goal setting model that you use to really one level get clear on, all right, in the next three to six months, what are the actual notes that we need to hit to be able to sing that beautiful symphony, is a terrible metaphor. And now I'm open to say it. But whatever.\n\nLenny (00:30:32):\nI get it. I get it.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:31:15):\nDang it. Love a bad metaphor.\n\nLenny (00:31:16):\nThat's evocative. While we're on that topic, actually just to interrupt briefly, how are you very practically doing this for say vision and mission? Are you starting a Google doc and writing it out, are you using Miro or FigJam, or something like that?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:31:30):\nYeah, so I think visioning exercise is a great moment to pull in your larger team. Because I'm remote now, I would use Miro or FigJam. Duolingo, we use FigJam typically because we are super embedded in Figma. In the past I've used MURAL. I actually personally like MURAL's whiteboarding product better. So I would open that up and I would walk through a number of things with the team and do a brainstorm literally. All right. Where do you all see us going in 10 years? What do we think what is the larger competitive landscape going to do in the next 10 years that could need to influence the work that we're doing? What are their ideas, and get everyone thinking.\n\n(00:32:05):\nGood brainstorm are often cross-functional. So go outside of your own team. Can you pull in somebody from marketing? Can somebody from the larger policy team sit in? How do you make it really cross-functional and really zoom up and give everyone the space and the freedom to think existential and to frame it that way,?we are going to be thinking in a five to 10 year timeline. Do not worry about what's happening today. And honestly, if you do that right, those are super fun exercises.\n\nLenny (00:32:30):\nAnd you're doing this remotely, I imagine.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:32:32):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:32:33):\nAnd so do you just kind of schedule a meeting, kick it off, point everyone to this Miro doc, for example, with a bunch of prompts and sticky notes and things like that? How do you actually practically do that?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:32:44):\nSo I would pre-fill out the Miro beforehand. So figure out what are the things you want to discuss with your team, create them as headers in the Miro document. So when everyone lands in there, you have a very clear here's what we're talking about today. You can put that into the agenda on your calendar invite. I've actually been to some really good strategic brainstorms that will attach some kind of competitive thinking landscape in advance. So people could have a little bit of a pre-read.\n\n(00:33:06):\nAnd then when you get into the actual session, you already have the time allotments scheduled and thought through. And both Miro and FigJam have really awesome timer, and it'll play music while everyone is working. It's pretty cute. FigJam's sounds are really well done. Whoever their sound architect is, bravo. And it'll ding after, give them 10 minutes and it'll give you a nice chime, and then you can review them together and you can go through each touchpoint that you want to talk about.\n\n(00:33:33):\nAfter it's done, I like to do some synthesis together in the meeting. So basically grab ideas that are similar, bucket things into concepts that are alike. And then I will take it later and spend more time thinking about it. I think a lot of people think you have to actually come away with a vision together in a meeting that's very clear, and you don't. You can just come up with ideas, take a stab at drafting it, and get some more feedback before it's final.\n\nLenny (00:33:56):\nOne last question on this thread, which also could be an entire hour of discussion, are there any examples of prompts or things you ideated that you could share? I know you can't talk about what you're doing at Duolingo, but just to make it a little more concrete for people, what are some examples of things that you brainstormed?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:34:11):\nYeah. I mean, so to take it back to experiences, because we've talked about that a lot, so people have some baseline context. Some of the early experiences visioning was really interesting because it was all about what type of experience can we create. And really thinking through when you've traveled in the past, what has brought you joy? Or what were the moments in your travel journey that have been really interesting, provocative, basically you remember the most, and why? And thinking through some of those things as a group. And those are good group exercises, because you're like, wow, I got to know a lot about Lenny by that crazy travel experience that he had. And so really kind of thinking through about how you craft really meaningful prompts that, again, connect to your strategy. So how does that ladder up into strategy? Obviously thinking through the experience that you're creating is going to help you come up with the right vision and fill out your pyramid in the right way, right?\n\nLenny (00:34:57):\nOkay. So we went on kind of on a tangent around brainstorming. Did you want to share more around just going from vision to goals to execution?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:35:04):\nYeah. So I think just generally, as you walk down that strategy pyramid, really getting down into the OKRs. And I think it's important because sometimes strategy is too abstract and too high level. And it's hard for people to take the step on how do I walk up that pyramid? And that to me is where having good strategy and having good OKRs help your team do that. And so good OKRs to me are just clear articulations of your strategy, whatever it is that are important to you, and it boils it down into the next three months, here's what we're working on. And I think that is just really good for teams because, again, if you're always in the clouds, it starts to get hard to really bring things down to the feature level of we're going to create a Jira ticket for this specific thing that we need to build. It needs to connect up to a strategy and back down.\n\nLenny (00:35:53):\nGot it. Where do you put, say, these OKRs? Do you just brainstorm, come up with vision and rough strategy, that translates into goals? Where do you do this? And then also just how long do you usually spend on this overall process?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:36:06):\nYeah. So the way that we do it at Duolingo now is we work on quarterly OKRs. And so that process will kick off usually the third month in the quarter. Really thinking through, all right, how are we trending on our OKRs this quarter? Did we commit to the right number of things? How are we doing? And then it is going, all right, so what do we need to do next quarter? And ideally, again, that's going to plug into a longer term plan. Otherwise it feels a little messy, and it feels not grounded in a long term plan or strategy in any way, shape, or form.\n\n(00:36:36):\nAnd then, so what we'll do is spend a few weeks as a team coming up with, all right, what could the next quarter look like? What is going to add the most impact and help us execute on that long term strategy? And then how do we make sure that we're setting the right objectives and KRs below them? And then usually there's some sort of leadership review. I actually forget, Lenny, how did goal setting go at Airbnb? I honestly don't remember. It sounds terrible, but it was a while ago. I can't even remember if Airbnb used OKRs.\n\nLenny (00:37:03):\nThere was a long period where OKRs were a very big deal. Our head of product was really gungho on OKRs. And I think for a couple years, we were very strict OKR culture. And then it kind of evolved into just rough-\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:37:15):\nGoals.\n\nLenny (00:37:16):\n... interpretation of OKRs. Yeah, goals and strategy and mission and vision. And so it's kind of this morphed version at this point, as far as I know.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:37:23):\nGotcha. Yeah. And I will say OKR frameworks might not be the best for every single team, but having some sort of goal framework that is shared across functions is useful no matter the size or the scale of your business. I think a lot of times people get hung up and they want to nitpick OKRs specifically. And I think some of those criticisms are very fair. But you should have some sort of framework that's shared from a process standpoint across your team that everyone can use and work on together. Because again, it takes your strategy and it brings it down into the now. So you can act on, in the next three months, you can bring something to life, and you're very clear on what that looks like.\n\nLenny (00:37:57):\nI'm going to pull out a thread of something you mentioned earlier of how to finally make decisions. And how in your experience the PM kind of is often sort of a final decision maker. I'd love to hear any advice you have of how to set that up on a team where it's either clear the PMs have a little bit more say and/or just bring people along to a final conclusion. Is there any advice on tips and tactics used to help with that?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:38:22):\nYeah. So I actually just read this really great book that is slightly tangential, but I thought it really applied to this type of basically getting people to align on decisions. It's by Chris Voss. He is this famous FBI negotiator. I think it's called Split the Difference: Negotiating As if Your Life Depends on It. Don't quote me on that.\n\nLenny (00:38:38):\nI think it's Never Split the Difference, right? And then I think he's also got a masterclass which I've watched, which is really good.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:38:43):\nI actually haven't watched the masterclass yet, but it's on my list after reading the book. And a lot of it, I think, especially because he's an FBI person, I thought it was going to be very much, \"You're going to do this.\" And it's all basically his whole approach is empathy, and it's repeating things back to you, making people feel heard, making sure that you're hearing why they maybe don't like your strategy, or why they think that's a bad OKR. And I think if you can spend some time just listening to your team and really understanding why is this not resonating, you can help guide people on the right path. Or you realize you're wrong. Good PMs are humble people, right? You're not always right. Not always going to be right. So how do you know when you're right and wrong is another good podcast that you should do with somebody else cause I'm probably not very at it. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:38:43):\nGood tip. I really like that.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:39:28):\nYeah. But I think that helps. And the other thing is I love the concept of one way versus two way door decision making, right? If your team is making a really critical long-term decision that's going to be limiting to a lot of the future things that you could want or need to do, that is a one way door decision. And you should spend time really thinking about discussing it, getting feedback and buy-in from your larger community, from your leadership team, et cetera. If it is a two-way door decision, it's not going to make a huge impact, you can change it later if you need to, let your team cruise on those things. Because it gives people autonomy. It helps you move fast. And then it just makes sure that when it does come down to decisions that are harder to change longer term, then those are the moments you should spend time and really think about and discuss and debate, et cetera.\n\nLenny (00:40:09):\nDo you have any examples or stories that come to mind of those sorts of decisions that you kind of help people just go for it, even though I may not necessarily agree?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:40:17):\nLet's see. Yeah. So one big one that we made at Airbnb that was pretty formative in early days was we came up with basically an articulation of what we thought a good experience was, and the standards that an experience needed to meet for it to be considered a good experience for us. And that was a many month long term project. And it was so important because we ended up building the product around it, building our policies around it, building how we educated our hosts around it. We had one moment in time to figure it out and get it right until it scaled everywhere. And so that was a true one way door decision where it was really hard to change later because we literally needed it to be relatively final.\n\n(00:40:53):\nOn Etsy, there was some big decisions that were made at certain points in time around what can be sold in the marketplace, and how to think through what constitutes something that is hand made. Those were one way door decisions, right? It's really hard to change that later because it's going to influence all of the listings that you have in your ecosystem. And so I think really thinking through those types of things are important and really setting teams up to be able to pause and spend some time to get it right because it will influence the end product in a very real way.\n\nLenny (00:41:23):\nHow do you know if it's a one way or a two way door decision? Do you find that it's generally pretty obvious when you're making the decision, or is it sometimes like, oh shit, we should have thought about that more?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:41:34):\nYeah. I would say I think I'm good at this 80% of the time these days, just because I've seen it done wrong in a lot of ways. But I think it's a muscle that you build honestly, and you get better over time about thinking about second order thinking. And so it's starting to understand, all right, if I make this decision today, it's going to impact this next level of decisions and the next level after that. And that will cascade through our larger system.\n\n(00:41:56):\nA great book to read if you are a product person is Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows. It's just about really thinking through how systems work, and then you can start to extrapolate what is the second order effect of the system. And if you think about that through your own ecosystem, it starts to help you understand, all right, this is a linchpin in our larger ecosystem that we got to be really careful about if we're going to touch it or change it longer term. But I do think some of that it's muscle, you build it over time. You make a couple of mistakes sometimes, and then you have to realize the true consequences of those mistakes and you don't make it again.\n\nLenny (00:42:29):\nCan we talk a bit more about the second order decision framework? I know you have a awesome newsletter post about this, and it was something I wanted to chat about. Is this a framework that PMs can use to make better decisions? And I guess how could they do that? And then maybe just describe a little bit more about just this concept of second order decisions, because it sounds really important.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:42:50):\nYeah. Basically what second order thinking is is you being able to think beyond the decisions that you're making today. The decisions you make today will affect tomorrow's decisions and your ability to build on your decisions that you made today. And this feels very existential and meta, but why it's important is that, especially when you're building product, is there's a cost associated with your time of everything you build. Especially when you're building marketplaces or anything with UGC content. When you make a change today, and it impacts every single user in your ecosystem that then is going to act on that change, it's really hard to make those changes later.\n\n(00:43:23):\nLet's talk about Airbnb home listing as an example. Really thinking through what are the pieces of data or all the pieces of data in the system that we need to actually list a home. And then how do we use those throughout our whole system in different ways? And then anytime you have to change those things. So that could be little simple things like truncating the length of the title of an Airbnb home when it's listed on the platform. You're going to have mad hosts, you're going to have design changes that need to be made to make sure that they can actually display something in a different way. It gets just inherently more complex the more complex your system is. So that is probably a terribly described way of describing second order thinking.\n\nLenny (00:44:01):\nThat makes total sense. And that's something we dealt with it, sorry to interrupt, but that's like on the host team, we dealt with this question often of just any change you make and the listing flow is going to impact so much of the experience of a host and a guest. And so that makes total sense. Sorry, keep going.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:44:16):\nYeah. No, and I think that forcing yourself and your team to think in that way is just a really good thinking exercise because it will save you time and it will save you money, a lot of money later, if you don't constantly have to rebuild things when you want to make changes to your system later. And that ladders up again into having a very clear vision and a strategy. Because what you're doing is you're starting to think on the long horizon. And so the decisions that you're making today are in service of that long horizon. So you can actually build in that direction and you don't constantly have to rebuild every time you're trying to change something.\n\nLenny (00:44:50):\nOn the second order thinking, sorry, I called it second order decision, but in this framework that you spoke of, how do you actually operationalize this concept? When you're planning, do you write out in the document second order impact that we should be thinking about, or do you do something else?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:45:05):\nYeah. So I think there's many ways to do this. If you have a spec-ed template or a piece of documentation that your team typically use when they're writing out product strategy or product requirements, et cetera, you can put a line in here to force people to think about it. I also think thinking about first principles and writing out first principles for the changes that you're making often are in service of second order thinking. Where it's like here are the things that we care about. Here's why these things are important. And we want to make sure these are baked into what we're building. Typically you'll write those through the lens of second order thinking.\n\n(00:45:36):\nShopify uses first principles a lot in everything that they build. And this is something I took away from that way of working because it's extremely effective. If you can get teams to align on first principles early on, it saves you a lot of heartache later because you've got people to align way early days before you even got into the design process, or before you had to start thinking about how do we actually technically implement this.\n\n(00:45:56):\nAnd then the other way I would say is there's ways to structure or have thoughtful discussion around second order effects. That could be a brainstorm. You could use Miro to think about that. We're going to make these changes today. How do they cascade through our ecosystem? What are the gotchas or the things we need to worry about? And again, I think the more complex your ecosystem is, the more you are forced to do this. A lot of founders in early stage products don't think like this because they're so focused on the product market fit. We need to just get something that people are using. That then when they get product market fit, they realize when they get into scale mode, they didn't build something scalable, and they have to rebuild things which can actually really hurt them when they're trying to grow really quickly later on.\n\nLenny (00:46:35):\nYeah. Absolutely. Happens all the time. For principles, do you put those in to say the team strategy, like the quarterly strategy document? Like here's our principles for the quarter? Is that how you generally do that?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:46:47):\nYeah. I think that is a great place to put it. You can write them on the feature level too. So something that you're building, just getting clearer on here are the things that matter to us. Here's what we care about. We're going to design in service of these things. And here are the things that aren't that important. And again, those are the types of places in a product requirements doc where people will argue the most, which is a good thing because you're basically discussing and debating sort of foundations of what you're going to build before you get into the work of building it. And so those exercises are always a good idea.\n\nLenny (00:47:16):\nAwesome. I love that. Okay. So going back, because I wanted to close this thread, you've come up with your vision, your mission, your strategy, your goals as a team. People start to align around it. What do you do to kick it off and get people on board and aware of the plan, and then to stay on plan with that strategy and not kind of be distracted by new priorities and shiny objects?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:47:38):\nYes. Oh, the shiny object thing is very real. Good question. So for example, I just did this recently where I brought my team along through the OKR process for Q2 planning. They had a say in basically what we decided we were going to work on. It went up for leadership approval. We got approval. And my process was I used Loom, which is another one of my favorite products. It's just a really easy screen share and video recording tool that you can share with teams. And so I just recapped, \"All right, here's what I presented to leadership. Here are the feedback that we got. Here's the strategic feedback that we got. And here are the changes we're going to make. Any questions, let me know.\" And I posted it in Slack.\n\n(00:48:10):\nSo I was just trying to keep the feedback loop really quick and tight with teams rather than wait till the next meeting you have with them a week later. I was like, all right, I'm going to just try to spend five minutes recording this and get it out ASAP. And that helps because then it gets people excited. Okay, cool. This thing that I worked on got really great feedback from leadership, and now we're working on it. I'm excited to get going.\n\n(00:48:29):\nAnd then it depends. Usually depending on the project, I have some sort of kickoff. I don't usually do a quarterly kickoff or anything like that because I think there's usually disparate teams owning different parts of strategy. But usually having a good weekly team meeting where you're really thoughtful about cascading feedback down from leadership, constantly checking in on what are we trying to do here? What is our strategy? How are these goals that we set laddering up? Are we achieving it? Are we not? Whatever. Having a meeting like that where you're kind of constantly talking about it each week also helps people feel bought in and not get distracted.\n\n(00:48:59):\nAnd actually I found that teams who are very bought to your vision and strategy are less distractable. Where I usually have more trouble is with leadership that aren't necessarily in the weeds with your team every day. And I'll get an idea. \"Have you thought about doing this one random obscure thing?\" \"Yes. However, it's not in service of this long term plan, so we don't want to do that right now because we don't think it's the best use of our time.\"\n\nLenny (00:49:23):\nGot it. And the way you're describing it, this is as a manager of product managers-\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:49:27):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:49:28):\n... versus an ICPM? Cool. So as an ICPM, I imagine you would do a quarterly kickoff, or whatever your cycle length. You kick off with the team. Here's what we're doing. Any questions?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:49:38):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (00:49:40):\nOkay. Another thing I wanted to make sure we have time to chat about is product review meetings and process. Just kind of like how do you, as a product leader, make sure that you're shipping great stuff that you're proud of and that your leaders aren't surprised by? How do you design just a product review and design process.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:49:56):\nYeah. So I have a lot of strong feelings on product reviews. And it's because I've been in a lot of different organizations and I've seen a lot of bad ways of doing this honestly. And I think it also depends on the product that you're building and the team that you've created. So I don't think that there's one right or wrong way to do this.\n\n(00:50:12):\nWhere I've seen them fail is when they happen at the function level, and they're not done or shared as a team. Typically it's normal to have a design review or to have some sort of technical review. And the more you can try to bring those different review processes into one central moment to check in, the better it tends to go. Because what happens is you'll have feedback in a vacuum. The design leader will give the designer feedback, and then you don't hear about it. Or there'll be some technical flaw that happens in a very specific technical review that doesn't get back to the larger team.\n\n(00:50:43):\nSo finding ways to make sure that those parts of your process are shared across each function, and you attend them and prepare for them as a team, I think really helps a lot of that. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a design review. Of course you should. I mean, you should just be really thoughtful about having moments, especially if there are moments where you're blessing something to move forward, to making sure the whole team is there. And that there's a very strategic check-in process to get those things approved that everyone knows about and is a part of.\n\nLenny (00:51:11):\nIs that a meeting that you do weekly and you invite the designer and the engineer? Who do you invite, I guess, and what is the goal of that meeting? The goal of that meeting, I imagine, is approved the product to go launch and build.\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:51:23):\nYeah. And I think especially going back to the one way, two way door moment, giving teams autonomy to ship some things that you think are two way doors and aren't necessarily mission critical are important to your vision, but aren't going to conflate with the larger system, I think trying to keep things quick and not have too many barriers for people to ship is incredibly important. So you'll have to figure that out for your own org and it's nuances, but that is something that is important.\n\n(00:51:49):\nBut when there are moments where you think it is basically a feedback gate, where it's a gate you need to walk through and a specific moment in time where you've gotten feedback, I think having a cross-functional meeting where there's a clear pre-read or something that's sent before. It's like, here's what we're talking about today. And then aligning on, do we think this meets our goals and does this meet our quality bar? And doing that in a really thoughtful way just so the team gets feedback. So the leadership is plugged in, but also so you're not standing the way of people shipping their products.\n\nLenny (00:52:17):\nAnd then do you check in throughout the process of the product being built, or do you kind of encourage teams to get to a point where it's basically ready for approval?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:52:26):\nYeah. Ideally in a perfect world, there's three check-in moments. There is the first principles check-in. What are you trying to build, or what are you trying to do? What are the sort of foundations that you're going to build on? What is the most important thing? What are you solving for? Getting approval on that, weirdly, is almost the most important thing. Because it saves a lot of teams a lot of time when they get later in their feedback review process and people are like, \"You're not solving for the right thing.\" So that's important.\n\n(00:52:49):\nOnce you've aligned on that, then it's like, all right, what approach are we going to use? What are we going to build? And that's sort of how we solve the problem. Making sure that there is a technical component there too so there's some sort of infrastructure review or architecture review, or whatever you want to call it. And then it's like, all right, this is ready to ship. Let's check in again. Do we think it's ready? And I think that, again, it depends on your organization. If you have a very small team, you might be very plugged in and these things might not need to happen. But in bigger organizations, especially where leadership isn't always able to be in the room, making sure that you have a clear checking in a few times to make sure that everyone is moving in the right direction and everyone feels good is, I think, a worthwhile exercise.\n\nLenny (00:53:27):\nI love that. Such a simple framework. And then one last question along those lines, do you leave it up to the team to schedule these meetings, or are you pulling it out of them and making sure they schedule it?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:53:36):\nToday, because the team that I'm working on is pretty small, and we're pretty pre-product market fit, we're not doing a ton of very formal check-in moments because we don't need to be. Because it's a small team and we're all cruising together. But in bigger orgs that I've worked in, for Shopify, for example, there was a process around having these meetings and who would be there. And so those would kind of be scheduled through the larger processor system that they were working in, which really worked for them actually. And I think it allowed teams to be pretty autonomous on the day to day, but just making sure that there was feedback coming of from their users as well as from leadership.\n\nLenny (00:54:08):\nGot it. One last question before we get to our exciting lightning round. And it's something that I've been thinking a lot about recently, which is around remote work as a product manager. I left Airbnb before COVID, and so I never lived in this world of everything is remote and product managing remotely. Is there anything you've picked up or learned that has been really helpful to being a product leader in a remote world?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:54:30):\nYeah. I would say last couple years have just been a huge shift in my ways of working. I sort of grew up as a PM in IRL environments where we did the majority of our work together in the same room. So that was whiteboarding, having a quick sync after you had an in person meeting to finalize some details or keep hashing out a problem. It's so cheesy and overhyped, but the proverbial water cooler moment where you see somebody, and you're like, \"Hey, how are you doing, Hey, did you hear about this thing?\" All of those things literally went away overnight.\n\n(00:55:01):\nAnd I think especially the job of a PM, it's hard under normal times because you are doing so much labor to make sure people are informed and give feedback, et cetera. And then overnight you took away a lot of the methods that they were using to do it. And so I think that has been a pretty profound shift for a lot of people working in product roles.\n\n(00:55:21):\nThe good news is there's a ton of new tools and new technology that's actually being built right now that's majorly helpful for this. So I use Slack in very new ways today than I did two years ago. Things like just making sure to post more asynchronous updates. Trying to actually take the burden off of an IRL or a Zoom meeting. Can we talk about this asynchronously and do it in Slack? Slack has this really great feature called huddles where you can just quickly get on. It's just audio. So there's no video. And you can just have a 30 second conversation. It's good for standups and things like that. Suggest you try it if you haven't yet.\n\n(00:55:56):\nAnd then a lot of the old in person whiteboarding, things like that, you can do those now using awesome tools like Miro and FigJam. And I feel like, especially at Airbnb, we had such an international team that there was always somebody who was remote typically. And I think we never really got the remote experience right. And now that the majority of our teams are remote, I'm a fully remote person, I've been a lot more thoughtful about making sure we're creating a really good experience of how we're working for the larger team. And so I think you have to hack on this with your team. Different teams have different ways of working, but trying to be a synchronous, using Slack, making sure you're following up in very visible ways where people can see. Don't rely on Zoom meetings to fill all of your time. Otherwise people will literally hate you. And things like that really make a huge difference.\n\nLenny (00:56:43):\nAwesome. Super helpful. All right. Nickey, are you ready for the lightning round?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:56:48):\nI'm ready. Let's do this.\n\nLenny (00:56:49):\nWhat's a book that you recommend most to other product managers?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:56:53):\nI love Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows.\n\nLenny (00:56:57):\nAwesome. Okay. We're going to link to that in the description. Other than Duolingo, what's another company that you recommend the PMs go work at or explore when they're looking for a new gig?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:57:07):\nYeah, I would say Etsy hands down.\n\nLenny (00:57:09):\nAnd why is that?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:57:10):\nI think it's a great place to learn how to be a PM. Data driven, really supportive, product leadership, and a super fun product to build.\n\nLenny (00:57:18):\nAwesome. Love that. What's the current favorite kind of app or piece of software that helps you do your work better?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:57:25):\nI'm obsessed with Superhuman, which is a email productivity app, which once you start using it, you can't not use it. You basically have to use it for the rest of your days. I also am obsessed with Loom, which is a video recording tool that makes it really easy to share really quick video updates.\n\nLenny (00:57:41):\nAwesome, great choices. And then outside of work, what's a current favorite app or just piece of software that you love?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:57:47):\nDefinitely TikTok. Short form video is very fun and entertaining. Can't get enough of it, and have been creating some myself. So I'm definitely hooked.\n\nLenny (00:57:56):\nWhile we're on that topic, how do people find you on TikTok?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:57:58):\nYeah, it's just my name. It's Nickey Skarstad, and give me a follow.\n\nLenny (00:58:03):\nI'm a very happy follower. And then I'll link to that in description too. Who's a favorite person that you like to follow on either Twitter, or Instagram, or even TikTok?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:58:12):\nYeah, so I love, she is a cultural journalist, her name is Anne Helen Petersen. And she's really plugged into sort of the larger cultural zeitgeist of the time. And I always give people, when people ask me my top advice for new PMs, it's just to be a consumer. To download new products, to try them out, to use all the things and try them because I think it actually makes you a better product builder. And follow people that are not just tech people on Twitter. You are doing yourself a disservice if your entire feed is tech people. So find people that are plugged into cultural zeitgeist because it helps you also understand the moment in which you are shipping, and it'll make sure that you're acing your product marketing and your messaging and you're building the right thing.\n\nLenny (00:58:53):\nWhat's her name again?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:58:54):\nHer name is Anne Helen Petersen.\n\nLenny (00:58:56):\nAnne Helen Petersen. Love it. Okay. And then final question. Who's been your favorite manager?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:59:01):\nYeah, so I couldn't pick one person here, so don't be mad. But it's actually a lot of women that I worked for at Etsy. The majority of my entire reporting line the time that I was there was all women, which has never happened to me again. So shout out to Kruti Patel, who is their current chief product officer, a woman named Heather Jassy, who ran the community team at Etsy long ago, who was a true delight to work for. And then Linda Findley, who is now the CEO of Blue Apron, but she was the chief operating officer at my time at Etsy. And she was my boss for a bit. And she was wonderful.\n\nLenny (00:59:31):\nAmazing. Thank you for sharing all that. And thank you so much for joining me, Nickey, for doing this. Where can people find you online? And then just generally, how can people that are listening to this be helpful to you?\n\nNickey Skarstad (00:59:43):\nYeah, so I have newly become obsessed with TikTok, like I said before. I've been creating some fun, little short form videos. One of my regrets as a long time product builder is it's very time consuming to write down the stories of building products and to share them. But I found TikTok actually really easy to do that. So I'm going to try to experiment there a little bit more.\n\n(01:00:01):\nSo you can follow me, I'm @NickeySkarstad on TikTok. And then I have a newsletter. I call it Builders. It's nickey.substack.com. Nickey is spelled like Mickey Mouse, but with an N. N-I-C-K-E-Y, .substack.com. And I publish their occasionally. I need to get it going again. But again, trying to write down more of the stories of actually being a builder who's been doing this for a long time. Because a lot of us don't have a lot of time to actually talk about it, but it's really interesting work and I want to share it more.\n\nLenny (01:00:29):\nAwesome. I'm a follower and a subscriber to both. So highly recommend that.\n\nNickey Skarstad (01:00:29):\nI love it.\n\nLenny (01:00:33):\nAnd thank you so much, Nickey.\n\nNickey Skarstad (01:00:34):\nYeah. Thank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:00:35):\nThat was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoy the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at lennyspodcast.com.
