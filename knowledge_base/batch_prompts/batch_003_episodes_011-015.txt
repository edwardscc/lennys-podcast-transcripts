I think the hard part is sublimating your ego a little bit and saying it's more important to get to the outcome than to be right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):\nI love this very tactical piece of advice when you're trying to come up with a metaphor or analogy, think about what you want your users to feel when you're using the product.\n\nAmi Vora (00:00:27):\nIf we all agree that the feeling of something should be, I'm sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday, then people will just naturally build something that feels more consistent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):\nThere's also this metaphor about the hill climb.\n\nAmi Vora (00:00:38):\nFor me, the hill climb is all about the difference between a local optimum and a global optimum. You're standing on top of the hill, you're looking down, you can see rolling hills, the sheep, the grass, whatever, but then, way off in the distance you can see a mountain. And the thing that gets me through the valley is remembering what the summit feels like.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):\nToday, my guest is Ami Vora. Ami is Chief Product Officer at Faire, which connects independent retailers and brands around the world, and I believe is the most successful and biggest B2B marketplace startup out there. Prior to Faire, Ami was employee 150 at Facebook, where she launched the first Facebook developer platform and was later head of product for the $55 billion global Facebook ads business. She also oversaw the introduction of ads on the Instagram platform and most recently, she led product and design for the largest messaging app in the world, WhatsApp.\n\n(00:01:34):\nIn our conversation we cover a lot of ground, including building your strategy skills, how to disagree with people skillfully, being a successful woman in tech, using metaphors and imagery to rally your team and get your point across, setting up effective goals, plus a bunch of jokes in the lightning round that you don't want to miss. This was a really special and authentic conversation that I'm very excited to bring to you. With that, I bring you, Ami Vora.\n\n(00:02:03):\nAmi, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAmi Vora (00:02:06):\nOh, thank you. I'm so happy to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:08):\nSo, when I asked you about your goal for our conversation today, you said the most amazing thing, which I love. You said that your goal is to be as authentic as possible and to show that people can be pretty messy and imperfect at times, yet still be very successful. I love that so much. Let's definitely try to do this. Is there anything else you want to add on that?\n\nAmi Vora (00:02:28):\nYeah, I mean, maybe I'll just say a couple more words on that. Actually, I feel like when I was coming up, when I looked at people who were successful, they seemed to have everything figured out, especially the women. They were all super women, where they respond to every email in 10 seconds, they didn't seem to sleep, they always wore high heels. They were just perfect and I was just like, oh, I guess I'm never going to be successful. That is not me. I love to sleep, I waste time doing absurd things all the time.\n\n(00:03:00):\nAnd I'll tell you how glamorous my lifestyle is, I'm currently working out of my bathroom. I'm talking to you from my bathroom, which is where I work from because I love my house, it's a great house, wasn't meant for work from home, three kids, two parents remote work, and it was just the place with the most closing doors between me and my children when the pandemic started. And so it just took me a while to realize that actually, it's all fine. No one's got it fully figured out, you never know how someone else is living. Most of us are winging it and learning as we're going and learning through trial and error and it's all normal. It's all fine and I can do it and you can do it, and everyone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):\nI so love hearing this. This is something people often want to hear more of on this podcast, because there's all these stories of here's all these successes, here's all these things I did and everything, it just always seems to work out. And we try to, we have this failure corner on the podcast where people share story failure. So I love just setting that frame for this conversation of just super being real and being clear that there's a lot of things that go wrong behind the scenes that people often don't hear about.\n\nAmi Vora (00:04:08):\nI for a long time felt like I was held back because I don't have a plan, but I realized that probably the most important thing is to just acknowledge that that is true for me. That I'm not going to be a person with a plan, and actually the thing that has consistently served me is to do the thing that feels right, go to the place that feels like home, work with the people who feel like my friends. Just work where when I put on the code of the job, I feel like, oh, this is a place where I could really be lucky, I could be creative, I'm in the right spot, as opposed to feeling like, oh, there is an end state that I know of and I'm just going to have to work my way to that end state. Whenever I get in that zone of, there's only one outcome and I just have to get there, I'm not my best. I'm not bringing the creativity and the luck and the excitement in the same way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:03):\nLet me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The best way to level up your career is to surround yourself with extraordinary peers. This gives you more than a leg up, it gives you a leap forward. This worked really well for me in my career and this is the Sidebar ethos. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This was a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers.\n\n(00:05:34):\nSidebar is a private highly vetted leadership program where senior leaders are matched with peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives and raw feedback. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback in every step of your career journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth. Sidebar is the missing piece to catalyze your career. 93% of members say Sidebar helped them achieve a significant positive change in their career. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today? Join thousands of top senior leaders who have taken the first step to career growth, from companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta by visiting sidebar.com/lenny. That's sidebar.com/lenny.\n\n(00:06:26):\nThis episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents, fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams, and the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations or you can use an all-in-one document SDK.\n\n(00:07:00):\nMost product managers will tell you, paperwork sucks. Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand's style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features. For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature.\n\n(00:07:29):\nThe best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's drag and drop builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy to understand documentation. Build documents software fast with Anvil, that's useanvil.com/lenny, to learn more or start a free trial. That's useanvil.com/lenny.\n\n(00:07:55):\nLet's actually spend some more time here. I wasn't planning to go here yet, but this is really great and important advice. I've just, basically you're saying that a lot of your success has come from following people that are awesome. Can you just talk more about that, just what it is you've followed and seen that has helped you land in places that have worked out so well, because clearly you've done incredibly well.\n\nAmi Vora (00:08:14):\nI mean, I think a lot of us are just like, you have a spreadsheet in your head of the axes and certainly when you're choosing between jobs, for me it feels like, oh man, the rest of my career hangs in the balance of making the exact right decision and getting the exact right job. And you work through all of this spreadsheet mass of, if I took this job, here's what it would do for me, here's where I'd be in five years, etc. And I have that engine in my head also, but what I try to do is work through the spreadsheets and then tear it up because none of that stuff is actually going to determine how good I am at the job. The thing that'll determine... In my track record, the thing that has determined it is when I walk through the doors, do I feel like I'm lucky to be there?\n\n(00:09:03):\nSo for me, it's actually a lot more emotional. I try to just put on the coat of the job. When I wake up in the morning, I'm like, what would it be like if I were doing this job? What would I think about on my commute? Who would I have lunch with? Do I like them? What problems am I going to solve today? And that gives me an emotional response, which is just much more telling than the spreadsheets of, here's where I'm going to be in five years.\n\n(00:09:31):\nAnd for me, the thing that has led me to the places where I do my best work is a feeling of being at home, which is all about trust and trust with the people around me. Can I walk through and feel like these people are going to have my back, they're going to let me take risks, I'm going to enjoy spending time with them? And that's where I feel like I've always just been able to try more things and do better because a big, trust is a big unlock for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:56):\nI love this metaphor of putting on the coat of the job, of just feeling out what it would be to work there. I imagine that was something that you did before you joined Faire, which I want to talk about, but let me transition a bit to talking about Meta and specifically, Boz. The CTO of Meta was on this podcast a few months ago and he said something about you that I want to read.\n\nAmi Vora (00:10:17):\nOh, kind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:18):\nOkay, so you've heard what he said about you?\n\nAmi Vora (00:10:21):\n[inaudible 00:10:21].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:20):\nOkay, cool. So let me read this and then I want to learn from you how to do this. So here's what he said. \"Working with Ami, it was like watching an alien because she could have the most profound disagreement in the world with somebody and they would say something that she thought was not just wrong, but crazy wrong, and she would respond, 'Fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that.' And she meant it from the core of her being. She saw this schism and rather than reacting as if it was a threat, she reacted with the most genuine and profound curiosity. I just watched it absolutely tear down walls between points of view. Embracing curiosity in those moments of challenges completely changed my life and I owe that to Ami Vora.\"\n\nAmi Vora (00:10:58):\nOh man, I love Boz, what a great guy, and so kind of him to say that. I mean, I will say that this did not come naturally to me. I really enjoy being right, I love to be right. I think most of us love being right, and at least in my childhood, part of my identity was built on being the person who was right and being the person who knew everything.\n\n(00:11:22):\nAnd then it turns out that in the working world, that did not serve me so great, it wasn't great to walk into things and be like, all y'all are wrong, I am the only answer, everyone please to listen to me and stop talking. And what really happened was that someone pointed out to me that not only... One of my old managers pointed out to me that not only was I spending a lot of energy trying to think through every possible thing by myself so I could be totally right, I was often not really coming to the right answer. Other people have a bunch of information that I do not have. And so I'm just ignoring that, I was letting my ego overtake my desire to get to the best outcome, which is just, that's a silly trade off and an unnecessary one.\n\n(00:12:12):\nThe thing that changed there is me just saying it's more important for us to get to the outcome and I very selfishly just like to learn more things. And so by deciding that I already knew everything, I was cutting myself off from learning the things that other people were really good at and it's so easy to just open the door instead and say like, hey, you seem to know something that I don't know yet. Why not tell me about it? I'm going to get better. We'll probably come to the right outcome. Maybe you'll have a better time. Why not?\n\n(00:12:45):\nAnd so it was a little bit just accidental evolution in that direction. But it's made work and life so much more interesting to just be like, hey, what does this person know that I don't know yet? It means that every meeting you walk into, you're probably not going to get bored and I get bored a lot, but if you assume that every person there knows something that you don't know, then it's not just wait to get to the right answer, it's like, discover the thing that they know that you don't know and it becomes just a little bit of uncovering.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):\nFor people that want to learn to be good at this the way you are, a couple things that I take away from the historian and the way you're talking about this is, one is there's an enthusiasm of, I disagree with you, but I want you to know I really care about what you think. So there's an energy of like, please tell me what I'm missing. There's also this assumption that a lot of disagreement is rooted in, we just have different information, so tell me what I'm missing. Can you talk a bit about just how to, what you've learned about actually do this well?\n\nAmi Vora (00:13:45):\nYeah, I mean, I think the hard part is just sublimating your ego a little bit and saying it's more important to get to the outcome than to be right. And I think all of growth is a battle with yourself, but this is one of the hardest ones because we all want to be right, we all want to protect ourselves and it served us, many of us for so long to be right. I just try to think about the feedback loop of, I think all of life is feedback loops, so I just started to think about the feedback loop I'm creating of like, I was curious about something. I learned something new, we got for a better outcome. Probably the other person felt better as well as I felt better. It's all positive feedback and you do that a couple of times and the positive feedback far outweighs the desire to be right because now we're more right, we're more right together. And so just building that as a practice of just noticing how much better things can get when you can be open to them, has been really fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:43):\nWhat do you think of this phrase that he used that he remembers? Is that a phrase that you find useful? Just fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that.\n\nAmi Vora (00:14:52):\nI do think that is a word that I say a lot. I do say that a lot, because it's true, it's fascinating that someone to look at the same movie that I was looking at and come away with a totally different understanding of the plot. I could sit in the same meeting as other people and they would leave with just a different retelling of what happened, and that to me is fascinating. Isn't that surprising, that we can all see the same, what we think are the same facts and walk away with a totally different narrative? And when you really go deep into that and you just understand how people see the world, and that is helpful. I'm curious about things, I like to know more things, and so that just helps me know more things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:36):\nI feel like the hardest part of this for people is you hear someone say something, say, okay, so our mutual friend, Dan Hockenmaier, he's in a meeting and he just says something that you are just like, no, because he's got influence. He's a big deal at Faire. Most people have this visceral reaction of like, oh no, I really don't think that's a good idea. Is there something you've learned about controlling that bodily reaction of like, oh, and then just being positive about it?\n\nAmi Vora (00:16:00):\nYeah, I do think it is just that feedback loop. It's not like I don't have the visceral reaction, it's just that instead of interpreting it as this is a visceral reaction, I got to shut something down, it's like, this is a visceral reaction and it's a chance to learn more. Just reinterpreting some of the feelings in ways that are more about opening than about closing stuff down.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:23):\nGot it, so it's kind of like a thinking you do of like, okay, hey, let me frame this and think about this [inaudible 00:16:28].\n\nAmi Vora (00:16:28):\nFor me the most important thing is just taking a pause. I think when you just take a pause, your body calms down, your mind gets a chance to breathe a little bit, and then your response is going to be better, but you got to take the pause because the immediate visceral reaction, is not always... It's going to be primal, it's going to be protective. It's just when you take a pause you're like, this is all fine, let's just learn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:52):\nI feel like more people are going to start using this phrase, fascinating.\n\nAmi Vora (00:16:55):\nFascinating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:56):\nWhen they hear something [inaudible 00:16:58].\n\nAmi Vora (00:16:57):\nIt's kind of my tagline. There were a few years where I had to be careful about not saying it because whenever I said it, people would be like, she disagrees. So I've had to use a thesaurus and expand my words I use.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):\nNo, that's such a good word. Maybe we'll make that the title of this episode.\n\nAmi Vora (00:17:12):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:16):\nWhat a great title that would be. So we've been talking a bit about the bodily reaction to stuff and our lizard brain almost, reacting to things. It reminds me of this metaphor that you called the dinosaur brain and how it applies to product reviews. Talk about what that is.\n\nAmi Vora (00:17:31):\nOkay, so a lot of people on my team, they're coming in to do product reviews and they're worried about it. They're stressed out, they don't exactly know what to show, and the normal temptation is just to show as much information as possible because that way you come in and you think, hey, the people in this room are super smart. I'll show them the information, they will come to the right conclusions. They'll probably make a better decision than I'm going to make. So my job is to catalog the information and present it.\n\n(00:17:59):\nAnd one of the first things that I talk to people about is, okay, for the purposes of this conversation, I'm going to put myself in the capitally executive bucket because that makes what I'm about to say less offensive. Assume that executives have a little tiny dinosaur brain. We all have a little brontosaurus brain and we can really only hold three facts at the same time. We will never be able to go deep in the way that you are able to do on everything that crosses our desk. And so the best service you can do is actually do the work of making a recommendation. That's the way we're going to be complimentary. The breadth that I normally have to look across means that I'm going to be better at things like pattern matching or giving you more context or telling you stuff that's happening in the company or the industry. But what I'm not going to be better at is looking at all the information that you looked at and coming up with a meaningful outcome. That's what you're going to do and my little dinosaur brain is going to be like, okay, that sounds like a very reasonable pattern, I've seen other patterns that look like this. Okay, that sounds like an outcome, however, it conflicts with this outcome over here. I can tell you about that. Does that make sense?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:17):\nYeah, and I love that you put yourself in that bucket. You have a dinosaur brain also, it's not other people.\n\nAmi Vora (00:19:22):\nIt's a pretty bad, bad look, but it's really true. As you get more breadth, you are less and less able to go deep on everything that deserves going deep and you just end up doing a different service than the people on your team, and recognizing that as complimentary has been really helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:38):\nYou have this phrase, my manager owns context, I own the recommendation. Kind of along the same lines?\n\nAmi Vora (00:19:42):\nExactly, very similar. And I think the thing that was helpful for me there is that really unlocked what I was looking for from my managers because otherwise I wanted them to be exactly like me. If I assume that I need to bring them information and then they would come to the same conclusion that I would come to, that's very narrow. They have to be able to look at the exact same information and process it in the same way and come out with the same idea. Whereas if what they're doing is complimentary to me, then I can learn from everyone. They're going to just have a different view, they're going to have new information that I don't have, and it gives me a lot more space to take accountability.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):\nIs there any other advice that you could share along these lines of just product reviews? So, the big takeaway here is just keep it simple and have a recommendation.\n\nAmi Vora (00:20:30):\nKeep it simple, have a recommendation. I also think that, I think we misuse product reviews sometimes as ways to get decisions and actually, they should be ways to calibrate on principles. So what you don't want is to come to a product review for every single that you want to make. Instead, what you want is to come to a product review with one decision, but the goal of that decision is to walk out with principles about how to make these decisions in the future so that you don't have to come to product review, but you still have this consistent and coherent product that you're building.\n\n(00:21:04):\nAnd so I think when you flip the frame of reviews to being less about, okay, I'm going to bring this information to an exec, my manager, whoever, and they're going to decide every piece, you're not actually building that much more capacity in the system. You're getting fast decision making, but you're not changing who can make really good decisions. And I think you always want to change the org to constantly make better decisions, and a way to do that is when you bring these sorts of questions, what you talk about is, why did you make this decision? What are the trade-offs you have in mind? Who are you optimizing for? What timeline are you thinking about? What's the risk level we're willing to tolerate? And then you don't have to come back. You have enough information that you can take those principles and run with them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:51):\nIs there a framework or a process you use for product reviews that might be helpful for people to hear? Just like a agenda or a way of thinking about just how to set up a product review for success? Because a lot of people are trying to set these up at their companies and they're like, I don't know if we're doing this optimally.\n\nAmi Vora (00:22:05):\nYeah, I think everyone's got... I think there's so many different takes on frameworks. I don't have a single system. I mean, actually I think Boz has written about a bunch of this, and I probably most agree with him. Where there's different kinds of product reviews, it's like, what are you trying to solve? What's the timeline on which you're thinking about for these? Is it a philosophy? Is it a strategic shift? Is it a day-to-day product decision? And then keeping it extremely short and pointed and then making sure you walk away with principles, not answers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:36):\nI think there's a lot of nuance and importance there of what you just said, which is start with the problem you're solving. What are we trying to do here? And the timeline, I think that's also really useful and important for people to hear.\n\nAmi Vora (00:22:47):\nI think the temptation is always to err toward writing more, and what I always really recommend people do is write whatever you need to write and then cut out almost all of it. What you really want to bring to any forum, whether it's a product review or a written inform or anything else, is the minimal amount of information that you need to make a clean recommendation because then you are forced to be opinionated. Otherwise, the opinion can get lost in all of this information. You can hide behind, well, all of these analyses seem to suggest, and instead you should probably just say, looked at all the data, there's three analyses that suggest this. There's one that suggests that, we think that one is inaccurate or worth taking the risk on. Let's go. Any objections? Let me know. Any new context? Let me know. That really forces you to deeply understand and take an opinion on the material.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):\nFinal question, who do you like to invite to these product reviews and your thoughts, rules, policy?\n\nAmi Vora (00:23:50):\nYeah, I mean I do think that usually fewer people is better. It leads to a sense of being informal and that is really useful because it lowers the bar on how complete or strong these conversations are and I'd rather have a less formal conversation faster than a formal conversation and lose three weeks in the process when we could have been building. I think it needs to be cross-functional. I think one of the things you want is cross-functional accountability. So we want it cross-functional at the leadership level and cross-functional at the team presenting level. And I think those are normally the groups.\n\n(00:24:25):\nI think the thing that gets hard is you often cut out the middle, where if it's a working team presenting to the senior leaders on something important, it's really hard because it means people's managers are not in the room and can't help the conversation or other things. And so in order to do that, you have to really have a bunch of implicit trust inside the team that everyone will get the context later, that everyone's going to be kind to everyone else and you don't need a ton of air cover, and that the managers trust their team to present in the best possible way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):\nThat is always a stressful place for a manager to be, where their success is riding in that meeting and they're not there and they-\n\nAmi Vora (00:25:07):\nIt's so stressful, it's so stressful. I think anything you do to make it less stressful is useful. But then there've also been times in my career where I would keep the room itself small, but because we were all trying to calibrate on specific principles, I would record or broadcast the reading to anyone who wanted to see it, just so they could all see the principles by which we were decision-making and get calibrated on that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:32):\nSo through your career you've transitioned from being the person pitching the products and being reviewed to the person reviewing and being on the other side. Is there anything being on this side of it that you think is helpful for people earlier in their career to know about that experience, from your angle now?\n\nAmi Vora (00:25:53):\nI mean, I think for what it's worth, I think I still do a fair amount of product pitching in the past few years because there's always someone else to convince.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):\nThat's true.\n\nAmi Vora (00:26:01):\nEspecially if you want to do something dramatically different. Really, I think the biggest service for people who are starting out a little earlier is that point around bringing the recommendation, really having the opinion and standing behind it with conviction and doing what they need to do to build that conviction for themselves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):\nAwesome. You've done this a number of times already in this conversation, and so I want to spend a little time here, which is using metaphors and imagery to make your point and get people to understand what you're trying to say. So you have this code of putting on the coat of the job and this dinosaur brain, and so someone told me that this is just a skill you have where you use metaphor and imagery to rally a team, get your point across, get people to understand what you're trying to say. There's also this metaphor, someone told me I need to ask you about the hill climb metaphor. Does that ring a bell?\n\nAmi Vora (00:26:52):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:53):\nOkay, what is that all about?\n\nAmi Vora (00:26:55):\nFor me, the hill climb is all about the difference between the local optimum and a global optimum. That sounds very abstract, but I think a lot of the time when we're doing our job, when we're doing life stuff, whatever you're doing, you try to just get better and better and you optimize your current system and then you feel really good about it, and that is great. You're standing on top of the hill, you're looking down, you can see the, I don't know, rolling hills, the sheep, the grass, whatever. But then way off from the distance you can see a mountain, one that's even higher than you can't even see the top of it, and you have to decide, are you going to take the risk of climbing down your hill, crossing an unknown chasm, and then climbing back up, just to get to the same level you started at with more climbing to do to get to that summit? And that is really hard.\n\n(00:27:51):\nI'm thinking of things like, maybe the first time I saw this was like a lot of companies were really good at desktop and you could see the mobile mountain way out over there, but to get there you had to really make a lot of trade-offs in your core desktop business that you were not totally sure were going to pay off when you made it to the mobile mountain, and you had to do a ton of work. You had to fundamentally rewire a lot of what you're doing without a guarantee that you're going to get there. I mean, you can see it in life when you think about new jobs or new moves or new relationships, anything that you think about. You are giving up something that is working pretty well without knowing whether you're going to make it to the top of that next mountain. And that's been really helpful to me just to place where I am on different things, where you get the inkling that there is a much better way to do this, there really is.\n\n(00:28:48):\nIs it going to be worth going down into the valley, climbing up, keeping climbing? Is that going to be worth it? Most of the time the answer is yes, but it's helpful for me to know, boy, this feels like a slog. It is supposed to? Because I'm still in the valley and the thing that gets me through the valley is remembering what the summit feels like. When you're on top of it and you're like, this is great, it was absolutely worth it. My life is better in these ways, we're able to solve these problems in these ways. It was worth it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:19):\nI love that. It feels like a big value of the metaphor, which I love is that to set expectations, it's going to be really hard for a little bit or we will slow down what we're trying to do now, but the idea is there's a bigger hill and a bigger mountain.\n\nAmi Vora (00:29:32):\nIt's a bigger hill and it's worth it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:34):\nOn this kind of broader idea of metaphors and imagery, is there something there that you've learned of just like, this works really well, I'm going to invest in becoming better at this, or is this something that's come natural to you? Anything you can share about that skill and approach?\n\nAmi Vora (00:29:46):\nI think this one came from, I worked for a manager, his name was Eric Antino, and he was just a master of the metaphor and analogies. And so whenever I would bring him something, he would be like, how is this product going to make you feel, and when is the last time that you felt this way? And you can say, oh, I felt this way when I was hanging with my friends in Dolores Park and he'd be like, cool, tell me what it feels like, why that's the analogy, what ramifications come out of that?\n\n(00:30:18):\nAnd one thing I like to do is try to build an emulator for different people in my head, because I've just had the good fortune of working with an amazing number of very different leaders, and so he's one of the people I tried to build an emulator for where I'd be like, okay, I see this thing. I don't know how to solve this problem. How would Eric describe this? I've tried to build one for Boz, which is all about principle of decision making and principle of trade-offs. There's a few other people where I'm like, I don't know how to solve this problem. Can I load this other person into my head and how would they approach it? And that gives me a fresh lens on it.\n\n(00:30:55):\nAnd I really like metaphors and analogies because I think especially as you scale a team, narrative becomes increasingly important. Narrative can carry so much weight and water where otherwise it's similar to the product review point, where either you can tell everybody exactly what to do at every point or you can create a story that we all agree on. And when we all agree on that story, people just know better what to do. If we all agree that the feeling of something should be, I'm sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday. You know what the iconography, the designers know what iconography should look like. You know what the communication and join pattern should look like. You're not going to build something cold and corporate, you're not going to build something strobe light, you're not going to build something flashy, but you don't have to go and make all those individual decisions. You can buy into the same story and then people will just naturally build something that feels more consistent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:56):\nThis is such a powerful and important skill. Is there an example that comes to mind where you did this really well, say at WhatsApp or Facebook of the story that carried a lot of water for you and the team?\n\nAmi Vora (00:32:08):\nYeah, I mean I think the product metaphor we arrived at for WhatsApp was face-to-face communication. Our goal there was to make it so that every person in the world could feel connected to the people they cared most about, even when they were separate, even they're distant geographically for whatever reason, we were always going to be apart from the people you cared about. And we really had to build something that would work for literally everyone in the world. People who are carrying these high-end devices in western markets who are very tech comfortable and savvy, and people in the low end markets who were carrying these low end devices, they weren't that familiar with technology, it was maybe their first time online. We had to build something that worked for everyone.\n\n(00:32:57):\nAnd the most universal form of communication is face-to-face. When you talk to someone face-to-face, you're not thinking, how do I present? What tool do I have to learn? You just open your mouth and words come out, and that's the feeling that we wanted to create. And that involved a lot of the app stepping back from communication, creating spaces that felt really intimate so people wouldn't have to think to themselves, what kind of space am I in? They could immediately map where they were in the app to the, okay, I'm sitting around in my kitchen table and people are joining and leaving calls just like they're walking in and out of my living room, but it is a family space and the family is there. Or, in one-on-one disappearing messages, you're like, cool, this is my close friend. We don't need to keep track of everything that we're saying. We're here for a little bit of banter, a little bit of relationship, a little bit of quick, what's your wifi password and stuff, and whatever's really important, that's what we'll hold onto and the rest is just day-to-day, normal intimacy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:58):\nThat is super interesting. WhatsApp, one of the main differentiators and benefits is it's super fast. And I see completely how it connects this idea of you're just like, ideas, we want you to feel like you're talking to someone.\n\nAmi Vora (00:34:09):\nAnd it's all really a small thing. It's like a typing indicator is like someone who's about to take a breath, give them a second to talk, the two check marks lighting up or someone's face lighting up when they hear you, it's just a recognition of being heard. These are all super small things, but I think they add up to a feeling of being there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):\nThat is super interesting. So I love this very tactical piece of advice that you just shared of just when you're trying to come up with a metaphor or analogy, think about what you want your users to feel when you're using the product and when else have they felt that same feeling? So interesting. And then this other point you made of making this emulator of a person in your head.\n\nAmi Vora (00:34:49):\nI mean, it sounds a little wild now that I think about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:51):\nNo.\n\nAmi Vora (00:34:51):\nThat's robotic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:52):\nIt makes total sense.\n\nAmi Vora (00:34:55):\nI get very bored a lot. It's another way to make sure meetings are really interesting where you're like, okay, let me see what that person is going to say next. Let me put myself in their shoes. Let me think about what they're reacting to and why they're going to think that and how they're going to see the world. And again, it just gives me more toolkits because it means when I'm stumped on something, I can be like, what would Rob Goldman say? He'd say, look at the dashboard. Have I looked at the dashboard? No. Okay, let me go look at the dashboard. You can load up these different skillsets that people have been so generous with sharing with me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:28):\nWhat would be the Ami emulator? What are people thinking when they loaded it?\n\nAmi Vora (00:35:33):\nFascinating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:33):\nFascinating?\n\nAmi Vora (00:35:35):\nFascinating, probably the number one, no joke.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:37):\nIs there an emulator you most often come back to that you find most useful in just in your day-to-day? Who's the person that like, oh yeah-\n\nAmi Vora (00:35:44):\nI think those are the three. I think it is like Antino's story. Story, metaphor, analogy creation. I think it's like Boz's, if we played this out, what principles are we using? And if we kept on using those principles, what would happen? And it is Rob Goldman, who's an amazing metrics growth product leader being like, look at the dashboard. I mean, look at the dashboard, which is a great central rooting part of my life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:16):\nThis was so fascinating, fascinating.\n\nAmi Vora (00:36:19):\nIt revs up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:20):\nI love this topic of just metaphors and stories and visions and things like that. It's something that a lot of people are wanting to get better at. Is there another example, per chance, that you could share of maybe using a metaphor to rally team, get things done?\n\nAmi Vora (00:36:34):\nI mean, I think taking a sub part of WhatsApp or when we talk about video calling. I really, one the metaphors was sitting around in your family room when you think about how to make calls work, where when you're sitting in a family room, you're not scheduling it, you're not, I don't know, having this cold corporate feeling, the way you do with a conference where there's heavyweight interactions, and instead there's just, you can join and leave. It feels lightweight, it feels like the space exists even when you're not there. And so just creating things like joinable calls, like that feeling of people popping in and just paying attention to whoever's there and letting them leave, but the call can flow on without a super heavyweight action that everyone needs to take. I think that was another one where we were just able to agree on the feeling and then you know what to build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):\nI was just using WhatsApp to do video call with my mom. They were traveling to Italy and so-\n\nAmi Vora (00:37:30):\nThat's great, that's exactly [inaudible 00:37:33].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:32):\nI experienced it, it felt great.\n\n(00:37:35):\nLet me go in a slightly different direction. One of my favorite posts of yours is called execution beats strategy every time, and I think another way you phrase it is, execution eats strategy for breakfast. I think you put that somewhere. I'd love to hear about this because I completely agree. I think a lot of people obsess with strategy and vision and got to get this right and forget that most of the work is execution. So yeah, I'd love to hear just your take and insight here.\n\nAmi Vora (00:37:58):\nYeah, I don't know if I coined execution eats strategy for breakfast, I think a lot of things eat other things for breakfast, but I'm a believer. I do think execution eats strategy for breakfast and that's something we used to say a lot at Meta. It was just the most important part and I was well-trained in that. That was one of the key lessons that I learned there, and it's because when you have... Look, strategy is super fun. You get to think about all this pie in the sky stuff. You get to think about if the world operated in rational patterns and you could predict the future, what is going to be the second and third order effect? You get to use your brain in a really fun, philosophical way, but customers don't care. Customers don't care about your fancy strategies and your five-year plan. They care about the product that's in their hands. And so anything that distracts you from thinking about the product in your hands I think, or maybe worse, takes you away from solving customer's problems today, I think is a distraction.\n\n(00:39:03):\nAnd I think one of the things that you learn is if you have great strategy, perfect strategy but poor execution, you don't win because your strategy never makes it to the market. And what's even worse is that you have learned nothing. You don't know whether it was your strategy that was wrong or whether it was your execution that was wrong, all you know is you didn't win. Whereas when you have a pretty good strategy, a good enough strategy, you're in the right direction and you have perfect execution, you still don't win immediately, but you know your execution was great. So then you learn, what do you need to do to improve your strategy? You've got the execution machine, you go back, you update your strategy, you relaunch, and you keep on doing it until your strategy is perfect and then you do win. And that's the lesson I repeatedly learned.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:50):\nIs this advice a reaction to what you said, where people, PMs let's say, are just like, I want to work on strategy, we got to spend all this time, get the strategy nailed, and it's just like, okay, we also need to execute and that's maybe even more important.\n\nAmi Vora (00:40:02):\nYeah, I do think it's very glamorous to work on strategy. It's so fun. It's so fun to have the word strategy in your [inaudible 00:40:11]. I don't know, we've built a mythology around strategy being the most important thing. And execution is not glamorous, it is not like white-boarding by yourself and pointing to things and coming out with the grand vision. It is the nuts and bolts and sometimes boring, sometimes grind it out work of like, you got to bring the donuts, you got to look at the dashboards, you got to rewrite the spec. You got to just do a bunch of the grinding, but that is what leads to the customer's outcomes. That is what the customer is eventually going to feel. They're never going to see the whiteboard, they're going to see that someone took the time to fix this bug.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:53):\nThis episode is brought to you by User Testing, transform how you build products and experiences with User Testing.

I guess, how do you think about this when they're trying to move up the ranks, become better product managers? Is this just a common thing that you often share, like yeah, strategy is going to be amazing, important. You got to get good at it, but also make sure this is going great.\n\nAmi Vora (00:41:57):\nYeah, I think about it a little bit in terms of proportion of time you should expect to spend. So I mean, there's no point next being on that strategy, you can't have a bad strategy. So you should spend some time, maybe it's like 20% of your time, but the bulk of your time should be confirming that strategy actually makes sense for the customers. Getting it out there, building the machine to constantly make it better, as opposed to a perfect strategy. You go away, you build it for a year, you ship it, the market has changed. Customers have changed, their needs have changed, competition, just the whole landscape has changed and you probably could have solved those problems more easily had you headed in the right direction, but done it with more ongoing customer feedback.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:39):\nIn terms of this proportion, I imagine what you see is as you get more senior, more of your time spent on strategy, less time on execution, right?\n\nAmi Vora (00:42:46):\nI don't 100% know that that's true. I think again, even at high levels, maybe the strategic directions become more important to get mostly right, but I think still most of your time is making sure they can make it to market. I think you should still be spending your time understanding what's slowing people down and unblocking it. Understanding, how is the market changing? Understanding what the broad customer feedback is, just constantly improving the system that you are building. I think that's, I mean, how much time can you spend thinking about the future, as opposed to actually trying to create it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:29):\nThat is really interesting advice because I think most people imagine as you get more senior, I'm going to have more time thinking about vision and strategy, not have to be in the weeds building things. And I love this point you're making of even as a senior exec, you're still, it's executing in a different way, but it's still execution.\n\nAmi Vora (00:43:44):\nA different way, yeah. You're focusing on the execution of the system a little bit more, but you got to stay connected, I think, to the customer and to what you're bringing to them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:54):\nI love that. Obviously, strategy is also very important. You have this great quote that I'm going to read here. \"For strategy to be useful, it actually has to change our behavior as a team to create better customer outcomes.\" Can you talk about that?\n\nAmi Vora (00:44:08):\nYeah. I mean, I think again, some of the joy of strategy is the philosophy and excitement of thinking about all the long-term stuff that will happen, but I try to always come back to, what's going to change for the customer? If we have all of these conversations and we come out with this shiny five-year plan, but then we change nothing about the products that we're building or how we are building, what was the point of that exercise? It made us feel good, and there's something to making us feel good. That is good, it's important for teams to feel good and connected and this is a good exercise for that, but it's so much more powerful when it's an exercise that translates into us doing something differently, whether that's prioritizing different products, whether that's changing our portfolio allocation, like moving people to the things we think are most important now versus things that are going to be less important right now. What's the change, or coming out with a strategy that'll align people because we have the story, we have the narrative, we have the sequence. What's going to change for our customers as a result of this strategy exercise?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):\nMany people want to get better at strategy. Often their performance feedback is become more strategic, think better about strategy. What has helped you become a better strategic thinker? Is it just doing it? Is it a person that influenced you heavily? Is it a book? What has helped you and what do you often recommend to people to get better at this skill?\n\nAmi Vora (00:45:30):\nI think I got that same feedback quite a lot, actually, of needing to think bigger and be more visionary, etc. And I still do, frankly, actually, there's moments where I retrench way too far into execution and worry a little less about long-term strategy. So it's definitely my bias still.\n\n(00:45:49):\nThe biggest thing that held me back from talking about strategy was I didn't feel confident that I knew enough to declare a strategy. It was actually almost like a self-confidence, imposter syndrome thing, where there were people who could just say, I know how the world is going to develop in the next five years, and let me tell you, here's where we're going to be, this is the dot on the map. And I was always like, how could anything could happen? Who would I be to say I know how the world's going to develop and here's where we're heading?\n\n(00:46:21):\nAnd so for me, a lot of it was actually learning the things that made me feel confident in my own opinion. And there's a bunch of things that do make me feel confident in my opinion. When I talk to specific customers and I feel like I can build an emulator for them, like a customer on my shoulder where I can say, oh, I talked to this person working in this job, here's what they would say if I showed them this product or this strategy. So, I think talking to customers is a big unlock for me and feeling like I have unique knowledge of the customer. I think working through different product iterations of, if we thought this was the right outcome, what would it really look like from a product perspective or a product portfolio in three to five years? And which of those seems right or rational or it will go the way I think the world goes. I think asking for other opinions. Sometimes I run surveys to the leadership team where I'm just like, what percentage of our revenue is going to come from small businesses versus big businesses in three years? And if we all agree on that topic, we should just take it as the truth and we should just fill it. If we disagree, then we should talk about it and we should talk about the strategic ramifications if we chose one path or the other path.\n\n(00:47:35):\nSo for me, it was getting more comfortable having an opinion, honestly, about how the world was going to go, and also feeling comfortable that we would be able to change it when we learned that maybe that wasn't exactly right. We would have the machine, the execution machine behind it to try it out and then change and iterate and improve with customer feedback.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:59):\nAt which point in your career was this overcoming this fear and uncertainty? Was it sometime within Facebook?\n\nAmi Vora (00:48:07):\nIt was sometime within Facebook. It was really when I was stepping into the bigger ads jobs, getting to be Head of Product for Facebook ads. I got feedback, I got a lot of feedback over the course of my career and some of the stacking of feedback was basically like, you could be the smartest person in the room, but it doesn't matter if people don't like you, which is very complicated feedback and I wouldn't give that feedback to anyone else, but I took it very seriously. It was coming from so many different places, it was coming from people I'm really trusted. And so I went out of my way to be more likable, which for me ended up being shrinking myself a little bit and not being so aggressive and not being so opinionated, being more unobjectionable.\n\n(00:49:07):\nAnd the weird part is that it worked for a long time. People were more likely to work with me, they were more likely to say nice things. I mean, I take this to extremes. I wore earth tones for two years because I was just like, I got to fade back a little bit. And then at some point I actually had to do a leadership job and my team was like, well, what do you think? What's your opinion? And I was like, you've been telling me not to have an opinion for so long. And so it took a little bit of work to get back to, oh yeah, I have a lot of opinions, I have a lot of thoughts. It is okay for me to express. It is needed, my team needs me to have these opinions and thoughts and be a leader who can take ownership and be visible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:52):\nThanks for sharing that. Do you think that was the right approach, going and indexing far to the other end and then realizing that maybe that's too far, or do you think you would've done things differently looking back?\n\nAmi Vora (00:50:05):\nYeah, it's one of my Roman empires. I think about this every so often, way too much, I think. Especially because I talked to other senior women who received similar feedback and chose not to act on it or did act on it, and what happened to their paths were different. I think where I landed is I wouldn't give that feedback to someone else. And the way I do give that feedback, actually, because I think there is a lot of really useful information in that. The way I do give that feedback is, you do need to be able to work with a broader range of people and the way to do that is to expand your tool sets. You're not going to make yourself smaller, you're not going to be any less of who you are, but you are going to build new tools, new keys to unlock new different kinds of doors. And that is only going to make you bigger and more powerful and more expansive. But the end outcome is the same, is that you can work with more different styles of people, more different styles of problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:08):\nI love that framing. There's an episode that's going to come out before this episode with this professor from Stanford, Jeffrey Pfeffer, who teaches a class called The Path to Power, which is how to become powerful in the world. And he actually has a big lesson that many people hate hearing, which is, you don't need to be authentic in the workplace, what you're trying to achieve, you're trying to achieve stuff and you can do... You need to use tools that you need to use to achieve the thing you want to achieve. So sometimes don't be exactly who you are and act in a slightly different way, which is basically what you're describing.\n\nAmi Vora (00:51:42):\nMore tools. I think that's a theme that's coming up, is just like, I'm all about more lenses, more keys, more tools in general because why not? Why not have access to more different styles of things?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:54):\nSomething that you were talking about subtly is the being a woman in tech and being a female leader. I imagine you've gone through some stuff that isn't what something men would've gone through. Is there anything there that you want to share or anything you've learned about just being really successful as a woman in tech?\n\nAmi Vora (00:52:13):\nI think we've talked through some of them. I think one, you get a different style of feedback and a lot of the ways to interpret that feedback. I think to this day, I get feedback that is about walking a very narrow tightrope where not only do you have to change a bunch of things and do a bunch of things that are important, you have to make people feel a certain way about how you do them and the ways that they want you to make you feel are diametrically opposite. Some people are going to be like, be more directive so that way everyone knows your thing. Some people are going to say be less directive so people can come to their own conclusions. Some people are going to say move faster because there's always more you can do. Some people are going to say move less fast because otherwise you're going to end up steamrolling people.\n\n(00:52:57):\nAnd a lot of it is personal, there's a bunch research about how women get a lot more personal feedback that is less about the content of their role and more about their style, I think that is still true and there's often a kernel of truth in it. For me, this is forever work. I do have biases toward execution and being directive and things like that, but I think learning how to interpret and respond to feedback has been a really important point for me and making my choices of, just because I'm getting feedback doesn't mean I immediately need to respond to all of it. There's a step in between where I can choose, is this feedback I want to take action on in this exact way? Am I going to look for more themes, take action in a different way, or am I going to say this is who I am and I understand the trade-offs, I'm going to do a better job of giving people context on the decisions I'm making and why I'm choosing these trade-offs. But actually this is part of how I want to operate and I'm going to keep on operating.\n\n(00:54:01):\nAnd then I think we just give women weird advice. Here's a hot take. I think we tell women things like, you need to find a mentor and you need to find a sponsor, and that's just another set of hoops that we have that we tell women to jump through that I don't think we tell other parts of the population to jump through. I think we tell women to unlock your future success, you've got to find somebody who has made all the same life decisions you have and who you look up to and relate to, but who also had an hour every month to be an oracle to tell you all the things you do in your life. And it feels like yet another burden where you're like, I don't know how to do that.\n\n(00:54:45):\nI had the extreme generosity of so many wonderful leaders who helped me on my way, but I didn't feel like I had this mentor and for a while it was just like, oh man, if I only had a mentor, I would know how to do all of this stuff and it felt like another weight that I needed to carry, which I didn't. I had everything I needed, people were so kind and generous, but I didn't recognize it that way because we talk about it differently.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:09):\nThank you for sharing all that. I wasn't planning on going in this direction, but this is such important advice for say, young women that are just getting started in the same product. Is there any advice you'd want to share to help them get to be the next Ami?\n\nAmi Vora (00:55:23):\nOh, I mean number one, no next Ami, they're going to be their next themselves. That is maybe the most important thing, is everyone will only tell you their own story. That's all anyone can do, but the thing that I tell people is, don't dampen who you are and your strengths, just continue expanding. Whenever you run into a problem, just add more to the things that you can do, the tools that you have, the way you can express yourself. Just keep on adding and growing and don't shrink yourself, ever.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):\nI love that. I want to move to a different topic. There's a few things I definitely wanted to touch on while we had our time together. One is that I hear, now this is going to be a total tangent, but I think it's really important and I'm excited to talk about it. I hear you're really good at setting goals and aligning incentives really well for teams. One of your colleagues told me you're best in class at building product orgs and figuring out how product orgs can best work with other teams. I'm curious if there's any tricks or lessons you can share here about what you've learned about how to do this well.\n\nAmi Vora (00:56:27):\nYeah, I mean I think one thing is to try to decouple all the things we're trying to do. Sometimes when you give people direction, you're like, okay, everybody just go get revenue or everybody just go get GMV. And it seems obvious because that's the thing you have to do as a company, but there's only a few places where you are guaranteed to get that and it's measurable and you can do it. And that leads to what I call toddler soccer, where everybody just runs to the same surface or the same customer set or the same exact product where you can do this and it's measurable and you end up, everyone's tripping on each other, everyone's trying, nobody really gets contact on the ball, there's no coordination. I have three kids, I've watched a lot of toddlers play soccer. [inaudible 00:57:18], it's a very fresh, very fresh metaphor.\n\n(00:57:20):\nAnd instead, one of the things I like to do is just detangle, okay, as a company, let's think about our customers. Let's think about all the things they're going to need in their journey. Let's think about how we will know how we will match our own metrics to customer success. Let's play the entire field. What would it look like if we could detangle it so that every team we had internally had a different goal that ladders into a goal framework that's actually the thing that we need to do to solve the full customer impact? And then you don't have the same swim lanes problem. You have plenty of room for people to make progress on their lanes. They all know how they fit into the bigger picture, and it just opens up a lot more growth for every team and it makes sure that we're solving the customer problem end to end.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:11):\nIs there an example that you could share to make this even more concrete from say, WhatsApp or Facebook or Instagram or anything like that, where you can share some of these goals that you've like, oh, this worked out really well? I know it's probably private information and partly-\n\nAmi Vora (00:58:25):\nIt might be trickier. I mean, maybe going back to the GMV example. Maybe instead of motivating everyone on GMV, you motivate them on GMV per surface and you divide up the surfaces, or maybe you motivate them on actually different goals that underlie. When you think about GMV, what are all the various engagements, customer engagements that lead to GMV? Can you goal on those input metrics, can you goal on number of people who visit, number of people who convert, number of people who reorder, number, etc? Rather than going strictly on the output.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:59):\nSo the core advice here is each team should have different goals that are part of this metrics tree that ladder up to revenue, GMV, something like that?\n\nAmi Vora (00:59:07):\nWhatever, yeah. The thing that best matches the overall customer outcome that mirrors the company outcome as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):\nGot it. And there's always this balance between it's actually the best metric versus it's something they can move and understand and it's easy to watch and it's movable and things like that, right?\n\nAmi Vora (00:59:24):\nYeah, and you have to have faith that it is actually connected to that output metric. You don't want to create a metric that's disconnected just to make a team feel good. It really does need to solve the customer problem and that's reflected in company's performance, but you can usually break it down into smaller pieces and I think that breaking down into smaller pieces and assigning those out to teams, that's really helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):\nIs there anything else along these lines of things you've learned about helping teams work together and not play toddler soccer, beyond having different goals that all ladder up to the one that really matters?\n\nAmi Vora (00:59:58):\nI think there's value in also acknowledging that teams are going to have different incentives. Even inside a team like cross-functional teams on the same pod or whatever, are going to have different incentives, they're going to come in with different information, they're going to have disagreements. And certainly, different teams inside a company or different pillars inside a company, different products inside, they're all going to have different incentives, and I think sometimes that feels like something is going wrong when people disagree, but actually, that's just a sign of healthy tension and knowledge.\n\n(01:00:34):\nI think the thing that makes tension healthy is one, when you can acknowledge it and say, yeah, of course there's tension. You're bringing different information than I'm bringing. We should be disagreeing. No one's a bad person, no one is coming in with poor intent. Everyone's doing the thing they are supposed to do and that is a useful thing to do. And then you have to agree on an outcome that you're aiming for. If you disagree on what the company outcome is or what the customer outcome is, then you've got some structural stuff you need to work out and normally you just have to escalate it, but if you agree on like, we're all trying to move this metric by changing this customer experience, then all you're doing is having a conversation about the best way to do that using the different information that everyone is bringing. And I think that's super important to just have as a rational, open, explicit discussion, as opposed to trying to hide it or pocket vetoing or something else. Because you assume that when someone disagrees with you that, I don't know, there's something emotional or wrong about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:37):\nBut it's fascinating.\n\nAmi Vora (01:01:40):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):\nThere's a piece of advice I once heard from the Head of Product at Airbnb once where we were trying to find, reorg the business and try to figure out the best org and his advice and something he realized is, there's never the best org, there's just the best idea we have at the time with the here's the things we know are not going to be optimal about it and let's build processes around that.\n\nAmi Vora (01:01:59):\nI think that's my take on leadership in general. Especially as you get more senior, you can only make bad decisions. At some point someone can bring you a problem, you can recognize a problem and you can solve it, and there's so much happiness in solving that and tying a bow around it. But as you get senior, the only problems you'll see are ones that are fundamentally unsolvable because otherwise, someone would've solved it before they got to you. And so all you're doing is choosing which branch of suboptimal you're going to put your name on and describing the principles you're using and the context and the fact that it's suboptimal, but it's still the best thing. I think that's a really hard thing, is just to recognize and acknowledge that increasingly people only see you do, make suboptimal decisions and from a distance they're just like, why is that person only making bad decisions? And it's because those are your only options. All you can do is choose the least bad, the best possible for the time, for the problem that's consistent that makes sense with the framework, and that's been a tough thing to learn too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:10):\nYou said somewhere that as you get more senior, you get worse at everything because the problems get harder.\n\nAmi Vora (01:03:14):\nYes, exactly. I mean, it's a kind of dark view of leadership where yeah, you can't fully solve problems, you have to say no a lot people are unhappy with you. I thought as you get more senior, everyone listens to you and they like you and you could just say a thing and then it happens and that is not at all accurate. It really is, most of the decisions you make are not going to be perfect.\n\n(01:03:42):\nAnd I think I'm all about just normalizing and acknowledging those hard truths because otherwise, I feel like I'm failing. And if I just know that something is normal that it's part of the job, then it's not me. It's just like, okay, this is a fact of the job that I have to get accustomed to if I want to have this kind of impact. And there's something about having the impact, being able to serve the customer, being able to be part of this team, there's something about it that is so worthwhile that it's worth being terrible at everything and being visibly terrible at everything because that is the best way that I have to have that kind of impact in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:21):\nI think this is really important for early ICPMs to hear because they see their CPO and founders making all these decisions and they're like, what the hell? That's a terrible idea, why are they doing this? What you're saying is just like it's the best... Options are limited and then-\n\nAmi Vora (01:04:38):\n[inaudible 01:04:38].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:38):\n... nothing's going to be optimal.\n\nAmi Vora (01:04:39):\nYeah, no org is optimal. It's definitely not. You can optimize for the people you have and you can optimize for the products you have, can optimize for the customers you have and you can optimize for the technology you have. Those are the options that you have, and in every one of those you trade off everything else. And so you just have to know, there's not going to be a perfect where all of it works and that's okay. That is part of the fun of it. That's part of getting to do this work, is continuing to improve, but it's hard. It's hard when people, it's hard, especially when you want everyone to think you're so great at everything.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):\nThis idea you mentioned of as a senior person solving people's problems, feeling really good, reminds me. Rolling to this, there's this Harvard Business Review article from the '70s or '80s or something about monkeys on your back. Have you read this or heard of this?\n\nAmi Vora (01:05:24):\nOh yeah, yeah, I did.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:26):\nWhere it's basically like as a manager, [inaudible 01:05:28]-\n\nAmi Vora (01:05:28):\nYou're trying to get monkey off of your back on people's backs?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:28):\nExactly.\n\nAmi Vora (01:05:28):\nRight, right, right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:32):\nPeople come to you, Ami, here's my monkey, please take it for me and feed it for me and take care of it. And your job as a leader is to keep the monkeys on people's backs and help them figure out how to feed this monkey themself.\n\nAmi Vora (01:05:43):\nIt's a weird one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:43):\nTo get it off their back. It's very visceral. I want to talk about Faire and your current role as a final section of our chat. First of all, what was it like starting something completely new after 15 years at Meta at the various properties of Meta?\n\nAmi Vora (01:06:00):\nYeah, I mean, I was so lucky. I had such an amazing run at Meta. I got to work with amazing leaders, truly great products. And I came to Faire for the same reason that I've been anywhere, because I believe in the people and I believe in the mission. A lot of my family in India is in wholesale and local retail, which is what Faire does, and so it was also a very personal thing for me too. I felt like I knew those customers. I'm a huge fan of small businesses, I got to work with a bunch of them in previous jobs as well.\n\n(01:06:30):\nI would say coming to Faire, I mean, one of the things I always think about is that especially as you are more senior, ramping on anywhere feels terrible because you expect to be as good at your new job as you were when you left your last job, but you forget that at your last job, you were there for years, you had years to build up the vocabulary and the cultural context and the network and the product knowledge, and then you're stepping in somewhere where you know none of that, but you have the same expectations of yourself of being able to have an impact and improve things and help your team. And so I always just try to remind myself, it's going to take time and what's most important is not for me to try to come in and change everything immediately, but to learn enough to be able to change things like 60 or 90 or 120 days in the future. And so that breathing helps a little bit.\n\n(01:07:29):\nIt was also really interesting because Faire was entirely new to me. It was a new business model, it was a whole new set of people. It was a whole new set of customer problems. And so every interaction I just had to learn so much. I had to learn, who is this person? How do they see the world? What's the problem they're talking to me about? What's the customer impact, I think? So it was just a dramatic learning curve, which I always really love.\n\n(01:07:54):\nMaybe the last thing I'd say is, again, I was super lucky at Meta. I think I always had this maybe deep-seated insecurity that maybe I was only good at Meta. Maybe there was something about that network of people and how great they were and how well I knew those products, and maybe I wouldn't be that successful somewhere without that scaffolding. And so leaving and being able to go somewhere else and lead through change and a new place, a new customer set, a new business model, that's also been really, really affirming for me, honestly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:34):\nWell, you have a lot of fans at Faire from the people I know there.\n\nAmi Vora (01:08:36):\n[inaudible 01:08:36].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:36):\nAnd so clearly, things are going well, at least as far as I can tell. Something that I think is, Faire definitely has, and a lot of companies have, is a very product minded visionary founder. And CPOs classically last a year or two, and then they're like, ah, this sucks. The founder just tells me what to do and what's the point of this role? And it's so frustrating. I'm curious just what you've learned about, at least so far, about working with someone like that as a CPO and not just being this middle person between what the founder wants to do with the team, this building.\n\nAmi Vora (01:09:09):\nYeah, I mean, this is going to sound so naive, but I literally didn't know how important it was for me to have such a great relationship with the CEO, because I always had great relation, I was lucky, I had great relationships with a lot of people at my previous jobs. I was like, oh, of course it's going to be fine, everyone's going to let me do what I want, whatever. And I think I just got really lucky because Max is an amazing CEO, who's also super growth mindset and super open to talking over ideas, even when they involve a lot of change.\n\n(01:09:42):\nSo when I was onboarding, one of the things I always like to do is write a list of observations. I go out and talk to, I have one-on-ones with a lot of people, and I write, here's the themes that I'm hearing. Here's what's going well, here's what's not going well. And that's a way for me to both share what I'm seeing and build some credibility and trust that way, but also for people to give me feedback and be like, oh, you're wrong about this, just so I can correct my starting point of knowledge.\n\n(01:10:10):\nAnd with Max, I also wrote a parallel document of hot takes. So once a quarter or so for the first year, I'd write a document that was just like, hey, for sake of provocation, if we wanted to fundamentally change a few things, here's ideas on what we could fundamentally change. And Max, very, very well could have just been like, hey, can you please just run product? That's you're job, can you please do that? And instead, he and the entire rest of the executive team were like, yeah, let's step through these. Let's talk about which of these we should try, let's talk about maybe context you don't have for why these don't make sense or why we don't do these. And that was such a gift because I was able to build such a great relationship, a trusting and complimentary relationship with Max and the rest of the exec team, and also that he took seriously things that he really didn't have to that I have so much respect for that, and I think I got really lucky in just finding a great CEO and exec team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:18):\nIs there anything you learned about this vetting process? Say you're a founder looking for a head of product, A CPO, any advice for how they might vet this person to make sure they are good fit and will last?\n\nAmi Vora (01:11:32):\nWhat I'd say to everyone else is, make sure you just have a mind meld with a CEO. Before you decide to take the job, spend a day together, understand how they think and how they operate, and whether you're going to work together in a way that feels really high fidelity and high trust and you're going to have room. I mean, I'm not a founder by any stretch and so when founders ask me what should I look for in a head of product or CPO, I say something a little bit different, which is, make sure that you really need the level of seniority that you are hiring. I think that a lot of founders think, I need a CPO, I need a VP of product, I need someone who's really senior, when often the founder has a bunch of the vision and knowledge, and what they really need is somebody to build the product. They don't need somebody who's going to scale the team or build systems like they've got enough of that. And so that to me is part of building that complimentary relationship where the founder and CEO know what they need and on the CPO side, they know that they can mind meld enough with the CEO to actually have an impact.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:41):\nLast question. You started as an intern in the PR department, I think, at Meta?\n\nAmi Vora (01:12:47):\nOh, I started as a temp, actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:51):\nAt temp, okay, amazing. And then you ended up leading Facebook ads and then WhatsApp and many other things. Can you share that story of just how you joined and how that happened?\n\nAmi Vora (01:12:59):\nWell, I had quit my last job. I knew that what I wanted to do was be involved in all the wild stuff happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 2000s. So I'd quit my last job, I was traveling around the world a little bit. I was living in New York, an extremely blissful lifestyle. I was unemployed, I was doing whatever I wanted. It was some of the best time I've had in my life, and eventually I needed a job, like you do. But it was 2007 and the only place I wanted to work was Facebook. You could hear the way people talked about these products. People would say Facebook is more important than than my car. It's like how I connect with the world. It was such a magical product, and you could hear that.\n\n(01:13:51):\nAnd I knew some people at the company and I convinced one of them to introduce me to everyone at the office. I'd made a trade, I said, I'll buy you a fancy coffee at Coupa Cafe in downtown Palo Alto, and in exchange just introduced me to everyone, everyone you know, take me around the office. So everyone I met, I said, \"Hey, I'm Ami, I really want to work here. I'll do whatever you need.\" And the only call I got back was from the Head of PR, Brandy Barker, who said, \"Look, we can't hire you. We didn't interview you. We don't have headcount. You're not really qualified.\" It was just like 10 reasons. I was like, okay, thank you for calling me. And she said, \"But we need a temp to review our press releases, so if you want to come join a temp agency, we'll tell them to send you here.\" And that's what I did, I moved out to California and I slept on people's couches and eventually they hired me full time and I didn't look back.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:50):\nAnd now you're on Lenny's podcast, what a run. It's interesting, this reminds me of another path to power rule from the Jeffrey PFeffer podcast, of networking is one of the best ways to acquire power in the world. So it's interesting that now that seed has planted in my head. Anyway, just A plug for that other episode also.\n\n(01:15:06):\nAmi, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nAmi Vora (01:15:13):\nSometimes people ask me who are working in product, what's the one thing they should do to be successful at product? And maybe the thing I would say is, especially as an org scale or a company scales, there's just a lot of distractions that get between you and the customer. And so the one thing that I would just advise everyone to do is just think about the customer, talk to the customer, be an advocate for them. It's such a shortcut to everything else you need to do in order to be successful, but it's so easy for that to get lost when you're thinking about, okay, how do I get alignment on my team? How do I figure out my roadmap? How do I convince people to join the company? There's all these different things, but fundamentally, we're here to create value for the customer. And the closer you can get to that, I always found myself the happiest because I'm building that feedback loop with the customer, but also more successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):\nWell, let me actually follow up on this because this is really important and interesting. There's a PM part of my brain of like, okay, but we also got to move some metrics and sometimes that metric isn't going to be moved by, we need to do something specifically for the customer, but it's something that will help the business. Is there anything there of just that balance of like, we need to move over this conversion metric, versus, let's focus fully on what does the customer want and need? Any thoughts there?\n\nAmi Vora (01:16:34):\nYeah, I think we often make things adversarial that are not actually adversarial. It is very rare for customer value to be different than a company value on a long enough time horizon. There might be short-term divergences, but really, to solve, to create value for the customer, you got to be around as a business, otherwise you are creating zero value for the customer. And so I think really, just starting with the, what are the end goals and where does stuff diverge in the very short term versus the medium term versus in the long term? It shouldn't, and really thinking about where you are in the journey and how to place that. That always helps me because our metrics should absolutely be about long-term customer impact. It's very rare if those aren't, and then you're still able to be successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:26):\nIt comes back to our chat about metrics and how to do those well.\n\n(01:17:29):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.\n\nAmi Vora (01:17:32):\nCool, I'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:34):\nHere we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAmi Vora (01:17:39):\nThe Year of Yes, by Shonda Rhimes. I almost never read nonfiction. I love Shonda Rhimes, made an exception for this one. It's about just saying yes to things and finding your voice when you do feel like you're sometimes the first or the only or the different, and what that feels like. And it was very life-changing for me, actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:00):\nThat's an awesome pick. No one has recommended that one yet. Reminds me of an episode of Matthew Dicks, who has a Ted Talk about saying yes to everything.\n\nAmi Vora (01:18:00):\nReally?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:07):\nHe just says, Chris, to say yes to everything and his life is incredibly interesting as a result. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nAmi Vora (01:18:17):\nI watch a lot of witty workplace comedies from the mid 2000s. So I watch a lot of The Office or 30 Rock reruns. Things are just very comfortable that I already know everything, there's no surprises. I'm not great with new stuff right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:33):\nI heard they're bringing back The Office. There's a reboot happening.\n\nAmi Vora (01:18:36):\nOh really? Let's see.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:38):\nYeah, exactly. Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love, either digital, physical, anything?\n\nAmi Vora (01:18:47):\nMaybe a physical product that I really like. I drink a lot of coffee and tea through the day and it's just, I don't know, a calming ritual. And so I have a Fellow's electric kettle, that was my big work from home upgrade. So I have this life for kettle, I have a pour over kit. I have these lovely colorful mugs that I like, that has actually just made my day-to-day a lot better, is just a little feeling of luxury.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:16):\nI love that. I think we have that same kettle. I also drink tea during every episode I have here.\n\nAmi Vora (01:19:19):\nOh, yeah. You know it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):\nSo we're on the same page. Next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to, share with friends or family, in work or in life?\n\nAmi Vora (01:19:30):\nIt is definitely not a motto. I feel like I know people have mottos and I'm so impressed. I'm like, you know what you are, you know what you need. I am not that person, but I have a piece of advice that someone gave me very early in my career. Actually, it was Chamath, he said, \"You can either have more energy or less ambition.\" And I was like, oh, that's a little harsh, but also really true. And I think about that, it's another of my Roman empires. I think about it all the time where I'm like, okay, if I want to have this kind of impact, I'm going to have to do the work, I'm going to have to try new things, I'm going to have to feel uncomfortable, and sometimes I don't want to do those things. I don't want to do all of that work, and then I can't be mad if I'm not having the impact. Those two just have to go together. I also have to get lucky in all these different ways, but the two have to go together and that's been just a good governor, a little bit, of how I think about what I'm putting in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):\nI love that quote. By the way, if people don't know what you're talking about when you talk about the Roman Empires, there's a meme on TikTok where somebody said that every man thinks about the Roman Empire at least once a week. Right?\n\nAmi Vora (01:20:39):\nIt's made me think about, what are all the things I think about repeatedly without really having trigger or reason? And there's still a lot. I don't think about the Roman Empire though. That is not one of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:49):\nI also don't think about the Roman Empires, something's wrong with me. Okay, final question. You can blame your colleague Barr for this question. He tells me that you are very good at jokes, you tell very good jokes. Do you have a joke that you want to share by any chance?\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:06):\nI love jokes. There was a year at Facebook where I posted a joke of the week to the company and they're all terrible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:15):\nTo the company.\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:19):\nYeah, exactly. All right. Here's my favorite joke.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:22):\nGreat.\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:24):\nWhy don't sharks eat clowns?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:26):\nWhy?\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:27):\nBecause they taste funny. I'll tell you one more and you can choose one, you can choose which one. All right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):\nNo, we're not cutting anything.\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:36):\nWhat did the zero say to the eight?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:38):\nWhat did the zero say to the eight? Something like us. Okay, no, I don't know.\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:43):\nNice belt.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:44):\nNice what?\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:45):\nBelt.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:46):\nBelt. Oh, I got it.\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:51):\n[inaudible 01:21:51].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:53):\nI get it, I get it. I'm going to tell you a joke. I just heard a standup share. How do you turn an egg into a vegetable?\n\nAmi Vora (01:22:02):\nI feel like if you put a letter on it'll turn into a vegetable name, but I can't think of the letter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:06):\nI love that you're really trying to analyze it and get there because I don't know if it's ever possible to actually get the answer. Okay, so how do you turn an egg into a vegetable? Squash.\n\nAmi Vora (01:22:17):\nThat is definitely my level of joke, definitely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):\nThey're like, this is for your kid. Go home and do this joke.\n\n(01:22:24):\nAmi, this was everything I hoped it would be. I'm going to read again the goal you had for this podcast, I 100% think we achieved it. To be as authentic as possible and show that people can be pretty messy and imperfect at times, yet still be very successful. I think exactly what this podcast ended up being. Thank you so much for being here.\n\n(01:22:40):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAmi Vora (01:22:46):\nOh, thank you, Lenny. It's been such a pleasure. I write a blog on Substack at amiboard@substack.com. It's called The Hard Parts of Growth, it's just about how even when you're working in great places with great people at great companies, sometimes things are hard and that's normal. And so you can find me there. I do the same, I crosspost to LinkedIn so you can find me there. And how can people be helpful to me? I don't know, just by being great, by being kind and nice and making the world slightly better. Yeah, I think that's what we can all do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):\nI love that, and I will link to your Substack in the show notes, so if where people want to check it out, and I'll recommend it. I haven't done it yet, but I'm going to recommend it for my Substack.\n\nAmi Vora (01:23:25):\nThank you, Lenny, so much. This was such a fun conversation. I've really enjoyed it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:29):\nI loved it. Ami, thank you so much for being here. Bye, everyone.\n\nAmi Vora (01:23:33):\nBye.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):\nThank you so much for listening.

Here’s why you’re probably chasing the wrong idea. | Andrew Wilkinson\n\n## Transcript\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:00:00):\nYou don't want to walk into the gym on day one and try and deadlift 300 pounds. So when someone comes to me and they're a first time entrepreneur and they say, \"I'm going to make the next great AI company,\" I think that is the equivalent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nI feel like you've actually started and run more companies than maybe anyone else in the world. What is your best advice for coming up with a great startup idea?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:00:20):\nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, has this amazing quote.\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:00:24):\nFish where the fish are.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:00:26):\nThe biggest mistakes I've made have been going into business models where other people have repeatedly failed and thinking, I can do this better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:34):\nIt's so funny to watch you on Twitter. Clearly you've become AI obsessed.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:00:38):\nIt's like having the world's most reliable employee who costs $200 a month and works 24/7. So many knowledge work jobs are going to change massively. I think the fundamental question is, do all jobs just become a single prompt?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):\nToday, my guest is Andrew Wilkinson. Andrew is the co-founder and CEO of Tiny, a holding company that's often called the Berkshire Hathaway of the internet. They own over 40 businesses ranging from Dribble to WeCommerce to the AeroPress coffee maker, and they focused on buying profitable businesses from founders and holding them for the long term. Andrew and his co-founder bootstrapped the business from zero to hundreds of millions of dollars in value, and Andrew personally was worth over $1 billion at one point. In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover a bunch of strategies for coming up with a good business idea, what common business ideas you should avoid, his experience automating much of his work and life using AI, and what that means for employment in the near future. Also, what he's learned about happiness and money and how they're not directly related, and also how getting diagnosed with ADHD and then taking SSRIs was the thing that most impacted his happiness in life.\n\n(00:01:46):\nThis is both a powerful and also a very tactically useful conversation and I'm really excited for you to hear it.

The way teams turn feedback into product impact is stuck in the past, vague reports, static taxonomies, unactionable insights that don't move business metrics. The result, churn, lost deals, misgrowth. Sauce is the AI product copilot that helps CPOs and product teams uncover business impact and act faster. It listens to your sales calls, support tickets, churn reasons, and lost deals, surfacing the biggest product issues and opportunities in real time.\n\n(00:02:41):\nIt then routes them to the right teams to turn signals into PRDs, prototypes, and even code that drives revenue retention and adoption. That's why Whatnot, Linktree, Incident.io and Zip use Sauce one enterprise uncovered a product gap that unlocked $16 million ARR, another caught a issue and prevented millions in churn.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:04:15):\nOh, thanks man, great to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:17):\nI've been wanting to chat with you for so long. There's so much that I want to talk about and I want to start with a topic that I know that you think a lot about and that it's also in the minds of a lot of people, which is coming up with a great startup idea and this is something that a lot of people are thinking about right now because AI makes it so easy to actually build your idea into something real, and I feel like this is something you spent a lot of time thinking about. I feel like you've actually started and run more companies than, I don't know, maybe anyone else in the world. I feel like you're in the top a hundred, top 10, something like that. I don't know. Does that feel right?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:04:51):\nI've definitely had a lot of experiences and I've probably started or been involved with 75 different projects or businesses where I've been a primary contributor and I wouldn't say that's anything to brag about because I've been an inch deep in a mile wide. So that's been in a lot of ways kind of my Achilles heel is I get too excited about ideas and I start too many businesses, but as a result I've seen almost every business model under the sun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:18):\nAmazing. Okay. Yeah, I think the benefit is for us is we get to learn from your experience. Let me just ask you this question, what is your best advice for coming up with a great startup idea?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:05:28):\nUltimately the best thing is something you're going to be interested in, but I think a mistake a lot of people make is they choose something that everybody is interested in. So for example, they say I don't know anyone that has hadn't had the thought, man, I would love to start a really cool restaurant or I want to have a cool cafe or something. And in reality, what they think about is how cool would it be to come up with an amazing logo or all fun stuff, design the menu and stuff. But in reality, operating those businesses is miserable and it's also a very hard business because every morning millions of people wake up and they go, I should start a cafe. But on the flip side, almost nobody wakes up every morning and says, \"You know what? I'd love to start a funeral home,\" or \"I would like to start a pest control business,\" or \"I should start software that helps people fill out forms for the government.\"\n\n(00:06:26):\nAnd Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, has this amazing quote. He says, \"Fish where the fish are.\" And he gives this example, he says, \"If you're a fisherman and you see a large pond and all around the pond, there's a whole bunch of fishermen and they're all elbowing each other out of the way. They're all using the best lures, the best fishing line, they all have amazing strategy. You actually want to walk off into the forest and find a small fishing hole with lots of fish and very little competition. And I think that's probably the most important thing in business is actually to find those niches where you can actually make real money because competition equals lower margin. The more competitors there are, the lower your prices have to be and the more competitive the business is ultimately.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:19):\nIt doesn't feel intuitive to go after small markets and to find niches. So let's just follow that thread. Well, why is that actually a source of some of the best ideas starting really small and niche?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:07:30):\nI don't necessarily think it has to be something that is small forever, but it has to be something that like I think about if you're a first time entrepreneur or a student or something, you don't want to walk into the gym on day one and try and deadlift 300 pounds. So when someone comes to me and they're a first time entrepreneur and they say, \"I'm going to make the next great AI company,\" or \"I'm going to launch a new bank,\" or something like that, something that is very, very rigorous and complicated and highly competitive and regulated, I think that is the equivalent. I think you really want to take the baby weights and start slowly building your muscle. And I think about my own experience starting a business, I was so lucky because the first business I ever started my web design agency, which became Metalab, that was so easy and it worked immediately because all I had to do was know how to build websites and be able to talk to potential customers.\n\n(00:08:33):\nAnd then once they said, \"Yes, I will pay you $5,000,\" I just had to send them an invoice, do the work, and that was it. It was a very simple business. And because of that, I got immediate positive feedback and I built my own narrative. And my narrative was, \"I'm good at business, I can do this, keep going.\" And then I went off and I started taking my money that I made from that original business and that's when I fucked up. So I went out and I started a pizzeria and I lost all my money. I started a designer cat furniture business, a online DJ school, a skin cream business, all of these things. I've just lost all my money almost immediately, but because I had that first win I kept on going. And I just think it's so critical that people choose a business where they get that initial win.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:22):\nOkay, this is a great topic. This is just like how do you avoid creating a job for yourself that you hate? There's a lot of business opportunities and ideas that like, \"Yeah, you can make this work,\" and then it works, and then you're stuck doing this thing running a restaurant. My wife tells a story where a friend started a coffee shop and then he's like, \"I thought I was starting a coffee shop, but I'm just replacing milk and buying milk all day. That's my job now.\" So just kind of along those lines to help people avoid creating a beast that they didn't expect any advice for Just how to know this is maybe even though this may work and make money, you probably don't want to be spending your life doing this sort of business.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:09:59):\nSo I just started a pressure washing business. I was speaking at a local business school and after I spoke, one of the kids walked up to me and he said, \"Hey, I'm an entrepreneur. I've started two or three businesses in the past doing landscaping and I'm not enjoying school.\" And so just on the spot, I said to him, \"Why don't you drop out and we'll start a business together?\" And I'd been cooking on this idea of a pressure washing business because I'd studied that industry a little bit and I knew a few friends who'd done it in other cities. And I had this unfair advantage, which is I owned a whole bunch of media properties where I could advertise it for free basically. And so we started this business and I think for him, he kind of had this moment of, do I really want to be washing people's driveways for the rest of my life?\n\n(00:10:47):\nAnd what I said to him is, \"Look, if this gets to scale, you'll never touch a pressure washer unless you want to.\" If the business can get big enough where you can have employees, he can just focus on sales or digital marketing or whatever aspect of the business that he really loves. And I think that's the biggest thing that a lot of entrepreneurs miss. They say, \"I don't want to do that for the rest of my life. I don't want to be in the back of a dry cleaner dry cleaning clothes.\" And to me it's just a question of scale. I think the cafe is a great example because a cafe, if it doesn't get to a reasonable scale is just a job.\n\n(00:11:26):\nThere's a big difference between a business and a job. I think if you could start a pressure washing business where you're the only employee, yeah, that's a job, but if you can get to a scale where you can drive 10 leads a day, then you don't have to do any of the pressure washing and you just do what you love. So I think a lot of people have this kind of Protestant work ethic where they think, well, I've got to be the person to do everything. And I think they really need to lean into what I call lazy leadership, which is how do I get away from the things I hate as quickly as humanly possible? How do I be Teflon for tasks?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):\nIt's interesting that this business is non-software related at all, this pressure washing business. So I guess just for folks that are coming up with ideas, and I imagine most ideas are there's a pull to make it software oriented, something AI is going to help build for you and help you run. What's your calculus on just going down a direction of real world physical business, like a restaurant power washing business versus a software just like what are the benefits of that direction when should someone actually seriously think about doing a business like a power washing business?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:12:30):\nI think if someone's listening to this podcast, odds are they're someone who's kind of a digital native. And I think the question is, what's your unfair advantage and what are you great at? So for me, I think I have reasonably good taste. And so what I could do is I identify and I knew enough to identify great design and development talent, but mostly I was lucky because I was a talker. I was good at meeting with clients and selling myself. And so ultimately my highest and best use my superpower was sales. And so that can be applied to anything, anything where you need to go out and you need to sell a customer. And so really it just comes down to what do you get drawn to and then how do you find the profitable business within that? So here's an example. A friend of mine, he owns a restaurant and he said, \"Oh, I love it. I'm so passionate about it. It's this stunning beautiful restaurant in my hometown.\"\n\n(00:13:32):\nAnd he said, \"But it's really just a job for a few different people and we can't make any money at it, but I've been noticing that there's all these vendors that service the restaurant and those guys are making a killing.\" And so he told me about a business that cleans grease traps, another one that cleans exhaust vents for kitchens. So I think looking around and seeing where your passion is and then sniffing around within it, probably somewhere within your passion, there's an opportunity. So for example, I love movies. My happy place is a dark theater. That's the best way for me to de-stress is go to a dark theater and watch a movie and get lost in it. And probably about four or five years ago, I was like, \"Man, how cool would it be to invest in movies in some way to be a part of that creative world?\"\n\n(00:14:26):\nAnd so I started looking into funding movies and I realized that when you fund movies, like 90% of the time you lose all your money. And even if you do make some money, you rarely make a good return. But I spend a bunch of time understanding the industry and learning about it. And then two years ago I was in New Zealand and I met the founder of Letterboxd and I realized, \"Oh my God, this is a business where this has a moat, so it has a network effect, it's a huge social network for film reviewers. It's something I'm passionate about and it's something that we can buy at a fair price.\" All those things came together and I was like, \"Oh my god, I can invest in film now.\" In the same way I used to be a barista, we ended up buying the AeroPress coffee maker company. So I follow my passions and spend a long time learning different industries and then I find the profitable niche within.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:19):\nOkay, and this is a great takeaway essentially when you're thinking about startup ideas, make sure there's some connection to something unique to you where you have some unfair advantage. This makes me think about Brian Armstrong. I saw him do a talk once and he gave this really amazing insight about why Coinbase did well and why he started Coinbase. And it's because if you look at his background, he had this really rare Venn diagram of background of computer science and I think it was cryptography and economics, which is the exact set of skills you need to start something like Coinbase. So I think the tip there is just what is that unique Venn diagram of skills in your background and just ideally what you're building connects to that and gives you an unfair advantage.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:16:02):\nWell, yeah. I just met another UVic student at the local university student. She is interested in marketing and so she's gone out and she's found some local clients, so small restaurants and stuff and managed their social media and she said, \"Yeah, it's okay. I can make a thousand bucks a month, but it's a lot of work,\" and the owners really want a lot for their money. And I said, \"Well, if you just pivot that idea just ever so slightly, and instead of doing restaurants, you did realtors or wealth managers who have quite a large marketing budget and are used to spending serious money and it only has to work a little bit to make a lot of money for them. Those people, you can charge $5,000 a month.\"\n\n(00:16:44):\nSo I think often it's you find your passion, your skill set, you zero in, and then you just kind of pivot and you find the most profitable way to do it. When I started my web design firm, I started mostly with local and small projects, but very quickly I found a job board in San Francisco where startups would share projects they needed help with. I could charge five times the amount for five times less work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:09):\nThis point about fish where the fish are I think is really important. You can start something that's awesome that you love, that you're so excited about, but nobody needs it. Talk a bit more about just what that looks like. What have you seen when you're thinking about ideas that tell you that there's fish but also not overfished as you pointed out?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:17:25):\nI think it's hard like Warren Buffett has this great quote, \"I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor and I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman.\" And I feel like in order to know what problems are valuable to solve, you kind of need to have valuable problems. So it's a bit of a hard thing because I remember when I was like 20, I would say, I hate how all the cat furniture I can buy for my cats is I bet people would pay a lot of money to solve this, but I didn't understand anything about the realities of that business model. I didn't understand how little people were actually willing to pay. I didn't have a enough life experience to go, \"Yes, that's actually a worthwhile opportunity.\" And I think that being able to know what people would pay to solve the problem realistically is incredibly valuable.\n\n(00:18:20):\nSo my example of a realtor selling a house, because I've studied that industry, I know that a realtor can make like 20 to $50,000 selling a single house. So I can intuit that they'd be willing to spend a lot of money if I have a unique way of getting them clients that'll buy houses that'll convert at a high conversion rate that is worth $5,000 a lead maybe, right? So I think you kind of have to understand the problem in depth before you really know. Because when I was starting out, I would go down every rabbit trail, every infomercial idea I had I would think was genius.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):\nOr people, I don't know, that don't have this experience, which is most people. Is there one thing you do, maybe a heuristic that gives you a sense, maybe there's something here, maybe there's a lot of fish, maybe it's a value of prompt or no, the soul tell me it probably isn't.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:19:12):\nNo, unfortunately, I think it's mostly gut. I mean Munger and Buffett talk about having a whole bunch of mental models in your brain and they form a latticework, right? And they all kind of piece together. And I feel like for me, there's so much of this that is, it's almost like I'm an AI model and I've trained on all this data of what works and what doesn't and what's a good moat and what's a bad business, et cetera. And when I see it, I just immediately know. I mean, I think all entrepreneurs are so lucky now to be able to go into Claude or ChatGPT and just say, \"Hey, I'm thinking about starting a Botox clinic. Can you break down the numbers? Is this a good business? What's hard about it? What is the regulatory moat? What would my payroll look like?\" I didn't have any of that and so I started so many incredibly stupid businesses, but I think there's no excuse at this point. You should be able to do it with AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:07):\nThat's a really good tip actually. Then there's this point you made about boring is good. That's a really good piece of advice. A lot of people are going after flashy stuff, things they condemn on Twitter. Your advice here is boring is actually a really good thing because fewer people are going after it. Is that the general tip?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:20:22):\nTotally. I mean, so I started this business, one of my first called Flow and Flow was basically Asana before Asana came out. So it was a way to manage your to-do's and projects with your team in a web app and we basically did the thing. We made the mistake that so many entrepreneurs make, which is to go after an industry that everybody goes after just like cafes. Everybody has the idea, man, I wish I could design my own project management system or my own to-do system. And not only that, but everybody loves new things. They love jumping around. I know me personally, in the last three years, I've probably used three different productivity systems and I love jumping around in them and I didn't understand that and I ended up losing $10 million trying to compete with venture-backed businesses and bootstrapping.\n\n(00:21:17):\nIt was all my own money, poured $10 million, lit it on fire trying to compete with Asana because I didn't understand how the business world worked really as they had raised hundreds of millions of dollars and they were run by the co-founder of Facebook and it was a little bit like, I'm Fiji and I'm deciding I'm going to invade the United States in retrospect, just completely silly. Now on the flip side, if I'd taken that same amount of energy and I'd instead focused on, let's see, what's a really boring one I've heard about, there was a business I saw recently.\n\n(00:21:52):\nThey were making $30 million a year and all they did was help people fill out forms to get government assistance in certain programs. So it'd be like your uncle is disabled and you need to access government funding. The process to do it is incredibly time-consuming and miserable and you have to fill out all these forms. They just have software that fills out the forms for you and it says, look, you're going to get $20,000 as a grant, pay us a thousand bucks, and that is such a boring, nobody wakes up and goes, \"I want to make form filling software,\" but I think they would if they could make 20 million a year\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:29):\nAlong these lines of just bad ideas, things people shouldn't start, what are a few ideas that you think everyone thinks is going to be a great idea and then they do it and then they always fail?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:22:37):\nWell, I think the biggest mistake, I can speak from my own experience, the biggest mistakes I've made business-wise have been going into business models where other people have repeatedly failed and thinking, I can do this better. So for example, me and one of my best friends about 10 years ago, we really wanted to start a bar. We just thought it'd be so cool to have a bar where us and all of our friends could go, we thought it'd be great for the city. We thought we can run this really high margin because we're tech guys, we know how to build systems, we're good at business, and we were utterly humbled. We realized that we didn't know anything about business compared to someone who runs a pizzeria. If you think about it, like my example earlier of if you run a software company, what has to happen?\n\n(00:23:24):\nYou have to hire a bunch of nerds, they need internet connections and computers and you need to pay them and you need to coordinate online and everyone can work asynchronously. Nothing has to go right. It's not that complicated, at least at small-scale. A pizzeria, it's like if the baker doesn't wake up at three in the morning and start prepping dough, the entire thing is effed and all along the way there's a hundred different failure points from front of house, back of house, the deliveries, arriving on time, all this logistics. And so I think it's been stuff like that. I mean also I got into the news business, the local news business. I ended up buying an old paper in Vancouver and it's the exact same thing. It's like you can't take a brilliant management team and change a bad business model. Ultimately the business model wins.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:20):\nThis is really good advice. Basically if there's a bunch of dead bodies in that space, there's probably something there that keeps killing them that you're probably not aware of until maybe somebody figures something out, right? Once in a while, once in a blue moon, someone's like, \"Okay, here's how we do this and then it works.\"\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:24:34):\nWell, look at Instacart. When Instacart came out, everyone said, \"Well, Webvan failed. This is never going to work.\" And we still don't necessarily know if Instacart is a great business. I don't know, I haven't studied it, but I think it was like, okay, enough technology has changed that it can happen, but would it be easier to start Instacart, Amazon or Coupang or would it be easier to start an enterprise SaaS software company? Definitely the enterprise SaaS software company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):\nI see. So this is I guess is the advice there. The thing that is easy to start is the thing you should not do because everyone's going after that.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:25:10):\nWell, it goes back to my gym analogy of if you're going to deadlift 300 pounds, trained for 15 years, you should have already had three startups and they should have worked and you've really built up the reps. And I think that if I was going to start Instacart, that's different than someone who's 20 starting it. Not that I would be good at it, but at least I would know what I'm getting into.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:32):\nLet's talk about something that is this endless debate on Twitter. Maybe it's a false dichotomy between lifestyle businesses, bootstrap businesses, this idea of not raising money, just making revenue, living off the revenue versus venture-backed venture scale companies feels like you're very good at the first bucket and a lot of people, this is their dream, \"I'm just going to start something. I'll start a lifestyle business, make a few million a year, never raise money. Who needs VCs? VCs suck.\" Advice for deciding which route to go with an idea you have.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:26:03):\nWell, I think it's just not true that a \"lifestyle\" or bootstrap business can't get huge. I mean, we bootstrapped the entire business and now across all of our companies we do almost $300 million in revenue. And the whole time I had been focusing on taking, starting small businesses, small ideas, simple ideas, often buying small companies and watching them grow really big. And I think that the only difference between what we do and what a venture capitalist does is the level of tolerance of burning money on fire. And I just haven't seen that If we choose the right businesses that aren't in incredibly competitive markets or where they have some sort of moat. So what I mean by that is a great brand or a network effect like a social network or something like that, I don't feel we're holding them back by not letting them light up a bunch of money on fire because these things naturally grow.\n\n(00:27:12):\nThe numbers, I mean they're like balloons, they just go as long as we don't mess them up too much. So I think the decision ultimately comes down to how hairy do you want your big, hairy, audacious goal to be? And if your big, hairy, audacious goal is I'm going to start the next satellite business that creates some sort of crazy technological revolution. Yes, you're going to have to raise a venture capital unless you're already a billionaire or something like that. But if you're wanting to just tinker and solve a problem that you think is not going to be hyper-competitive, so for example, that form-filling thing or software that just does a narrow thing that doesn't require 20, 30, 40 million to be lit on fire before it can make money, then you can have a wonderful life and build a wonderful company that can scale into the hundreds of millions of dollars if you play your cards right without ever raising money.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:09):\nPer the story you shared with Flow where you're competing against a venture-funded company, if there is a venture-backed company in this space, is the advice you're not going to win competing with them most likely and try to do something else.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:28:22):\nWell, look at Things. Do you know Things?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:25):\nI have used Things\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:28:26):\nI do too. It's awesome. Things still exist and Things has existed for 20 years. It's run by I believe one or two or three people. It's not a big team, certainly under 10 people, it was, I believe, bootstrapped and it's just consistently delivered an exceptional product and built up a loyal following. They have their 10,000 true fans who use it, and that's enough for them, but they don't do a lot. They've been very intentional. They don't do any AI stuff, they don't have an API. They're not on Android. They're very focused and I think they have succeeded. But the question is, what would an MBA or a business professor say about their success? If the measure of success is did they maximize taking as much market share as possible and grow to be as big as possible, then the answer is no because Asana and other people have built multi-billion dollar companies.\n\n(00:29:28):\nIf the goal is the founder has an incredible life, probably has three houses, flies all over the place, does whatever he wants, has recurring revenue and he gets to work with headphones on building beautiful piece of software that people love, then I think he's won. I am generally much more in the camp of the Things guy has won, not Dustin Moskovitz. Dustin Moskovitz is just playing a different game than the Things guy. And if Dustin Moskovitz was running Things, he'd be miserable and if the Things guy was running Asana, he would probably kill himself because he wants to put his headphones on and build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):\nI wonder why nobody has come. It feels like just with lifestyle businesses, if it's working and you would think somebody would come in with more money and more funding and just eat their lunch, is the key that the market is too small for a VC to ever be excited and so that's why no one's coming for them?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:30:21):\nI think so. I mean, I think Things probably, I'm just guessing, I don't know any of the numbers or whatever, but I would assume it makes between five and $25 million of revenue, which to a VC is not even worth considering a VC. For a VC to invest in your business, you need to have a story where it's worth 300 million to a billion dollars or more. So it's just not that exciting to them, which again, going back to fish where the fish are, you don't want to be fighting against the commercial fishermen. If you just want to have a little business where you get enough fish to feed your family and your village or whatever, find the other fishing hole. Don't go where the trawlers are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:04):\nThis is great advice if you're trying to start a non venture backed company is find. This metaphor just keeps working for us, which is fish where the fish are, but not where the professional fishermen are. Also, ideally not where there's just a ton of, I don't know, fishermen from all over the place. I don't know, solopreneur fishermen. Okay. Coming back to just starting a successful company, what would you say are the keys to an amazing business model, an amazing business broadly, what should you be thinking about and looking into? I know you spent a lot of time thinking about this. When you're buying companies, what are a few bullet points that you want to focus on?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:31:38):\nWhat I do for a living is basically buy businesses. So in my early career I started one business, then I started about 10 more, and then I realized starting businesses was extremely hard and I was doing pretty well. I was making quite a bit of money and I'd sold one of my businesses and I was looking out at the next 10 years and really asking myself what do I want my career to be and am I happy doing what I'm doing? And the answer was no. I did not starting businesses and experiencing that failure rate, it was incredibly stressful. And so I picked up a book about investing and I got lucky. The first one I bought was about Warren Buffett, and for those that don't know, Warren Buffett is he's counter to every VC kind of hustle culture thing you might hear because he basically just sits quietly in a room and reads all day, despite owning 260 different businesses and being one of the 10 wealthiest people in the world, his life is incredibly calm.\n\n(00:32:44):\nHe only does what he wants and he spends most of his time quietly reading and once or twice a year, he makes a big decision to buy a business. And so when I read about Warren Buffett, I just thought, wow, I'm a sucker. I'm running around like a crazy person trying to run all these businesses. Why am I not just buying businesses and letting them run? And so when I'm buying a business, what I'm really looking for is something that I can't mess up. Right now, obviously we buy a business, we try not to mess it up, and we're very intentional, actually very odd in that when Tiny buys a company, we generally just leave them alone. If they already have management in place, we say nothing changes, no one should know that we've even bought them. Obviously people know that, but really there should be no change whatsoever.\n\n(00:33:31):\nThe only change that we generally make is if the founder wants to leave the business, then we'll bring in a CEO to run the company, and that's probably the most important decision that we make. So I'm looking for a business though where it is so good that it's hard to mess up, and most businesses are very easy to mess up. One person leaves and the whole business falls apart because it's held together with dental floss and duct tape. And so I'm really looking for what Warren Buffett would call a moat. So a moat is basically a brand, so that could be a brand like Coca-Cola, Tylenol, Advil, something like that. So something that gives you pricing power where you can consistently charge and you have loyal customers or where we usually find a lot of opportunity is in network effects.\n\n(00:34:23):\nSo typically we're looking for a community that's gotten so big where people don't want to go elsewhere. So for example, we own Letterboxd, which is the largest social network for film lovers. And the question is, if someone else wants to compete with us, why would someone go to their social network that has a small number of users when all their friends are already on Letterboxd? And so you see that same kind of thing with Instagram or Facebook or similar. And so we're looking for businesses like that, something that has staying power that is hard to compete with and that we can hold over the very long term.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:01):\nIt was interesting when Elon bought X, how that was such a test of the power of network effects. If you think about it, back then he changed the name. So the brand completely changed the team. 80% of the people left. What was left, it was the network and the network effect and the simplest way. Just for folks that aren't super familiar with network effects, the way I think about it is just network effect is where every additional user that joins the network becomes more useful for everybody.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:35:27):\nThere's another moat, which is high switching costs, which I don't really like because it's not really very consumer friendly, but an example might be Salesforce where no one wants to, they've spent years and they've done all the implementation and trained everyone on it, and it's kind of the standard, everybody hates it, but ripping it out and switching is such a pain in the that they just won't bother. That's another form of sometimes a great business, but again, that's more depressing. I don't love that one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:56):\nWhat's the last company you guys bought?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:35:58):\nWe bought Serato. Serato is the largest DJ software company in the world. So if you ever see a DJ playing and they've got a laptop in front of them, probably using Serato to DJ.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):\nWow, that is super cool. What I'd like a funding to be walking into.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:36:14):\nI used to DJ so I was aware of them and it was one of those moments we talked about earlier where I understood the business. They had a really interesting mode of this huge passionate user base and deep hardware integration. And I also love DJing and I was able to analyze the business and luck comes to the prepared mind and it worked out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:35):\nThis is another great callback to your excellent piece of advice of just ideally what you're working on, whether you're starting the company or buying the company, is you have a unique unfair advantage or some kind of unique background that connects to that idea. Let me ask you one more question before we shift a whole different topic, hint, hint, AI. Something that I know you talk a lot about, something you believe strongly and something you deal with a lot is when you buy companies is just as people and the challenges of management and hiring and people. So what have you learned about just how to successfully, I don't know, find amazing people, keep amazing people, help people be more successful within the companies that you operate?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:37:15):\nMy business partner, Chris, has a really great quote. He says, \"There are no problems. There is only people problems.\" And so we've found that you could tell us that there's a disaster that one of our business units is about to fail or something like that. As long as I'm surrounded by really great smart people, I feel fine. But when we have a bad actor, we have a psycho or a narcissist or a really horrible, difficult person we're dealing with, all bets are off and life becomes incredibly stressful. So I'd say I spend probably 20% of my time just trying to make sure we're filtering people very carefully and ensuring we're working with people that we enjoy. And I could talk about it in the AI, I've done some really interesting stuff to help me screen and identify difficult people, but I've just found that the biggest mistake I made in my early career was I would hire people because I liked them on gut and I would think that I could change them.\n\n(00:38:12):\nSo it's kind of like in romantic relationships, it never works out well. If you get married to someone and you go, \"Okay, well this is going to be a great relationship as long as I can convert them to Christianity or I can change their parents or their personality,\" or whatever it is. And so I've just found that I've never been able to change someone. You can never mentor someone out into being a good employee. And the kind of heuristic I have is if I ever think, should I fire this person even once, I should fire them immediately. It has always been a signal, at least for me, that when someone's a superstar, I can't imagine firing them. I think it's impossible, I'd be lost without them.\n\n(00:38:56):\nBut when I repeatedly start going, \"Man, is this person going to work out?\" Almost always within six to 12 months, it doesn't work out. And so I really try and be really direct about stuff like that and just cut when it's not working. So I'd say the lesson really is hire for what you need. Don't hire just for potential, which is counter to what a lot of people say. A lot of people say hire for potential and coach them into being whatever you need. I just haven't found that. I think you need to hire someone who already is fully formed and can do what you need. But again, everyone does it differently.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):\nThis is big advice. Powerful advice. Is this true not just for the CEOs of the companies you run? As for folks under lower down the ladder too?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:39:39):\nWell, for CEOs, one of the most interesting things we've observed is, so I'll give you an example. We had a CEO come in and we were interviewing them and in my opinion, the business needed to grow via organic marketing. In his opinion, it was enterprise sales. And so when we're interviewing him, he keeps going back to his experience building with enterprise sales. And there's this great saying, \"To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\" And so for him, he's looking at this business and going enterprise sales, that's the way to grow. I hire him, but I say, \"Look, if we're going to hire you, we need you to do the organic marketing.\" Lo and behold, of course, he goes off and he does the enterprise sales thing. And I've just found that hiring CEOs is like they're an elephant and you're the rider.\n\n(00:40:31):\nThey're going to go wherever it is that they want to go. And so listening incredibly carefully to people's words and their experiences, because generally people will do the thing they tell you. So what I look for when I interview a CEO now, I want to be nodding along. I want to go, that's exactly what I would do or that's way smarter than my idea. And then I just leave them alone because I've found that anytime I try and pull them in a certain direction or coach them or whatever, it just doesn't work. And again, this could be my problem. I might be the world's worst coach and mentor, but for me, that's been what's true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:06):\nI imagine there's also an element of they won't love the job if they want to be doing say enterprise sales, and then they're creating viral TikTok videos all day and tweeting. They're like, \"What the hell?\"\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:41:15):\nWell, I've also found people will shoot themselves in the foot. If I tell them an idea in a board meeting and I say, \"I really need you to try this,\" it never works because usually they sandbag it, right? They don't really put their heart into it or they're just placating me and they don't want it to work. They want their idea to work. And so I've learned not to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:37):\nThis episode is brought to you by Miro.

That's M-I-R-O.com.\n\n(00:42:41):\nLet's talk about AI. It's so funny to watch you on Twitter. Clearly you've become AI obsessed, AIphile. I don't know what the term is, and I love that you're not just the kind of person that just talks about it and tweets pontifications, you're clearly using it in every facet of your job and looking for more ways to use AI. So I have a lot of questions here because I think this is where more and more founders are going to be where you are today. First of all, just what's in your AI stack these days? What are the tools you find yourself coming back to most or finding most useful?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:43:10):\nSo the primary tool I use is a tool called Lindy, Lindy.ai. And what it basically lets you do is build workflows and agents. So it's very simple. You might say, \"When I get an email in the Gmail API, I want to add an AI agent that reads the email and labels it based on that.\" Or you can build a crazy Rube Goldberg machine that sends different emails all sorts of different places. So for example, when I get an email and it's related to my kid's school, one of the big problems I have is that my kid's school sends so many emails, the field trip is on Thursday and you need to bring the following things. And meanwhile, there's parent teacher interviews and all these things get added to my calendar. The AI agent automatically takes that, puts it onto my calendar, makes sure there's notes for all the things I need to prepare and stuff. So I have just basically tried to take every single thing a human could do in my inbox and automate it with Lindy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:10):\nAnd you're sitting there in Lindy doing this yourself or do you have people that you've trained to help build these sorts of things for you?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:44:16):\nNo, I do it myself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:17):\nOkay. How many agents, if that's the term you want to use, do you have running for you roughly?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:44:22):\nOh man, I think I probably have not a crazy amount within... Let's see. Well, each workflow probably has four or five agents. So for example, my inbox has four or five agents, and then I have a whole bunch of other, I've got a calendar agent, I've got a meeting agent, I've got an email agent, I've got a scheduler, I've got a CRM, and basically they're all different workflows. So the whole bunch of agents within.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):\nOkay, and you're not an investor in Lindy, right? You're just a fan, super user.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:44:53):\nNo, no.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:54):\nFun fact. I actually am. So this is great.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:44:56):\nOh, no way. That's awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:57):\nTiny angel investor. So just want to put that out there, which I love that this came up organically. What are a couple other really interesting use cases, workflows you've built that people might be inspired by it?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:45:08):\nLet me go through the email one a little more. So basically emails come in and the first agent says, does Andrew even need to see this? Let's say you're in a thread and you've already chimed in and everyone's just saying, cool, that works. I don't need to see that. So just archives that never. So that immediately reduces my email by about 20%. Then it decides is this something that is time sensitive? Is this something that needs to be dealt with in the next 24 hours? And if so, it labels it in a special 24-hour label. So when I go in my email, one of the biggest stresses I find is I go, \"Shit, there's 200 emails in here, and if I don't go through all of them, I don't know if there's an emergency burning somewhere.\" So now I do. Then it takes any email or every single email and it decides, is this a simple decision?\n\n(00:46:00):\nSo for example, let's say you email me and you say, \"Hey, do you want to get lunch?\" So it emails me privately and it says, \"Hey, Lenny wants to get lunch. Do you want to say yes? Do you want to say yes, but in a few months? Do you want to say no? How do you want to say no?\" And it gives me multiple choice. I just can say four, number four, and then it'll email you as me and it'll write out a nice thoughtful email or whatever. So stuff like that is so freaking cool and helpful. And I'd say that it's replaced stuff that my full-time, I used to have a full-time assistant just working on email that's all completely automated and there's all sorts of other cool stuff I'm doing there. Other agents, I'm working on one right now to manage my calendar, which is really complex. I do a lot of scheduling and a lot of rules. I have another really simple one. It adds emojis to every single calendar event. So when I look at my calendar, I've got beautiful little emojis for every single calendar event. Very silly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:00):\nWhat are the emojis? Do they represent something?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:47:03):\nYeah, so if I write weightlifting, it'll just do a guy weightlifting or whatever. I've got one that, this one's cool. Basically what it does, every time I email someone, it looks them up online, it figures out what city they live in. It checks my CRM and air table. It says, \"Okay, I don't know where do you live.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:21):\nIn Marin, in the Bay Area.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:47:22):\nOkay. So it'd say, \"Okay, you email Lenny, he lives in Marin.\" It puts in the database you live in Marin. And then next time I travel to the Bay Area, the agent will see two weeks before and it'll say, \"I saw you're going to San Francisco. Here's all the people in San Francisco you should try and have coffee with.\" Right? So just all these things that-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:22):\nI would pay for that.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:47:43):\nYeah, yeah, exactly. All these things that I've dreamed of having my assistant do that my assistant could just never consistently do because she gets distracted, we're doing an event, there's something going on. It's like having the world's most reliable employee who costs $200 a month and works 24/7.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:02):\nOkay, I want to follow that thread, but first of all, what other tools do you have? Lindy's one, what else do you find really useful?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:48:08):\nSo the other one is Replit. So Replit is basically a vibe coding platform. You can literally go into it and say, \"I want to make a website for my sound software business. Here's a big document with a bunch of details,\" and it'll go and design a pretty impressive website. But then you can also build web apps now. So you can literally be like, \"Yeah, build a Python web app that does XYZ,\" and the design is getting so good because it uses Claude 4. You can start saying, \"Do it in the style of Stripe. Think this through, rewrite all the copy and the tone of David Ogilvy or Malcolm Gladwell,\" or whoever you like, and it does a really incredible job. So what I'm finding is that things that previously would've frustrated me because I would've had to rely on a team of five, I can just do entirely on my own when it comes to web projects and stuff like that. So I'm having a blast with that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:07):\nThat's cool. So your team Replit versus Lovable, Bolt, v0, is that roughly right?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:49:12):\nI mean, they're all great. I, just am the most familiar with Replit, and it seems like it has the most functionality. It has a lot of beef to it, whereas Lovable and Bolt seem a little more basic. You might have to deal with deployment and stuff in a fiddlier way with them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:29):\nAwesome. Okay. Anything else?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:49:32):\nAnother one I love, so Limitless. I don't know if you've seen this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:32):\nI've got one of those.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:49:37):\nIt's really cool. So clips to your shirt. I actually just put it on my pocket so no one actually notices that I've got it on usually, and I just have it on all day. And what it does is it just records everything I do. And then I can say, the other day I had a coffee with someone and I'm the kind of person where I go a mile a minute and I say, \"Oh, I'll send you that and I'll do this,\" or whatever. And so at the end of the day, I can just say, \"Hey, what did I promise to people today?\" Or even better, everyone loves this use case, I have a fight with my girlfriend. And she says, \"You didn't say that.\" And I'm able to say, \"Well, actually you did.\" And you can query it as an LLM.\n\n(00:50:16):\nSo you can say you're a couples counselor. Look at this fight. What did each person need? How did it start? What are the key lines? Where did it change? How could you do this better? And so honestly, from a relationship standpoint is probably where it's been the most useful. What's cool too is that has an API. And so eventually, I haven't gotten there yet, but eventually you'll be able to just have it record your entire day and then automatically go into your Todoist or whatever it is, and add to-do's or send emails or whatever you need it to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:48):\nWow, this is so fun. Or just per your point with the relationship, ask it, \"What could I have done better today? Where did the day go downhill?\"\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:50:57):\nYeah, I saw a guy on Twitter. He said, \"Every day I ask it, 'How could I have been a better dad?'\" And it'll be like, \"Oh, your daughter tried to get your attention about this. You should have paid attention,\" or whatever.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:07):\nAnd that was with the Limitless data. Oh, man, I love that. With the relationship, you didn't go where I thought you were going to go, where it's like, \"Oh, but who actually said it? What did you actually say?\" I love that It became much more wholesome of just like how could we have communicated better holistically? Okay. My wife actually is like, \"Don't wear this around.\"\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:51:25):\nYou just got to wear it really covertly. Honestly, I know it sounds kind of cheesy because you think like, \"Oh, it'll tell her,\" right? But in reality, usually you're both guilty in the fight. And my girlfriend has actually appreciated it because there's been half the time it'll be like, \"Oh yeah, Zoe said this and it triggered this,\" but a lot of the time it's me too. And I think I'm totally right. So I find it actually really helpful. Other tools, I mean otherwise, it's the basic stack of Claude and ChatGPT and Gemini. And Gemini I use mostly for things that are really large. So for example, all my medical records, I have trained on Gemini 2.5 just because the other ones can't really go through it all. Claude, I use for writing very extensively. I find it's the best for that.\n\n(00:52:14):\nAnd then ChatGPT for everything else. In terms of cool things I do, recently, I went through my entire medicine cabinet and I just took big photos that showed all the different medicines and stuff. And now I can say something like, \"Hey, I'm really tired and stressed out today. What supplement should I take and what dose?\" Or I'll say, \"Remember all the medications I'm taking, whenever I ask you a health question, always remind me in the context of I might be taking that medication.\" So a few times it's said, \"Hey, you shouldn't take this other medication because your genetics say you're not compatible with it and you're already taking this other one.\" So stuff like that's been really helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:57):\nFor that use case, do you come back to a specific conversation where you've given it that context, use a project or something-\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:53:02):\nNo, I say remember. I just say remember these supplements, this is what I have in my medicine cabinet or this is what I take every day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:10):\nI see. So just tap into the memory of ChatGPT.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:53:12):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:13):\nThis is awesome. This makes me remember that. And this connects to other points you've been making, I've started to use ChatGPT deep research to prep for these conversations. I used to have a researcher who did this for 400 bucks. They did research on every guest that I had, four to 500 bucks, and gave me a whole doc, \"Here's everything about them. Here's their background, here's questions you might want to ask.\" Deep research is better. Just as of recently, especially with o3-pro.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:53:39):\nWe were talking earlier about agents. I forgot one of my favorite agents. So it looks on my calendar 30 minutes before I meet anyone. It goes on to Perplexity and it does a deep dive on the person and it sends me, it goes into my email and it gets the context of the meeting. So often I book meetings three months out. So I usually look at my calendar and I go, \"Who is this person? I don't even remember booking this meeting.\" It'll text me before and it'll say, \"Here's who you are, here's your background, here's the email context of why we're meeting.\" And it basically does all the research for me. So I do the same thing. I also use deep research and say, \"If I'm meeting them, you know everything about me. What are our commonalities and what are all the fun things we should talk about?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:22):\nOh my God, I just want to plug and play all these agents you've built to use them myself. Interestingly, I tried to create an agent to do this research kickoff for me, but I don't think you can automate ChatGPT deep research. Okay.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:54:35):\nOnly Perplexity. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:37):\nOkay. Perplexity is great too, but it's different. Okay. So let me follow this thread I was going down, which is around job displacement. I know you think a lot about this. So with me, this researcher as a contractor I was working with for a few months, I no longer need them. Your assistant, you no longer need. Thoughts on just the impact we're going to see on jobs as a result of AI.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:54:58):\nThere's this great William Gibson quote, \"The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed.\" And I think that we are in the Palm Treo phase. Do you remember the Palm Treo?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:09):\nNo.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:55:10):\nSo when I was, let's see, in 2007 I think, was that when the iPhone came out? 2007?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:17):\nI know [inaudible 00:55:19].\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:55:18):\nSomething like that. In 2007, there was this device called the Palm Treo and it was like a little PDA with a stylus and it had a little modem attachment. And so what you could do is you could get your email anywhere and that was this shocking thing. It had a black and white or barely color screen and you could go in and email people. And I remember walking through the mall buying shoes while answering business emails and going, \"This is the ultimate freedom. This is incredible.\" But the problem with that device was it sucked. You had to use a stylus, it's not a good user experience. And then the iPhone comes out and you're like, \"Okay, this is what I was waiting for. This is the real thing.\" But I got a little preview with the Palm Treo and so right now people like me who have the time and skillset to nerd out and build the agents can do this. It's just not accessible to everybody.\n\n(00:56:14):\nAnd I think that if it was accessible to everybody in terms of if you could just open ChatGPT and say, \"Hey, ChatGPT, I run a business, can you help me?\" And it started asking you questions and it said, \"Oh well you do sales. Do you want me to set up a sales agent? Okay, great, plug in your HubSpot API, now tell me a few things and then give me access to all your data.\" And then before you know it, it's just a digital employee that's on the other end of the phone on ChatGPT just like in the movie, Her, that you can talk to and it can go do stuff. I think that is kind of the iPhone moment that we're going to have in some time in the next five years. And so I think that if AI doesn't progress, we will see some serious job displacement, like what you already mentioned, the translators, the researchers, the admin, some assistant jobs, depending on the kind of work they do, those jobs will definitely be massively affected.\n\n(00:57:13):\nBut I think pretty quick, all knowledge work jobs could be affected if the models scale in the way that they say they're going to. I mean if you trust Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, I mean Dario Amodei said by, \"2027, our models will be smarter than all PhDs.\" So in any subject. That is a staggering statement. And he's been a very conservative kind of almost fearful voice in the AI world. Very cautious to say things like that. And so when he said that, I perked up and started listening carefully. I don't know that that's how it's going to play out. He might be trying to fundraise, we have to take it with a grain of salt. But if that's true, then I think so many knowledge work jobs are going to change massively.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:09):\nOkay, there's a lot here. I actually had Mike on the podcast, their CPL, Mike Krieger, and he pointed out that Dario, every prediction he's had so far has been right over the past few years. And so there's a reason to listen to his insights. Okay. Andrew, I know you're not going to have all the answers for people. But let me ask you kind of a two-part question for new grads and for people currently in the workforce say like, I don't know, senior product manager advice on what they should do, where should they focus? What skills will matter most? What jobs do you think will last? What advice can you give us?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:58:43):\nEverybody 10 years ago, do you remember there was this whole movement that we should teach kids how to code? Remember that?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):\nMh-hmm.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:58:51):\nNow teaching kids how to code is teaching kids Basic and we have a GUI, right? You don't need to learn punch cards and basic programming or MS-DOS because we all have keyboards and mice. We don't have to do that. And I feel like coding has really gone away because of that. And I think now people are saying people need to learn how to prompt, which I think is very true for the tool set right now. But I don't know how relevant that is in the future because I think we're still, again, in the Palm Treo phase, I think that the AIs will be very good at eliciting what the actual problem you're trying to solve is and reinterpreting it in a way that it can optimize the query to get the right answer and solve the problem.\n\n(00:59:38):\nAnd so I think the fundamental question is do all jobs just become a single prompt? For example, does a CEO just grow the business while making the customers happy and turning a profit or something like that? And it is able to actually be an omniscient presence that can run a whole company. Now that's a big I'm someone building AI agents. I can barely get it to reliably do calendar entries and that kind of stuff. So I don't think that's totally imminent, but I can certainly see a world where that's coming. And so the question is, what is one to do when that reality is barreling down at you? For people who have resources, I think there's a lot of things they can do in terms of investment, they can invest in the companies that'll benefit from this, companies that have a lot of compute or energy or that sort of thing.\n\n(01:00:29):\nSo that's one thing, but that's not really the question. The question is what do you do if you're a smart 18-year-old or 19-year-old or whatever? In my opinion, I think the best thing to do right now is to get incredibly good with these tools and utilize them to build enough wealth that you can put the money into diversifying into compute and energy. And I do think that while everybody thinks that all jobs will go away in five years and robots will be everywhere, people generally overestimate things in the short term and underestimate them in the long term. So I think there's going to be this long window where robotics is not anywhere near good enough to even do raking leaves and stuff. And I think there's going to be a ton of opportunity for people to just spin up new businesses that never existed before.\n\n(01:01:20):\nI was talking to some friends and we were like, \"What do you do in a world of abundance where everything is really cheap and companies operate almost autonomously?\" I think there's a lot of weird skillsets that we can't imagine right now. For example, just being funny, right? Being funny to hang out with them. Think about OnlyFans, right? Right now, there's this whole idea of OnlyFans where people are paying for comfort and connection, but in a romantic sense. Imagine people did that day to day, they just love hanging out with funny people. So you have a funny guy who you chat with or comes over to your house or whatever it is, I'm making stuff up. Maybe it's a guy who comes to play pickleball with you or something, I don't know. But I can imagine that in this weird world, there's all these weird new jobs.\n\n(01:02:06):\nSo I think my take is things will either be totally fine or they will be terrible and we'll all be dead. And I can't predict which those is there. I don't think it's worth thinking about all of us being dead. And so I think it's really just lean into what are the tools, how do you stay cutting edge? How do you build businesses and wealth in this new world? But I am certainly feeling a little bit like all of our brains could be defunct in the next 10 years. And that's kind of a scary thought.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):\nI'm picturing this dystopian world where humans are just going around making jokes.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:02:44):\nWhere does status come from in a world of abundance? Where does status come from? Maybe it is just like being the best at hiking or something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:52):\nWell, let me ask you this because this is where it gets even more real is just with your kids. What are you encouraging them to learn? What are you encouraging them to get good at? Because this is the real problem a lot of people are having right now is what will matter in the future. Obviously we don't know, but what are you encouraging them to focus on?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:03:09):\nWell, I don't know. I mean there's so little, they're five and eight. And so really what I'm focused on is making sure they're socialized and they're polite, very basic. So are they comfortable talking to adults? I often send my son, whenever he wants something at a cafe, I always make him go up, ask nicely, pay himself, all that kind of stuff. But at this point I feel like for the first 10 years of life, you're just trying to make sure that they're not traumatized or rude. And I think it's going to be really interesting when they're 10 plus where they're really aware of this stuff and can start building with these tools. And to be honest, I just don't know. I think I just want them to lean into whatever they're passionate about and go from there. But I have no idea. And to be honest, it's not something I'm worrying about because it's too hard to worry about. I don't know, it's too multivariate. There's too many ways it can go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:03):\nI feel like a core part of your message is just get good with these tools. There's this classic quote, \"AI won't replace you, it'll be somebody very good using AI is going to replace you,\" at least for a while. And so it feels like a big part of this is just use these things. Before we started recording, we were having a mic issue and I love you just went straight to ChatGPT, \"ChatGPT, how do I connect this mic to reverse side and make it work?\" And I feel like that's just a habit to build is just like go to ChatGPT whenever you have a problem like that. I've been doing that a lot. I was connecting a subwoofer from what wire do I need to buy to connect the subwoofer to the receiver?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:04:37):\nWell, the best part about ChatGPT is I used to just get stuck and I have ADHD. So when I got stuck, let's say, what's an example? I was redoing my home IT security. And what will happen is I'll be in the terminal and I'll enter something and then something goes wrong and it just keeps erroring. And then I'm like, \"Well, I'm out.\" I have ADHD, I can't tolerate this. I just lose the thread completely. And ChatGPT allows me to stay on track and go so much further and faster than I ever could before. I love not being artificially stopped in your tracks and being able to continue the flow state as a result.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):\nAnd also I noticed you were using voice mode, which is what I've been using more and more. And I feel like that's something a lot of people sleep on is just the voice mode where you could talk to it and not have to sit there and type your questions. Okay, so let me go in a different direction. You've been spending a lot of time, you wrote a whole book about this, of just your journey from, you call it Barista to Billionaire where you started serving coffee, then you ended up being very successful, then realize that didn't make you happy. You're quite unhappy with lots and lots of money. I think a lot of people hear these stories, they see this stuff, they're like, \"Yeah, okay, I sort of get it.\" But they still do the same sorts of things. They still assume they will be happy once they reach that next goal, that next title, make certain dollar amount. What can you share? What have you learned about just what it actually takes to be happy that you think people are still not really recognizing and still kind of are confused about?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:06:10):\nDo you remember when you're in your early 20s? I remember when I was in my early 20s, I'd always be like, \"I need to move away to Europe. I need to go discover myself.\" And I'd be really anxious and stressed out and in an existential crisis and then I'd fly to Europe to go backpacking or something and I'd still feel anxious and have my existential crisis. It's just now I'm in Europe. And I think the reality is that whatever's in your brain, whatever that anxiety loop is, doesn't go away just because you have a bigger house or more money in the bank account or you're in Bali or wherever it is, that's a chemical reaction happening inside you that relates to your past and your DNA and all that stuff that creates that soup. And for me, I've always been a very anxious person. I've always worried about tomorrow, I rarely enjoy today, I'm always worrying about what could go wrong in health or my businesses or with my family or whatever it is.\n\n(01:07:12):\nAnd so when I started my business, all I thought was I just don't want to work for someone else. If I can just wake up in the morning, do my own thing, make 60K a year, then I'll be happy. So I got that and then it was once I make a million dollars a year and I can buy a house, well, I got that and so on and so on and so on all the way up to at one point being worth over a billion dollars, by the way, should redo the title of the book from Barista to Billionaire, now it's former billionaire because our stock went down, but it didn't change anything. I'm still just as anxious as ever. I remember a month ago, I had this day where I was sitting in the sauna and I was stressing about a bunch of business problems and money things and I stopped myself and I was like, \"Wait a minute.\"\n\n(01:08:04):\n10 years ago I had all the same thoughts and I was stressed out about similar kinds of problems and our revenue was $20 million bucks or $15 million bucks. Now we're at almost 300 million and I'm still stressed about the same things. And the saddest part was as I met more and more wealthier people all the way up to multibillionaires, I realized they were all still comparing themselves to their peers, competing over who has what and tracking stuff and still unhappy that anxiety loop or depression was still in their brain. I remember I had this moment where I met this guy who is a single-digit multibillionaire, and he goes, \"Oh, Jeff Bezos, he's just so fucking rich.\" And I was like, \"Wait, what do you mean you're worth $5 billion? What can he do that you can't?\" And he goes, \"He can buy a super yacht.\" And it's like, \"What?\"\n\n(01:09:09):\nYou can look at that guy and you can say, \"Oh, that's a wacko and all the other stuff.\" But the reality is that we're all just comparing ourselves to our peers, whatever our peers have that we don't feel hard done by. And I remember just thinking like, \"Oh my God, how do I avoid becoming this?\" And that's the scary reality is no matter how lucky you are, I mean we're also fortunate. For me, I live in Canada. I have every opportunity that I ever could have hoped for. And there's people all over the world who have nowhere near what I had growing up. And yet I felt hard done by because in my neighborhood I was the poor kid. I wasn't poor globally. I wasn't even poor based on Canada. But all my friends had big screen TVs and would go to Hawaii and I never got to do any of that stuff. My parents were stressed about money. So I feel hard done by.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:05):\nThere's a phrase of friend's financial advisor once shared, \"The Joneses are doing really well,\" and that's hard to get over. So what changes did you make to just be happier? It's hard to give up money. It's hard to give up more money you could make. It's hard to give up things that money buys, I guess just so what did you change?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:10:28):\nWell, there's a few things. I mean, one was reframing money to some degree to have it be something that wasn't just about feathering my own nest and making it better. So for example, I was talking to a friend who's very wealthy and I was saying all the feelings I described of have all this and yet I don't feel better. And he said, \"Well, what are you working for?\" And I said, \"Well, I guess I'm just working for the numbers to get bigger and have more employees and that's nice. Our businesses do good things in the world and help more people and stuff, but ultimately it's just to pile up cash.\" And he said, \"I've reframed it so that all my money, 90% of my money plus, goes into my philanthropic foundation and then it gets given away to great causes. So when I think about working really hard or losing a deal or an investment going well, the win isn't for me. The win is about doing something good.\"\n\n(01:11:26):\nSo I did that and that definitely helped. I also stopped spending as much money. I found that the more stuff I had, the more houses I had, the more people that directly worked for me to manage all that stuff, the less happy, I was owned by my stuff. And then I work really hard not to have people... I try not to beat people over the head with it. I drive a normal car. I don't bring people to my house until I know them really, really well. I meet them on neutral ground, I meet them in a cafe. I dress like a schmo. I just try not to be a weird out of touch rich person. But the biggest thing, which is a weird answer, is actually medicating myself. So basically all my life I've been really anxious.\n\n(01:12:18):\nAnd in 2020, I remember I was watching a movie with my ex-wife and I was looping on, \"I need to respond to this email. If I don't respond to that email, this person's going to be mad.\" And then I realized that I was watching a movie for the last 20 minutes and I didn't know anything about what was happening in the movie. And then I was going, \"Oh my God, my wife is going to be mad at me. We're going to get in a fight,\" and I'm projecting all this negative stuff. And in that moment I was like, \"Okay, maybe I do need to try an SSRI or something. This is not sustainable.\" And so I went to my doctor and I got prescribed with one, and I remember I was so scared of it that I cut it into 10 pieces. I said, \"I'm just going to take a tiny little piece.\"\n\n(01:13:01):\nAnd it took me six months after that to try any. But I started taking these pieces every day and I just noticed that within about three or four days, it was like someone had turned down the volume on the nasty voice inside of me doing all that. And for the first time in my life I felt relief. No amount of money or success or attention or anything else had done what this little tiny yellow pill could do for my mental state. And so now I've been on an SSRI for four and a half years or something like that. And then I also started medicating my ADHD. And I would say that my brain went from Times Square to a quiet library. And I think a lot of people are scared of that, but ultimately most people are acting out something that's going on inside of them. There's a trauma or something medically going on and that's creating this anxiety, this depression, this feeling and addressing that is so much more important than trying to get praise from the external world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:05):\nWow, it's really powerful. I really am really thankful you're sharing this. The advice most people hear, the general, I don't know, culture is just like, \"No, don't take meds. Don't medicate yourself, I don't know, there's all these downsides, all this risk. The pharma industry is trying to make money.\" I love this other perspective of it. It's actually really effective and actually makes a big difference in your life and it may be the only solution.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:14:29):\nWell, it's funny because if you have a headache, I don't think many people say, \"Oh, don't take Tylenol, you're benefiting Johnson & Johnson, big pharma.\" They go, \"Yeah, you take a Tylenol when you have a headache.\" Or a lot of people have seasonal allergies and they take antihistamines and they forget that histamine is not just in your nose, histamines in your brain and everywhere in your body. And so when you take an antihistamine or even a Tylenol, you're changing your brain, you're changing the way you think, you're changing everything. And yet for some reason, people are so scared, myself included, of taking an SSRI or similar medication to treat something that is ruining their life. Anxiety was ruining my life. Every minute of every day I was convinced that something terrible was about to happen. And even now medicated, I still have that voice. It's not like that frankly beneficial voice that helps you grow your business or whatever becomes unproductive at a certain point. And I think that it is wonderful to be able to actually just get a little bit of solace from it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):\nWell, for folks that, I mentioned many folks listening, are like, \"Oh man, I should really explore this,\" what's the best way to explore is to talk to your primary care physician?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:15:47):\nYeah. I think talking to your doctor, and one note I think a lot of people miss is when I was so scared of side effects because you hear about all these horrific side effects of people lose their libido and feel terrible and stuff. And so I looked into it and a lot of the side effects are due to the way that people metabolize different drugs. And so you can actually do your 23andMe or similar DNA test and you can find out how you metabolize different SSRIs. And then I chose one that I could metabolize well. And so I've had no side effects or problems. And I know every time I mention this, I get a lot of people that say exactly what you say, big pharma and all this other stuff. But I just ask everyone listening, if you take a Tylenol or you take an antihistamine or other medications, I don't know why something that can be so profoundly helpful is something that people need to be afraid of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:40):\nAmazing. Andrew, we've covered so much ground. I love the spectrum of topics we've gone after. Is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything you wanted to double down on? Any last nugget you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:16:56):\nOne thing that was shocking for me was I was doing... My doctor asked me to get a cognitive test, not because I had any problem, but he said, \"Look, it's really important to get a baseline in your 30s because then as you age, we can make sure that you're not getting Alzheimer's or dementia or whatever.\" So I go and I do this test with a neurologist and she asked me a bunch of questions. It's, \"Remember these 10 digits and say them backwards and all this stuff.\" And finally when I get my test results back, she said, \"Look, your crystallized intelligence, your ability to remember stuff, long range is totally fine. You're above average. Your short-term memory, your working memory is 10th percentile, very, very bad. And you probably should get checked for ADHD.\"\n\n(01:17:47):\nAnd I was like, \"Nope. There's no way. I don't have ADHD. I'm organized. I've got to-do lists. I built a business. I wasn't the hyper kid in school or anything like that.\" And she said, \"Well, look, just humor me. Just go get tested.\" And so I went through this crazy process. You can go online and just quickly get tested or whatever. But I went through this really, really five-day process to get tested. And it turned out that I do have it. And it's really interesting because if you take the normal population of about 5% of people have ADHD, but about 30% of entrepreneurs have ADHD. And many entrepreneurs I talk to, they love new things. They love jumping around between a million different topics. They're an inch deep and a mile wide like I described. And they describe themselves as unemployable. And frankly, I remember I was so skeptical of ADHD that when my girlfriend told me, a friend of hers got diagnosed with it, I sarcastically said, \"Oh good, she better take some meth,\" talking about stimulant drugs.\n\n(01:18:54):\nPreviously I was very, very skeptical of ADHD, but it is a real brain disorder if you actually dig into it. It's a very real thing, very objective that people have poor executive function. And for me, it's given me a lot more empathy for myself and my behaviors because at work, if you have ADHD, you can delegate to other people and build systems to get around your disability. But at home, that's where it really plays out. And so for me, it's like my girlfriend asked me to take the garbage out, and I say, \"Of course.\" And then I forget three times in a row. And she views that as you are being very hurtful and you're not caring for me. And it causes all sorts of different problems at home.\n\n(01:19:37):\nAnd so for me, not only did it make my work life better because I was more focused, but it actually really helped me in my personal life and it made me feel not broken. I always felt a bit broken. I couldn't put my finger on why, but I just went, \"I'm not good at doing all the things everyone else seems to be able to do no problem.\" And so I think especially because you have an entrepreneur audience, I think a lot of entrepreneurs should consider getting checked for ADHD. Just go and ChatGPT say, \"Ask me a of questions and tell me if you think I might have it.\" But I was very surprised, and that's been really impactful for me too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:13):\nMan, this garbage story is very descriptive of my life, and so I'm going to do this. There's this implication that it's good to know this, right? It feels scary to feel like, \"Oh, shit I might get diagnosed with ADHD.\" Your advice I imagine is it's better to know because you could do stuff about it.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:20:33):\nTotally. I think it's like any medical thing, right? It's like there's an Alzheimer's gene, right? And if you know you have it, there's a lot you can do to slow the disease or prevent maybe getting it or whatever. It's always better to know. Even if you don't medicate, I think there's a lot of lifestyle interventions, dietary interventions, and just things you can do to make your life easier, even if it's just explaining to your partner, \"Hey, I need things to be explained to me this way so that I can be effective in loving you.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:05):\nBeautiful. Okay. Well, Andrew, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:21:11):\nLet's go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:12):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:21:17):\nIf I could only recommend two, I would recommend The Laws of Human Nature by Robert Greene. It's basically like a compendium of every single type of personality disorder or psychological effect. How do people work their minds to make bad decisions? What is a narcissist? What is a psychopath? All that kind of stuff. And Robert Greene does such a great job of telling all that in a really engaging way by using storytelling. So every single chapter has a story about someone with that personality disorder. So I love that book.\n\n(01:21:48):\nThe other one that I love is a book by Felix Dennis called How to Get Rich. It's hilarious because the whole book starts out saying, \"I got rich and I regret it, and I wish that I'd become a poet.\" And instead he went off and he built this huge publishing empire, became a poet in his sixties, and then he died of throat cancer. So it's his story, he basically says, \"I'll tell you how to build the business even though you probably shouldn't.\" And I read that when I was in my 20s, and I found it so exciting and inspiring, and then I recently reread it and I was like, \"Oh my God, why didn't I listen to this guy?\" Everything he said came true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:23):\nNext question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you have really enjoyed?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:22:27):\nI love Challengers. I don't know if you've seen it, but it's amazingly acted, amazing cinematography. It's like this amazing romantic triad tennis movie. Really, really good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):\nDo you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love? You already mentioned Limitless. Is there anything else?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:22:45):\nI'm one of those people who really believes in the idea of a robot vacuum. I've probably spent $10,000 on different robot vacuums over the years, probably five or six of them. And I finally got one that actually works. It's called the Matic Vacuum, M-A-T-I-C. And basically, I think it's like former Google Engineers basically built like a mini Waymo car. So it has machine vision and it will avoid absolutely everything and never get tangled, and it can mop your floors and vacuum. I've been super impressed with it so far.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:16):\nI've got one of these myself. Completely agree. My wife loves it, which I did not expect. She's like, \"Turn that Matic on.\" It's very delightful. It has his little personality and it just does a really good job. And I'm not an investor, and that's awesome. I'm a huge fan. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:23:38):\nYeah. My favorite is a quote by Jerzy Gregorek. It's, \"Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.\" And I often find that anytime that I'm making the easy choice, my life gets hard. And when I make the hard choice to shut down the business, fire the person, say bye to a project that I was excited about, it's almost always the right choice and it makes my life a lot easier.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:07):\nFinal question. Okay, so let me know if this is true. I found that when you were a teenager, when you're running Macteens, you interviewed Steve Jobs at a conference. Is that true?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:24:18):\nSo when I was a teenager, I had a tech news website and I emailed the Apple PR people and I said, \"Hey, could I interview Steve Jobs?\" And they kind of laughed at me. They're like, \"Yeah, there's no way. You're not going to interview Steve Jobs, but hey, why don't you go to this tour of the Apple Store?\" So this is no other Apple Store has existed. This is in New York at Macworld back in 2004, no, 2003, something like that. And so I was really excited about that. So I show up to go do this tour and there's 30 other journalists there, and I'm first in line, and this big black SUV pulls up and this man gets out and the man is wearing gray New Balance, little circular John Lennon glasses, the mock turtleneck. And my brain finally puts it together and I realize it's Steve Jobs.\n\n(01:25:11):\nAnd he walks directly up to me because I'm first in line and he shakes my hand and he says, \"Hi, I'm Steve.\" And I'm like a quivering mess. I'm 17 years old. He is my hero. He's my Jesus. And so I was just so high on adrenaline that I just started asking him questions. As soon as we walked in, I basically just stayed at his side, and I just picked his brain about all sorts of different stuff. So it's not like I got to ask him questions about life. I was asking him about the new 17-inch iMac or whatever. But it was a pretty cool experience to get to meet him.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):\nThat is awesome. There's such a funny thread recently with guests. Everyone, there's like a Steve Jobs connection for the past couple months of guests. That's an awesome story. It just shows that it wasn't luck. You made this happen. You got there first in line.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:25:59):\nThe lesson for me was ask big and maybe you'll get something great. Ask for amazing, you'll get something great, which I did.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:07):\nYes, door in the face technique, I think people call it.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:26:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:12):\nAndrew, this was incredible. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out? I know you're buying companies, investing in companies. Just talk about what you're looking for there in case people are like, \"Oh, this is me.\" And then finally, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:26:26):\nYeah, my business is Tiny, T-I-N-Y.com, and we buy businesses. Basically, when we sold the business, we hated it. We went through this process where we talked to all these douchebags that ran private equity firms that would show up in our office in suits and use a bunch of words we didn't understand. And we ended up going, \"Man, why can't we just sell to somebody who's like us?\" And so we basically started Tiny to become the buyer we wish we could have sold to. And we're looking for businesses that have some of the qualities I mentioned before. So really high quality businesses that do something positive in the world and have happy customers, happy employees, and some kind of competitive advantage that will make them continue into the future. So we own AeroPress, Letterboxd, Dribble, which is a design social network, whole bunch of businesses like that. So if somebody is thinking about selling their business, definitely get in touch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:29):\nAmazing. Okay. And then how can listeners be useful to you if it's not just that?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:27:33):\nI just would say if there's anyone really interesting coming to Victoria, Canada, which is where I live, send me an email and would love to have coffee with you. The reason I love going on podcasts is because I get to meet so many interesting people, both randomly. If I'm in a cafe and someone sees me and says hi, I often make a lot of friends that way, or if someone comes to my hometown. So yeah, just get in touch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:56):\nAmazing. Andrew, thank you so much for being here.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:27:59):\nYeah, thanks, dude. That was fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:00):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:28:03):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# When enough is enough | Andy Johns (ex-FB, Twitter, Quora)\n\n## Transcript\n\nAndy Johns (00:00:00):\nThere are day-to-day stresses that are normal and we just have to put up with, but then there's the other stuff that's the flashing red alarm. Again, you can go back to animals. It's like when their fundamental functions, when their core behaviors of diet, exercise, playfulness, socialization, sleep, when those things get disrupted, it's a sign that there is something going on here that you need to take a look at. \n\n(00:00:27):\nSo the same is true with people. If your sleep always sucks, if your relationships are constantly strained or frequently strained, if your physical health is failing, there's so many ways that that can be measured. So there's really no excuse for that to say, \"Oh, I just didn't know.\" I'd say it's to look at those things. When those are suffering or when they're really out of whack, it's undeniable that there is something that is detrimental to your wellbeing that's going on right now, and your body is telling you, \"Stop. Something needs to change.\"\n\nLenny (00:01:03):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Andy Johns. This is going to be a very different type of episode and maybe the most meaningful and important episode of the podcast. \n\n(00:01:21):\nAndy was a legendary product and growth leader at Facebook, Twitter, Quora, and Wealthfront, where he was VP of Growth and VP of Product, and then President, and as you'll hear, was in line to be CEO of Wealthfront until he came to realize that this path was not right for him. After a lot of internal reflection and hard self-work, he changed his entire life's path to becoming a mental health advocate and helping burned out high achievers and also veterans with their mental health journey. \n\n(00:01:48):\nIn our conversation, Andy shares his personal story, what true burnout looks like, and when you should pay attention to your mental health. Talks about the process of deep personal transformation and the four steps involved in making lasting change in your life. He also shares how to actually allow change to happen in your life, tactics for moving down this path, and a lot of advice and real talk on mental health and tech.\n\n(00:02:10):\nThere's a lot of struggle happening in the world right now, including in tech, and so I hope this conversation helps you with your own journey. You can check out Andy's work at Clues.Life. With that, I bring you Andy Johns after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:26):\nThis episode is brought to you by Mercury, who I also happen to use for my business checking account.

You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how can it help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda. \n\n(00:04:07):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down.

Happy to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:54):\nSo I've been both looking forward to our conversation, but I've also been dreading it a little bit because I know it's going to be incredibly valuable, but I also think it's going to get very heavy, and I think it's important to get heavy sometimes, especially with the stuff we're going to be talking about, but just wanted to share that.\n\nAndy Johns (00:05:09):\nYeah, and I'm looking forward to that. I think one of the things that has been a change for me over the last several years is that I prefer to move forward in my life being completely honest with who I am, not hiding any aspects of myself, including the stuff that in the past I'd be afraid to share. \n\nLenny (00:05:29):\nWell, on that topic, I'd love for you to just walk us through the path that you've taken. Basically, you're like me in a sense. You're helping companies build product, drive growth, worked with some of the best companies in the world, and then things took a turn. So could you just start with a brief overview of what happened? \n\nAndy Johns (00:05:48):\nSure. So the short background is I spent about 17 years working in the world of startups. I think on the whole, it was a successful experience. I managed to land at a handful of really good companies and had a great experience, but along the way, despite having built somewhat of an impressive resume, I guess you could say, I was also struggling quite a bit in terms of my emotional, psychological, and spiritual health. So in some ways, it feels like the cliche that as my career reached its pinnacle, that from a professional, from a financial perspective, I was at my highest, but when it came to other aspects of my life, I was arguably at my lowest or close to my lowest. \n\n(00:06:43):\nSo even though I had those successes, there was a lot that I needed to work through that was under the hood, which I eventually came to understand very, very deeply as a result of turning inward and doing a lot of work on my own path towards self-understanding and healing some deep emotional wounds.\n\nLenny (00:07:04):\nIn a post that you worked on for my newsletter back in the day, you shared this story of, I think maybe it was at Wealthfront where you were giving a big presentation. Maybe share that story?\n\nAndy Johns (00:07:14):\nSure. I can share that. It actually goes back to ... This is 2010. I was at Twitter at the time. I was in my late 20s. Again, my career was going really well. I was starting to string together a series of successful experiences, and I was suddenly hit with near constant panic, panic attacks, depression. I was having a very, very difficult time sleeping and just managing my emotions as a whole. It got to the point to where there were several occasions while I was at work where I could tell that I was about ready to have a breakdown of sorts, and I would just grab my laptop, throw it in my bag, and pretty quietly just walk out of the office even if it was 10:00 AM and I'd only been there for an hour or two. That happened on multiple occasions. \n\n(00:08:07):\nThere were some occasions in which I was set up to go and speak to the entire company during an all-hands session, and it was something where I just had to come up with an excuse and bow out of it because at the time, I was already completely overcome and overwhelmed by this near constant panic I was experiencing, but I had a really good poker face, I don't think most people could see it.\n\n(00:08:34):\nTo give a little bit of an explanation and to tie first question together with this, there were two major things that contributed to me having a pretty acute case of burnout and needing to step away from my career as I knew it. The first was just the slow and steady accumulation of the pressure, the stresses, the anxieties, the emotional ups and downs that came from having such a strong commitment to my career, and frankly an addiction to achievement as a way to feel good and to feel whole, but I was so focused on my work that I had slowly become the frog that was boiling in the pot, the typical analogy of you don't realize how bad things are getting because it's happening to you slowly until it happens quickly, right?\n\n(00:09:38):\nSo on one hand, I was not only struggling emotionally and psychologically because of the pressures of the career and climbing the ladder and just the common existential angst that comes with being at a startup and not knowing what the future holds. What I later came to understand was that I was also starting to experience and to address old emotional pain that I'd buried for a very long time, stemming back to the death of my mom when I was 10. She was severely mentally ill. She was bipolar, had bouts of psychosis, and had spent time in and out of psychiatric hospitals. I can remember going to those hospitals as some of my earliest memories as a kid.\n\n(00:10:33):\nSo there was a lot of disruption in my childhood, a lot of neglect, some occasional abuse, and then it culminated with the loss of the most important female figure in my life when I was 10. Of course, like anyone else after that, I was in a lot of pain emotionally, but as a kid, you don't have the tools or even the capabilities to effectively process something as significant and traumatic as an experience like that. \n\n(00:11:11):\nSo my mind did what the mind of most children will do, which is it finds a way to bury it or to ignore it. The thing that I had latched onto that made me feel better was that anytime I hit a home run or scored a goal or got straight A's and was just basically a stellar student and a stellar athlete, I was showered with love, not only from my family, which is fantastic, but from society at large, especially within the world that we live in.\n\n(00:11:44):\nSo I learned very early on that if I wanted to feel good, I needed to achieve, and that if I wanted to love myself and be considered lovable by others, I needed to achieve. That pulled me out of a darkness that I was in for several years as a kid, and I'm glad that it did, and it led to an excellent experience in high school, in college, and then well into my 20s, but eventually, those emotional wounds are going to come to the surface. They're going to come up for error, and when they do, it's going to be difficult, and that's what happened with me. \n\n(00:12:24):\nSo it was really two things coming together at the same time. It was the growing pressures of an escalating career within the dynamic industry, but then also, I think, the natural maturation of my mind and of adult development such that it was time for that old pain to come to the surface, and when it did, it was very disruptive and it's something that I'm still continuing to work on to this day.\n\nLenny (00:12:55):\nI imagine many people listening either resonate with some of this or just like, \"This is exactly the life I'm living.\" I know you work with people now helping them through these challenges, especially in tech. So two questions there. One is just you've done polls around this. Just what percentage of people in tech have you seen struggle with these sorts of things on some degree?\n\nAndy Johns (00:13:16):\nFor the last two years, I've been doing a lot of writing, and most of my writing has really just been me opening up and sharing this personal side of what was going on behind the scenes. Along the way, I've been able to connect with, at this point, hundreds of folks in the tech industry who are dealing with their own forms of burnout or their own deep existential questions that are coming to the surface and they're trying to understand them.\n\n(00:13:48):\nSo from some of the surveys I've put out from my own anecdotal experience and from some proper research that's been conducted by experts who focus on entrepreneur and high performer wellbeing, I'd say that it's a fair estimate to say that at least 50% to 60% of tech employees who have, just to give it a bit more nuance, who have been in the saddle, so to speak, for a minimum of five to seven years, they're experiencing some form of psychological and emotional distress. It may be minor enough such that they think it's just day-to-day anxiety, but it's often much more significant than people realize because, again, it creeps up on you slowly and then all of a sudden it hits you quickly.\n\nLenny (00:14:42):\nWe're going to dive into what this looks like and ways you've found to be helpful to people. One last question before we get there. You walked away from a pretty senior incredible role, and in the post that you wrote, you shared the salary you gave up in that giving up. Can you just talk about what that last role was and then what you had to give up to change career paths and [inaudible 00:15:05]\n\nAndy Johns (00:15:04):\nYeah. So one of the things that I did towards the tail end of my career as I became a consumer or founding partner of the consumer arm of an early stage venture capital firm, and most folks know that especially once a fund gets big enough, it can be a high paying job. Suddenly, I found myself in a position where I was making high six figures per year into early seven figures. When I look back on it in retrospect, I had put in so much effort to get to that point really going back to when I was 10 years old, having always been the straight A student and captain of whatever team I was on. \n\n(00:15:46):\nFrom the age of 10 to basically 35, I was switched on, constantly seeking to perform at the top of whatever my field was. So I gotten to that point first as an executive at a high growth startup, that was Wealthfront, and I became president and was next in line to be CEO before I had a health scare with my heart that led to me stepping away from the company because I knew I couldn't take on the CEO position. Then here I was six or seven months later, again, very subconsciously driven by the desire to succeed because underneath that was the sense that I wasn't lovable unless I was succeeding. \n\n(00:16:30):\nHere I was after a heart attack scare at the age of 35 sweeping that under the carpet like I'd swept so much stuff under the carpet and choosing to join on as a founding partner of a venture capital firm, which is not an easy job at all, and especially when you're starting a new firm up, it's, in a lot of ways, it's a company in and of its own. So it was another startup. It was my sixth startup in a row. \n\n(00:16:59):\nSo three years into that though, even though I was working on my own mental health and my emotional wellbeing, I had convinced myself repeatedly for so many years that everything was okay and that I could continue to put my head down and run through these walls, these professional walls and keep going, but it got to a point to where that was no longer the case. \n\n(00:17:32):\nIn fact, it was the culmination of conversations with my doctors and with the experts that I've been working with where I ended up actually spending 45 days in a mental health institute myself. It was something that was extremely difficult to do. It was something that certainly contributed or was really the tip of the sphere of me stepping away from my career of realizing that the only reason I was continuing to push forward despite how poorly I felt on the inside was because of stuff that had happened to me when I was much younger and because of the fallible nature of the human mind and how it wants to interpret experiences and ways that can become so self-critical and self damaging.\n\n(00:18:32):\nSo that happened for me roughly three years ago. Needless to say, my life has changed quite a bit since then, and I'm happy to chat more about that, but that was a difficult decision to walk away from my career at the peak of it, but I guess the takeaway, and then I'll stop for a bit, is it's important for people to understand that there are formative experiences in our lives which put us in positions to where we form adaptations in order to survive, just like my attachment to achievement and how my self-worth was entirely tied up in that.\n\n(00:19:14):\nI needed that when I was younger because I was heartbroken, I lost a parent, and that adaptation that I formed saved my life when I was young, and it gave me a great childhood after that, and a great next couple of decades, but these adaptations, if you're unaware of them and if you're unaware of the subconscious drivers that are responsible for them, they run the risk that they go too far, and that these adaptations, which were initially beneficial to you and to your life, they reverse course in a sense, and they become detrimental to your present state and your future development. \n\n(00:20:04):\nSo my stepping away from the career, stepping away from the high salary, and stepping away from everything I'd worked so hard to obtain was an action that I took in recognition of the fact that that early life adaptation had now gone awry and was responsible for my life heading in a negative direction and it was time to change.\n\nLenny (00:20:30):\nThe gift of your experience going through all that is that now we can all benefit learning from that. You spend your time these days helping people get over a lot of these challenges that they have. Can you just talk about what it is you spend your time on specifically? Then let's unpack the process that you've come up with to help people through this.\n\nAndy Johns (00:20:52):\nNow, when people ask me what I do, I say I do mental health advocacy, and I do it in a few ways. One is I sit on the board of a nonprofit called Heroic Hearts Project, and what we do is we raise money so that we can pay for military veterans with PTSD to get access to alternative therapies, namely psychedelic assisted psychotherapy. It was started by a handful of veterans. I was lucky enough to meet a few of them a couple of years ago. Given my own personal experience with PTSD stemming from my childhood experiences, I was bonded together with these men and women of the Armed Forces who had, in many cases, not only their own personal trauma, but also war trauma. So that's one organization that I'm thankful to be able to work with and help out. \n\n(00:21:48):\nI also write my newsletter and have created a new website that I'm toying with. In general, my writing and the content that I've put out is focused on the unhappy achievers, the other folks like myself who are out there, which there's quite a few of us. I write in order to express my personal experience because I think there's many others that can relate. So those are the things that I've been working on and a little bit of coaching with some of the high performers as well.\n\nLenny (00:22:23):\nThrow out the website in case people want to check it out while we're talking.\n\nAndy Johns (00:22:26):\nThe website that I'm playing around with is called Clues.Life, clues as in questions, clues, not truth dot life or facts dot life. I called it Clues Dot Life for a reason because if there's one thing that I've learned in my own personal journey, it's that given the immense heterogeneity of the human population and how we're all born unique and then we're made further unique through our own individual life experiences, the thing that's clear to me is that if somebody is going through their own struggles, at the end of the day, they have to find the philosophies, the tools, and the methods that work for them. \n\n(00:23:08):\nYou can read plenty of studies, you can read the books, you can listen to what others are doing, but at the end of the day, you got to personalize it to yourself. So that's why I called it Clues Dot Life because I'm building this library of mental health information that allows people to navigate all of this information in search of their own clues.\n\nLenny (00:23:28):\nAwesome, and we'll link to that in the show notes, but it's an easy URL to remember. Something you spent a lot of your time on as you've talked about is helping people through deep personal transformation. That's the way you describe it. What is involved in that process of someone going through a deep personal transformation?\n\nAndy Johns (00:23:47):\nI love this question. So most of the conversations I have are with folks who are going through significant change. Now, what's involved in that? It can happen on a spectrum where everyone's process is unique. We all change and unfold in identical ways. Some can go through subtle shifts. I've heard this referred to as a micro transition, where, for example, they may be working at a tech industry or at a tech company, but this specific company they're working at, they have no real values connection to it. So part of their suffering is the fact that they feel that the work that they're doing doesn't really matter or they don't feel a connection to it. So switching to work at a different company that's aligned with something that's consistent with their values, that may be enough for somebody to go through a small transition and then find themselves in a happier place. \n\n(00:24:52):\nThe transitions that I talk about are the big fundamental ones like the transition that I've been going through myself. Now, what's involved in that? I think that there are four parts, just to give it a simple general framework. Step one is it begins with suffering. These large transitions in life rarely take place in the absence of suffering. So step number one is suffer. Usually, the deeper somebody suffers, the more significant the transition that may follow. There's a reason why in the 12 steps community like Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, you name it, there's a reason that rock bottom is in the vernacular because rock bottom tends to proceed somebody getting sober. So step one is suffering. \n\n(00:25:53):\nStep two is seeking the truth behind why we suffer. Once the suffering gets so bad in somebody through some spiritual intervention, a legal intervention, the intervention of friends and family, whatever it may be, they decide to change, and in order to change, you have to understand the truth as to who you are and why you are the way you are and why you're suffering. The answer lies in understanding the truth, and that is usually a long process. Digging through the subconscious mind, digging through your history and your past, digging through your relationships, that takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of time to remove the mental blocks that we might've spent decades developing such that we don't even see these patterns that we play out regularly. \n\n(00:26:51):\nSo first, you begin with suffering, and then second, you seek the truth for your suffering. What I have found, and that leads to step three in the process, is that once you discover the truth of your suffering, the real root cause of it and where it came from, that's when you move to step three, which is you begin to experience and to practice self-compassion and self-love because inevitably, what you discover through this process of seeking the truth is that your suffering isn't necessarily your fault. Maybe you're suffering because of things that you experienced or had to go through of which you had no control over.\n\n(00:27:44):\nNonetheless, it's common for the mind, especially the mind of a child, to interpret those less than nurturing experiences as, \"This happened because of me.\" So what sits at the core of their suffering is not only a low sense of self, but a shame, a shame regarding who they are and who they believe themselves to be. \n\n(00:28:08):\nWhen you dig deep enough into your own self-understanding, eventually you'll discover that that's not true, that it isn't your fault, that these things swept you up like a wave, and you were just along for a ride of which you had no choice. When you understand that and you start to feel a sense of forgiveness and to begin to love yourself for the first time, you make this switch where then you're willing to live in a way that is more consistent with self-love and self-compassion. \n\n(00:28:45):\nSo me, for example, stepping away from my career, at the end of the day, I wasn't running from something, I was running back towards myself. That was an act of kindness towards myself. Going into a 45-day hospitalization, that was an act of love. So what ends up happening is the truth fuels that process of self-love, and when you begin to live in a way that is consistent with valuing yourself and understanding that it's not your fault, then that's when you move to step four, which is compassion towards others because by understanding yourself and realizing the true nature of why you are the way you are and forgiving yourself because you understand it's not your fault, guess what? You see the same thing in everybody else. \n\n(00:29:46):\nThis is what is meant when folks sometimes say we're all adults or we're all children walking around in adult bodies, right? We're just acting out the things that were done to us in the past because when I think of the human mind, there are many ways that you can describe what the brain is, but one way that I describe it certainly is that it's autobiographical. It tries to predict what's going to happen next based on what happened in the past. It's a prediction engine. That's what it does, and that's why I say it's autobiographical because the way that you present yourself to the world as an adult is a reflection of what happened to you in the past, the messages you were told, the ways you were conditioned by society, maybe the traumas you experienced. \n\n(00:30:36):\nSo that's the process as I see it of deep, deep, deep transformation. It's that four-step process of the suffering, the seeking of truth, the living in a way that is compassionate towards oneself, and then living in a way that is compassionate towards others. When you do that, you change. Think of that as the horizontal foundation to which the rest of your external life is built. The place you choose to live, the partner you choose to have, the friends you have, the career you have, all of these things are erections on top of a foundation of identity, and that identity is what is completely rewired when somebody goes through that four-step process, and as a result, everything that's built on top of that identity, it doesn't necessarily have to change, but it might.\n\nLenny (00:31:41):\nThat feels like a reason somebody wouldn't want to go down this journey of, \"I don't want to change everything about myself.\"\n\nAndy Johns (00:31:48):\nYes, and this is the power of the human mind at work or what someone referred to as the ego. As soon as the ego senses that something wants to challenge it and to undermine its authority, it finds a way to push it away. It finds a way to ignore it because it is a very difficult process. I now understand what some philosophers described as death before dying. In this process of change that I've been going through, it's been the death of the old me, the death of Andy whose identity was entirely attached to succeeding, and that old Andy doesn't want to let go. It's been around for a few decades. It believes that it's there to protect me. \n\n(00:32:46):\nThis is a survival mechanism that's somewhat gone awry within the context of modern life. So it doesn't want to let go, but that's what I've been doing. That's the process I've been going through is slowly but surely finding a way to take my fingers off the steering wheel and to let that old sense of self die, and then in doing so create the room for what's next, whatever that may be. I'm three years into the process of discovering what that will be. So we'll see.\n\nLenny (00:33:24):\nThinking through these four steps, suffering sounds like people will just do that naturally, potentially, and I feel like it gets hard at the understanding the source of that suffering. I guess, one, is that true or do people try to resist that suffering and are just like, \"Nah, it's okay, it's okay,\" and they white knuckle it?\n\nAndy Johns (00:33:45):\nI think you're pretty spot on with it. This dips into a lot of the ancient Eastern spiritual traditions of just this recognition that life involves suffering. One way or another, there's going to be suffering. I think of it as there's two types of suffering. There's the necessary suffering like we're going to get old and our bodies are going to hurt and we're going to have physical ailments and toothaches and shit's just going to happen and we're going to lose the people we love, all of us, and the 80 to a hundred billion homo sapiens that live before us gone through the same thing. \n\n(00:34:29):\nSo there is necessary suffering in life or the mandatory suffering, and then there's the unnecessary suffering, which is the suffering that is almost entirely, and I think the argument could be made that it's entirely made up in our minds. This is the superpowers of the human mind gone awry again in the modern context. So there's going to be a lot of suffering one way or another. I think if there's a goal or objective, it's to minimize the unnecessary suffering, but the seeking of the truth part is very difficult. It takes years.\n\n(00:35:10):\nThere's a reason that, again, in some of these spiritual traditions, let's take Buddhism for example, there's a reason that there's so much structure and discipline and there's a daily method that they adhere to because it turns out it takes daily practice. In the same way that if you want to get extremely fit and climb Mount Everest, that's not something you do by just getting off the couch, right? It takes a dedication to it. I think that the seeking of truth takes that dedication, and that's, again, why I believe that the first step is almost always suffering because to undergo that process of personal transformation, which can be very difficult, and it can feel like you're in a life raft and you've just pushed away from the shore completely untethered, uncertain of where you're floating. In order to work up the courage to get to that point, things typically have to get pretty bad.\n\n(00:36:09):\nYou say, \"I can't fucking do this anymore. I'm not going to live like this. Something's got to change.\" So much of that seeking of the truth is actually at first driven by intense fear, fear of going back to how bad things were and feeling that bad again. Eventually, the process changes tone when you move past the fear stage and you understand yourself enough and then you start to look forward optimistically towards the future, where instead of just being driven by fear, you're also pulled forward by a vision for the future that inspires you. So that eventually comes, but to begin with, yes, this process of discovering the truth is very, very, very, very difficult. It requires a personal commitment. It's not something anyone else can do for you.\n\nLenny (00:37:02):\nWith that context in mind that it's very difficult, I imagine many people listening are like, \"Yes, I have a lot of suffering that I'm going through. Life is hard, work is hard, work is too crazy,\" especially product managers and founders that listen to this podcast.\n\nAndy Johns (00:37:19):\nI know. To all the VPs of Product out there, I'm so sorry. I've been in your shoes.\n\nLenny (00:37:24):\nSo with that, say someone wanted to go down this path and understand the truth of what is the source of this suffering that you even described as unnecessary and made up, what would the first couple steps be of knowing that it's going to take years potentially of how to actually try to understand this?\n\nAndy Johns (00:37:40):\nCommonly in the West, the first step that makes a lot of sense is you turn to somebody who's trained in helping you figure out what those truths are, which is a therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist or a counselor. Sometimes people turn to religious or spiritual leaders because they can be quite gifted in this as well. That's the most common step. \n\n(00:38:02):\nThat's the first step that I turn to when I was just completely stricken by panic and terrified that I might harm myself. I said, \"I got to figure out what the hell's going on because I can't live feeling like this,\" and all I knew to do was reach out to a therapist, and that is a wonderful first start because if anything, they're not going to have all the answers, but they can act like a router, where as they're helping you understand yourself and they're really understanding you, they're thinking about, \"Okay. Who might this person also benefit from speaking with? Let's route them to this person that specializes in body-based work, somatic work. Let's send this person to somebody that specializes in nervous system management through breath work or other things.\" So seeking a therapist is a pretty good first step.\n\nLenny (00:39:00):\nAny advice on how to figure out who the right therapist or wrong therapist is for you? I know you've actually shared somewhere on LinkedIn once that there's also a lot of disagreement within the mental health community of what is the right approach and what's the right solution.\n\nAndy Johns (00:39:13):\nIt's like speed dating at first because I would argue that the most important factor is that you feel safe. Animals can teach us so much about what it means to heal ourselves. Imagine going to the pound and you go in there and there's a bunch of dogs that have been picked up off the street or that have been abandoned, and the vast majority of them, they're a nervous wreck, right? Their tail is down in between their legs. They're hunched over and they might be shaking. Their nervous system is completely overwhelmed. That is not the time to teach a dog tricks. When the dog still can't come out the corner of the kennel is not the time to teach it how to sit. Once that dog can make it into the arms of an owner that it feels safe with and loved by, that's when you see the dog transform and change, and that's when you can teach it a lot because it's open and receptive to it.\n\n(00:40:21):\nSo that's number one in my advice is speed date if you've got the opportunity to and try out a few therapists and just go based on intuition, what just feels right to you, and you're going to want to fall into that feeling of comfort. Now, a quick asterisk on that. Of course if you're in real distress, if you're in a bad place, just see whatever professional you can as soon as possible. That's what I did. I was fortunate to where the first one that I saw was also fantastic. I ended up seeing many other specialists over the years, but that first one, she was wonderful.\n\n(00:41:05):\nSo it's essential that you feel comfortable with them. I would also say, this one's a little controversial, but you're going to want a therapist that is at least as intelligent, if not more intelligent than you because I think part of that openness to learning from them and to feeling somewhat comfortable but also feeling inspired and looking forward to it as if sometimes they say things that make you say, \"Oh, shit. Wow. Wow, I never thought of that. That was smart,\" or, \"That was a wonderful insight.\" I don't think if you respect their intellectual abilities, then it's going to be difficult for them to help you. They may not be able to communicate on the same wavelength. So you really want to look for that intuitive feeling of something that is safe and comfortable. Ideally, if you can find somebody with some intellectual horsepower that matches your own, honestly, I think the rest after that is just implementation details.\n\nLenny (00:42:11):\nIf someone maybe isn't ready for a therapist and that's something about that just holds them back, is there another route that you would recommend people take or is it just go straight to a therapist?\n\nAndy Johns (00:42:23):\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. If you're not in a state of distress, but you feel like there's something to be figured out, there's an ancient technology known as pen and paper. At the end of the day, the seeking of the truth involves the seeking of a deep sense of self-understanding, and if you can get into the daily practice of being able to sit down with pen and paper and write to yourself, to ask yourself questions, to really sit there and evaluate the thoughts that are running through your head, it is possible for somebody to, and I'll use the term, I won't get into it, but to reach some state of bliss or enlightenment or some real spiritual awakening, it is possible for somebody to do that entirely on their own with just pen and paper and a quiet room. \n\n(00:43:20):\nI know people that have arrived at a deep place of self-love and self-understanding through those methods, and I know a lot of others, including myself, where the writing to others was really the writing to myself 15 years ago as a way for me to continue to understand myself more deeply. So I think pen and paper is deeply, deeply overlooked and underrated in this process.\n\nLenny (00:43:48):\nSay you get a pen and paper, is there some guide or framework or something you'd point people to you to think through what to think about and how to approach this?\n\nAndy Johns (00:43:58):\nYeah. There are different ways of doing it. Some advocate for a completely unstructured approach because what you want is you don't want to turn it into assignment. You want to feel your way into it. If something is bubbling up in your mind, just spit it out. Don't analyze why it's coming up, just allow it to flow. That method certainly works. Sit down with no agenda. On some days you'll write one sentence and that's enough, and on other days you'll write 10 pages and that's also enough. There's some magic to allowing the human mind to just work and to not interrupt it through some analytical process. \n\n(00:44:40):\nOn the flip side, if you want a little bit more structure, one thing you can do is I'd like to start with if the goal is to understand oneself, then one of the quickest ways of doing that is to quickly write down a list of simple bullet points of the most recent situations you can think of where you became most acutely reactionary and emotional. You could have been having a political conversation with somebody and they said something that really just you felt like you just wanted to reach out and strangle them. You could have felt deeply insecure in a social setting. \n\n(00:45:24):\nJust run through those scenarios where something disrupted what might've been your current state of presence and calmness. When you identify those situations where there was some strong reaction, that is very revealing because that wasn't a conscious thought process that led to the reaction. That was a knee-jerk reaction. That was a reflex. If there's a reflex, then there's something that's underlying the reflex, and the question to then ask is, \"Why did that happen?\" \n\n(00:45:58):\nThen from there, it's an unstructured process. Keep asking, keep digging, keep asking, \"Okay. If this happened, why did that happen? Well ...\" and then write a little bit, \"Well, is that really the reason why? Was there something else?\" Just keep working at it until you hit the truth, and you'll know what the truth is because it always feels either deeply uncomfortable or it feels like an epiphany.\n\nLenny (00:46:26):\nWow. For you that was recognizing that it was about your mom.\n\nAndy Johns (00:46:32):\nThere were many parts of it. At its core, at first it began with a simple truth, which was I went into the therapist, I was describing what I was feeling, I was describing the uncontrollable thoughts and mental imagery that I was experiencing, and my sleep disruption, and my pounding heart, and everything else, and she said, \"Yup, you're having panic attacks,\" and just knowing like, \"Oh, there's a thing and it's called a panic attack,\" starting at that basic truth was enough in the moment to just take a little bit of the edge off. \n\n(00:47:18):\nSo this journey along the way is there are dozens of truths and then hundreds of truths, and then every now and then it's punctuated by the big, \"Oh, holy shit. I never saw that coming,\" kind of truth. It's just what the experience is. I had many, many truths about myself that I discovered before I hit some of the fundamental ones that were at the core of my subconscious.\n\nLenny (00:47:48):\nFollowing in that thread, what are signs that you're in need of this transformation versus, \"Work is just stressful. Things are hard. I have some challenging meetings,\" which a lot of people go through on and off? I've had a lot of those. What are signs maybe you're boarding out or something that requires, \"Wow, I really need to dig a lot deeper\"?\n\nAndy Johns (00:48:09):\nThere are day-to-day stresses that are normal and we just have to put up with, but then there's the other stuff that's the flashing red alarm. For me, and a lot of the research and literature supports this too, is, again, you can go back to animals. It's like when their fundamental functions, when their core behaviors of diet, exercise, playfulness, socialization, sleep, when those things get disrupted, it's a sign that there is something going on here that you need to take a look at. \n\n(00:48:49):\nSo the same is true with people. If your sleep always sucks, if your relationships are constantly strained or frequently strained, if your physical health is failing, there's so many ways that that can be measured so there's really no excuse for that to say, \"Oh, I just didn't know,\" I'd say it's to look at those things. When those are suffering or when they're really out of whack, it's undeniable that there is something that is detrimental to your wellbeing that's going on right now, and your body is telling you, \"Stop. Something needs to change.\" So that is number one to look at. Look at the fundamentals.\n\n(00:49:43):\nReflecting on my own situation, I almost had a heart attack at 35, and I got the classic talk from a Stanford cardiologist saying, \"You're just going to be another 40-something-year-old CEO with a broken heart.\" The years of really poor sleep, the number of teeth that I had broken that I had to have fixed multiple times because for years my grinding was so bad that I had to, now two times over, had to completely redo all the teeth, all my molars, and then most of the front teeth as well, and I just continued to move forward even though my body was, again, throwing out all the signals.\n\n(00:50:31):\nFor anyone who's listening to this, especially for the folks who haven't, go get the book, The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk. He's a expert clinician who's worked with trauma patients for decades, and the entire book is basically one big message saying, \"Hey, when mental health presents itself, look to the body because it's the body that is keeping the score.\" It's the body that's the scoreboard, and it's the body that is actually holding on to all of this shit you've been carrying for years, and eventually, the body breaks in the form of chronic disease and illness and so on and so forth.\n\nLenny (00:51:12):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro is all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to go check it out for yourself. Go to miro.com/lenny. With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board with two of my own favorite templates, my one pager template and my managing up template that you can plug and play and start using immediately with your team. I've also embedded a handful of my favorite templates that other people have published in the Miroverse. When you get to the board, you can also leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question that I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works.\n\n(00:51:56):\nMiro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wireframes, and generally just collaborating with your colleagues. I actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and super easy. Go check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O dot com slash Lenny. \n\n(00:52:22):\nWe've talked about the suffering step, then the understanding the truth of what is going on. Say someone sits down in a room, writes out what's going on, has this epiphany of, \"Oh, wow, it's really this moment in my childhood that really led me to need to achieve and do all these things.\" The next step is self-compassion and recognizing that it's not your fault. That sounds very easy on the surface like, \"Okay. I understand this is not my fault.\" I know it's not that easy. How do you go about actually deeply doing that steps?\n\nAndy Johns (00:52:56):\nIt's likely this deeply internalized self-belief. You can think of that as one of the deepest grooves in the neural pathways in your mind. Now, that was the case for me, so deep that you don't even realize that it's there, it's omnipresent. It's going to take time to rewire that because what you're effectively trying to do is take an internal narrative and edit and rewrite that thing, and this internal narrative is probably at a foothold in you for years or decades. So it's reasonable to believe or to understand that, \"Okay. If I have not had a high opinion of myself for 30 years, that's not going to change overnight.\" \n\n(00:53:50):\nFor some people, it miraculously does. That's not the norm. For most others, including myself, it starts with that truth stage because with truth is the awareness, \"Okay. I understand that I have a low sense of self-worth, and I understand that it plays out in all these ways, and I have the awareness of it that now when I'm doing something that is a conditioned behavior or a conditioned response born out of that deep self-belief or that negative core belief, then when I spot it, there's an opportunity for me to intervene,\" and it starts in the simple ways. \n\n(00:54:31):\nFor example, I had a boss once where he would come over and he would give me praise all the time. He was wonderful human being, and I think I was doing a good job. One day, he swung by, he said, \"Hey, amazing job,\" and my response was, \"Oh, yeah, I did my best,\" and then he looked at me and he said, \"Hey, say thank you or you're welcome. That's it. When somebody gives you a compliment, just say thanks, accept it.\" So it's become a pattern of mine now that if somebody gives me a compliment, I look them in the eyes and I say, \"Thank you,\" and I really try and embrace that little moment because it's in all of those ways where you identify these little patterns, you intercept them, and you choose to make a change to how you're conditioned to behave in that moment. If you do that consistently enough and you keep practicing it, and you keep it up every day, then you're developing a new internal narrative through all those little actions, and it accumulates in ways that are pretty powerful. \n\n(00:55:43):\nEvery now and then, there's things that you can do that are more of a brute force method of driving that home. Some may find it through a Vipassana retreat, a seven to 10-day silent retreat, which is agonizing if folks haven't tried to be that quiet that long. Things bubble up, you confront the stuff in your mind that in our day-to-day, it's easy to just keep it under the hood. Some find that through psychedelics. Some find that through somewhat extreme physical feats. \n\n(00:56:22):\nThere was a period in time where I didn't realize this at the time, but not only was I building my career, but I was running ultra marathons. Looking back at that I was like, \"Yeah, there I was, another desperate attempt to feel worthy,\" but I also recognize now that that was medicine for me, that me going out onto a remote mountain range for five hours every Saturday and just running well beyond the point of discomfort was consistently cathartic for me. I would cry at the end of almost every single one of those runs. So it's just a recap. It's in those little moments and sometimes in those big moments too, but it begins with the awareness based on truth and then the daily practice.\n\nLenny (00:57:17):\nHow long does this process often take for people that you've worked with?\n\nAndy Johns (00:57:21):\nThere are some famous figures that you can turn to. For example, Eckhart Tolle. He wrote The Power of Now, which he's probably most famous for. He's a great Western spiritual teacher of Eastern traditions. He went through immense suffering himself. Actually, the suffering was so great that for him it led to a somewhat sudden and spontaneous collapse of his sense of identity. Doctors would probably say psychosis, and what he actually had was a spiritual liberation, liberation from his mind, but he describes it himself. In reading his book and listening to some of his lectures and talking about his own journey, he wrote this at, I think, in the first chapter or the preface of The Power of Now when he described the suffering that he was experiencing and the sudden collapse of this sense of identity, and then waking up the next day and feeling this deep sense of peace and freedom for the first time in his life.\n\n(00:58:28):\nThen his journey continued to unfold. He eventually started to research to try and understand, \"What had just happened to me? What experience did I have?\" and dot, dot, dot. Seven years later, he woke up one day and realized he was now a spiritual teacher, seven years. It's not that the journey had ended, but to use a metaphor of two mountains and a valley, that first mountain in his life when he got off of that mountain and he entered this valley, between the first mountain of life and the second mountain of life, the valley that he was in that sat between the old sense of self and then this new sense of self as a spiritual teacher, that valley was seven years for him. \n\n(00:59:22):\nThere are many other examples I can pull up like that, including Siddhartha Gautama, Lord Buddha himself. That wasn't a couple weeks or a couple of months, his journey towards liberation from his own mind. If I can recall, that was also a seven or eight-year journey. So these big shifts on a cosmic universal scale, it's instantaneous, right? On the scale of-\n\nLenny (00:59:50):\n[inaudible 00:59:50] context.\n\nAndy Johns (00:59:50):\nYeah. On the scale of 13 billion years, it's instant, but from our perspective, it's not. It feels a lot longer than that.\n\nLenny (01:00:00):\nI want to close the loop on these four steps that you shared, and the one we haven't talked about yet is the last one, which is building compassion towards others. How do you go about that just broadly? I know we're not going to solve that problem for people in the podcast.\n\nAndy Johns (01:00:14):\nFor me, my experience was that it happened automatically. When you do the first three, it is the result. It's the thing that comes out of step number three itself because, again, when you dig deep enough and you keep searching for the truth, you're like Captain Ahab going down with the white whale in Moby Dick. That is what that book is about. It's not about a fisherman going after a whale. This is the author himself through a story talking about his own journey of emotional and spiritual liberation. \n\n(01:00:57):\nThere are many people that would, experts and historians that might disagree with that, and I would disagree with them that it's a story of seeking the truth at all costs to liberate oneself, including being willing to die for that whale, metaphorically, because at the end of the book, they don't really reveal. Did Ahab actually go down with the whale and never come back? Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. \n\n(01:01:27):\nSo when you have suffered enough and the search for the truth becomes the only thing that matters and that truth leads you to understanding that, \"It's okay. I can accept myself for who I am and it's not all my fault,\" when that has been done in earnest and when you feel those moments of love for yourself, it suddenly changes how you see everybody else. For me, step four was the easiest because it just happened. It happened after eight years, nine years of my own on and off mental health journey, but it finally happened.\n\nLenny (01:02:19):\nPeople who are listening to this say they're a VP of Product and they're like, \"I don't want to become a spiritual teacher. I want to stay on this path. I want to have a successful career. I want to continue to make a bunch of money.\" How often do you find there's a path to stay on that path with a rejiggering of how you see the world or does it, if you're suffering enough, does it almost always lead to something completely different in your experience?\n\nAndy Johns (01:02:46):\nAgain, it's a spectrum. What I've experienced is that the vast majority of people who feel some tug to undergo a process of change, I'd say 90%, 95% of the time pretty confidently I can say that those changes are more of the micro transitions. It's, \"Okay. Let me change my job. Let me downsize my house. Let me break up with my partner.\" Still hard things, and for them, that may be all that is needed and necessary. There's no moral judgment on my side about everyone's got to dive into the deep end. That's certainly not the case, and I'm not advocating for it. I honestly don't even know if it's a choice. There's a part of me that, based on some of the experiences I've had, believes that it was somewhat preordained and that this was going to happen for me, but it's in the minority of cases where the radical transformation of one's sense of identity takes place. It's not common. My general sense is it's definitely less than 1% of the population, and I suspect that's just the way things are.\n\nLenny (01:04:11):\nOne of those ends up being Buddha, and one of those ends up being Andy Johns.\n\nAndy Johns (01:04:16):\nYeah, or another popular figure in Western spirituality is Pema Chödrön, who she's got a lot of great books. One of them is titled When Things Fall Apart, some of the first books I read when things fell apart for me. Her story, actually, she used to live in Berkeley, I think, but an American woman. She was married. First marriage didn't work out. She got married again. Second one didn't work out. It ended in somewhat sudden and expected and catastrophic fashion. Here she is with a few children and a broken heart again and deep emotional suffering, and that suffering was so great that it led her to ultimately say, \"I must pursue these teachings and this spiritual tradition that I'm starting to wake up to in the Eastern traditions,\" with Buddhism in particular because she had suffered so much that she needed to find liberation from that.\n\n(01:05:25):\nIn her case, that even meant separating, not all the time, but a significant portion of her time away from her own children who, if I recall correctly, were early teens timeframe. Now, I think that Pema Chödrön is the only female Buddhist nun in all of North America and is a very well-known spiritual teacher. I also think her journey was somewhere around seven or eight years. Again, that's just the valley between two mountains. Truthfully, the journey continues for the rest of your life, but just another example I wanted to share.\n\nLenny (01:06:06):\nThere's some obvious reasons why going down this path is difficult, why making change is hard. What else would you say holds people back from making a big change in their life, and maybe on the flip side is just how do you allow change to happen?\n\nAndy Johns (01:06:20):\nA significant thing that holds people back from change is the inertia of civilization because we all experience a fundamental conflict in our life because when we're born, we have many needs, but there are two substantial needs that are immutable in everyone, especially children. The first need is the need for love, acceptance, and connection for mammals. We have one of the longest gestation periods of the entire animal kingdom, and even when we're born, we're helpless, we can't survive. We need nurturing for many, many more years afterwards in order to survive. \n\n(01:07:13):\nThat goes hand-in-hand with our need for connection. So we're biologically hardwired to need to be accepted and connected because it is perhaps the most essential thing to survival, more essential than water. So we're born with that need. Yet at the same time, we're also born as unique individuals. \n\n(01:07:37):\nI read a study where the scientists estimated the probability that two sperm or two egg would be genetically identical. For context, I think the average man generates in their prime somewhere around between 10 to 100 million sperm a day. So we generate a lot of sperm in our lifetime. The math that they came up with was that the probability of two sperm being identical is roughly 10 to the 15th power, which is a million times greater than the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. There's somewhere between 100 to 400 billion stars in the galaxy. So it's a million times greater than that. So all that is to say is when you were born, you were unique. There's never been a you before ever, and it's going to be a really, really long time or another dimension before another one of you shows up again. \n\n(01:08:32):\nThen further through the socialization of life, we all have unique experiences, and those experiences are passed through this unique prism of our own mind and genetics to where we're further accentuated as individuals. So we're born with this fundamental need to be connected and to be loved, but we're also born with this need to be ourselves and to express ourselves. What ends up happening though is the world that you're born into eventually conditions you away from the unique individual that you were, and that is the function of society. \n\n(01:09:09):\nSociety operates because enough people choose to agree on the same beliefs and ideas around the style of education, of raising children, of city planning, of millions of things. So the substrate of society or the adhesive of it is shared belief. So that's why I say the inertia of civilization or I should have said the inertia of society is because you're born into a world that begins to condition you at a very early age to act a certain way and not act a certain way, believe some things and don't believe others. \n\n(01:09:48):\nWhy am I a San Francisco Giants fan? Well, because I grew up in a Giants family. It's not like I was two years old and I picked the Giants. It doesn't work that way. What ends up happening then is, and this begins, again, really young. You're two, three, four, five years old and the world around you, namely the adults in the world, start telling you who to be, and it begins to challenge or run into conflict with that individuality, but because our fear of not being accepted and loved is so great that what do we end up doing? We choose to push down our individuality in exchange for being accepted by the pack, beginning with our parents, and then our friends, and then our teachers, and then our bosses, and all of the other dimensions of society. \n\n(01:10:42):\nSo we lose who we were before the world told us who to be. It's actually a Carl Jung quote, \"The world will ask you who you are, and if you don't know, it'll tell you.\" So I would say that that is the number one reason why transformation doesn't take place. It's because a long time ago, we made that exchange to forego our individuality in order to be accepted by others because of that deep primal need for love and acceptance. In order to undertake that process of personal transformation, one of the truths you have to realize is that truth, that truth that you are in large part the way you are but because of what the world told you to be, and it's making the choice consciously to then say, \"Fuck that, and I'm going to go against the grain and I'm going to now tell the world that I don't want its influence on me anymore, and I will, like Moby Dick or like Ahab going down with the white whale, I am willing to die to return to my individuality and to break free and to be who I want to be in the face of the currents around us regarding the messages around how we should think, live, act, and feel.\" \n\n(01:12:11):\nSo that is the thing that prevents transformation. The simple thing is you could say fear, but what is the fear? That is the fear. It's to say, \"I'm going to walk my own path now and I'm going to be who I want to be, and I'm going to discover who I was before the world told me who to be, and by doing so, I run the risk that I'm not going to be accepted anymore.\" That's terrifying.\n\nLenny (01:12:44):\nBecause it's so terrifying, I imagine that's why the suffering is so important to really feel that because, otherwise, why would you go down that path? It feels very hard.\n\nAndy Johns (01:12:57):\nYeah, and that gets to my point earlier around I'm not entirely convinced that this is an act of free will on my part. There have been moments of me intervening and acting with free will, but I believe that there are also undercurrents that would fall into the realm of superstition for a lot of folks that this is the path that was laid out in front of me even before I was born.\n\nLenny (01:13:29):\nAlong those same lines, you wrote in one of your writings that at the end of the day, you're on your own to find what ends up alleviating your psychological suffering. Can you speak to that?\n\nAndy Johns (01:13:41):\nYeah. That really ties in with this point of the uniqueness of people. You have to find what works for you. For some people, it's going to be the ice bath thing. For others it's not. Last year, a quick anecdote, I spent a month working at an animal sanctuary in northern Thailand for abused animals and neglected animals. This place is amazing. They take in anything and they say, \"We'll find a way,\" and that's what they do. So they have hundreds and hundreds of animals, including a large herd of elephants, which is pretty amazing. \n\n(01:14:24):\nThere was a worker there who I met, and just by the expression on his face, I could tell that this was a liberated man. This was somebody who had figured out something that was contributing to his deep sense of peace. So I went to talk with him. I said, \"Hey, something tells me that you figured out the secret to life and I'd like to chat.\" So we talked, and it turned out that half the time he was a farmer, he had a small little farm, an acre up on a hill in the mountains, and he'd work at his farm half the time and the other half he would then go and work at the animal sanctuary, and he was a practicing Buddhist. \n\n(01:15:15):\nOne of the things he said to me really stood out. He used a simple analogy. He said, \"Everyone's trying to make it to Bangkok. The problem is they're getting to Bangkok by following somebody else's road. The whole point is to find your own path to Bangkok.\" He was making that same point or a similar point of you've got to find your own way. That is the message. For me, I take that as maybe the most fundamental message in looking back at the story of the original Buddha himself was, sure, the teachings, the traditions, everything that's formed around his teachings has power and merit to it, but I look at what he did. He was born as a prince into a royal family. Something wasn't right, and he was seeking the truth behind this anguish and this unfulfillment, and there was something inside of him that said, \"I must seek the answer because growing up in this sheltered life as a prince, this can't be the answer.\" \n\n(01:16:31):\nSo he left it all behind, including his wife and child, and then he lived as an aesthetic for years, nearly dying close to starvation. He did that for years. Then eventually he realized, \"Well, that's not the answer either.\" Then he famously made his way to the Bodhi tree and sat under it and meditated for 40, 41 days. I can't recall what it was, a long time. Then he had his enlightenment, and out of that came one of the teachings, which is known as the middle way. It's not about being a prince, it's not about being poor. There's something in between. He found that was his path to Bangkok. You could walk that path and maybe it'll teach you something or it'll lead you nowhere because it's not your own path. I think that's the point.\n\nLenny (01:17:32):\nAndy, what a beautiful way to wrap up our conversation. Before we do, is there anything else you want to share that you want to leave listeners with? Then also, I'm just curious how you're doing these days.\n\nAndy Johns (01:17:44):\nSure, sure. Well, let me answer the first one, a message to leave to folks. I would imagine that there's a lot of high performers, successful folks out there. Some of you, you may feel like you're on the verge of answering a call towards a new chapter in life or towards finding a way out of whatever situation you're in that you don't want to be in anymore. The thing I guess I would say to you is that having undergone some change myself, all I can promise you is that it's going to be in some ways the best thing that's ever happened to you, but also the worst thing that's ever happened to you, but those are the experiences that define a life. \n\n(01:18:36):\nIf you feel that call inside of you to seek a new way of living, just know that you're not the only one out there doing it. There are others out there such as myself and that I can always be reached. So I wish you a happy journey and just know that things are going to be okay. Now, the second question, what am I up to nowadays? Is that-\n\nLenny (01:19:03):\nHow are you doing? How are you doing on this journey?\n\nAndy Johns (01:19:06):\nI'm good. I still have my ups and downs. I've arrived at an interesting part in my journey where it's something that I'm practicing now and I still don't quite have the hang of it. I'll use one more metaphor. I think the way that I approached the first part of my life was as if life was a big mountain to be climbed, where you're trying to head up Everest under this assumption that once you get to the top, you're going to have this bliss that will persist or that will make you feel that you had a life well-lived, and that that was the answer, but what I experienced was that once I got to the top of one mountain, then I had to find the top of another and another and another. Although you see and do some amazing things along the way, at some point it's too exhausting. At some point, you may really get yourself into trouble and you might not survive. \n\n(01:20:13):\nThe vast majority of people who die on Mount Everest actually die on the way down, not on the way up. You don't save anything for the return home, I think is the point. Instead of pursuing my life now as a mountain to be climbed in the hopes that reaching the top will make me feel good again, I'm instead trying to float down river. So for example, if you go whitewater rafting, they'll give you a little safety crash course at the beginning. They'll say, \"Here's how you paddle. Put your vest on.\" One of the things they'll ask you is, what do I do if I fall overboard, especially if I fall overboard into the rapids or the cold water? This is maybe the most important thing they teach because commonly what happens if you're in sizable enough rapids and you fall overboard, the tendency is to freak out and to fight the current. When people freak out in the water, especially when the water's choppy, that's when they get in trouble. \n\n(01:21:20):\nThe thing they teach you to do is instead you go into mummy mode, right? You lay back, you cross your arms across your chest, and you stick your feet out like you're a mummy, and you do the opposite of fighting the current. You allow the current to take you where it's trying to take you. For me, I actually find that I believe that that's a more fitting metaphor for life. It's possible that there's something amazing for us downstream so long as we're willing to surrender and just let go, to turn off the intellectual mind a bit, to quit trying to plan as if you can predict the future, to quit thinking about all the edge cases and trying to optimize our life, which I think is a bunch of bullshit. It's possible that if you just relax and you instead pay attention to the signals around you, you feel where the current is trying to take you, maybe towards a potential life partner, maybe away from an oppressive work environment, maybe towards a place to live that is more calm and peaceful, whatever it may be. \n\n(01:22:33):\nIf you really tune in with yourself and pay attention to that current and you relax into it, you'll arrive at a destination that you were meant for. In a sense, that's what I did that has brought me to this conversation today. Instead of talking about investing in companies and what have you, I'm instead trying to connect with people on an entirely different level and help them make their own way downstream, so to speak. \n\n(01:23:11):\nSo for me nowadays, that's how I'm living at the moment. I'm actually in Vietnam. Just got here about 10 days ago because it seemed like the current of life was taking me here right now. It's likely that it's just the next lily pad towards wherever else I'm heading to, but I guess I'm in the mindset now where I'm willing to just surrender and see how it unfolds.\n\nLenny (01:23:35):\nThe metaphor for that is they lost your luggage on the way to Vietnam, and we had to push back this recording a week.\n\nAndy Johns (01:23:41):\nYeah, that's right, that's right. My luggage was half a world away from me, and so when that happened, what could I do? I just said, \"Okay. Well, I have shorts and a shirt on me that I can wear for the next three or four days,\" and that's what I did.\n\nLenny (01:24:00):\nAmazing. Andy, I think this might end up being one of the most meaningful episodes of the podcast. I think it's going to end up being a Trojan horse for people are coming here for advice on optimizing their product and growth, and they'll opt up rethinking their whole life, hopefully in a good way, maybe cause some suffering, maybe help people through suffering. Thank you, Andy, so much for being here. Two final questions. You said people could reach out if they're going down this path and maybe need some help or advice. So what's the best way for people to reach out, and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAndy Johns (01:24:31):\nSure, a couple ways. You can find me on Twitter, my username is Clues Dot Life, so C-L-U-E-S-D-O-T-L-I-F-E. You can also find me on LinkedIn, search for Andrew Johns, you'll find me on there. You can check out my website Clues.Life. It's a basic MVP, but it's an art project that's in process. So those are a couple of ways that you can reach out. In terms of ways you can help, you can't always tell who you're helping. When I sit behind my laptop and I write and I send my messages out into the world, other than getting some thumbs up here and there, you don't always know what impact you're having. \n\n(01:25:22):\nSometimes it's good to hear because, again, for me, this is part of me rewriting that internal narrative where I'm trying to do more work for the benefit of others as opposed to what it does for my bank account. So if part of this message has been beneficial to you, it would certainly put wind in my sails to hear that. So that would be one way to help.\n\nLenny (01:25:50):\nWhat a great answer. So let's blow up the YouTube comments and send you some DMs and LinkedIn messages if people find this valuable. Andy, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nAndy Johns (01:26:02):\nLenny, I appreciate it, man. Thank you.\n\nLenny (01:26:04):\nBye, everyone. \n\n(01:26:07):\nThank you so much for listening.

So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatments. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. Every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, and I call this shift the shift from the old game to a new game. The archetypal example of this, I think in the business world, is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, \"Hey, software is over and there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, new rules. That's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there.\" This structure really is about defining a movement, and that's very different from, \"Hey, I'm going to solve your problem.\"\n\nLenny (00:00:54):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Andy Raskin. Andy helps CEOs and company leaders align their teams around something he calls a strategic narrative, which as you'll learn all about in this episode, is essentially a simple story that helps people understand why they need your product. And with that helps you align your sales, marketing, and product teams along with your fundraising and even your hiring efforts.\n\nLenny (00:01:25):\nAndy has worked closely with some of the most successful founders and companies out there, including companies like Gong, Dropbox, Uber, Salesforce, Square, IBM, and many others. In our conversation, Andy explains why most people are pitching their product completely wrong, why focusing on the problem you're solving for people is no longer an effective pitch and how the strategic narrative helps you frame your solution in a much more effective way. Andy also shares a ton of examples of the framework in action, why focusing on categories and category creation is so limiting, signs your narrative needs to work and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Andy Raskin after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nLenny (00:02:07):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing a roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.\n\nLenny (00:02:45):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups.

So great to talk with you.\n\nLenny (00:04:21):\nYou are quite known as someone that helps CEOs optimize their pitch, their story, their strategy, which we're going to get deep into. But before we do that, can you just give us a little glimpse into how you found your way into this line of work?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:04:35):\nI started as a coder. I was a computer science major, undergrad, a friend and I had an idea for an app. So this was like during the dot com years. So Windows app, and we coded a little prototype and we started, we put it out there, we started getting some users and we thought, \"Oh, okay, maybe we can get some investments.\" So of the two of us, I spoke English fluently. So we decided, okay, I'll write the investor pitch. So I wrote the pitch, we sent it out and the reaction was really bad. One VC wrote back and said, \"Listen, I rate every plan I get on a scale of 1 to 10, and yours is a 1,\" and the next to the one he wrote in parentheses, \"Worst,\" in case we thought maybe that was the top of his rating scale.\n\nLenny (00:05:20):\nBrutal.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:05:22):\nYeah, brutal. But then lower down, so this was back when they would like you'd print, send the hard copy of the plan and they might mail it back with comments written in. And he had written in, \"Not a compelling story.\" A few weeks later, I'm walking by this Barnes & Noble and there's a sign in the window that says, \"For anyone who wants to tell a compelling story,\" okay, that's me. And there's an arrow that points to these books and they turned out to be screenwriting books. I didn't know anything about this, so I started reading these books and it strikes me a movie is a pitch. What is Star Wars a pitch for? It's a pitch for be good, care about people, trust The Force in their terms. But I don't have couple hours. I'm pitching a business. It's very different. I'm not writing a three X screenplay.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:06:11):\nSo what applies, what doesn't apply? I mean these are questions I think I'm still asking, but I did my best to take some of the learnings of how the movie was structured. It was very different from how my pitch was structured and kind of restructure it. And we did that and we sent the pitch out and we start getting more interest. It was really clear. And then we had a term sheet I think a few months later and I'm like, \"What is this story thing?\" That we didn't change the product, it was basically the same business just sort of how we talked about it. That was really interesting to me.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:06:49):\nI mean, over the next 10, 15 years, I thought about, \"Hey, maybe I could do consulting with this.\" CEOs who heard about this were asking me about it. But I still was like, \"No. No CEO's going to budget a line item for the story. That's not a thing.\" So I just didn't do it for a really long time until eventually I was proven wrong about that.\n\nLenny (00:07:13):\nAnd how many years ago was this at this point?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:07:15):\nSo this was dot com. This was like '98 when I was pitching that company.\n\nLenny (00:07:20):\nAmazing. I think there's a couple interesting tidbits about this. One is that interesting opportunities arise when you're doing something you're excited about. So you had the startup, it didn't work out, but you had a problem that you solved for yourself and that led to another, a bigger opportunity for your career.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:07:34):\nYeah, totally.\n\nLenny (00:07:35):\nSo that's interesting. And then also just some of the best opportunities arise from solving your own problem, not planning to start something with it, but just like, \"I have a problem.\" Turns out [inaudible 00:07:44]-\n\nAndy Raskin (00:07:44):\nYeah, I think that's same with you. Right, Lenny? You started writing about stuff and boom, that became the thing.\n\nLenny (00:07:49):\nAbsolutely. It was not quite boom, but eventually it became boom.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:07:53):\nFeels like boom from outside.\n\nLenny (00:07:55):\nYeah, that's how it goes. It always overnight for everyone else that isn't here.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:08:01):\nRight, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:08:03):\nYeah. Okay, so let's get into it. So you help CEOs at this point come up with what you call a strategic narrative and you help them not only come up with this strategic narrative, but you help their teams align around this strategic narrative. So let's just start with what is a strategic narrative?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:08:19):\nYeah, you'd think, I've been doing this for 10 years, I'd have a very snappy definition of it there, and I don't know if I'm really happy with ... like I've ever found one that totally gets at it yet. The one thing I say is it's this one story that the CEO uses to drive success in marketing, sales, but also product. That it becomes like a north star, strategic north star for product roadmap, for fundraising, for recruiting, really everything.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:08:54):\nWhat I think is really interesting as a kind of qualifier is that this story has a certain structure. Like I said, when I found those screenwriting books, I sort of shifted the structure. And the traditional structure, the way I learned how to pitch in business school, I think the way most people did is what I call the arrogant doctor. So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatment.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:09:24):\nNot to say it's not better, but just this is the structure of it, and it kind of sets you up for bragging. Let me tell you why it's so great. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. In the movies, every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, in the character's world. And I call this shift the shift from the old game to the new game. And the archetypal example of this, I think in the business world is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, \"Hey, software is over,\" meaning software in the sense that we're going to own it and maintain it, \"And there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, like the new rules, everything has changed and that's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there.\" This structure really is about defining a movement and that's very different from, \"Hey, I'm going to solve your problem.\"\n\nLenny (00:10:34):\nI think the Salesforce example is an awesome example of your approach. If they were thinking about it in the old way, what would Salesforce have done? How would they have pitched it if not for, \"Everyone's moving to the cloud, your dumb for using desktop software,\"?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:10:48):\nWell, I think they would've just come out and said like, \"Oh hey ...\" I mean CRM by the way, was already a category. I mean, already Siebel was the huge giant of that space. There were already even companies doing it online, doing it through the web. And so they would've come and said, \"Oh, we're easier to install, faster to get up and running than Siebel,\" or, \"We have this much functionality compared to,\" I think it was, was it NetSuite? Or, I don't know. It was some early Salesforce-like thing that was out there. They would've done these sort of comparison things.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:11:25):\nAnd Benioff, I mean he is a pretty proud guy. I think he did still say like, \"Hey, we're the number one CRM,\" but wasn't what they led with. They led with this story about this fundamental paradigm shift and, are you in or are you not in? And what they did was instead of just saying, \"Hey, we're better than,\" they said, \"Hey, all those others, those Siebel's, they're part of that old game. You want to play that software game? Be my guest, go buy Siebel,\" and of course we know how it played out.\n\nLenny (00:12:02):\nSo the crux of the approach is instead of, \"Problem, solution, you should go do this,\" it's, \"The world is changing, here's where it's going and we're going to help you get there.\" I want go in a little more depth of the framework. But before that, what are some other examples to give people a sense of like, oh, I see, I understand what this might be.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:12:19):\nYeah, so another great example and no coincidence, so is Zuora. So Zuora is the company I wrote about in this post called The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen, the CEO of Zuora, Tien Tzuo, was employee number 11 at Salesforce. So he learns this from Benioff. And he's pitching, \"Hey, in the old world, businesses operated on transactions. You sold things to people outright. In this new world,\" he calls it the subscription economy, where people want the benefits of those things without necessarily having to pay for them. And of course gives all these examples of all the winners in this, look at all the winning companies. They're all basically going to this new model.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:13:05):\nAnd so he's pitching someone like Ford and you can imagine they're going to Ford and pitching a subscription for car service, which is quite different from just a lease. And they're starting out with this. This is the big shift. Another one, team I worked with early on, and I think they'd agree their story came out of this work was Gong. So Gong everyone probably knows by now, they take the video recordings of all your sales calls and they stick AI onto it and come out with all these insights. And that story is, hey, goodbye opinions. Used to be a world where sales is run on opinions. Hello reality, that now all the winners are adopting this new mindset where we really have to see what's really going on.\n\nLenny (00:13:56):\nIn the Gong example, let's say, what would they have done if they were going, \"Here's the problem, here's the solution, here's what we're going to do for you,\"?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:14:03):\nYeah, I mean that's kind of what they were doing when they started out. And I'm not saying that didn't work totally. I mean already by the time they started doing this, they were starting to become a big company. I remember Bendov said to me, \"Listen, Andy,\" they were around series B, I think this is around 2018. It's like, \"We're going to be a huge company. The question is how huge. And I think that this narrative along the lines of Zuora or Salesforce, if we get this right, this is going to be a multiplier on our growth.\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:14:38):\nSo I don't remember exactly the pitch beforehand, but it was very much like, \"Hey, we're going to record your calls. We're going to get insights from them. They're better than the insights you could get from Salesforce.\" There wasn't this kind of unifying kind of movement ideology that put it all in context. And what was really interesting was one thing, I don't think they'd be upset if I shared, and maybe it's known. Initially, they were seen as a tool for sales operations, for someone who's going to record the calls and what this narrative did for them. And I think it was already starting to happen, but what it really coalesced was this is a tool for sales leadership.\n\nLenny (00:15:23):\nYou talked about Zuora in the post you wrote, and I imagine many people listening are like, \"Oh, shit. This is the guy that wrote that post that everyone's always sharing with me about how to make a deck.\" And I wanted to ask, how impactful was that one piece of writing for you in your career, just like as a tangent?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:15:39):\nI had written some other posts on Medium in particular. Medium has changed quite a bit, but back then I found that I could write stuff there and get really a lot of people who were interested in what I was interested would sort of come in and create some noise about it. So I was already doing this kind of work for a couple of years, but that post immediately got something like 2 million views around the world and I started getting inquiries from teams all over the world.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:16:12):\nAnd it was I think what really allowed me to say no, okay, I could do this work. That CEO's would budget a line item for this. Because I think if you really understand that post, it's not really about a sales deck, it's really about this story that Tien, the CEO is telling everywhere and that is showing up in the sales deck and structuring it that way.\n\nLenny (00:16:40):\nI think it's just another example that comes up a bunch on this podcast is just the power of writing and the power of content. Yeah, and you're shaking your head.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:16:48):\nTotally. I mean, I had a little mini career as a journalist, as a freelance writer and I really loved that. I actually, I took a class in New York called How to Write a Magazine Article, because I was sort of mid-career, I was curious. And the class wound up being more about how to sell a magazine article. And I found I really loved that, pitching articles, but one thing that was always a downer for me was there's always this editor sort of deciding what's going to be out there.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:17:23):\nAnd when you work with a great editor, it's great, they make yourself better and they're priceless. But still there's this intermediary. What started to happen, I think around when I started writing around 2013, '14, you start to see these platforms, like Medium, even LinkedIn where you can just write and have this audience and I think no way I could do this, the work I do if that development hadn't happened first.\n\nLenny (00:17:53):\nI'm taking us off track, but I want to go a little deeper with this. I find that there's kind of two paths to writing online. One is your path where you write one piece that just blows up like crazy. The other path is more my path where I just write consistently for a long time, and both work and most people try to go your path and they never succeed. It's really hard to make something gets 2 million views, but you can go that path.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:18:14):\nThis is like you said earlier, hey, it seems like boom, but really it didn't. So that was probably the 30th or 40th piece and they were gradually getting more and more traction. There was one I wrote before that about, it's kind of dissecting Elon Musk's pitch for the Powerwall, the battery that they sell. And that one got maybe few hundred thousand views and also was a big jump. And then the next one got some poultry number. So what I find is like, yeah, there's this a while where you're writing and it feels like you're talking to nobody and then gradually it grows and you'll have these peaks, but then over time is where the magic is.\n\nLenny (00:19:03):\nOkay, I'm really glad you pointed that out, that it rarely is just you write one thing and it's boom.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:19:08):\nI'll also say, sorry, because I worked in a magazine, I haven't done a newsletter because that idea of having a deadline all the time and constantly having to, we used to call the magazine Feed the Beast, I feel so free not to have that. So for now at least I haven't done that.\n\nLenny (00:19:27):\nI know that well, so let me take us back on track and let's talk about just the high level framework here. So you talked about, it starts with this idea of tell people worlds changing, join this movement. What's the simple way to think about this, the pieces of this strategic narrative framework?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:19:42):\nA lot of times people will contact me, say, \"Hey, I tried it, didn't work.\" Well, one very common thing, at least earlier was they would basically just take the Zuora deck, they'd get ahold of it and just put their logo on it. And so that's not going to work. One thing is we're not just saying, \"Hey, the world is changing.\" And then sometimes I'll see, \"The world is changing,\" and there'll be, \"Used to be,\" and there's a long list of things and then, \"Now it is,\" a long list of bullet points.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:20:11):\nWhat's really, I think key is naming it, naming that old game. The examples you saw, software, cloud, transactions, subscription opinions, reality. This very, very concise naming is really key. And it's hard because in making it compact you're losing completeness. So you can imagine you're in a meeting, someone says like, \"Hey, how about we do transactions to subscriptions?\" And someone says, \"Well I don't know, there's a lot of things I don't really subscribe to. Subscription economy, really?\" So we're always kind of overstating it in a way, but it's not a problem. I don't think people say like, \"Oh that's wrong, subscription economy, because I still go to the grocery store and buy things.\" So anyway, that's the first piece.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:20:59):\nThe second piece is what I call naming the stakes. And there's a few ways to do this, but one that's really great if we can do it is to name the winners to show that winners are already playing this new game. So for instance with Zuora they're saying, \"Hey, look, look at all the new winners,\" this is like 2015 so, \"Airbnb, Box,\" all these companies, they're already doing this subscription thing.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:21:28):\nAnd by the way, overall they show this scary stat about the longevity of Fortune 500 companies. It's getting smaller, and so it's a little disingenuous, but basically they make this case that, \"Hey, companies are dying, the ones that are winning are doing this.\" And so to the extent we want to make this life and death just like a movie. This is again, I'll make the parallel to Star Wars. So Luke, he spends the first 15 minutes of the movie belly aching. He wants to be a pilot, he wants to go out and have adventures in space. So Obiwan comes, he says, \"Hey, we got this mission, this princess we got to go,\" and all this stuff, \"Let's go. I'll teach you to be a pilot. We'll go have adventures in space.\" What does Luke say? He says, \"Ooh, you know what, I can't really get involved. They got to go home. It's late.\" Who does this sound like? The reluctant buyer.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:22:27):\nSo yeah, \"I want to be innovative and all this. Ooh, you know what? I don't have budget this quarter.\" So how does George Lucas change Luke's mind? He basically kills the aunt and uncle, sorry, spoilers, it's been 40 years though. If you haven't seen it, you're probably not going to see it. Kills the aunt and uncle. Now it's pretty clear they're coming for Luke. Now the stakes are life and death. Probably he's going to be dead. But there is this other path that Obiwan holds out for him.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:22:55):\nAnd whenever I work with teams and I talk about this, so they're like, \"Okay, I guess we got to then for kill the prospect's aunt and uncle,\" and basically yes, I mean figuratively. We got to show them that the future is not going to just be sort of okay. People talk about making it emotional and I've always wondered, what does that mean? Literally, what is the definition? This is for me the definition, is that the prospect doesn't see the future as sort of okay. They see it as split between a very negative outcome and a potentially very positive outcome.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:23:29):\nThe third piece is what I call naming the object of the new game. I used to call it the promised land message, but I've changed it to this because I've found that it's sort of a little more fruitful. This subscription economy, transactions, it can get a little highfalutin and sort of big, but on the website when we just have to boil it down to a couple of words that's going to be clear right away, what can we say? And I find that what's the object of the new game really boils it down as kind of the rallying cry of the movement. So the example with Zuora, the object for a while was turn customers into subscribers. Very simple. It just sort of flows from it. Airbnb for a while had this one, live anywhere. If you think about-\n\nLenny (00:24:21):\nBelong anywhere.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:24:23):\nWell actually it was-\n\nLenny (00:24:24):\nOh, live like a human.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:24:25):\nSo you're right, it was, \"Belong anywhere,\" and then it switched to, \"Live there.\" I may have the chronology wrong, but it was the two of those things. You know better than I do. But either one, I mean think they're saying very similar things. Hey, there's this new world where you don't have to live in hotels, you can stay in people's houses. What's the object of that game is to belong anywhere, but live there. And I love it when it works that way where it's almost like an asymptotically unachievable thing. You are never literally going to live there. And if you think about it, this buyer mission statement, this rallying cry, I think of it really as the mission of the company. I mean, what is the mission of Airbnb other than to help people live there if they're going to be customer focused and all that?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:25:17):\nThe fourth piece is, okay, well this object of the game, winning this game, it better be hard because if it's not, why would we even exist? Just with the movie, if Luke can just go destroy the Death Star then no movie. So there's got to be sort of obstacles in the way, things that are preventing them from. So saying, \"Okay, you want to turn customers into subscribers.\" So whereas Zuora, where they go next is to say, \"Okay, well how are you going to measure lifetime value?\" Because now you have this always on thing. \"How are you going to measure preferences and how they're changing over?\" All these new kind of challenges that didn't exist before. And then these are like the monsters in Lord of the Rings or the Empire in Star Wars, these are the obstacles.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:26:11):\nI think about them because they sound like problems. This is what people would normally say, \"Oh, these are the problems we solve.\" But by setting up this story thing first we've repackaged them as obstacles to a new goal state that we've already positioned as life and death. So they take on this much more emotional meaning. We understand why they matter. And then of course the last piece is now talking about, well, how are we going to overcome these obstacles? Narrative people, in the movie business they call these the magic gifts that the main character gets to go help them win. What are the ways? Now we can talk about that and success stories and all the rest of the stuff.\n\nLenny (00:26:58):\nThere's some obvious parallels to the hero's journey here. I imagine that it was a source of inspiration, and the Star Wars I think is the epitome of that journey. Can you talk about just how related those two are, how you think about that?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:27:09):\nYeah, I mean so hero's journey is this book that comes from, I think it's Hero of A Thousand Faces is a book by Joseph Campbell, a sociologist. He looks at myths over different cultures and different times and he finds this kind of common structure that he calls the hero's journey. I mean it's some controversy about that, about his book. Is it a very male oriented sort of take on things and a bunch of things.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:27:38):\nBut even that aside, I found when I would talk about hero's journey and stuff, it's just like, it didn't really tell me what to do. Yeah, okay, yeah I got to do this pitch. So in the hero's journey there's like refusal of the call. That's actually that thing where Luke says he doesn't want to go and where the buyer says, \"Hey, I don't have budget.\" But I don't know, it was just too theoretical for me to really ... when I use it, people seem to sort of glass over. So I just don't really talk about that at all. But yeah, I mean that's behind a lot of this stuff for sure.\n\nLenny (00:28:17):\nYeah, that makes sense because I think if people hear about that all the time when they're like, become a better storyteller, tell your story in this hero's journey, and it's like, \"I don't know what I'm doing.\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:28:25):\nAlso, I would say there's storytelling as a skill kind of thing, which is a great thing. Learn how to tell stories better, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not really interested in that in my work, what I'm interested in is the one story and the structure of that one story. And this one story, it doesn't really have ... like, the world is moved from transactions to subscriptions. There's not a main character in that story who's like having a problem and getting saved. It's almost as if what's happening is we're turning the person we talk to into the main character. By spelling out the shift, we're changing their world and we're saying, \"Hey, you got to change and you want to come with us.\"\n\nLenny (00:29:13):\nIt's almost like you're putting them into the hero's journey, like, \"Here's how you win.\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:29:16):\nExactly. I love that.\n\nLenny (00:29:18):\nLet me just try to summarize what you shared, this five step framework. So you start with here's a new movement that's happening and you want to name it, you want to name the stakes and there's winners and losers and here's already happening and it's really important. Then you want to name the object of the new game, like turning customers into subscribers. Then show the obstacles, here's why it's challenging, and then talk about how you're going to overcome these obstacles.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:29:41):\nAnd by the way, the naming of the object of the new game, I find it often is really nice to do it as a question. So we hey, there's this shift from transactions to subscriptions and look, everyone's doing it. So we asked a simple question, what would it take to turn every customer into a subscriber? And this way we're kind of bringing the person we're pitching to almost like they're coming along with us as a co, I don't know, adventurer in crafting this story.\n\nLenny (00:30:17):\nI love that. This episode is brought to you by Eco. Last month Eco users earned an average of $84 in cash back rewards. How? With Eco the future of personal finance. Eco is the update to a misaligned financial system providing an app that works just like your bank but removes almost all of the middlemen, helping even the best money optimizers optimize in less time automatically.\n\nLenny (00:30:40):\nWhat if you earn rewards for paying your rent or got rewarded for ordering food and shopping online or even earn rewards for saving each month? And then imagine if you got rewarded again just for getting rewarded. With Eco, you can spend at some of your favorite merchants and automatically get 5% cash back plus Eco's APY rewards look more like $80, not 80 cents. And then there are Eco points, the world's first open reward system.

Learn more at Eco.com/Lenny, that's E-C-O.com/Lenny. Maybe just to reinforce this even more, what if we go through the five steps and just with one company as an example and just talk about what each of those were for them?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:31:41):\nOkay, great. So there's a company called 360Learning. So this company, I don't know if folks know, but this company is raised over $200 million. They're in the space of corporate training software. So big companies, they have to train their people on all kinds of stuff. So you want to go through that one?\n\nLenny (00:32:01):\nYeah, that sounds great.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:32:03):\nOkay, great. By the way, Nick Hernandez is the CEO and Nick's been on my podcast, so he's talked about this. So they for a long time were pitching themselves as collaborative learning. So they have features that let people sort of collaborate on courses and all kinds of stuff. And Nick is often pitching CEOs, of course his team is as well. And he told me that it was sort of falling a little bit flat. People, collaborative learning, whatever. How are you different from this learning platform, this learning platform?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:32:42):\nAnd so when we worked together this collaborative learning, it's almost like a category name or a descriptor or something. They were so embedded that I decided, I don't even want to take it out, but can we define it in terms of a story? So the story they came to was, hey, used to be that companies train their people through basically a mindset of top-down learning. There's going to be some learning guru at the company, they're going to get all the courses, they're going to put it all together and sort of send out this training material to everybody.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:33:23):\nWhat's happening now is winning companies are approaching this differently. They're adopting this approach we might call upskill from within, which is if you look at Google, there's this page where I think you can go, it's a public. You can connect with Google's AI experts. They literally turn their internal experts into champions that are educating, not even just the company but even external people. They've created this culture of our own people are going to be the educators. So that's the shift from top down to this upskill from within. And of course I just even started to do the second piece which was like, hey, look at the big companies who are doing this.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:34:10):\nAnd then I think they showed, \"Hey, you're not doing this. Look, training is becoming very expensive. People don't care. So this is the downside. So we're creating these sort of stake ...\" And also I think he has something about how training now, like companies, if you don't adapt, if you can't get these skills to your people, if you're a car company and you can't get these skills around electric cars, you're dead.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:34:35):\nNick was in France and he saw this poster, a recruiting poster from McDonald's and it said, \"Hey, if you work at McDonald's you're going to learn from everybody else on your team.\" And it was like, wow, there it is. So there's another example we used as a kind of winner example. And so then the question became, I can't remember exactly, it was something like, how do you upskill from within? What would it take for you to turn your experts into champions of learning in the company and turn them into stars, and all this?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:35:06):\nAnd then I'm going to forget here what all the obstacles were. But I think it was things like, well, how are you going to make it possible for anybody to create a course? People who might have expertise in electric engines but don't know how to create a course, how are you going to make sure that there's still the learning department, they're going to keep control and can ... all this. You can imagine all the different kind of questions. And then of course now 360Learning starts talking about all that stuff.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:35:36):\nWhat Nick has told me, I'm actually going to be on a webinar with Nick where someone asked me, \"Could you bring in a CEO who could talk about this stuff? Not just you B blabbing on about strategic narrative.\" And so Nick is going to join it. And we had a dress rehearsal the other day and he was telling me it's just like when he starts with this now he doesn't even get the question anymore of well how are you different from this other learning platform? Which used to always be the thing. It's just a much more seamless, okay, yeah, talk to our learning people, get this going. So it's just sounds like it's been really effective for them.\n\nLenny (00:36:13):\nThat's actually was what I was going to ask next is what kind of impact have you seen with someone shifting their pitch story from this doc? What was the arrogant doctor approach to the strategic narrative?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:36:23):\nYeah, I mean it's always this kind of thing I hear. I mean, of course it's very difficult to measure this. I mean, what was the value of the strategic narrative for Gong and its growth? Was it 3X versus 1X, 2X? Or I don't, who knows, right? But the things I hear from CEOs, a few things. One is that when they're pitching, they're not pitching features out of context, they're pitching now a movement which is a lot better place to be, I think. In a way you're not pitching product. Product is like a prop for making the story come true. Very important prop, but there's this higher level overlay that becomes the focus of the conversation, at first, and of course we're going to get into product and that helps sell. Once we have this story then everything in marketing can be all about this story.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:37:21):\nWith Zuora, if you look at their website, well when they first started doing this, maybe 80% of the content is not, \"Hey, let me tell you about how Zuora is so great,\" or, \"Here's our new release,\" or whatever. It's, \"Here's how music companies are embracing subscriptions. Here's how luxury goods companies are embracing subscriptions.\" It's all these kind of almost trend pieces that become unlimited fodder. And again, you're not touting your ... it's less salesy, right?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:37:51):\nAnother thing I just hear always, I just interviewed a CEO this morning for my podcast and this is the first thing he actually said was, \"It becomes the strategic north star for the product.\" So what he was telling me, and this was actually a little unusual, I asked him, \"Why did you come to me at first?\" And of course I'd asked him that before, but he said something this time that was a little different from what I'd heard before. He said, \"We are constantly getting feature requests through sales, through customer success. And we had sort of no way, bar to decide well what do we take on, what don't we take on? And this clearly has become our bar.\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:38:38):\nIf you think about it for 360Learning, does it help us upskill from within? It's in. Does it not? Or it's prioritized. Does it not? Less prioritized. Amit Bendov told me this directly, he said we exactly the same thing. He said, \"We get a lot of requests for features and a lot of them are basically about opinions, some way to record opinions.\"\n\nLenny (00:39:04):\nAnd this is Gong.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:39:04):\n\"We're not going to do those.\" In Gong, yeah. \"We're not going to do those.\"\n\nLenny (00:39:08):\nAre there any companies out there that maybe aren't clients that you see as like, wow, these guys are nailing it and they're doing a great job of this strategic narrative?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:39:15):\nWell, one that really comes to mind is, I mean it's been out there for a while, but Drift. Drift comes out with essentially like a chatbot for your website, which might be the 30th chatbot for your website. And they don't say, \"Hey, here's why our chatbot is the best one.\" They start from a completely different place, which is, \"Hey, used to be people would sort of wait around for you to get back to them. It was a world of later. They called it the world of forms. You put up a web form and you expect someone's going to fill it out and maybe wait a few days while you take your sweet time deciding if you're going to get back to them.\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:39:58):\nAnd David Cancel and David Gerhardt started from right the beginning saying, \"Now we're in a world of now, where buyers are ...\" I think they showed this woman, I remember it was this woman sleeping with her phone. That's your prospect. They're always on and they're going to expect you to be engaging with them right away. And they called this conversational marketing, and they really went with that and created I think a whole movement and they broke away from all of the other chatbots.\n\nLenny (00:40:35):\nAwesome example. So earlier you threw out this word category, and I've noticed you haven't talked about category and category creation too much, and I think that you're kind of not a fan of this idea of creating a category and focusing on category. I'd love to hear your perspective on how that all relates to the stuff you recommend.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:40:55):\nLenny, are you trying to get me in trouble? Like that guy who guy on your podcast who attacked jobs to be done?\n\nLenny (00:41:02):\nApparently, let's do it. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get into.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:41:06):\nI would soften it a little bit and not just ... because I don't want the ire of the category design folks, but I really would soften and say, I wouldn't say I'm not a fan of creating category. Look, I think if you look at Play Bigger, which has become The Bible of that category creation thing, if you look behind that going to, what do they say the category is? They say it's a narrative. It's a story about how the world was to how it is. And so what I find though is that when people think about category creation, they tend to just focus on, okay, well, what is this category name going to be that we got? What are these three words or two words, whatever, that are going to magically make us seem like we're totally different from everybody else?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:41:52):\nAnd A, I think that's not really possible. These three words aren't going to do it. Take Gong, I mean already other companies were using this term revenue intelligence. With Gong, it suddenly becomes a thing because I think they have this opinions-to-reality story behind it. At one point, again, I asked Amit, he said, \"Yeah,\" because I remember he really struggled, \"What should we call it? What should we call it?\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:42:20):\nHe came up with that one. But then when I asked him later, he is like, \"Yeah, you know what? In hindsight we probably could have called it strawberry intelligence. It didn't matter. It was really the story that sort of mattered.\" I think he was exaggerating a little bit. And I think the category people would actually agree with this, I think they would agree with, hey, these three words are, it's sort of a shorthand for this movement of old game narrative.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:42:48):\nBut I guess I feel like still by calling it category and category name, we're just focusing on those three words so much. And what happens often is CEOs will, they'll kind of come up with this little category, like what happened with Nick at the 360Learning with collaborative learning. We have this name, but we don't know how to tell the story around it. So my feeling is like, well, let's focus on the story. So that's why I talk about strategic narrative and movement creation versus category creation. If someone decides that your movement is a category, great. Bonus.\n\nLenny (00:43:32):\nI see. So essentially your approach is category can play a part of this, but there's a bigger question you have of what's the story, what's the movement, what are the obstacles and categories and element of that potentially?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:43:45):\nI mean, I almost see them as orthogonal, like with HubSpot. HubSpot had this narrative around inbound. It used to be just outbound stuff, now we're going to have inbound. And that wasn't really a category. Back then they were probably known as marketing automation. Now they're probably known as CRM because they've broadened. But this movement is the thing that's sort of the constant and in some ways orthogonal to whatever category they're in.\n\nLenny (00:44:16):\nIs the strategic narrative framework right for essentially any company or is there a sweet spot? And I've noticed most of the companies you've been talking about are B2B SaaS. So I don't know, maybe if there's a spectrum of perfect fit for strategic narrative framework and then not a fit at all. What's along that spectrum?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:44:33):\nYeah, well you can see, I mean it takes a little time to tell this story and you were kind of framing it a little bit and we're telling it in lots of different channels. So I think it does really play well in this enterprise sales context because also we have a group buyer there. So it's not just one person who's doing some research. This whole group has to have a uniting story. So I think you're right that in noticing that the companies that this tends to resonate with tend to be B2B, enterprise sales, technology I think because often the product is very complicated. That arrogant doctor stuff comes from an age when the things people were selling were products on shelves that didn't change much, cans of soup at the supermarket or a car in a dealership. Even software back then, shrink-wrapped in a box, doesn't change.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:45:44):\nB2B software, this stuff is changing by the minute. And does it even make sense to make a claim to say, \"Oh, we have these features and they have those features, therefore we're better,\" does that make any sense? That said, hey, I was looking for a sports watch, a Fitbit and I'm comparing specs and I'm doing all that stuff. And so that mode of buying is still happening, but I think, so yeah, when consumer products companies contact me, I usually say, \"No.\" Occasionally they still say, \"Okay, yeah, we'll build this, we still want to have this narrative.\" But yeah, I think it has the most value, most impactful right away for B2B enterprise technology companies.\n\nLenny (00:46:33):\nJust a few more questions. One is just what's a sign that you should spend time in this area, that something is broken in your strategic narrative story pitch?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:46:42):\nWell, I can tell you what I hear from CEOs when they contact me. I always ask, what's happening? Because that idea I had, no CEO's going to budget a line item for this. I'm basically asking, why was I wrong? So a few things they tell me, one is that the company is maturing from a point a stage where they've been successful, but that success is ... one CEO put it this way, was brute force of the founders. So the founders are in every meeting, they're in every product discussion, every sales call, and that's shifting, the company's getting bigger.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:47:21):\nUsually I'm seeing this around series B where the company is getting ... so they can't be in every sales call, every market call and they're looking to transmit all the good stuff and some direction in a way that people are going to remember and all that. Everything from how we pitch to what the product should be and all that, and they see this as that.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:47:47):\nThere's another point that I see people contacting me at, which is where they're growing. It's usually a bit later where they've scaled tremendously successfully. Now we're either acquiring or building out whole new product units. And that old story we told is just, it's just not big enough and we got to expand it to something bigger. This is the example of OneTrust, which the CEO I had on my podcast recently. Starts out with just, I think it's data privacy around the regulations that people have to be able to say, \"Don't track me,\" things like that. And then they buy these other company and now we have this much bigger offering. So how do we tell the story? And then I guess the third one is some form of pivot where hey, we were telling an old story but whatever, the market changed or whatever and we want to go in a different direction.\n\nLenny (00:48:53):\nSay a founders listening to this and they're like, \"Okay, I realize I need to do this. I haven't spent enough time on this. Something's not working. This could be a huge unlock for us.\" What are the first couple steps they could take to start to figure this out? And I imagine at some point it's like, go talk to Andy. He'll help you through this. Is there stuff you can do on your own? How do you go about figuring this out?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:49:11):\nWell, a lot of folks have emailed me over the years like, well I told you before, there were some who emailed me like, \"Hey, tried it, didn't work.\" But many more have emailed me, \"Hey, I tried it, it did work. Thank you.\" And so yeah, just try to lay out that structure and try it mean even when I work with teams, I adapt what people might call sort of lean approach. I want to get that thing out there into sales calls. We're not rolling it out to the whole sales team right away, but getting it out into some sales calls and get a sense, \"Hey, is this resonating? Are people given the nods?\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:49:49):\nIdeally by the way, one way I look to test it, is it working, is when we talk about this shift and the stakes and do they stick. Do they kind of say, \"Yeah, let me tell you how that's playing out for us,\"? Or, \"Am I? Yes, I'm seeing that.\" Sometimes I'll literally, I'll train salespeople to ask them that question, like, \"Am I crazy or are you seeing this?\" And what do they say? And you can usually tell if they're in and it's qualitative. But I really like that kind of testing to see if it's working. And I think anybody can do that.\n\nLenny (00:50:32):\nIs there a template or guide you have online for folks to follow other than maybe just listening to this podcast and reading? Is there a post that's like, \"Here's the framework defined, and go follow these steps,\"?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:50:41):\nI mean, I guess the closest is that The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen post, which is the Zuora deck. But even there, people have asked me for a framework and presentation companies say, \"Can we have your template so we could make it available to people? We'll revenue share with you or something.\" And I am so against this template. Every team I work with, it's different. It's not the same number of slides. Sometimes we can lay out this shift in one slide, sometimes it just feels better or the team likes it better, whatever, if it's a few and we're sort of getting people into it. Sometimes there's no slides. So I am really hesitant to recommend any template. And what I'd say is these are principles for building it, not any prescribed formula.\n\nLenny (00:51:37):\nIf they do want to reach out to you while we're on this topic, what's the best way to contact you?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:51:42):\nConnect with me on LinkedIn. That's usually a good one. And I'm usually posting things on LinkedIn that I've learned from working with other teams.\n\nLenny (00:51:52):\nAwesome. Last question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Speaking of LinkedIn, you posted how in a working session with companies that the second session is always this low point they all go through and that everyone's starting to get discouraged and pained. And first of all, I love the expectation setting. You're like, \"This is going to suck initially and it'll get better.\" Why is that the low point and what is it that they focus on in that second session?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:52:17):\nWell, apparently I'm not doing enough of an expectation setting, because what that post was about was this woman. So when I work with a CEO I always ask them to create what I call a strategic narrative team of up to four people. And usually those are leads of marketing, sales, whatever. In this case, the CFO was a really important person in this company. And so the CEO wanted her as part of this team. And she said to me at the end, she's like, \"I love where we got to.\" I always ask, \"What worked? What didn't work?\" And she's like, \"I love where we got to. That worked great. What didn't work was like, you told us that this second session was going to be bad, but I think you could have drilled home more like exactly how bad.\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:52:58):\nAnd then I asked her, \"Actually, could I have that quote with your face on a slide that I now present to future teams?\" She said, \"Yeah, you could do that.\" So the way I work it is I have a kickoff session where essentially I'm asking people on the team, what are these pieces? What is this old game, new game shift? How do we talk about when to set the stakes and everything I just took you through? And we have like five people in the room. There's going to be ... we're going to come out of this with notes and notes, boards and boards of ideas of this stuff.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:53:34):\nAnd so then two things happen. One is I ask the team to start interviewing customers about how they see this shift and sometimes the customers will literally give us the words and that can be helpful in sort of aligning if we have differences. But I also start working with the CEO one-on-one and we build a first version of this thing, and it's the second session where we present this first version to the team and think about what's happening.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:54:02):\nThe team has just given us millions of gold ideas, truly they're all ... and in order to make something sort of clean and powerful, the CO and I have had to pretty much throw out all of them, save one or two. And there's going to be feelings about that, first of all. Second of all, if this were easy to just get all ... interview everybody, come up with it, they would've done it. So it's going to be wrong.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:54:30):\nBut the good news is this is where the team gets to weigh in. I also ask, what's working, not working in this thing? And when we learn how it's not working, that gives us the juice to then me and the CEO go back to the drawing board. We plan on this in advance, we're going to go back to the drawing board and then bring up something good. So having a shit draft is a million times more valuable than having all these great ideas. But it's also really painful. It's painful not only for them, but for me. No matter how many times I say this, I expect they're going to love it in that first one too. And I'm really pissed off when they don't. But luckily now I've done enough times I know that's going to happen.\n\nLenny (00:55:20):\nI was just watching a documentary about Annie Lamont who came up with the first draft concept for writers that I stick to.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:55:27):\nI'm a firm believer in that. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:55:30):\nAs you're talking, one last thought that I had is, so you'd work with because and founders. I feel like this could be just as useful to product leaders, product managers working on a product that they're launching, just like what is the movement, where it's happening, here's why this product's important. Do you find that too?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:55:45):\nAbsolutely. And very frequently, the product leader, chief product officer is part of this group. What I'd say though is that the reason ... so after I did this work for a few years, I looked back and I was like, which were the engagements I did where I can see it, and the narrative is really this true north star for everything?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:56:10):\nIt was always the ones where the CEO was leading it, not just in name, but literally the person who called me who was working on the drafts with me and going through. And so initially I didn't insist that it would be the CEO doing that, but eventually I started to, and I think even for a product leader, you're going to want the support. You don't want to be just telling that story in product. You're going to want that supported from this Zuora person who gave me the initial deck, he said it, \"It was like I had air cover and I was just going down and knocking down deals on the ground.\" You're going to want that air cover in marketing, sales, recruiting, everything. And how much better is it if it's really driven by the CEO and you have that?\n\nLenny (00:57:01):\nAmazing. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on or you want to share before we get to our very exciting lighting round?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:57:07):\nNo, except I love category design people and it's really just sort of terms that I like that are ... you know what? Forget it. Scratch that part.\n\nLenny (00:57:19):\nI thought that was funny.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:57:21):\nOh yeah. Okay. Yeah, we could leave it in. We could leave it in. You could even leave this in where I'm telling you to scratch it.\n\nLenny (00:57:26):\nSounds good. I was actually going to joke that I was going to cut this out and leave you hanging, but okay.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:57:31):\nNo, you can do that. Yeah. Category design people. Love you. Don't hate me. Thank you.\n\nLenny (00:57:37):\nGreat. I love it. We're going to be okay, I think. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:57:46):\nI'm ready. I saw like what you sent them, but I didn't really look at them, so I'm just going to tell you what I said. I'll go off that.\n\nLenny (00:57:52):\nPerfect. Excellent. The best version of this. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:57:59):\nOne of the books that I read initially from that Barnes & Noble, it was Story by Robert McKee. I think a lot of people know about it who are sort of interested in story stuff, but it's kind of a Bible of people who are doing screenwriting and stuff. If anyone who's in Hollywood who thought about going to Hollywood, they know about this book. I love a book called Out of Sheer Rage. It's really not about what I do or anything, but the author is Geoff Dyer. Geoff, he's written a lot of books that are kind of essay memoir, and this is a book about him trying to write a book about DH Lawrence. So it's all about procrastinating and like, \"Oh, I'm supposed to write this book. I'm about to go on a trip somewhere. Should I bring the collected works of DH Lawrence with me on the trip because that'll help me start the book, but maybe I shouldn't because it's not going to ... Then I could come back refreshed without having ...\" Basically, it's all that. It's this sort of in the head. I just really enjoy that book.\n\nLenny (00:58:59):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:59:03):\nStation 11. Station 11. That was just so beautiful to me.\n\nLenny (00:59:09):\nTrippy. That was a trippy movie. Did not expect to go where it went. I usually ask what's a favorite interview question you like to ask, and I don't know how often you're interviewing people, but does anything come to mind when I ask that?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:59:21):\nWell, I can tell you one thing I ask when I speak with CEOs is I like to ask, what role has this narrative played in your leadership? How does it work in your leadership? And it's always really interesting for me to hear that, 'cause I often hear things that I don't expect.\n\nLenny (00:59:39):\nWhat's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you just really like?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:59:43):\nI recently got a Fitbit. I think I may have mentioned it earlier. I was looking for a product like that, and so far I'm really loving it.\n\nLenny (00:59:53):\nAmazing. Have you tried other versions of Fitbits or that's the one that's working?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:59:58):\nI also ordered a Polar at the same time and wound up returning the Polar. Basically, it was just a little clunkier on my wrist, so I went with a Fitbit. Well, do you have one that you recommend instead?\n\nLenny (01:00:13):\nI just have the Apple Watch and I've never tried a Fitbit and it gives me all this stuff that seems cool, but I've never gone further.\n\nAndy Raskin (01:00:21):\nI got the Fitbit like a week ago and I actually still am on the fence whether I bring it back to return it for the Apple Watch, so I'm enjoying it, but we'll see.\n\nLenny (01:00:28):\nOkay. Final question. You're expert on presentations and I imagine you spend a lot of time in decks, and so just what's like one small change people can make to how they put together a deck or a presentation that will make their presentation a lot better?\n\nAndy Raskin (01:00:41):\nThis is the one thing, make the title the takeaway of the slide so that the person looking at it has to do zero work to take away. So example, you'll sometimes see, \"The problem,\" or, \"The team.\" Replace, \"The team,\" with, \"Our team is veterans of whatever industry,\" or every single slide it's a takeaway, not a label. It'll make everything flow a lot better.\n\nLenny (01:01:17):\nYou did a killer job answering the lightning round questions without having a peek at what they were going to be. Andy, this was incredibly insightful. I'm going to go start working on my strategic narrative for my podcast and newsletter. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe consider working with you? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAndy Raskin (01:01:35):\nSo I mentioned LinkedIn as a way to connect with me. That's fine. My website is AndyRaskin.com. I also have a podcast where I talk with CEOs, so if you're interested in hearing more details about actual use of this, it's called The Bigger Narrative. My mom introduces every episode. I sent her the interviews in advance. I call her and interview about what she thinks people will get out of it, and that conversation becomes the intro to the podcast episode. And what was the last question?\n\nLenny (01:02:04):\nHow can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAndy Raskin (01:02:06):\nUseful to me. Just if you try any of this stuff, let me know. Like, \"Hey, worked. Didn't work. Have this question.\" I would love to hear that stuff.\n\nLenny (01:02:17):\nAmazing. Andy, thank you again for being here.\n\nAndy Raskin (01:02:20):\nThanks so much for having me, Lenny. This is really fun.\n\nLenny (01:02:22):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "title": "Becoming more strategic, navigating difficult colleagues, founder mode, more | Anneka Gupta",
  "transcript": "# Becoming more strategic, navigating difficult colleagues, founder mode, more | Anneka Gupta\n\n## Transcript\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:00:00):\nWhen people say, \"I want someone that's strategic,\" what they're really saying is, \"I want someone that can come up with and articulate a compelling and simple why behind the decisions and the direction of the company and product.\" So that's number one. And the second piece is, \"I want someone that's going to champion and be a change agent to do things that may be hard but actually best for the long-term interest of the product or company, even though those things are not going to be easy to execute on.\" And I think if you have one without the other, ultimately people are not going to see you as strategic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):\nToday my guest is Anneka Gupta. Anneka is Chief Product Officer at Rubrik, a lecturer on product management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and on the board of Tinuiti. Previously, she was President, GM, and head of product at LiveRamp, where she spent 11 years and joined as one of their earliest employees. A bunch of former guests recommended Anneka Come on this podcast and you'll soon see why.\n\n(00:01:03):\nIn our conversation, Anneka shares a ton of powerful advice on navigating difficult personalities, giving and hearing hard feedback, bringing humor and gratitude to every situation, managing your energy versus managing your time. Super tactical tips for how to become more strategic and how to make better decisions, and also how to break into product management for people that are trying to become product managers. There's something in this episode for everyone and I am excited for you to learn from Anneka. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Anneka Gupta. Anneka, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:01:51):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:52):\nSo, I want to start with a question that I've started to ask guests that come on the podcast that have had extraordinarily successful careers and also just consistently successful careers. So here's the question. What do you believe are one or two skills or mindsets or habits that you think most contributed to your success that you think might be helpful for other people to learn and build to help them have more successful careers?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:02:18):\nSo it's funny, before we kicked this off, you talked about the post-it that you have on your computer that says have fun. My one mindset that I really have leaned into after someone actually gave me advice on this is to figure out how to have fun in my job, even in the most difficult of times. The reason why I say that is because when you're hit with really hard times, it's easy to operate from a mindset of scarcity and to look at everything as an unachievable hurdle to overcome. And when I was able to switch my mindset and say, \"Well, I'm actually going to figure out a way to have fun with this,\" it actually changed my entire for how to deal with super difficult situations.\n\n(00:03:03):\nThis advice specifically came up to me when I had a scenario where I had to essentially change out all of my direct reports in very short order, and I figured that out. It was a super daunting situation. I didn't know how I was going to manage and at first I felt so scared by what was ahead of me and how much change I was going to have to go through in a very short period of time. But when I got this advice, I started to try to reframe my thinking and it actually really made it so that I was able to get through that hard time and opened my mind up to so many more opportunities. So, now I try to embody that in every situation that I come across where I'm faced with something super, super challenging.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:45):\nI love this advice. It's something that I've recently seen also in public speaking. If you can just reframe your thinking from \"I'm scared of this\" to \"This is going to be fun. I'm going to have so much fun doing this. It's going to be like this energy and anxiety I'm feeling is me feeling like it's going to be a lot of fun.\" So, spending a little more time here, how do you actually do this? So in this case, you shared an example of basically you have to fire a bunch of people, not something one can quickly think about how to have fun with that. How did you do this? Is it just in your mind you're like, \"I'm going to have fun with this,\" or is there something tactically people can do to make something fun?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:04:18):\nI think there were a couple of things that I did and I've continued to do. One is figure out and really look at the situation and ask myself, what can I learn from this situation? What can I get out of this that's a positive outcome even though it is incredibly challenging to be facing it right now? So that's one thing that I've done. The second thing I think that has been really helpful is in going into meetings or other situations where I was trying to figure out how to collectively solve some big challenge, figuring out how to bring humor into the meeting. Just starting it on a light note and that elevated my own mood and way I was approaching the meeting, but also adds a level of levity to the situation for other people as well, which I think as a leader is super important because it's not just about your own mindset, but how are you transferring that mindset to the people that you're working with and the people that are working for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:12):\nGot it. So part of it is just like, \"How do I add a little humor?\" Part of it is just thinking, \"How do I make this fun?\" Is part of this just like this is not as important as people make it out to be and we could just have a little fun with this thing. It doesn't have to be like we're not curing cancer.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:05:28):\nYeah, definitely I think that helps. Reflecting on this too, I feel like a lot of it comes down to the amount of emotional and mental energy I can bring to solving a problem. And there's always so much going on in life, like personal life as well as professional life, trying to figure out how can I architect my day and time to maximize my energy and be able to bring my full self to work and to these difficult so that I can have that mindset to look at things more broadly versus operating from a place of scarcity. That may come down to simple things like making sure that I have lunch. Sometimes when things get so busy you're like, \"Oh, I'm just going to grab a protein bar and I'm going to skip lunch.\" But I found that that really decreases my energy.\n\n(00:06:15):\nOr, trying to do things that are really difficult late in the day. Five to 6:00 PM is my worst time of day and I know that about myself, so I'm not going to schedule in my most difficult meeting or writing up a strategy deck or something for that period of time because I know that that's not going to be my best and it's actually going to make it more difficult for me to get the work done. Being able to manage my energy levels and figuring out how to schedule my time for my energy has really allowed me also to figure out how to have that abundant mindset in all situations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:50):\nThis episode is brought to you by the Enterprise Ready Conference, a one-day event in San Francisco, bringing together product and engineering leaders shaping the future of enterprise SaaS.

If you're like me and most users that I've built product for, you're probably used to chatbots at the bottom right of websites where you ask a question and it says something like, \"Check out these three helpful articles. Did that answer your question?\" And then you click away and then a few seconds later you get bombarded with some other useless pop-ups. For those of us who work on software, no one wants their product to feel like this. Command AI is an AI power toolkit for support, product, growth and marketing teams that embeds in your company's product.\n\n(00:08:19):\nThe AI support agent can deflect upwards of 80% of support questions providing actually useful answers, and it can magically co-browse with your users to show them around your interface. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. Command AI works with web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, LaunchDarkly, and over 25 million end-users interact with Command AI interfaces. To try out Command AI, you can sign up at command.ai/Lenny and experience a custom demo of how it works in your app. That's command.ai/Lenny.\n\n(00:09:06):\nI'm going to go in a totally different direction. Before we were recording, we were also chatting about founder mode, and this is recently. This episode we're recording shortly after Paul Graham put out his now classic, instant classic founder mode post. And he had some really interesting takes on ways to think about founder mode, both from product leader perspective, from a founder perspective. So, there's kind of two questions I want to ask, but just broadly, what's your take on founder mode?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:09:33):\nWell, first of all, I think Paul Graham did an amazing thing by putting a name to something so many of us have seen in practice. And while he didn't in his article say this is exactly what this is, I think many, many people that I talked to were like, \"Oh yeah, I recognize this.\" I recognize people that I've worked for, CEOs, that have done founder mode, great founders that have done founder mode poorly. And it opened up a level of discussion that I think is really valuable for everyone to be having, whether you're a founder or you're someone that works for a founder.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:04):\nOkay, so I'm going to ask two questions around this. One is from the perspective of working for a founder and founder mode, the other is being a product leader in founder mode. So, first of all, imagine you've worked with a few founders that operate in founder mode. As a CPO, as head of product, that's often a difficult place to be between the founder and the team that are building the thing. What have you learned about how to effectively work as a product leader with a founder in founder mode?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:10:30):\nSo, I think when a founder's in founder mode and if they're doing it well, what they're doing is really deeply understanding the business and then figuring out when to use their power as a founder to either tweak things and send something in a slightly different direction or fundamentally innovate and completely change directions or completely innovate in a totally new area. Now I think the way to use that effectively as a head of product is to recognize that they have that power to figure out how to use that power to get the things done that you know are best for the company. So, I always think about I have all the people around me. Whether they're people on my team, my peers, or my CEO, these are different resources I have to go get a initiative done or get work done in the company.\n\n(00:11:23):\nAnd as having a founder that can effectively operate in founder mode means that I can go and have a conversation with the CEO and say, \"Hey, look, we have this huge opportunity and these are the things that aren't working, and I need your help to help figure out how we can move the needle more substantially in the direction that we need to go.\" And so activating that founder, that CEO to really be able to push the initiative that I think is best by making them an ally in doing so. I think one aspect. The second aspect is, which often happens, it's very difficult for many people and I've had this happen to me many times, is when a founder is like, \"Well, I have this idea,\" and then you may or may not agree that that's the best direction to go in and how do you navigate that kind of situation?\n\n(00:12:10):\nSo, one is actually taking a step back and objectively saying, \"Well, why are they pushing this?\" Maybe it's the wrong mechanism to go actually get done a strategy that's quite important for the company. So having a really deep understanding about why are they asking this, what are they ultimately trying to get at and what is the objective that they're trying to get at and is this the right way to get at it? If the answer is no to that, then you can go have a conversation. If you know what the objective is, you can go have a conversation with that founder and say, \"Hey, look, I know this is what you're trying to do, but maybe instead of looking at option A here of how we go about tackling this, we should have explored these three other options instead.\" And that can help you and help navigate that conversation.\n\n(00:12:53):\nNow sometimes it's difficult to even get to that kind of understanding of the objective because someone might be just super set in their ways of, \"Hey, I really want to go after this opportunity. It's my pet project.\" Then you have to decide as a head of product, do I really want to fight this or do I just give in on this, let it go? And also make sure that we get the stuff done that's most important to the company. You have to make that judgment call as a head of product and decide what is really going to make or break the company. What's the hill that I'm going to die on and is this something that I can shift or is this something that is not worth shifting? Of course it comes down to the personality. I've been very fortunate that I've actually had very few of those situations where the founder has been like, \"Hey, I really want to go in this direction and I haven't agreed, at least with what we're trying to go after, regardless of the mechanism behind it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:47):\nI really love the point you made, especially about how the founder could be this lever to get things done. When you identify something needs to change, the best way to change that is just have the founder go in there, tell everyone, \"Hey, we're going to do this thing differently.\" It's such like a positive spin on how to leverage founder mode where a founder actually has a lot of power to change that other people in the company don't. Okay, so let's go from the other side. So, I was talking to Nikhyl Singhal who runs the Skip, which is a community you're part of about you. And he said that you're a leader who excels in founder mode, that you operate in founder mode a lot. And so as a product leader, what have you learned about just how to think in founder mode, operate in founder mode, leverage that approach to leading teams, leading product teams?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:14:32):\nYeah, I think it's often easy as a leader to say, \"I'm not going to roll up my sleeves and get into the details of the business or ask a lot of detailed questions about the business because you want to empower people and make them successful.\" What I've found is that understanding the details of the business and asking questions and understanding to the utmost extent you can, what's working, what's not, what are the financial goals of the business? Are we on track to get there? How are we making decisions? Getting into that level of depth is super important, and then you can decide as a leader, what do you want to do with that information? So there's a lot of information that I collect about what's happening in the organization, the decisions that we're making that I don't do anything with at a point in time.\n\n(00:15:20):\nThat's my choice to make, but I want the information because in understanding the depth and what is happening, I can decide where I actually think I need to go in deep and make either very significant course correction or a small course correction. Then the way that I think about how do I bring my team along for that so they don't feel like I'm coming in and stomping all over the work that they're doing or trying to re-adjudicate a decision, one, is how do I get in there early?\n\n(00:15:51):\nOne of the tactics I use is I ask people to present their strategies for things that I think we may need to do a course correction on, and I have them come in and then I ask them questions and then I make suggestion. And I'm able to do that in a forum where it doesn't feel like I'm coming in and rewriting the entire strategy, but I'm giving them there an opportunity to present their best thinking and then trying to figure out how do I take that and make that better and make them feel like I'm making it better versus stomping all over and dismissing the work that they've done.\n\n(00:16:23):\nI pick a strategic set of areas. So I think about what is most important for the business? What's going to kill the business if we don't get right and what are the biggest opportunities for the business that we need to go after regardless of how difficult it is for us to actually execute on that? By doing that, then at least I have clarity in my mind and I can provide clarity to the team about what is most important and rally the troops around making that stuff happen if that is what is essentially right. And I'll have all the context because I've asked all the questions of why this is right for the business, why is this going to help us with increased margins or get better growth or get into a new persona if that's what we're trying to do as an overall organization.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):\nSo in that example, and I love this tactic, you have your team come in, you ask them, \"Tell me what the strategy is for this thing that you're working on.\" What you've seen work is instead of like, \"No, this is broken, this is wrong, this isn't going to work.\" Your approach is ask questions and hope that they see the flaws or gaps. Is that how-\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:17:24):\nYeah, it's ask questions, but you can't always lead someone somewhere with asking questions. It's also sharing a hypothesis. So I might have a particular hypothesis about the business where I might see something like, \"Well, I was talking to security leaders in our customer advisory board recently and I heard this piece of feedback and this is what it made me think about our strategy, what do you think about that?\" And then let them say like, \"Okay, yeah, actually I see this or maybe I have some follow up questions.\"\n\n(00:17:54):\nIt actually opens a whole discussion where I'm still able to provide my perspective and point of view but not completely shut down the discussion. Because what I always worry about is a leader is I'm going to come in and say something, and because I'm one of the more senior people in the room, no one is going to say if they have a concern. And the reality is I'm not always right far from it, but I want to be able to seed an assumption and then have a discussion based on that and then figure out what the right outcome is about what we should do next based on that discussion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:27):\nSpeaking of strategy, you shared with me that at one point in your career you got this feedback that you just weren't strategic enough and that that comment led you to research and dig into what does it mean to be strategic, and also just to level up your strategic mindset and the way you think about strategy. What did you end up with recognizing as being strategic? What is that in your work and in your research? And then how did you actually get better at this work of being strategic?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:18:57):\nI got this feedback once in a performance review and then I actually got it as well a few years ago when I was interviewing for head of product roles and I thought I had made a lot of progress on it, but when I reflected back, I think it actually all came back to the same themes. Which was I think when people say \"I want someone that's strategic,\" what they're really saying is \"I want someone that can come up with and articulate a compelling and simple why behind the decisions and the direction of the company and product.\" So that's number one. The second piece is, \"I want someone that's going to champion and be a change agent to do things that may be hard but actually best for the long-term interest of the product or company, even though those things are not going to be easy to execute on.\"\n\n(00:19:45):\nAnd I think if you have one without the other, ultimately people are not going to see you as strategic. If you're really good at articulating the why, but you're only bringing small ideas to the table, then that's not strategic. If you're championing big ideas but you can't articulate the why behind them in a compelling and simple way, then you're not going to be seen as strategic either. So, that's the formula that I've come up with. This is what it means. And so I focused a lot on how do I make sure I do both of these things? How do I champion a few things that a really big ideas that are going to help change the direction of the company, and then how do I articulate that in a simple and compelling why?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:26):\nThat's such a cool simple way of thinking about this. Is there an example from your work that might illustrate some of this from a project you worked on or a product you built?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:20:35):\nI can take some recent examples. We've been doing a lot of strategic planning for where do we want to be as a company over the next three years, and Rubrik operates in the cybersecurity space. It's a very fast moving landscape. There's a lot of places that we could go as a business, and one of the ways that I've exhibited this, and this is what I recommend to other people too, is sometimes it's really hard to come up with the compelling and simple why behind something and sometimes it's also really hard to come up with a really big idea out of thin air. So these things can be very challenging. The first step that I found as very useful, and I use this tactic every single day in meetings, is just summarization. So, bringing people together, lots of different voices into a room and hearing what they have to say and at various times in the conversation summarizing what people are saying and summarizing what that means in terms of the direction that we could go in.\n\n(00:21:34):\nAnd then that's a checkpoint of saying, \"Okay, this is how I've synthesized what is happening. Is this correct or do we actually need to do another turn because we don't all agree with where we're landing here?\" That summarization, even though I may not be adding a new idea into that, I found people actually view that as strategy. They view the effective summarization as strategy. So I think that's one element. Then what I've also found is that when I summarize what other people are saying and especially multiple different stakeholders, then I can think about offline and not in the context of right in the meeting, sometimes in the meeting too I guess, is how do I make this idea one click better? It's not about how do you do something radically, radically different, but taking ideas and then making it slightly better, slightly better.\n\n(00:22:25):\nWhen you think about that, especially from an outside-in perspective of what are the customer problems we're trying to solve and how are we going to take this to market, and don't worry about how difficult the technical implementation is going to be, then you start to get to these big ideas that can really be the change agent ideas. So, I've started doing this more and more and I think especially in the past three to six months, and I'm seeing a material difference in terms of the number of big ideas that we're going and pursuing overall as a company and also the quality of the strategic thinking that I can bring to the table, and it's been really exciting and rewarding.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:02):\nThere's so much you're sharing that resonates with other podcast episodes. For example, this idea of just going one click better. I had Roger Martin on the podcast where this book, Playing to Win, which is one of the more popular strategy books, and he has this concept of betterment as a way to work on strategy. A lot of people go huge with a big strategy and vision, and his advice is just find the thing that is the biggest constraint and bottleneck to your business right now and just make it better and that's your next step. And then just keep doing that and you'll end up in a much better place over time, even though it feels like you're just doing one little thing. And so I love this idea of just picking one thing and making it one click better. There's going to be an episode that comes out right before this with Alex Komoroske, and he has this concept of the adjacent possible and it's just find the next thing that's possible and focus on that versus some big lofty thing. So I'm just sharing a bunch of stuff, that's not a question.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:23:56):\nThat totally resonates though.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:58):\nOkay, okay. Okay, great. And then the summarization idea, I love it. So tactical, basically any PM can do this just in a meeting just like, \"Okay, let me just summarize to make sure everyone's on the same page.\" Funny enough, this is the feedback I get on this podcast and I haven't been doing this in our conversation yet, but I often try to summarize the person's point and everyone's like, \"Oh, I love that you do that. That's so helpful.\" So I totally see the power of that in my experience.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:24:22):\nIt also makes people feel heard and especially when you have a lot of diverse voices in the room that may not agree on all things but have valid viewpoints, it helps bring people together and ultimately the diverse perspectives are going to yield better insights and better decisions for the organizations. You want that, but some people shy away from that because it's scary because you have to deal with a lot of conflict and it's a way to kind of move beyond the conflict and get to the heart of an issue, which in my mind, that's what the PM job is all about is getting to the very, very heart of a problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:56):\nIf someone wants to work on this skill of summarizing as kind of a tactic, can you give just an example of how you would do that? Is there like a phrase to use? Is there words or an example you could give of just like here's how it would look in a meeting?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:25:10):\nYeah. So, often if there's a lot of discussion going on, sometimes it can be a little hard to insert yourself. I still may insert myself and say, \"Hey, let me pause here for a second and try to capture what has been said.\" This is what I've heard. I've heard that our customers are having these kinds of challenges. We feel like this is the way that we want to solve these challenges. We have a right to win in this way and therefore we're going to take this action.\n\n(00:25:36):\nIs everyone in agreement with that or is there some dissent about whether that's an accurate portrayal of where we've landed with this conversation? That's the way I'll frame it up and again, ending it on a question so that you're not coming in and just being like, \"Hey, this is where we're at.\" But then inviting people to discuss and say \"Yes,\" or \"No, I agree with 90% of that or 10% off.\" And that helps move the conversation forward because sometimes you'll get stuck in these circular discussions that aren't moving forward and you need to figure out a way to move it forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):\nAnd then you experience is just doing that makes you look more strategic and gives people the impression you're thinking strategically?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:26:18):\nYes. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:19):\nAwesome.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:26:19):\nThe other way you can do it is if you're in a room with someone and you have a whiteboard is actually summarize on the whiteboard while people are talking and then show your summarized framework or whatever on that. So that's kind of a good way to do it too. If you're having a hard time interrupting the flow of discussion or you don't feel as comfortable thinking on your feet and interrupting and then framing your point of view, you can do that. In Zoom you can also use a chat. I've done that very effectively and said, \"I'm not going to interrupt the flow conversation. I'm just going to summarize in Zoom chat this is what I've heard, and this is what I think we're saying in this conversation.\" And then sometimes that'll get invited back into the broader conversation that's happening live on the Zoom itself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:05):\nThat's a much lower stakes way of doing it, and I'm picturing all the PMs listening to this, they're going to start doing this and there's going to be all these summaries now in Zoom chats and everyone will be like, \"Oh my God, why is everyone sharing?\"\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:27:14):\nAnd then Zoom AI will start just doing it all for you. Then we'll have to think again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:19):\nAnd then PMs are over and AI replaced us all.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:27:19):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:22):\nOkay, so then just to close the loop on becoming more strategic, your advice is when someone's like, \"Hey, you're not strategic enough. You need to be more strategic.\" Your insights is the two things to work on is one, be clear on the whys behind the ideas that you're working on and be very crystal clear. People may not be understanding why you're working on the things you want to work on, the things you're pitching. And then two is actually be the person that makes these things happen, not just put a doc out there. If you're not actually achieving them, people are going to think you're not strategic.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:27:53):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:53):\nAwesome. Okay. I want to talk about decision-making. You have a really interesting perspective on how to become a better decision-maker in relation to being kind of a historian, which I love this concept. Talk about that insight.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:28:07):\nYeah, so I was at my previous company for 11 years, so I kind of ended up becoming the historian. And when I joined Rubrik about three years ago, I came into an organization that had a lot of history that I just didn't know about. So one of the things that I decided to do when I joined the company was to really understand what happened in the past. What were the products that we launched that weren't successful? Why weren't they successful? What was the perspective on the history of how we've decided to develop the things that we did and why? What was the perception of different people in the organization? I tried to construct this past knowledge of what had happened and what were the decisions that were made and why were those decisions made, whether they were good or bad it didn't matter, so that I could better understand how to make decisions going forward and to learn from the mistakes that I didn't personally live through.\n\n(00:29:07):\nI think that's the part that's really important about being a historian. You can always be a historian. It doesn't have to be just when you join a company, but even today I'll hear about projects from many years ago that people will bring up and I'll be like, \"Tell me about this project. What happened with it? How did we decide to do this?\" And just really learn and be curious about it because that gives me more context into, well, what is it that we did poorly and how can we do that better? And also, what is the baggage that people have around trying to do something similar again? Because people always come with their baggage of, oh, this hasn't worked before, so why is it going to work now? And as a product leader, you're obviously putting in place a lot of thoughts and ideas around this is what I want to go achieve and these are the initiatives. And some people are going to come and say, \"Well, we've tried that before.\" Especially you've been at an organization that's been around for a while.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:56):\nI've been that guy. We've done this so many times. It didn't work. Why are we thinking about this again? Okay, so the advice is if you're new to a company especially, just study the past decisions that were made and share them out as a part of that and then as a side effect, it'll help you make better decisions because you'll have this history about what the company has done. I love that. Along the same lines of decision-making, I asked your former colleague Rachel Wolan what to ask you, and she said that your parting advice when she left to join a different company was it's not about making the right decision, it's about making the decision. That's like the things she remembered about you most, that parting advice. Talk about why that is so important and your insight there.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:30:42):\nVery easy to get into analysis paralysis before making a decision and say, \"Well, if I just had this one more data point, if I just knew this, then I could make a decision.\" But the reality is that you were always operating off of imprecise information as a product leader. What I've found is that once you commit to a decision, you actually learn more post committing to that decision about what's going to work and not going to work, and you move out of the hypothetical. And as long as your decision is like 70% right, you can iterate on that 20, 30% in either direction, but if you don't commit, then you don't actually get any new information that is high fidelity and high quality. So, I'm a big believer in making decisions...\n\n(00:31:28):\nI know you've had a few guests talk about speed is super important in organizations. Well, I think making decisions quickly and then being able to iterate on them is a form of that. Just make a decision. Don't make it uninformed, but have a strong hypothesis and then just keep testing whether that hypothesis is accurate or not and you'll shift here and there. You might build something that you have to throw away 20% of the work on, but that's okay. It's better than making no decision at all because you won't get any new information if you don't make any decision at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:56):\nAs a PM that might be listening to this, feeling like, \"Okay, yeah, that sounds great.\" But then I make a bad decision and then Anneka is going to be like, \"You messed up here. You've shipped the wrong thing here. It didn't work.\" How do you create a culture where people don't feel that and aren't as afraid of making bad decisions and making decisions with 70% of the information?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:32:19):\nI think part of it comes down to making sure there's a strong hypothesis that everyone understands when you're making the decision. Or it might not just be one hypothesis, it might be a series of hypotheses and assumptions that we're making that are informing the decision. So it might be a hypothesis that this segment of customers is going to be willing to pay for this product because it's solving an urgent and important enough need for them that they're going to go do it and this is the evidence we have to find it, but this is also the stuff we don't know.\n\n(00:32:52):\nThen along the way, we learn whether that hypothesis is true or not. And so at the end of the day, if something didn't work out, we can go back to the original hypothesis and say, \"Well, this is what we learned in this process that our hypothesis was actually not true, and we learned all of this after the fact.\" I think the way to make a culture of risk taking and people willing to make these bets and go out on a limb is to reward the learning versus the outcome. That's what I try to focus on is if we're constantly learning, it is okay if we make bad decisions, but we learn from them and we get better for next time. Even in making this bad decision, we learn something about our customers or our business that we otherwise wouldn't have learned that we can use in another context.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:40):\nFirst of all, I love that this comes back to your strategic lesson of just if you have a strong why behind something, that's incredibly powerful and people will be confident that you're thinking strategically. Two, I was just at a talk with Zuck. He's being interviewed at the Chase Center, the Acquired Podcast at this whole event, and his main thing that he talked about that he values most in the culture of Facebook is learning faster than anyone else. Shipping stuff that isn't perfect, but just so that you can get one more turn and learn something faster than someone else. So, that super resonates that's Facebook's culture. Is there an example of something you worked on where you did that, where you kind of ship something that you weren't fully confident in and you learn faster?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:34:26):\nYeah, I mean, I think there's a lot because anytime you're shipping products, there's so many different things that could go right and wrong. There's a situation where we created a really amazing high value product and we decided not to monetize it, and then we realized after the fact, \"Wait, we should have monetized it. So, we're trying to figure out how to package some new capabilities to monetize this thing that we know has a lot of value without taking away what we've already given to existing customers.\" So that was something we learned along the way that we originally didn't think, oh, we should monetize this, but then we realized that there's actually an avenue to do that after the fact. There's been other things where we've developed a set of capabilities thinking that it will solve for this new persona's problems, but then we misunderstood how easy it was going to be to go sell to that new persona within our own organization. I've made that mistake many times actually.\n\n(00:35:26):\nAnd so now I think now what I've taken from that is really know how you're going to sell something and who's going to do the selling before you actually go build out the product. Because if you don't have that right focus, you may build out the best product and yet it's going to get zero adoption because no one in your organization is ready to sell it. So there's tons of stuff like that where it's like been okay, yeah, we've learned something from this, and it's not all throwaway, it just means that we've got to do something differently for this product and we need to do something differently for our organization going forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:01):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo.

By the way, first of all, she spent a lot of time raving about how amazing you are first. That was the first set of conversations, and then she came up with a bunch of questions to ask you. And so her other question was about how good you are at navigating very difficult personalities. She showed this quote that she constantly saw you interact with and bring together several leaders who had much higher egos and very disparate points of view who are not informed or thoughtful or as gracious as you were, and she also said you have very low ego. She wanted me just to ask you for what you've learned about how to navigate very difficult personalities and help people align when it's not neatly what they want to do.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:38:06):\nI try to embody the mindset of feeling like and believing that I can work with anyone. I think what I do when I hit a difficult personality and difficult personalities come in all shapes and sizes and forms is I really try to understand what drives that person. What is it that they really care about? Hopefully they care about something deeply about the company and making the company successful. Sometimes they care about their own personal career, how they're showing up, what people view of them. That's fine. I just need to understand what it is that they really care about, and then if I need something from them, what is it that I can do to motivate them to find what I need from them important? And trying to make that match of they have this desire kind of like building a product, they have this desire and how am I going to get them to care about the thing that I want to care about?\n\n(00:39:08):\nThe other thing I do is instead of feeling like anger or frustration with the person and instead trying to shift that to a mindset of feeling gratitude and a positive emotion about them is I look at them and I ask myself what can I learn? Maybe I don't want to adopt their personality or operate the way that they are operating, but everyone has something that they can teach you, whether it's their communication style or the way they're able to marshal people together, the way they come up with visionary ideas, whatever it may be, trying to study that person and be curious about them, learn from them and then thank them for that and feel the generosity genuinely about what I got from this situation. It's easier to do sometimes than others, but I think it comes back to that abundant mindset. If you can approach it with an abundant mindset, then you can really consciously do this and when you actually learn something, you will feel the gratitude when you recognize that you are able to get something from that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:13):\nI love that this connects with your other original piece of advice of just turning something into this is going to be fun. Let's make this fun. And in this case it's like make it great. What can I learn from this person even though they're really annoying me and it's frustrating and don't want anything done? Then your other point of understanding what they want and kind of using that as a way to pull them in your direction, how do you figure out what they want? Do you have any tricks for just like, \"Here's how I learn what this person's motivations are and goals are\"?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:40:42):\nTalk to other people that have worked with them before and have done so successfully. So that might be people that work for them because if you work for a person like that, you have to figure out and or you're successful working for that person, you probably understand what makes them tick. So that's one, or talk to people that are peers, anything like that to try to understand and build this view of this person that helps me empathize with them and also helps me understand what they may be wanting to get out of a situation and why.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:16):\nI love that. Yeah, they don't have to be involved in that. You just ask other people, \"What is this person's motivations?\" And then the idea is connect what they want with the thing you're trying to achieve. Beautiful. I really love this idea of when you're frustrated by someone just reframing it to like, \"I'm grateful I'm going to learn something from this person in our interaction, even though they're making life hard for me.\" I really love that. Another skill I hear you're really strong at, and this comes from another one of your colleagues, Hema Mohan shared that you're world-class at giving feedback, giving hard feedback, and receiving hard feedback. And so I want to just ask you, what have you learned about how to do this? It's very hard to give hard feedback. That's why it's called hard feedback. So from either direction, what have you learned about receiving hard feedback or giving hard feedback where someone actually hears Zoom doesn't get defensive?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:42:07):\nThe answer is so much, I've learned so much from it. So maybe I'll start with receiving feedback. So, on the receiving feedback side, I think it's very natural to feel upset, defensive, all the negative emotions when you first see a piece of negative feedback, whether it's you're reading it in a employee survey or you're receiving it in a one-on-one from a direct report or from a manager or from a peer. And I try to let myself just feel the things that I'm going to feel. Sometimes that's an emotional feeling, sometimes that means I want to step out of the room or it depends on who I'm talking to, but let myself feel the things that I'm going to feel. Then once that's passed, whether that's a few hours or a few days, don't react. Don't try to say, \"Oh, I don't believe this.\" Listen. And then ask myself, okay, well where is this feedback coming from? Why am I getting this feedback?\n\n(00:43:07):\nAnd try to be super curious about it. And that might be going back to the person that gave me the feedback and maybe asking someone that's a peer somewhere in the organization that might have more context and flavor to what the feedback really is, just trying to learn. Then I can decide, do I think this is valid or not? Is this something I should do something about or not? Actually, all feedback I think is valid. People's feelings are valid, but it doesn't mean that you need to do something about all of those things. Going through that process and letting myself ride the emotional wave and not judging myself for that, but then not reacting and letting myself then figure out and come back curious. I think when you come back curious, people then want to give you more feedback because they know that you're listening and that you're hearing what they say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:55):\nSo the advice is feel it, don't block it off and be like, \"No, no, no, no, no, this isn't real.\" So fully let your body go through the roller coaster of feeling the negative feedback. Sometimes the feedback is just like, \"No, this isn't actually a thing.\" Do you have any just heuristic of like I should actually pay attention to this deeply or just like let me wait for more data points?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:44:15):\nYeah, I think in product you receive feedback all the time for your organization or for yourself, and you can't make everyone happy. Everyone wants a different thing from product. So I think this comes up quite often where there's a lot of feedback for the organization or for you as a leader and you have to decide what to focus on and what not to focus on. I always try to anchor on, \"Well, what is best for the company and what does the company need for me and for my team at this point in time?\" There's stuff that is a must-have on that list, and there's stuff that's nice to have. Sometimes there's just too many must-haves to go deal with the nice-to-haves and you have to just be like, well, I know this is a problem, or I know we could be 10% better in this, but it actually doesn't matter as much as fixing these things that are really, really important and are really what's going to help my organization deliver what it needs to for the company and for the business overall.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:13):\nIn terms of receiving hard feedback, so you shared one example or I shared an example where someone said you weren't strategic enough. Is there another example of receiving hard feedback that you got that you're like, \"Ugh, that sucks\"? Either earlier in your career or more recently, anything else come to mind?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:45:26):\nI mean all the time. So there's always hard stuff. Well, people will give feedback of, \"Oh, I feel like we're not moving fast enough on our roadmap and priorities. We need to be doing more. Why aren't we moving fast?\" Or-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:47):\nNever heard that one before.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:45:48):\nNever heard that one before, right? Or disparaging the direction that we're taking a certain product because they don't agree with it because a competitor is doing something else, but we've decided for our reasons that we're not going to go follow that path. There's always something that people have negative feedback about and sometimes I'm like, \"Okay, this is an eye roll.\" I understand where they're coming from. I understand why they're giving me this feedback, but I also don't agree that we should change directions because of it. I don't know, some of the things cut deeper than others, but I think people are making personal statements about my team or they're feeling like, \"Hey, the product team isn't listening to feedback, or the product team has a bad culture. Anneka isn't listening.\" Things like that cut deep and are a lot more... I know like physiologically they make me kind of seize up a little bit, but again, then I try to feel the things I'm going to feel and try to understand why are they saying that. Why do they really feel that and what does that mean behaviorally that I have to do differently or my team has to do differently or maybe just two people on my team need to do differently and someone is extrapolating this out to be a much bigger problem than actually is?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:59):\nAwesome. Okay, and then we were going to shift to what you've learned about giving hard feedback so that someone actually listens and doesn't just put up a shield and like, \"It's not real.\"\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:47:10):\nSo I think in giving feedback, you can never fully control how someone else is going to respond to that feedback. All you can control is what you do, your body language and what you say. What I have found is that if I can convey, and I will say this very directly to people, I care so much about you and I'm giving you this feedback because I want you to be successful and I want you to be able to reach the pinnacle of what I know you can accomplish. And you do all of that setup and you don't just hope that they understand that, you actually explicitly say that and you show that in your body language, then it makes the other person much more receptive to hearing whatever you have to say. Then I think the other piece is that you've got to be direct.\n\n(00:47:57):\nThe worst feedback is the kind of passive-aggressive feedback versus saying directly this is what you are doing or this is how you are being perceived in the organization, and here are the three things that you can do to change the way you're being perceived or to change the outcomes of what you're driving or become more strategic or whatever it is that I'm trying to give feedback on. I do a lot of prep before I give someone a lot of feedback. I really think about how can I frame this in a way that's going to resonate with them that doesn't come across as attacking them, but helps them understand why what they're doing isn't working or is being perceived poorly? And try to give them examples and even examples that I've personally had to go through myself of how I've approached those situations. And let them ask questions and brainstorm with them, be part of the solution versus saying like, \"Here's all this feedback, now you go figure out what to do with it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):\nThis reminds me of Radical Candor. Basically make people feel like you care deeply about them, but be very direct about what they can be doing better. Are there phrases or ways that you set up the conversation? You mentioned a few of just like, \"I want to help you become the best version of who you could be and what you're capable of.\" Is there any phrases you find helpful that you come back to often of just a way to start the conversation?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:49:21):\nYeah, I think what I started with is like, \"I care a lot about you. You have a lot of potential. I can see you doing these kinds of things. I can see you getting to where you want to go in your career.\" Sometimes I even start the conversation by asking them, \"What do you want to do? Where do you want to go in your career?\" And that will help me frame up which of these things are important. Because honestly, if someone wants to be eventually like a CPO, the feedback I'm going to give to them is very different than if they're like, \"Hey, I don't really want to manage people ever. I just want to be the best I see I can ever be.\" I'm not going to give them the same feedback. And so having that conversation up front also allows them even before I jump into the feedback to give them their perspective of what they want and then I can tailor the conversation more to what they're looking for.\n\n(00:50:04):\nI think that has really helped as well make sure that I focus on the things that are going to really matter. During the feedback conversations, I also try to frame things as this is how you're being perceived than you are doing X. Because I think even though it's hard to hear, \"Oh, hey, this person doesn't perceive you in the way that you may think,\" then we can talk about, \"Well, what are ways that we can change the perception?\" I also think it's important because sometimes people are like if you say, \"Hey, I don't think you're X,\" and then they're like, \"Well, yes I am.\" And if you're saying, \"Hey, well this is how other people perceive you including me, but maybe this is not what you are intending,\" and you actually say that, you're giving them the benefit of the doubt of actually how they're trying to show up is different than how people are perceiving them. You can have a better conversation then around, \"Well, what can you do to change that perception?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:01):\nYou mentioned I see product managers, and this is a good segue too. You're a big deal, fancy chief product officer person. A lot of people listening to this podcast are early career PMs or trying to get into product. I want to ask a couple of questions along these lines. One is about getting into products. So, interestingly, you got into product the same way I got into product, which is you used to be an engineer and then you moved into product within a company, which is maybe one of the simplest ways to get into product potentially. For people that are trying to break into product management, what advice do you often give them of how they could go about doing it? I know there's never the silver bullet, but what's your advice?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:51:41):\nI definitely think doing it within the same company is a lot easier than trying to switch companies and switch jobs at the same time because when you're within a company, you've already built credibility, hopefully. And if you haven't, then go crush it at your job so you build the credibility. Then you can start to raise your hand, interact with the product team, take on projects and do things that allow you to get some experience and build a relationship with a leader on the product team who then may be willing to take a chance on you to put you into a product role even if you don't have the experience. Especially when you're within the same company, you bring other things to the table. Let's say you're working in customer support, well, you have a huge amount of knowledge about what are the big problems that people are calling up the support team or opening tickets on the support team for, and that is valuable knowledge for being a product manager.\n\n(00:52:33):\nYou're coming from the sales side, you're coming with a knowledge of how to sell the product, what really resonates, how do you do the objection handling, and that can be a valuable perspective. If you come from the engineering side, but you understand how the product is built and you understand that technical nuances of that well, that can also be a valuable way to enter into the product team. That way, even though you don't have the direct product experience, you're still bringing something to the table where you are going to have to get trained on core product management, but you're not going to have to be totally trained on the business or the technology.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:06):\nSo is the advice basically get a job in any function, not necessarily any function, but join a company however you can essentially and then push to try to get into the product team in some form?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:53:19):\nYeah, I think join a product adjacent function, which honestly pretty much every function is product adjacent, because what function does product not engage with, but as closely product adjacent as possible, and then yeah, find your way into the product world from there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:34):\nIdeally there's something within the company, there's some program I imagine that does this sort of thing. Some companies have something structured, some are just kind of ad hoc. Is there anything there you're just like should you talk about this in your interview just like, \"Hey, I would really love to become product manager someday.\" Do you have anything along those lines that would help me get into that or not? Or should you not talk?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:53:52):\nWell, I think it depends. For instance, when I joined LiveRamp, which was my previous company as a software engineer, I actually did say in the interview process I want to become a product manager I think. At that point I was still early in my career, I didn't know for sure, but I said that. Now that was a 20-person startup, so it was worth saying it because they didn't really have a product team and I wanted to put it out there that that was something I was interested in growing into.\n\n(00:54:17):\nIf you're joining a 5000-person company, you're hiring manager is probably not going to receive it well if you're like, \"Hey, I'm interviewing for product marketing, but really what I want to do is go into product.\" So, it just kind of depends on the company and the stage. You have to play that wisely. But I think once you're in a company, then finding a way to make a relationship with the product leader, or if you're in a startup that is really small and they don't have product management, well then you have the opportunity to take on projects for sure that are product management related because no one is doing that work. Really taking initiative to do that so that you can find an inroad into product management.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:57):\nKind of along these lines, you have a really unique perspective on new PMs because you teach product management at Stanford. You've been doing that for a while. I just want to ask you work with a lot of people that are new to product, thinking about getting into product, then get into product. What do you find are the things that new PMs or people getting into product most misunderstand about the role of PM or are most surprised by when they become product managers?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:55:23):\nWhen we interviewed students as we were designing the class about what they wanted to learn, what was most surprising to me was that students would say, \"Well, can you teach me how to use Figma? Can you teach me the tools that product managers are going to have to use?\" What was surprising me about that was I don't think it's the tools that you need to learn to be successful. I think what you need to learn to be successful is how to take very ambiguous situations and consistently drive more and more clarity over time. So, it was interesting to see this mismatch between what people said they wanted to learn and what I felt they actually needed to learn.\n\n(00:56:03):\nNow, having taught this class for a few years now, I think talking to students who have then left and become product managers, they've seen a lot of this in practice now and I think they understand that, but there is this mismatch of people who haven't been in product management saying they want to go and thinking that they need to learn some tools or process versus the mindset and the skills required to clarify ambiguity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:29):\nAlong those lines, I actually saw you somewhere in a talk or maybe something you wrote talk about how creating this class and creating the curriculum helped you crystallize your own thinking on product and helped you crystallize the mental models of becoming a product manager. Is there anything that you recall from that time of like here's something that's really helped me understand about this function and the skill as you were putting together the class?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:56:51):\nYeah, I know anytime you're teaching something, you have to figure out a way to synthesize it for another audience, and so many of us have learned product management just figuring it out on the job. I don't know if there's a particular framework that I would say came out of that, but what I found very interesting was seeing the questions that people asked in the class and then feeling like, \"Oh, I understand how to answer this question. I can provide an example for it.\" That was super interesting to me because I didn't expect that coming out of the conversation. Yes, there's frameworks we developed to talk about ideation and product discovery and all of that, but I think those are fairly flexible frameworks.\n\n(00:57:33):\nWhat was most enlightening was being able to crystallize the answers to some of these questions, whether it was about how do you interact as a PM effectively with engineering or what happens if the data shows you that it doesn't matter which direction you pick, like there's merits to both ways. How do you actually go about making those decisions? It was very interesting being able to then have those conversations with students and bring in the real life examples. And I found in some situations that actually go back to my own team and share the same answer that I came up with in class, I was like, \"Oh, this is actually a valuable thing to share with my team back at my company.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:15):\nReminds me of the recent chat I had with this guy Alex Komoroske, where he talked about how oftentimes talking with people helps them uncover new insights that he had in his head and then he writes them down as soon as he says something that's really clever in any way. He's like, \"Okay, I'm going to remember that now.\" Coming back to how to become a PM, so you see all these people getting and taking this class want to become product managers. I know they're like Stanford students and people more likely hire Stanford people. But I guess in terms of how they end up becoming PMs, if you were to look at the pie chart of the people that end up getting a PM job, what's the biggest chunk? Is it they join at some other function and then move into product? Do they just join as a junior PM somewhere? How are people actually getting into the PM role in that class?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:59:00):\nYeah, I think very few are directly going to an established company and becoming a PM directly, so I would say a big chunk of them. Some of them are, but many of those then had PM experience to begin with or had engineering experience and then went to a technical company into a PM role. The vast majority of them are joining product adjacent roles or they're going to small startups where they might be doing product management, might be the first product manager, or they might be doing product management plus plus, chief of staff, something like that where they get to put their hands in product management, but it's a super small company. So I think those have been the two most successful paths to get into product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):\nAwesome. That's a really interesting lens into how people actually get into this role. Potentially final question, but we'll see where it goes. I have this recurring segment on this podcast called AI Corner where I try to get a sense of just how people are finding AI tools useful in their work, in their life. So, let me just ask you, is there anything you've found useful in some AI tool in how you work? Like something you found that helps you work more productively, more efficiently, either you or people on your team?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:00:08):\nOne way that we're using AI today is summarizing our user research calls. So, that has been really valuable because we're doing all these calls all the time, we're getting a ton of rich insights. Some of those rich insights are related to the specific project that we were doing this call for and some of them aren't. And now we have that summarized and tagged in a way where you can look up any sort of thing that you want around the calls that we've done and it'll find you the call, it'll find you the context, it'll find you the transcript and summarize exactly what we've learned from that call. So we're starting to use that more and more. It's very powerful capability. I definitely think that that kind of summarization of information for PMs is a big unlock for organizations and I think we're still in the very, very early days of AI making a meaningful difference to the way that PMs do their work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:01):\nIs there a specific tool that you love to help you with that that you may want to give a shout-out to or is it something you guys built?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:01:07):\nYeah, we use Dovetail and it's been fantastic. Connects into all of the Zoom calls and everything, it does a great job with summarization, with search, everything.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:18):\nAwesome. I love it when someone recommends a very awesome sponsor of the podcast. Dovetail is ongoing and excellent sponsor, so I'm really happy to hear that. Amazing. Anneka, is there anything else that you thought you wanted to share or that you want to leave listeners with that you think might be helpful before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:01:38):\nThe mindset that you bring to your work is actually the most important thing over anything else that you can do. And if you are approaching every situation as much as possible with the positive mindset, you can do more than you could ever possibly hope to achieve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:56):\nI'm going to pull on this thread because this is such a powerful point and I think it's easy to just hear that. It's hard to learn to do it. Do you have any advice on just how to build that mindset? Like it connects to many of the things you said: how can this be fun? How can I be grateful to this person that's annoying me and the things that they might teach me? Is there just anything you've done that has helped you build this mindset?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:02:20):\nJournaling is very powerful. So actually growing up I journaled every single day of my life from when I was 13 to when I was 23. And while I cringe to go back to read any of those, I think what it helped me do and build a practice around that I still do today is when I have a lot of thoughts going through my head, especially negative thoughts, just putting them all down on a piece of paper, writing them on my phone and trying to explore why am I feeling this way? Why am I getting triggered? What is it about the situation that's making me feel so strongly?\n\n(01:02:56):\nAnd when I put it down on paper, then it takes this thing that's abstract and things that I'm ruminating on and actually makes it possible for me to break it down and understand, \"Well, okay, this is something I may feel, but the why behind it is a little irrational, so let me let this go.\" I realize that this isn't rational way to think about this. Whereas other things I start to uncover, well, what is it about the situation and what is it that I need to do differently? What's within my control and what is it maybe that I need to go talk to someone about and say, \"Hey, I need you to do this differently to be able to make myself feel better and make the situation better.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:34):\nIt's interesting this is another thread that's been coming up a bunch on the podcast recently that when something is bothering you or something is hard, the more you actually listen to that part of yourself and dive into it and explore it and give it a space to share and talk, the less power it gets and the more space is created for the stuff you actually want to take space. It's not what you would expect because usually it's like, \"No, shut up, everything's fine.\" But the more you actually hear that out, the easier things get. So, I love that you share that.\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:04:09):\nIt's like doing cognitive behavioral therapy on yourself. That's how I think of it. I've never actually done cognitive behavioral therapy, but I've read a lot about it and sometimes when I go through this, I'm asking myself the same questions that I think are asked in those settings.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:26):\nLove that. All right, Anneka, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:04:29):\nI think that's all I can think of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:04:35):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:36):\nAll right. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:04:41):\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz, such a great book, great again about mindset of how to approach hard things. Second is I'm a huge fantasy sci-fi fan, so I love Brandon Sanderson's books. I highly recommend those to people as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):\nAll I know about him is I saw videos of him after COVID where he just said, \"I wrote five new books during COVIID.\" I was like, \"what is going on?\"\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:05:03):\nHe is someone that is at the top of his craft and I admire people so much that are truly the elite in what they do, and he's truly the elite in what he does. He writes a lot about writing, he podcasts a lot about writing. It's pretty impressive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):\nAnd he writes fantasy books, is that right?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:05:18):\nHe writes fantasy, yep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:20):\nOkay, cool. It feels like a lot of books to read though. I'm just like, \"Oh, my God, so many books.\" Okay, great. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:05:31):\nAgain, on the fantasy sci-fi track, I really like Fallout, which is a dystopian show based on a post-apocalyptic, post-nuclear war world. It's very entertaining.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):\nYeah, it's just very quirky and fun.\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:05:45):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:46):\nAnd unexpected. Awesome. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:05:53):\nMy eight-foot iPhone charger. So I have a cord that's very long that allows me to move around the house and do stuff while my phone is charging because my phone is always running out of batteries. So, highly recommend getting a super long charging cord.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:10):\nI've got one of those and I know exactly what you mean. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work during life?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:06:18):\nI think it comes back to dealing with lots of different types of people. I really try to remind myself that everyone has something to teach and everyone has something to learn. I think that helps not only think about how you interact with other people, but also combat imposter syndrome because you have something to bring to the table and teach as well as anyone else, no matter what your age is, no matter what your background, and leaning into that and realizing that people can learn from you and you can learn from others in every single situation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:51):\nFinal question. I heard that you're a big fan of Isaac Asimov. Do you have a favorite Asimov book, one that you'd think if someone were to explore his canon, they might want to start with?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:07:01):\nI really like the Foundation series, so starting with that is really good. It's a very different style of writing. You kind of have to stick with it, but it's good, I promise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:11):\nAnd I'll build on that and say, \"Don't watch the show because the show is so different from the book series.\" I don't know if you've seen it and-\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:07:16):\nYes, I have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:17):\n... not nearly as good.\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:07:17):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:18):\nI was just like, what is going on? This is not the story.\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:07:20):\nYeah, very different.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:21):\nWhat are they doing? Amazing. Anneka, this has been amazing. We covered so much ground. I feel like this is going to help a lot of people. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to follow up on things, maybe ask you questions or just check out the stuff you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:07:38):\nYou can find me on LinkedIn, follow me, DM me. I would love to connect. The way you can help me is we're actually redesigning our Stanford class right now for PMs, and I would love to hear from you if you don't have any PM experience, what is it that you wish a class could teach you? And that would be super helpful for me as we're redesigning this class. Thanks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:59):\nAmazing. And the way they could share that is DM you on LinkedIn or Twitter?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:08:03):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:06):\nEasy. Amazing. Anneka, thank you so much for being here.\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:08:07):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:09):\nAbsolutely. My pleasure. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:08:13):\nThank you so much for listening.
