They don't care about you. They don't care about you. They care about their reader or their listener or their viewer. That's who they care about. That's who they're serving, and if you can be of use to them in sharing the kinds of information that they are looking to serve their audience, then you can get what you want. But you can't treat them like a service provider because they're not. And so you have to approach them with an understanding of what they're trying to do for their audience and how you can fit into that because if you don't, they are not interested in you.\n\nLenny (00:00:47):\nToday, my guest is Jason Feifer. Jason is editor in chief at Entrepreneur Magazine, previously an editor at Fast Company and a number of other magazines. He's also an author, podcast host, keynote speaker, and startup advisor. In our conversation, we get incredibly tactical about how to get press for your product. Jason shares how to pitch a journalist, how to find the right journalist to pitch, what publications to consider, why freelance writers are more likely to write about your story, why the mission of the publication is so important in how you pitch them, plus what channels to use to reach out to journalists, how to think about your goals and what success looks like from getting press, so much more.\n\n(00:01:25):\nI learned a ton from this conversation, and if you're looking to get press for your stuff, you'll find so much value here. With that, I bring you Jason Feifer after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career, and something that worked really well for me a few years ago, is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group.\n\n(00:02:05):\nWith Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together, we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey.

I actually joined Maui Nui Venison earlier this year after hearing their app on the Tim Ferriss Podcast, and I'm excited to be spreading the message further. Not only does this company provide the most nutrient-dense and protein-dense red meat available, their operation produces the only stress-free 100% wild harvested red meat on the market that is the only one of its kind in the world, actively managing Maui's invasive access, deer populations, helping to restore balanced, vulnerable ecosystems, food systems and communities in Hawaii.\n\n(00:03:33):\nAlso, it is seriously delicious. Not at all [inaudible 00:03:37] and easy to cook. My wife and I made stew and steaks and all kinds of grilled goodies with the meat. We also feel great about it as a protein from an ethical standpoint. I highly recommend trying their all-natural Venison jerky sticks for an optimal protein snack, as well as a wide variety of fresh cuts, all available in their online butcher shop.

Jason, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nJason Feifer (00:04:13):\nLenny. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:14):\nIt's absolutely my pleasure. We've actually collaborated on a couple of things recently, and as we were chatting about some stuff, I was asking for advice on how to help a startup I'm working with get press, and you shared a bunch of killer advice, and so I asked if you could just come on this podcast and share similar advice for how to help startups get press and here we are.\n\nJason Feifer (00:04:36):\nYeah, I'm really happy that you asked me to do that. This is something people ask me about a lot. I've been in media for decades. I've worked at a lot of different magazines. Obviously, I run Entrepreneur Magazine now, but I was a Fast Company. I was at Men's Health, so I've seen a lot of different sides of media, and it is a very misunderstood tool, particularly for people in business, and so I love demystifying it.\n\nLenny (00:05:00):\nAmazing. I'm excited to learn all this too, and so thanks for doing this.\n\nJason Feifer (00:05:04):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:05:04):\nFirst question is just, as someone in press, how much volume is there coming at you from startup founders and PR people trying to get you to write about them and also just reporters that you work with?\n\nJason Feifer (00:05:15):\nYeah, it's tremendous. It's ridiculous. I would say that by the time we are done recording this podcast, I'll have, I don't know. I mean, it could be anywhere from 30 to 50 pitches in my inbox. It comes all day. Now, to be clear, most of that is garbage in the real garbagey sense, right.\n\n(00:05:36):\nIt's a lot of completely unrelevant press releases that were sent to me and a bazillion other people. But within, there are definitely some people who have spent the time to reach out very specifically to me, and everybody in media gets some kind of volume like that. To reach out to somebody in media is to be shouting over a lot of noise.\n\nLenny (00:06:01):\nWow. I imagine we'll get to this later, but I'm curious just what percentage of those are PR people and press release versus a founder or someone that is doing it themselves?\n\nJason Feifer (00:06:12):\nThe percentage of direct messages from founders that I'm getting is low. I would say probably 20, 25%. And then the 75% is PR in some capacity, either targeted PR where somebody's intentionally reaching out to me or mass blast press releases.\n\nLenny (00:06:30):\nYou know what's crazy is I've been getting a lot of these now. People think I'm some kind of journalist, and they're just like embargoed announcement product launch.\n\nJason Feifer (00:06:37):\nIt doesn't take much because you just end up on some list, and what's really interesting, and we'll talk about PR later, I know. But one of the great insights that you can get into the challenges of that industry is how completely automated a lot of it is where a lot of people in PR are not thinking specifically about how to tell the right story to the right potential media outlet. Instead, what they're doing is they're just playing a numbers game, and they're just blasting it out to everybody.\n\n(00:07:13):\nAnd that means that you could end up... I write this newsletter, right. I have... Entrepreneur Magazine is the thing that people obviously would pitch, but then I have this newsletter where I don't interview anybody. There's no opportunity to be featured in my newsletter, and I still get pitches to the newsletter because somebody saw it and dropped it in some spreadsheet, and it just... now I get it. And I think that's a real disservice to entrepreneurs who are paying for people to do that, and I really hate that.\n\nLenny (00:07:41):\nYeah. Okay, so we're going to get into the meat of just how to actually do this well, but a couple more questions just to set a little context. One is in terms of impact. What kind of impact have you seen from getting press for a startup in terms of growth for their product specifically?\n\nJason Feifer (00:07:57):\nSo it's a really wide range. I have had entrepreneurs tell me that a single story in Entrepreneur Magazine, like the print magazine or just online, will drive more, whatever more app downloads, more sales that month than any of their paid marketing efforts.\n\n(00:08:16):\nBut then I have also heard entrepreneurs tell me that it didn't do anything for them or that it did one very specific thing for them, which is to say maybe some potential partner read it and reached out, and it started an interesting conversation. It's all over the gamut, and it's a really important thing for people to remember is that this is not something that I think that you should bank on as a strategy for growth. It's a great add-on. But if you think that press by itself is going to solve your problems, you're wrong because it might, but it's way too unpredictable.\n\nLenny (00:08:48):\nIs there anything else along those lines of just when it's worth somebody investing time into getting press, either stage of startup, type of startup, any just general broad advice of you should not be spending time on trying to get press versus this is a really good opportunity for you.\n\nJason Feifer (00:09:02):\nThink about press the same way that you think about raising money, which is to say you do it when you know what the money is for, and you should do it when you know what the press is for. A lot of people reach out to me at such an early stage that if we wrote about them, it wouldn't get them anything. They're not at a stage where they could use that press in any meaningful way, and so there's really no purpose in chasing it now. You should step back and think really as a starting point, \"What do I need press for?\" And if you have a good tactical answer to that, that could be because I need to drive awareness to a new product. That could be because I'm going out to raise money, and I need articles to show that the marketplace takes me seriously.\n\n(00:09:55):\nThese are good reasons, but I get a lot of emails. It's funny because people are... like entrepreneurs, in particular, they're just so vulnerable, and it's kind of a wonderful way sometimes. And sometimes people will just email me, and they'll just say, \"You know, I've worked really hard, and I just feel like I deserve this.\" I respect that, and I relate to it in some ways with my own trying to get attention for my own work. But, \"I deserve this\" that's not a good tactical decision for your business that doesn't do anything for you. And so I would put that to the side and only think of press as you don't go out and raise money if you don't know what the money is for. You shouldn't go out and try to get press if you don't know what the press is for.\n\nLenny (00:10:38):\nI'm curious to hear other examples when it's not, when it's a bad idea because, as like I said, an outside observer, I would always love to get more attention for my product and more people to be aware of it, more people to check it out. Is there an example or anything that comes to mind of there's no need for you to do that in this moment or for this product?\n\nJason Feifer (00:10:55):\nOftentimes, it's not even about the moment, but it's about the publication. So I'll give you an example. I spoke at an event once, and afterwards, this guy comes up to me, and he has a small hot dog food truck business in Washington, DC. So he said he's got a couple trucks, and he's doing good business selling hot dogs, and he wants coverage in Entrepreneur Magazine. He's like, \"Oh, how can I get a feature?\" And the problem with that instinct that he has is that he's really directing his energy in the wrong place because if he is selling hot dogs in Washington, DC, then I understand what press is for him. Press is to drive hotdog sales. That's what he wants to do. Entrepreneur is not going to do that for him. Full stop. Why? Because Entrepreneur reaches a national to international audience.\n\n(00:11:52):\nSo that means that 99.5% of the people who would read a story about this guy have no ability to go get his hotdogs, which means that that was wasted effort. So fine. Was it that hard to come up and talk to me at the conference? No. But scale that out. How many emails is he sending that are like that? How much energy is he putting into chasing things that ultimately don't have good direct value to him? What he needs to do is think, \"Okay, my goal, get more people to buy hot dogs. Where am I? I'm in Washington, DC. How can I reach people who are interested in food in my market?\" So stop chasing Entrepreneur and start chasing the local eater or the food section of the Washingtonian or something like that. That small shift can give you a lot more payoff for your effort.\n\nLenny (00:12:38):\nThis is a good segue to just let's just dive into how to actually go about getting press, and I know you-\n\nJason Feifer (00:12:38):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:12:42):\n... kind of have this three-step structure for thinking about it. Maybe just start with what are the three steps, and then we'll dive into each one.\n\nJason Feifer (00:12:50):\nYeah, sure. So I mean, look, it is pretty simple, right. Step one is prep. You want to be thinking about how to tell your story. You want to be thinking about the kinds of stuff I just talked about. What is press for for you? Everything that you need to do to orient yourself towards what is this opportunity, and why am I chasing it, and how to make the most of it. Step two is figuring out who to pitch. Not all press is created equal. There are not reasons to just go chasing everybody arbitrarily. The hotdog example is a good one.\n\n(00:13:19):\nSo finding the writers and editors who you're actually going to reach out to, who are going to most receptive to you. And also making sure that because you did the prep, you can figure out how to tell your story in a way that they're going to be interested in. We'll talk about that. And then step three is the actual pitch. What does it mean to reach out to these people, to engage the writers and editors? How do you find them? What do you send them? What are you telling them? That's it.\n\n(00:13:42):\nI mean, right. But what you need to understand is that you're entering a world that probably doesn't operate the way in which you think it does, and I see that all the time as the recipient of pitches. People don't understand who they're reaching out to and how I and my colleagues think. We should maybe even start with that because a really important thing to understand just again, to go to [inaudible 00:14:07]-\n\nLenny (00:14:07):\n[inaudible 00:14:07] do it. Yeah.\n\nJason Feifer (00:14:08):\n... yeah, the metaphor of the investors, you don't reach out to an investor if you don't understand what that investor does, what they're interested in, or what kinds of companies they invest in. You can't do that with media, either. So I get pitches every single day along the lines of, \"How do I get coverage in Entrepreneur Magazine? How do I get a feature in Entrepreneur Magazine?\" And to me, it always feels like they're ordering a hamburger from me. Like, \"How do I get a hamburger from Entrepreneur Hamburgers, right?\" They're treating me like a service provider. That my job is to provide press.\n\n(00:14:44):\nAnd I get it because, of course, if you're an entrepreneur, and you're looking for press, then the... [inaudible 00:14:51] writers and editors out there seem to be in the business of writing about people, and therefore, there's some service that they seem to provide, and you're trying to figure out how to get it. But that's not how the media thinks of themselves, right. The editor, the writer, I'll just say it as plainly as possible, they don't care about you. They don't care about you. They care about their reader, or their listener, or their viewer.\n\n(00:15:18):\nThat's who they care about. That's who they're serving. And if you can be of use to them in sharing the kinds of information that they are looking to serve their audience, then you can get what you want, but you can't treat them like a service provider because they're not. And so you have to approach them with an understanding of what they're trying to do for their audience and how you can fit into that. Because if you don't, they are not interested in you.\n\nLenny (00:15:49):\nI love that. And more... even specifically, what is it they're trying to do for their audience? I imagine it's just have something interesting that they want to read. Something they can learn. Something they're like, \"Wow, I'm really excited to read this.\"\n\nJason Feifer (00:16:00):\nYeah. But it's going to be more specific based on the mission of each publication. So, for example, I've worked at two separate business titles. I was a senior editor at Fast Company for a number of years, and now I'm the editor-in-chief of Entrepreneur Magazine. The decision that is made about whether or not a story belongs in a publication, it was totally different based on these two publications. So I can't speak to Fast Company now because they've gone through a couple of leadership changes. I don't know what their mission is, but back when I worked there under Bob Safian, he was the editor-in-chief, that was really a magazine about where businesses going, and the stories that were in the magazine were all supposed to be in some way representative of the evolution of business.\n\n(00:16:50):\nAnd so when people would pitch what we'd really be looking for are, are there insights into... in what this person is doing that other people could read and say, \"Aha, that helps me understand where this industry is going or that industry, or it helps me think about how I can shape my own company to match current trends,\" that kind of stuff. Entrepreneur, totally different mission. The way that I think of Entrepreneur is that it's not even a magazine about business. It's a magazine about thinking. Or what I want to do is make sure that everybody who comes to the magazine walks away with great insights into how to think through the challenges in their business.\n\n(00:17:29):\nAnd so what I'm looking for when somebody reaches out is did they make some interesting counterintuitive decision that solved a problem in their business, and I'll emphasize in. Because, oftentimes, when people hear me talk about solving problems in business, they think, \"Aha, but I solve a problem in business, right. I saw that there weren't the best razors in the world, and I made the best razors.\" That's not what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is... There's this woman whose name is Joelle Mertzel. She has a company called Kitchen Concepts Unlimited, and she makes a butter dish, and it's a really smart butter dish because it is built on a hinge, right. So this is designed to solve a very specific problem, which Lenny, I don't know if you knew this, I did not, that you don't need to refrigerate butter. Did you know that?\n\nLenny (00:18:18):\nI knew that intellectually, but I still refrigerate it. I know people don't.\n\nJason Feifer (00:18:22):\nMe too, even though I've had multiple conversations with this woman about this. You don't need to refrigerate butter, and if you leave it out, it cuts easier. It's more spreadable. Big problem, the butter dish. So most butter dishes you just lift up. And so if you have warm room temperature butter that's soft, and you lift the butter dish top up, you might bump into the butter, and it's going to make a big mess. So Joelle makes a butter dish on a hinge, right. Opens and closes exactly the same way every single time. No mess. Brilliant, solves a problem. She reaches out to me about this. This is not interesting to us, right. Maybe this is interesting for a cooking magazine, right. Maybe Bon Appétit is interested in this. Entrepreneur's not interested in this because that doesn't help other entrepreneurs to have thought through that problem.\n\n(00:19:13):\nBut then she tells me something else. What she tells me is that she is, at the very beginning of this, trying to figure out how to answer some basic questions about her audience, like what colors do they want in this butter dish and what price point are they willing to pay? And she wants to do some market research. She goes to a market research company. She says, \"How much would it cost to research consumers and answer these questions?\" They say, $10,000. She doesn't have $10,000. And then, one day, she's sitting at the airport waiting to board a flight, and she looks around and she realizes that airports are full of people who have absolutely nothing better to do than answer questions about butter dishes, right. Nothing better to do, just sitting there. And you could start at gate one. By the time you get to gate eight, everyone in gate one is new. You could do it all over again, and you could have a 6:00 PM flight, and you could show up at 9:00 AM. Nobody's going to stop you. You can do this all day in the airport. And this is how she starts to do her own market research. She saves that $10,000, and she does it herself. I put that story in the magazine. It's tiny. It's this tiny random company and this random decision. But the reason I did it is because every time I repeat that story to entrepreneurs, they're all like, \"Ugh, right, totally. There's always other ways to do things.\" They love the ingenuity of it. That's what I'm looking for. That's Entrepreneur's stories. So to go back to the point that you were making, it's not just about, \"Well, it's a magazine called Entrepreneur. They must write about entrepreneurs, right. I'm an entrepreneur. I belong in Entrepreneur.\"\n\n(00:20:41):\nPeople think that all the time. No. You have to step back and read what these publications are publishing and ask yourself, \"What are they doing? What is the purpose here?\" The editors and the writers, they're making decisions about what goes in this magazine, and they're making decisions about how the stories are constructed. Why are they doing that? Who are they trying to reach? When you start to see it through that lens, you start to see the pattern, and you get an understanding a real instruction manual for what it actually means to pitch these publications.\n\nLenny (00:21:13):\nThat is such an interesting insight. I had no idea that that was something you should be thinking about. Is there an easy way to understand the mission of the publication? Is there an about page they often add this to or is it, like you said, you just read a bunch of stuff and try to suss it out?\n\nJason Feifer (00:21:28):\nNobody publishes an about page in that way because the internal logic of the editorial team. But you can certainly make some starting assumptions based on who the publication is trying to reach. Everybody is trying to reach somebody. It gets more complicated the more general interest something becomes, right. What is the New York Times?\n\n(00:21:53):\nWhat is the mission? That's a hard thing to answer. You sort of have to divide it up into sections, right. The mission of the National News Desk is different from the mission of the Business Desk, and even within there, the mission of the Sunday business section is different from the mission of the Monday to Saturday business section.\n\nLenny (00:22:09):\n[inaudible 00:22:09].\n\nJason Feifer (00:22:09):\nSo you have to start to really parse it out. And this is the reason why people hire PR is because if they're good at their jobs, they understand a lot of this already. But I really do think that if you spent time with the content and your starting point is, \"I understand that this publication is trying to reach X. They're trying to reach these people,\" then you can start to see the patterns of what it is that they're doing. How are they telling stories? What do these five stories all have in common? They have something in common. There's something that they're all doing, and you can certainly read the tea leaves and try to figure it out.\n\nLenny (00:22:48):\nAwesome. Okay. It feels like we've already gone into step one around prep. What else is involved in preparing to get press?\n\nJason Feifer (00:22:57):\nIf we're talking about prep, the very first thing that you need to do is what I had said earlier, which is just ask yourself, what do I need press for? And you need a good answer to that question. And once you have that, the next thing you should do is you should start to think about, \"Well, what's interesting about my business? And oftentimes, it's not necessarily what you think, and you can be guided in a way by what's happening in step two, where you start to think about who you're trying to reach out to. Because, for example, the story that somebody might tell me at Entrepreneur is going to be different than the story that somebody might tell Cosmo.\n\n(00:23:42):\nThere's a reason for a company to end up in, both Entrepreneur and Cosmo, right. Maybe the product is for young women. And so, Cosmo might be interested in some kind of product feature or including the product in a roundup of some kind of products. Whereas Entrepreneur would do the entrepreneur-focused story. What did this founder do? How they do they write? You can take your... You could think about your story and kind of break it up into a whole bunch of different little pieces and then figure out which piece goes to what media. But oftentimes, people make the mistake of trying to do that in reverse, which is to say that they kind of decide what narrative they would like to have out in the world, and then they just go around to different publications trying to sell them on that. I get that all the time.\n\n(00:24:34):\nA lot of my pitches that I'll receive in my inbox are somebody who hasn't really thought at all about what Entrepreneur publishes but instead just has something that they would like to get out into the world. I mean, a good kind of dumb example is, yesterday, somebody sent me an email about a company that had just hired a new president. I don't care about that. That's not useful to my audience at all. I'm sure that there is a trade publication, right. Let's say that there was a company in the restaurant industry. I'm sure that a trade publication that follows the blow by blow by blow of a restaurant industry might be interested in your new president. But I'm not because you hiring that new president isn't useful to my audience. Stories in Entrepreneur are not really about the person that I'm writing about.\n\n(00:25:23):\nThey're really about the audience. They're really me serving the audience through the stories of the people I'm writing about. That's not useful. I wish that they had spent a moment and thought about that, but they didn't. So once you start to think about who it is that you're trying to reach, you can step back and say, \"Well, what part of my journey is going to be most relevant to them? And I would push you to be really, really creative about it. Because if you go back to the Butterie example, the butter dish, that little funny story about the airport, I mean, who else is writing about that? It's not central to her story as a brand. It's not central to her sales pitch. It was-\n\nJason Feifer (00:26:00):\n... central to her story as a brand, it's not central to her sales pitch. It was just for us. We were probably the only publication in the world who cared about that, but I really cared about it.\n\nLenny (00:26:11):\nAmazing. Okay, so just kind of summarizing what you shared, think about the goal. What are you trying to get out of press? Goals could be awareness of what we've done, something new, investor interest. What are some other common examples of goals that you see for trying to get press?\n\nJason Feifer (00:26:27):\nYeah, awareness of something new. But also doesn't have to be awareness of something new, it could just be continued growth, trying to reach into a new marketplace. That's fine. Anything that's tied to growth or reaching a new customer base-\n\nLenny (00:26:45):\nCool.\n\nJason Feifer (00:26:45):\n... would make sense.\n\nLenny (00:26:45):\nThat makes sense.\n\nJason Feifer (00:26:47):\nBut it could also be that you're looking to position yourself in your own marketplace a little differently. I see, for example, a lot of people, a lot of big companies, keep knocking on my door because we don't just hear from startups, we hear from major companies as well who are pitching stories. I know why they want to be an entrepreneur. They want to be an entrepreneur because they're trying to position their brand as also being relevant to small business owners. It's helpful to have that kind of context because coverage an entrepreneur can help them go out to the marketplace and say, \"Look, we're also reaching X, Y, Z people.\"\n\n(00:27:25):\nSo sometimes it's not even about a conversion, but rather it's about a positioning and that's a good reason to also maybe put forward your executives. Sometimes it's just about establishing your CEO or your founder as an authority in a particular area because you want them to be more trustworthy, you want them to be invited to more conferences. Because all of that stuff draws more attention to the company, all sorts of reasons to do this stuff. And then trying to get in front of investors, trying to get in front of partners. Look, there's a million reasons why being visible can be useful, but you need to make sure you understand what you're actually trying to do.\n\nLenny (00:28:07):\nOkay, awesome. That was really helpful. So think about what goal you have in mind for getting press, pick a publication and understand their mission and what their goals are. And then think about some interesting stories that you could pitch them. Not just like we have a new president, but something that you think they'd be excited to share that connects with their mission.\n\nJason Feifer (00:28:25):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:28:26):\nKind of on this topic, I know we want to talk about who to contact and how to figure out who to actually talk to. A couple of questions that come to mind. This is all a lot of work. Founders are really busy.\n\nJason Feifer (00:28:35):\nYeah, it's a lot.\n\nLenny (00:28:35):\nSo begs the question, PR agencies, do you have a perspective on would you recommend working with PR agency? Is there a time when it makes to and doesn't make sense to?\n\nJason Feifer (00:28:45):\nYeah, I mean it's a ton of work. Everything that I'm describing is a ton of work. And let me be clear, people succeed in getting press without doing any of the things that I'm describing because dumb luck happens in the world. You could very well just bang out an email to some random editor and they might like it. That is entirely possible. You could disregard everything that I've just said. What I'm really helping you do is try to optimize your approach. But yeah, hiring PR can cut out a lot of this. Now you're not doing this research yourself, you're not thinking through these challenges yourself. You're working with people who understand exactly how to identify the most interesting parts of your story and then turn them into good pitches. So why wouldn't everyone do that? The couple reasons. Number one, cost PR can be expensive, so you just have to factor that in. Number two, PR is and can be, I'll say can be, a very frustrating journey because a lot of PR people are very bad at their jobs. They're very bad.\n\n(00:29:52):\nAnd this isn't just me bashing PR people. I have literally been hired to give keynotes at PR industry conferences. And I get on stage and I say most PR people are bad at their jobs and everybody nods. And they all know it. And of course, none of them think that they're one of the bad ones, but they all know it. PR is full of people who are bad at their jobs. Why are they bad at their jobs? They're bad at their jobs because they're lazy, because they're primarily relying upon email blasts, just sending things out, because they have a older idea of what it means to get the word out. For example, if you hire or talk to a PR agency and one of the things that they recommend doing that you should spend money on is a press release, like a traditional press release, run as fast as you can away from that. I don't know if you know this. Do you know this? The press release, there are some purposeful reasons to put out a press release, but the press release is really no longer the primary unit of press attraction.\n\nLenny (00:31:07):\nYeah, I get that sense.\n\nJason Feifer (00:31:08):\nYeah. But here's what's fascinating. So a PR agency I wouldn't recommend might do this. They'll tell you, \"We're going to put together a press release about this new thing, so you have to pay a little extra money for the production of this press release and then also the distribution of this press release because what we're going to do is we're going to put it out on the wire,\" because there are a whole bunch of press release distribution wires. So they'll do that, you'll pay the money, it'll go out on the wire. And then they'll send you a report about all the places that this press release ended up on. It ended up on Yahoo Finance, it ended up on Market Watch. And it technically did. The press release is there, it was posted. And zero people are going to see it in the whole world because Yahoo Finance has a section where they just publish every damn press release that gets published by all these different distributors. Nobody saw that.\n\n(00:32:08):\nSo don't confuse posting press releases even on very big websites with actual success. What you want in an actual PR person is someone who traffics in one thing, and that is relationships. The most important thing that a PR person can have is active relationships with people in media. Why? If a PR person is guaranteeing you press, that's another reason to run out the door as fast as possible because the PR people cannot control this. Writers and editors, they do what they want. It's a completely subjective industry and very frustrating. I completely understand. That was totally subjective. So the best that a PR person can do is shape your story, understand who to pitch, and then get that writer or editor to look at it, to pay attention to it. There are some PR people in this world who I think very highly of. I think they're incredibly smart, incredibly good at what they do, and they only pitch me when they have something that they think I will genuinely be interested in. Instead of a lot of PR people who just send me some random thing every week or every day.\n\n(00:33:21):\nI don't pay attention to those people. But, I don't know, just shout out, when John Beer from Jack Taylor PR sends me ... John, I met him in a PR capacity a decade ago and we've since become friends. When he emails me, I pay attention. I don't write about it all the time. I'm not going to write about something just because I like John, but I will pay attention. And paying attention honestly is half the battle because people in media are getting so much email. So you want someone who's going to understand you, understand your industry, understand and know the people who they should be reaching out to, and who really respect you as an entrepreneur and are going to give you the hard feedback. Because there are a lot of people who will go and hire PR and they'll say, \"I want you to email this and this and this and this and this publication.\"\n\n(00:34:16):\nAnd if the PR person just does that, all they're doing is annoying their contacts if they don't really feel like this was meaningful. You should like when a PR person pushes back on you and says, \"You know what? I don't think that your story is right for that publication. Here's why.\" That's someone you should hire.\n\nLenny (00:34:34):\nIs there any other PR people you want to call out as ones that you think are awesome?\n\nJason Feifer (00:34:38):\nThe challenge here is that I'm going to regret not including a whole bunch of people who don't pop to mind immediately, but-\n\nLenny (00:34:44):\nWe can include them in the show notes, whoever else.\n\nJason Feifer (00:34:45):\nYeah, sure. Okay, so let's see. Off the top of my head, so John of Jack Taylor, he does a lot of wellness stuff. So PR agencies tend to specialize, and so you want to make sure that you're going with people who really understand you and the media ecosystem that you are reaching out to. So I think John's really smart. Let's see. Hannah Lee at Hannah Lee Communications is great on hospitality stuff. So restaurants, hotels, booze, they're really smart. Jen Sesquila, sorry Jen, if I mispronounced your name. Max Borges Agency, really good on sort of consumer focused products. Greg Delman, he's based in San Francisco, he has a boutique shop called G3 Media and he does a lot of tech startups stuff, just really knows that world. Greg, I'll find writers through Greg because he just knows everybody. I just texted him recently and I was like, \"I need somebody who can write about this very specific AI thing.\" He happened to be at TechCrunch Disrupt and he found some freelancer and connected us. That's great. So those are four. I will have more that'll give you for the show notes.\n\nLenny (00:35:55):\nAmazing. Okay. This is really useful. If any come to mind as we're chatting, feel free to shout them out again. Similar question, when people are thinking about publications to go after, say you're a startup founder. Is there a list you could just share of just like, here's probably the top five, 10 that you should be thinking about? The obvious ones, you talked about entrepreneur, [inaudible 00:36:15] Company, TechCrunch obviously comes to mind. Is there others that are just like, \"Here's a good list to start with?\"\n\nJason Feifer (00:36:19):\nHonestly, it really, so much depends upon what it is that you're looking to do. You could be a startup, founder and entrepreneur and Inc and Fast Company are for maybe some good reason not at the top of your list because you're a startup founder, but your goal right now is to reach consumers. And those publications don't reach consumers and they don't reach people who are in a buying mindset. They reach people who are in a creating mindset. So I would expect that if you have a startup and that startup is not B2B in some way, that it would be possibly very reasonable that business publications might not be your target right now. Maybe Men's Health is. Maybe, I don't know, anything could be. I think oftentimes people tend to think too close to them about where they belong. Lenny, here's a real kind of exchange that happens, which is if somebody will email me, I don't respond to every publicist.\n\n(00:37:23):\nIt's just literally not possible. I would not have enough time in the day. I do do my best to respond to every entrepreneur who reaches out because I feel like they deserve a response. And sometimes somebody will email me and they'll send me something and it's just not relevant. And I'll reply and I'll just say, \"Hey, thanks. Congratulations on what you've built. But this isn't a fit for entrepreneur.\" And maybe once a month somebody responds really in a testy way, and they're like, \"But don't you write about entrepreneurs? I'm a great entrepreneur success story.\" It's like, no, that's not what we do. Yes, entrepreneurs are featured in our stories, but no, we're not just a directory of entrepreneurs. Here's a good way of thinking about it. If you have a startup and you're trying to figure out what publications to be in, go look at where your competitors have been featured. That's a great place to start. What audiences are they reaching and how are they doing it? That should give you some direction about where you might want to go next.\n\nLenny (00:38:33):\nAwesome advice. On TechCrunch, do you have a perspective on is it worth investing in getting featured in TechCrunch?\n\nJason Feifer (00:38:40):\nI'll tell you a sort of personal press journey moment, and then I think that it will translate into the answer for TechCrunch.\n\nLenny (00:38:47):\nAmazing.\n\nJason Feifer (00:38:48):\nOkay. Something we haven't talked about so far yet is, and this is sort of almost skipping all the steps that we've laid out to what happens after you get the press. But the point of the press is sometimes to reach the people who are reading it. You get covered in Entrepreneur and entrepreneurs are going to read it and maybe something good will come of it. But sometimes the point of it is not to reach the people who are reading it at all. Possibly a very small number of people are going to read it, which by the way is a real, real possibility. Because although all of these publications that I have mentioned, Entrepreneur, Forbes, Fortune Inc, Fast Company, whatever, these are reaching millions of people, their websites get many, many, many millions of unique visitors each month. That does not mean that your story is going to be read by millions of people.\n\n(00:39:40):\nIn fact, the largest possibility here is that your story will reach five to 10,000 people, a small number of people because these publications are publishing tons of stuff. So you might get this story, it might look awesome, it might not reach that many people. That might also be okay. Because maybe the reason in your logic for why to get that kind of coverage is not to have reached that publication's audience at all anyway. Maybe what it really is is to tweet it and then put some money behind promoting that tweet because then you can target that you got coverage to the people who you want to notice you got coverage.\n\n(00:40:21):\nAnd I see a lot of people do that. They'll take articles that we ran on Entrepreneur and they'll basically turn them into advertisements. And that's really smart because what they got out of Entrepreneur was the social cachet. It was the validation in the marketplace. And then they're going to do something with that themselves. That's really smart. You also see it sometimes the reason to get coverage, it's just so you can put it on your website. As seen in. As seen in is probably more valuable than anyone actually reading that story to begin with. They probably won't read the story. You might not even have to link it on the website. But you could just get to say as seen in. Because again, it gives you that validation.\n\n(00:40:56):\nMe personally, I am building a small podcast company with my friend Nicole Lapin. Nicole Lapin is a bestselling business money expert. And we have a company, she's the founder and I'm an advisor. And it's called Money News Network. We have a podcast on it called Help Wanted that we co-host together. And we got coverage in Variety. And that was the result of pounding on a lot of doors and finally getting someone at Variety to take interest and they ran an article about us. Did we get anything from that story in Variety? The answer is no, like nothing. But you better believe that every email we send out to every potential advertiser, to every partner, includes the link. Variety has covered us. And I guarantee that when someone receives that email, it makes them pay more attention.\n\n(00:41:52):\nAnd I have used it many times too when I reach out to people. It just gives you that validation. So sometimes what you're looking for is a prize to walk around with. And I would bet that the same is true for TechCrunch, which was your original question. Why get the funding announcement in TechCrunch? Probably not because anyone's going to care because they read it on TechCrunch, but now you can use that to your own means. And sometimes that's more valuable than the press itself.\n\nLenny (00:42:16):\nThat is an awesome insight. It also makes you realize you may not feel like it was a success after spending all this time getting in a story and entrepreneurs. Like, oh, nothing happened. But the benefits may come later, like weeks, months, years later when you start to share that.\n\nJason Feifer (00:42:30):\nExactly right. A lot of this is what you make of it.\n\nLenny (00:42:32):\nAmazing. Okay. That was extremely interesting. Okay, let's talk about step two. So initially you prepped, we talked about how to think about who to go after and the mission and goals. Then you get to step two, which just figure out who to reach out to at a publication.\n\nJason Feifer (00:42:47):\nRight. So a lot of people make the mistake of emailing me. If they want coverage in Entrepreneur, they email me. And I understand why they're emailing me. It's really for two reasons. One, I'm the most visible editorial person at Entrepreneur. And so it's easy to find me, it's easy to find my email address. And also they just assume, well, editor in chief, making all the decisions. But no. I mean, think about it. If you have a problem with a purchase that you made on Amazon, you don't email Bezos. He's too busy. And I am not comparing myself to Bezos. But I am the busiest editorial guy at Entrepreneur for whatever the hell that's worth. And I'm just not the guy to pitch because my job actually isn't really to select stories that go in the magazine. My job is to work with editors who develop their own ideas and then I get to say, \"Oh, that's a good one,\" or, \"Oh, let's refine that.\" I'm not sourcing as much. And so you really should start by looking at who's writing about your subject area.\n\n(00:43:57):\nAnd you can do that by going to the website and surfing around. You can do that by Googling around. But you'll find the answer. Every publication is structured differently. Some people have specific beats. Some publications will be like, \"This is the person on the transportation beat.\" And some publications don't. Entrepreneur doesn't really have a beat system necessarily. But if you look, you'll figure it out. \"Oh, that editor is clearly interested in food. That writer is clearly interested in food. They seem to write all the food stories.\" And a good way, again, to do it is to start with the publication and then look at how they're covering your competitors. So a good example is I was once consulting with a guy who has a kind of fun peanut butter company. It's like imagine peanut butter meets Ben and Jerry's, so it's like peanut butter with lots of stuff and fun names. And so he's trying to figure out how to get press. And originally his thinking, the reason why he reached out to me was because he's like, \"Well, I'm an entrepreneur. I run a business. I should be in Entrepreneur.\"\n\n(00:45:05):\nI was like, \"No, no, no, you shouldn't because none of our readers are going to buy your peanut butter. So who is your target audience? Who's buying your stuff?\" And he says, \"Millennial moms.\" I said, \"Great. Okay, so Cosmo is a good place to reach them. So let's look at how Cosmo covers snacks.\" I don't know how they cover snacks. I don't read Cosmo, but let's find out. It's not hard. I went to cosmopolitan.com, searched for snacks. What I found immediately was a lot of stories that are all basically roundup-y and anchored to some time-sensitive things. So it's 10 snacks for Valentine's Day, it's our 10 favorite new fall snacks, whatever. It's all stuff like that. So now we know they are not going to run a thousand word feature on your peanut butter company. Instead, the best that you could hope to do is get into one of these seasonal-ish roundups.\n\n(00:45:59):\nSo now next step, who's writing these things? Let's look. Let's open some of the articles. The byline is right there. You can click on the byline. You can see what this person does. And in many cases, maybe they're the food editor, maybe they're the lifestyle editor, whatever. You'll see what they cover. And you'll have a good understanding of now how to frame the thing that you're looking for. Now, let me introduce one other possible option. They don't work for the publication at all. They're a freelancer. Publications use a lot of freelancers. Freelancers are basically independent contractors. They're writers who are working sometimes. Sometimes they have longer term deals with publications. Sometimes it's just one-off. My wife is a freelancer. My wife is a freelancer who writes a lot for the New York Times and Washington Post and Guardian. And the interesting thing about my wife versus me is that my wife, whose name is Jen Miller, just so I don't keep saying my wife.\n\n(00:46:58):\nSo Jen, on a day-to-day basis as a freelancer is hungrier for stories than me because Jen has to hustle for her food. Jen has to find stories and pitch those stories to editors at publications, and that's when she gets paid. So she actually is more incentivized to be looking for stories than I am because I am a salaried employee of Entrepreneur Magazine. And my email address is very easily found and people just send me stuff all the time. And I should add here also, note that a good journalist, a good writer is not actually sitting around thinking that their job is to wait for people to pitch them so that they can just write about the best pitches. Their job as they see it, is to go and find the most useful things for their audience. And they like to do a lot of that themselves. So they're not sitting around just waiting for your pitches. And in fact, your pitches have to overcome their instinct to go find things themselves.\n\n(00:48:02):\nSo Jen is constantly hustling. Jen is constantly talking to people. Jen is curious about the world and will spend a lot of time hunting things down. But if somebody reads a story that she wrote and says, \"Ah, I think I have an idea of what this person is interested in,\" and then tracks her email address down and then emails her, Jen is getting a lot fewer pitches than me, the chances of her reading it are close to a hundred percent. And the chances of her taking it seriously if it's relevant to any of the publications that she writes for is much higher than me. So sometimes going to the staff person is not actually your best move. Finding the freelancer who's doing the work is sometimes the better move.\n\nLenny (00:48:43):\nSo many interesting tactical insights that you're sharing. I love it. With this freelancer tip, how do you know they're freelancers? Is there something in the byline?\n\nJason Feifer (00:48:51):\nIf you find them on the publication's website so let's say that you go to Cosmo and you click on a author's bio. If they're staff, it'll say staff. If they're not staff, it'll probably say something else. It might say writer, it might say contributor. It might say Jen Miller is a writer in Brooklyn, New York. But also you can just go one extra step and just Google their name because any smart freelancer has a portfolio website where they should be very easily found.\n\nLenny (00:49:22):\nAwesome.\n\nJason Feifer (00:49:23):\nSo sometimes just take their name, plug it into Google, you'll very quickly figure out who they are.\n\nLenny (00:49:28):\nOkay, so let me summarize things that you've taught us so far. One is think about publications that go to people that will buy your thing. So in your example, Cosmo is a good example of someone who would buy this peanut butter thing. Two is don't think of it broad thing. Think about the writer at the thing. So it's not like Cosmo would write about this. It's like, who specifically at Cosmo would write about this? And we find that as go to their site, search for, you talked about search for your competitors, but I think it's even broader, just things related to your area, right? [inaudible 00:50:01].\n\nJason Feifer (00:50:01):\nYeahs, that;s good point. Search for your category.\n\nLenny (00:50:04):\nEven adjacent things probably are close enough. And then this tip about freelancers is really great, that they're hungrier and that they're more likely to respond to your pitch versus someone that's working there. And then also this point that they're like, their assumption is this is not a good pitch and they don't want your pitch. But freelancers have a higher chance of being interested and will pay attention.\n\nJason Feifer (00:50:25):\nYeah, freelancers got to eat.\n\nLenny (00:50:28):\nAmazing. Is there anything else along this step of finding somebody at a publication that you want to share?\n\nJason Feifer (00:50:36):\nWell, the next step is going to be how to actually reach out to them and pitch. So at this stage, I think that we've fairly well covered it. And I love your summary. And just to double click on part of that, the reason why you're doing a lot of this is not just for the crazy busy work of it. But it's because you have to understand that the media ... Just sort of go back to translating the media. The media, which is a phrase that is used in all sorts of different ways, is a pretty bad way of actually understanding the media because the \"media\" makes it feel like it's a unified entity. In politics, the media will be criticized as a sort of multiple publications colluding together in some way. But the way that we're talking about it is just as organizations that you're trying to reach out to.\n\n(00:51:25):\nBut really and truly, these are just publishing companies made up of individuals. And those individuals are all making fairly subjective decisions about what it is that they're going to write about. And there are layers of approval that they have to pass through. So nothing makes it into the print magazine, for example, without me saying yes. But I'm also trusting my editors to be passionate about the ideas that they're finding and convince me of yes. And so the thing that you are really looking to do is to find the way-\n\nJason Feifer (00:52:00):\nThe thing that you are really looking to do is to find the way in to a publication. Because nothing gets covered until a single individual at a publication takes interest in you enough that they go to somebody else and say, \"I think that this would be a good story,\" and that other person says yes.\n\n(00:52:17):\nSo you have to find your way in. Because media is not a coordinated effort. It's a bunch of people showing up every day trying to figure out how to make the best thing for their audience.\n\nLenny (00:52:27):\nAmazing. Okay, so that's a great segue to final piece, which is actually, get someone excited and write about you.\n\nJason Feifer (00:52:33):\nSo how do we do that?\n\nLenny (00:52:33):\nHow do we do that?\n\nJason Feifer (00:52:36):\nThis is where the rubber hits the road, okay? So things not to do, don't call them, if you track down their phone number. Which is a real thing that happens. People call my personal cell phone number.\n\nLenny (00:52:48):\nOh, wow.\n\nJason Feifer (00:52:48):\nIt doesn't happen often, but it happens. And I don't even know where they get it from. But I don't like it.\n\n(00:52:53):\nAnd media people are torn on whether or not DMs by social are an okay way to reach out. I find them kind of annoying. Because, number one, the format doesn't lend itself very well, right? If you write anything wrong in a DM, it just looks like this endless thing that I got.\n\n(00:53:13):\nBut also, I don't know, my Instagram DMs, I just kind of don't think of as the place to be pitched. But other people don't care. So I don't know, you can roll the dice on that.\n\n(00:53:21):\nEmail is just the most traditional way. If you know somebody's going to be speaking at a conference, that's great, come up, you can talk to them. But the question of course is, what are you sending them? And here's what you're sending them.\n\n(00:53:34):\nYou're really sending them the product of the work that you have done in the previous two steps. Because you have now spent some time thinking about your story, and who you're pitching, and the publication, and how they're telling stories to their audience.\n\n(00:53:51):\nAnd then the individual person who you're reaching out to, who you now have some sense of how they write about this. And you're taking all of that, and you're trying to distill it down into a presentation that they're going to find appealing.\n\n(00:54:02):\nWhich again, to go back to the thing about how press is not that dissimilar to going out and raising money, that's kind of what you're doing when you go and meet an investor too.\n\n(00:54:12):\nIf you have meetings with 10 investors, the way in which you talk about yourself and the company should not be exactly the same with those 10 investors, because they're all going to have somewhat different approaches and different thesis.\n\n(00:54:25):\nAnd you're not trying to scam anybody, but you're just trying to be as customized as possible by building in your knowledge of what it is that they do, and what their firm does. And the same is true for media.\n\n(00:54:35):\nSo all of this is really going to take the form, in its most traditional sense, of a short email. A short email pitch. And what does that look like? I mean, look, there is literally no magic answer to that. I wish that there was, but there is not. There's no format. People always ask me, what should the subject line of the email be?\n\n(00:55:00):\nThat's is a good question. There's not one answer to that. The closest that I can give you to an answer is that, picture me. Picture me at my computer. I have a lot going on, and I'm glancing at my email, and 40 new emails are sitting there. And my instinct is to delete all of them as fast as possible, but I'm going to glance at each one.\n\n(00:55:23):\nI'm not going to open each one, but I'm going to glance at it, which means that I see the subject line and I see the preview text, or just the first thing that somebody had written. What you want to do is write something that makes it pretty clear to me that this is targeted to me. That's step number one.\n\n(00:55:40):\nBecause most of those emails that I got in my inbox are not targeted to me. They're mass blasts, and I'm delete, delete, delete, delete, delete. So which is the one that actually is reaching me? And sometimes you can do that by referencing something that I wrote in the past. I see people do that a lot. Don't fake it. People fake it all the time. People email me and they tell me they're fans of my work, they've never read my work. It's very obvious, right? Don't do that. But if you've read something, or if you're familiar with something, if you're familiar with the publication in some way, any signals of that are good.\n\n(00:56:15):\nBecause again, what you're trying to do is just separate yourself from noise to, this is customized to you. Because If you think about it, this is really an efficiency question. What I'm trying to do is, I'm trying to spend my time on the things that have the highest percentage chance of being relevant to me. And I'm filtering out the things that seem not relevant to me, who are wasting my time.\n\n(00:56:41):\nSo if I see something where somebody's writing me and they have a sense of the publication and they have a sense of me, there's a higher percentage chance that the next things that they're going to tell me are going to be relevant to me. Maybe even turn into a story.\n\n(00:56:53):\nWhich is great. I like when that happens. Because it saves me time, frankly, right? It's one less story I have to find myself. So I'm happy for it, but it's got to be right. So you want to structure ... And then the email that you're writing is don't go on forever, like three paragraphs max.\n\n(00:57:09):\nAnd you are telling the version, you're not writing an article, but you're telling me the thing that you are pretty sure I'm going to be interested in. It's the difference between, going back to the butter dish example, woman sending me a three paragraph email about the butter dish itself, and opening up, telling me a little bit about the butter dish, and then immediately moving into this very clever story about the product market testing survey.\n\n(00:57:43):\nThat's the difference. She told me the story that was going to be relevant to my audience. She got there quickly, and it felt like, to me, this is a interesting human being with an interesting entrepreneurial story to tell, and that's why I'm going to engage.\n\nLenny (00:57:57):\nSo that story actually came through a cold email?\n\nJason Feifer (00:58:00):\nThat was a cold email. Yep. Just showed up one day.\n\nLenny (00:58:02):\nAmazing.\n\n(00:58:04):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments.\n\n(00:58:18):\nWherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential. But there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools, or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.\n\n(00:58:30):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform, where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.\n\n(00:58:49):\nEppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics, and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's get Eppo.com, and 10X your experiment velocity.\n\n(00:59:11):\nIs there any other examples that come to mind, of someone doing this well? For people to have more kind of examples of here's...\n\nJason Feifer (00:59:17):\nOh sure. Well here, let's see. We'll have to do this in real time here. But I keep in my inbox a folder called Bad PR Pitches and a folder called Good PR Pitches. We can go through both.\n\nLenny (00:59:28):\nLet's do it.\n\nJason Feifer (00:59:29):\nAll right, I just pulled this up. This is, and I haven't read this in a long time. I'm kind of trying to read ahead as I'm talking just to see if this is appropriate to read. But I think so. I don't know, whatever. We're just going to read it and see what happens.\n\n(00:59:42):\nAll right, so the subject of this was, \"Idea for entrepreneur and Problem Solvers, how the Border Closures grew my business.\" So this was sent to me in September of 2020.\n\nLenny (00:59:54):\nAnd this is a good or a bad?\n\nJason Feifer (00:59:56):\nThis is good, this is good. This turned into an episode of a podcast that I do for Entrepreneur, and I might've also then converted it into an article I can't remember.\n\nLenny (01:00:06):\nAwesome.\n\nJason Feifer (01:00:08):\nAnd so here's what she did. So her name, I shout her out. So this is Meg O'Hara. And Meg O'Hara is a painter, a Canadian landscape painter. Which again, a small business.\n\n(01:00:21):\nAnd she writes, \"Hi Jason, I have an idea for a story I think would be valuable and relevant to you, Entrepreneur Magazine and the Problem Solvers Podcast.\" That's the show I do for Entrepreneur. And then she says, \"Here's what's going on with my business. All entrepreneurs had to be flexible during Covid. This is a story about how one artist in Canada benefited from the border closure.\" This just sort of intrigues me. Oh, how?\n\n(01:00:42):\n\"When Covid hit in March, all ski resorts across North America shut down early. Skiers are a high earning demographic in Canada. They fall in the top 5% of income.\"\n\n(01:00:53):\nOkay, well anyway. So she goes on. What she tells me, I remember this now, what she tells me is that her business used to be being hired by ski resorts to come and paint landscapes for their facilities. And when the border shut down and people weren't going to these resorts anymore, she had to come up with a completely different way of doing her business.\n\n(01:01:15):\nAnd so she started to think, well, I can't work for these resorts anymore. They're not hiring me. But all these skiers who used to work at the resorts who have seen my work, or who used to ski at the resorts who were maybe familiar with my work, they're not skiing either. They probably are sitting around wishing that they were skiing. They'd love something to see of their favorite ski location, and they also have money sitting around because they're not spending it on the ski resorts.\n\n(01:01:39):\nSo then she lists off the problems and the solutions in bullet points. Which I love. Because she has listened to the show, the Problem Solvers Show, which is structured in exactly that way. Tell me the problem, tell me the solution that you came to. So she lists it off.\n\n(01:01:53):\nHere are the problems: the skiers can't come, people are spending more time at home.\n\n(01:01:56):\nThe solution: I create artwork for their homes that depicts their favorite views from skiing as they were. She goes on and on and on.\n\n(01:02:03):\nI read this and I just think, there is something here about what this person did to reinvent their business at a time in which one marketplace shut down, but it created a new one that I think people would like to hear. Because at that time everyone was thinking about how to reinvent themselves and their business.\n\n(01:02:21):\nAnd even though I reach people who have very complex and large businesses, sometimes it's really a beautiful thing to hear a single individual who does the simplest thing in the world, which is put paint to canvas, talk about how she did it for herself. Because you can extract these wonderful little lessons about how to reinvent yourself that I think are going to be relevant to a very broad audience.\n\n(01:02:44):\nSo Meg sent me that email, I replied and I said, \"I like it.\" And we did it. So that's a good example of someone who spent time understanding my work, down to the structure of how I'm communicating, and then sent me a pitch that very quickly and clearly seemed customized to me, and told me her story in a way that I could imagine telling my audience.\n\n(01:03:12):\nAt that point, it's a pretty easy yes,\n\nLenny (01:03:14):\nThat is an amazing example. I just took some notes on things that she did right based on things you've shared in the past.\n\n(01:03:19):\nEven just from the subject line or the first sentence, it was clear that she knew you. She knew you had this podcast, she knew the magazine, and she even expressed this specifically, you're going to be interested in this. She mentioned how this, she has a story. She starts immediately with a story. There's not the value prop of the company, here's what we do and here's why we're awesome. And then the lessons, the mission of Entrepreneur you talked about, is insights and lessons that people achieve, and she just went straight to here's what we've learned.\n\nJason Feifer (01:03:49):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (01:03:50):\nSo I could see why that resonated.\n\nJason Feifer (01:03:51):\nYeah, it was great. And the next thing that made it a real success, by the way for her, was that once I got her on the phone, she was, and I find this, this is a make or break thing for me. Because I can talk to somebody and then kill the story, or not run the podcast. She was willing to be open about challenges.\n\n(01:04:17):\nI mean, she had reached out because of challenges, but not everyone is. I will get a pitch from someone who is presenting like, oh, we had this challenge in the business. But then when I talk to them, they act as if there was no problem. Or the problem was really small and their ingenuity immediately made this a very successful business. And that's not interesting to me.\n\n(01:04:42):\nBecause success stories are not interesting. They're not interesting to anybody. It's not useful for you to just hear that someone else succeeded. What's useful is for you to hear how someone else faced challenges that you faced. And got through them so that you can see. Aha, that's an interesting strategy to use for me.\n\n(01:05:01):\nI hate success stories. I love problem solving stories. And that's why when I talk to an entrepreneur, I expect them to be really open about that stuff. And if they're not, I basically lose interest.\n\nLenny (01:05:13):\nThe hero's journey. I'd love to hear another example. But before that, hearing this, obviously it takes a bunch of time to do this for a founder. I guess, two questions. Just, how many places should somebody probably try to reach out to give them a chance of being successful? And then do you have any thoughts on how much time they should put into something like this? I know it's a very broad question. But, any thoughts there?\n\nJason Feifer (01:05:35):\nYeah, it's a really broad question. So again, this is in some way why, in a large way, why a lot of people hire PR. Because PR can just move this along. They can reach a lot of people very fast, whereas you as an individual cannot.\n\n(01:05:51):\nOne way to think about it is, you're going to be on the hunt. You're going to try to make this work, and you're going to take a couple bets and hope that some of them pay off.\n\n(01:06:01):\nAnother way of thinking about it is, this is a passive activity. And I'll spend some time when I'm reading media, thinking about this, kind of developing an idea. Another thing that you can do, follow a bunch of writers and editors on social media.\n\n(01:06:20):\nMeg, I can't remember the order of operations here, because I know that Meg follows me on Instagram now, because she's DMd me many times. And I respond to everybody. I can't remember if she followed me before, but she might've. And maybe she even DMd me a few times. Usually it's somebody's responding to an Instagram story or something.\n\n(01:06:38):\nAnd I've seen a lot of people use this strategy with me, and I think that it's a really smart one. Which is basically, before you ever pitch, just get me to recognize your name. Just engage in social media in a very casual way, such that when you email me, I think, do I know who that person is? Meg O'Hara, I think I know who that person is. It just makes it more likely that I'll open the email.\n\n(01:07:08):\nAnd I see a lot of people do that. They'll spend a long time engaging with me on social media before ever pitching me. I know what they're doing, I understand that it's probably calculated. I still like it. It's smart. Because it means that by the time that they've reached out, I think you have a pretty good sense of my work. Which means that what you're bringing to me is probably in pretty good faith. And for that, I like it. It's a good filter.\n\n(01:07:36):\nSo if you've been listening to this whole thing, and you're thinking, this is a tremendous amount of work, I have a new product launch, or I have a bunch of budget that I can spend on this, this individual kind of approach, it may not be for you. You might want to just spend a bunch of time instead interviewing different PR firms. And find the one that seems most aligned with and understands your story, and your vision, and knows people in your space shortcuts a lot of this.\n\n(01:08:06):\nBut even then, even then, I think that having heard this is really useful. Because at some point, if the PR person is successful, you are going to get on the phone with the writer or editor. And it's very useful to understand how they think. That they're not there to serve you. That this isn't a service that they're providing you.\n\n(01:08:27):\nSo you better understand what they're entering into this with, and what they have in mind. When they're asking you questions, they're asking questions, thinking, this is what my audience is going to be curious about. This is how I'm going to drive this person in this interview towards the kinds of insights that my audience are going to find gratifying.\n\n(01:08:44):\nSo the more that you understand who you're dealing with, the better.\n\nLenny (01:08:48):\nAnd also just having done it yourself, you'll better understand what to ask your folks, how they're going to work, find opportunities to improve the way they're operating. On that question of quantity, say you're doing this, say you're spending the time. I'm going to really invest in understanding Jason and whoever else.\n\n(01:09:05):\nIs there a rule of thumb you'd recommend? Try to do this for three publications to get one, or is it five? I don't know. Is there anything there that you could recommend?\n\nJason Feifer (01:09:14):\nSo it's really dependent upon how easy you are to write about. I may just sort of note, if you are some kind of B2B service, especially in some kind of very niche or wonky space, it's going to be really hard for you to get [inaudible 01:09:40]. So hard that it might actually not even be worth trying. Because there are other things that you can do, or things that we haven't even talked about yet.\n\n(01:09:46):\nYou could say, you know what? Screw it. I'm not going to try to get coverage for my company. Why don't I just try to position myself as an expert? Right? It's a totally different kind of approach. Where instead, what you're maybe trying to do is just hook onto the news, try to get a quote or a perspective to a reporter who might be writing about something. I get these all the time.\n\n(01:10:07):\nSomething breaks, some news breaks, and people start reaching out to me. And they'll say, \"This just happened in the news. And my client,\" or sometimes just the individual, \"I have this insight into this, and here's what I would say if you want to interview me.\"\n\n(01:10:22):\nIt's not going to be a feature about you, You're not going to be the subject, there's no photo of you. You might get a quote. You might get a quote in a story. Which again, is all you need to be able to say as featured in on your website. So that's the reason why people do that.\n\n(01:10:33):\nSo sometimes it's about that. Sometimes it's about you could just be a writer. You might try to just pitch authoritative articles by you to different publications. Get yourself out in that way. Sometimes, again, you're not going to be able to be easily written about. And sometimes you are. Sometimes you made some insane technology that everyone's going to be talking about, and it's going to be super easy for you to get press.\n\n(01:10:56):\nAt which point your hit rate is going to be much higher. That's why going into this with really realistic expectations, and if you're going to work with PR, having PR who can set and hold you to those realistic expectations, can just save you a lot of heartache.\n\nLenny (01:11:12):\nAlong the same lines, there's always this idea of exclusivity and people want to write first about a thing. Say you talked about an awesome technology. Do you have advice on, do you just pitch the same thing to all of them and hope they all write about it? Do you pitch them different stories? Do you offer one an exclusive, any advice there?\n\nJason Feifer (01:11:29):\nEveryone has a different approach to this. The number one rule here is just, don't do it in a way that the people in media feel like you're playing them. Because they won't have tolerance for it. I would rather walk away from something like this than do some funny dance with somebody.\n\n(01:11:48):\nSo my favorite version of this goes like this. Actually, there's a founder who recently, I met him years ago. So when he reached out, I recognized the name immediately. And he reached out and he's like, hey, we did this really interesting thing and we haven't told anybody about it yet. And I'd love to see if it's a fit for entrepreneurs.\n\n(01:12:10):\nSo I hop on the phone with him, and he tells me. And I'm not going to tell you what it's yet because we haven't run the story. But after 15, 20 minutes, I say, yeah, you know what? This is a really interesting story.\n\n(01:12:20):\nAnd frankly, I know other media outlets are going to be interested in this too, particularly because a finance element to it. So I think the Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg, and those kinds of places are going to be interested in this.\n\n(01:12:32):\nHe wants to go to Entrepreneur for whatever reasons he wants. I mean, I think probably two. Because number one, he wants to position himself towards that audience. And then number two, there's a trust factor. He knows me in a way that he doesn't know the editors over there. And so he feels like I'll probably treat the story more carefully.\n\n(01:12:49):\nSo we worked out a deal, which he proposed. And the deal is that we'll get the exclusive, and there's going to be a three-hour window after our story runs, and then they're going to start responding to everyone else. And then they're going to start talking to other people, or maybe they'll even line it up and reach out to some other media.\n\n(01:13:10):\nAnd that's fine with me. I understand. And we're going to create a little embargo window. And we'll go first, and then they're going to talk to everybody else.\n\n(01:13:21):\nSometimes you can offer an exclusive to someone in that you are going to release the news to everybody, but only one media outlet is going to get the interview. Which works really well if you have a big personality.\n\n(01:13:35):\nSo for example, recently a company that Mark Cuban has invested in offered us that, right? They're like, we have this news. We're going to reach out, we're going to send the news everywhere, but we're going to give you the exclusive interview with Mark Cuban. He's going to do one interview and he'll do it with you. You can parse it out in any way. You just want everyone to feel like you're being upfront with them.\n\nLenny (01:13:57):\nAnd that they're getting something special, as much as possible. That makes sense.\n\n(01:14:02):\nYou touched on this relationship piece, and that's something I wanted to ask. It feels like in tech, a lot of reporters end up writing a negative story, because a lot of times that's what people want to read. Why is this destroying the world?\n\n(01:14:14):\nI actually had a fast company do a thing on me, and I talked to the reporter, and I had no idea. Was he going to just completely tear me apart, or is he going to be really friendly and positive over what I'm doing? And I have no idea, and it just comes out.\n\n(01:14:24):\nIt's not like I look at it before it comes out. So do you have any just advice to give you a set, help if this is going to turn into something positive or negative? I know you have no idea\n\nJason Feifer (01:14:34):\nWhat happened, by the way? Was it positive or negative?\n\nLenny (01:14:35):\nSuper-positive.\n\nJason Feifer (01:14:35):\nGreat.\n\nLenny (01:14:37):\nI was very happy with it, yeah.\n\nJason Feifer (01:14:38):\nOkay, good, good. I'm glad to hear that.\n\n(01:14:40):\nSo part of it is the publication itself, right? Entrepreneur, and I would say Fast Company, are just sort of not in the business of running negative stories. And the reason is, it doesn't serve our audience. My audience is coming to me to learn things for their business. Tearing somebody apart just doesn't help them in any way.\n\n(01:14:59):\nSo part of it is just what ecosystem are you dealing with? You can also look at the past work of the writer. And if you work with a PR person, it's funny because occasionally somebody has accidentally forwarded this to me, and I'll see the dossier that a PR agency will put together on me.\n\n(01:15:17):\nBut a PR agency, if they set you up with an interview with someone, they'll usually do some digging. And they'll find, what does this person usually write about? What kind of stories do they do? What are they generally interested in? So you can have a sense, right? What kind kind of thing are they doing?\n\n(01:15:33):\nAnd past that, there's also a question of, well, what are you doing in the world, right? I mean, if there is something somewhat controversial about you, and especially if you're engaging with an outlet that is interested in that kind of stuff, there's a halfway-decent chance they're at least going to explore it with you, and ask you about it. And if you're weird and cagey with them, they're going to think that there's more to it, and they're going to start digging more.\n\n(01:16:03):\nBut the ultimate answer here is that every part of this, and this has come through, I'm sure, in our whole conversation, every part of this process is really out of your control. Does somebody pay attention to you? What do they write about you? When do they write about? All of it is outside of your control,\n\n(01:16:23):\nWhich again, is the reason why it's not smart to think about press as a primary strategy for driving growth. It's a good add-on, but these people are going to do what they're going to do. And the best you can do is read the tea leaves.\n\nLenny (01:16:37):\nYeah. It was a very weird ... I don't get press often, it's not like something I pursue. But it was just like, this is wild. I'm just going to talk to this guy, and then something will come out. I have no idea what it might be.\n\n(01:16:46):\nHe might have things wrong, because I didn't get a chance to review, and might skew things. But it's a strange experience to go through. But it all worked out great.\n\nJason Feifer (01:16:55):\nYeah, it is. It's very strange.\n\n(01:16:58):\nIt is, it's strange. And I find that people often don't ... In business, people understand the structure of what's happening. They understand that we're a business magazine, we're going to write a story about a business. It's going to take a certain form.\n\n(01:17:14):\nBut I've done a lot of different writing, and I have had the experience many times over my career where I will spend a lot of time with people, and they will have really no understanding of what it is that I'm doing at all. They can't conceptualize it.\n\n(01:17:30):\nAnd then the story will come out and then they'll always reach out to me and they'll be like, oh, now I finally understand what you were even trying to do. It's fascinating.\n\n(01:17:40):\nIt is a vulnerable experience, and you have to know that. And the more you try to control it, the more the reporter is going to be annoyed at you. And the more, in fact, the reporter might try to take a shot at you in the story as a result. Because they found you too controlling, because they felt like you...\n\nJason Feifer (01:18:01):\nThey found you too controlling because they felt like you had something to hide. This is not a comfortable thing. You have to go into this being vulnerable and you have to know that there's a chance that it could blow up in your face. That's the price that you're paying for reaching their audience.\n\nLenny (01:18:19):\nGreat advice. How about we do just one more example of an awesome email pitch that you got and then we get to our very exciting lightning round.\n\nJason Feifer (01:18:26):\nI'll tell you about a pitch. I don't know that I have it in my inbox still, do I? No, it's not there, sadly. I'll just tell you about it.\n\nLenny (01:18:32):\nYeah.\n\nJason Feifer (01:18:33):\nIi leads to something that is another way of thinking about getting press, which I think is really important for people to remember. So far, Lenny, we've spent the majority of our time talking about press in the form of some kind of feature on you, writing about you or including you in some kind of prominent way in a story that's basically highlighting the thing that you wanted to get out there, your product or something about your business, something. Then we talked a little bit about another way of doing it, which is sort of putting you out as an expert in authority. There's another way of thinking about this, which is that you can either create or present context in which you just happen to be a part.\n\n(01:19:18):\nHere's the story pitch that I got that leads into this. This is years and years and years ago. I had just started at Entrepreneur. I hear from a guy named Fred Ruckel. Fred Ruckel has got a cat toy and it's called the Ripple Rug. It's basically, imagine a rug and then another rug kind on top of it, but ill-suited. The rug is lumpy, there's a lot of lumps in and there are holes. This is for a cat to kind of crawl in and out these spaces and bat and do whatever cats do. I don't know. I don't know a cat. He wanted to tell me about the sales of this Ripple Rug and about how the sales are skyrocketing and all the things that he thought made it special. It's made out of recycled bottles and whatever the stuff, made in the USA, all cool stuff, but not relevant to me because we're not cat toy monthly and we're not reaching a whole bunch of cat owners, not that I know of.\n\n(01:20:16):\nI replied and I said, what I usually say, \"Congratulations on what you've built, but it's just not a fit for coverage.\" Now Fred stumbled his way into this, but he did really a very smart thing because what he responded with was he said, \"Totally understand. If you're ever interested in learning about a gigantic scam that's happening on Amazon and eBay that we've been caught up in, let me know.\" I was like, \"Oh, well, yeah, I guess I am interested in hearing about that.\" I said, \"Tell me more.\" He sent me this long email. Fred loves long emails, and I got him on the phone and had him explain, and finally I understood it.\n\n(01:20:53):\nThis is, and maybe people are familiar with this, but this is sort of known as Amazon to eBay arbitrage. Basically the idea here is that Fred is selling his Ripple Rug on Amazon, or at least he was then, I don't know if he still is, but he's selling his Ripple Rug on Amazon. There are a lot of people who are copying the listing for his Ripple Rug and making their own postings for it on eBay. They sell it for a slightly higher price. Let's say that, and again, I'm making these up, but let's say the Fred is selling his Ripple Rug for $30 on Amazon, so somebody will sell it for $40 on eBay. Then somebody buys it on eBay, they find it, they buy it on eBay, they pay $40, that person gets $40, takes $30 of it, goes to Amazon, buys the Ripple Rug, and then just has it shipped to the buyer. It's arbitrage.\n\n(01:21:47):\nYou might think, \"Well, why would Fred care about this? He still gets the sale.\" The reason he caress about this is because the Ripple Rug shows up at the customer's house and it shows up in a Amazon box, even though they bought it on eBay. They think, \"Why did that happen?\" Then the next thing they do is they go to Amazon and they discover that it's cheaper on Amazon and now they feel ripped off. Who do they feel like they got ripped off by? Fred, because they don't know about the arbitrage. They don't know that they exist.\n\n(01:22:21):\nThis person who has at this point opened the cat toy and probably had their cat roll around in it, now shoves the whole thing back in a box and returns it and Fred gets dinged and that's why he doesn't like this. He has tried and tried and tried to get Amazon and eBay to stop this, but he said, \"Nobody seems to care and all these small businesses are losing tons of money on returns because of this.\" I had never heard of this. I thought it was fascinating. It's like a problem small business owners are dealing with. I was like, \"Fred, do you know other people who are dealing with this?\" He's like, \"Yeah, I talk to them on the line all the time.\" He sends me off.\n\n(01:22:54):\nI reported this whole thing out. I wrote this three 4,000 word story on this thing, and Fred was the main character because he was the way to understand this problem. I did all the reporting and I contacted the platforms and I contacted the people who make the arbitrage software. I did a whole report, but Fred got his press because sometimes, and here's the lesson, sometimes you are not the story, but you can be part of the story. Sometimes that means if Fred stumbled into it, but I get plenty of people who've reach out and maybe they have a real estate startup and there's something really interesting happening in the real estate space and they reach out and they tell me about this really interesting thing that's happening in the real estate space and the role that they happen to play in it. Now I think, \"Oh, well that's interesting. Maybe there's a story about that.\"\n\n(01:23:46):\nMy wife, the freelancer, Jen Miller, she's done this many times where she once did this story about there was a bunch of startups that were all related to helping people prepare for death in some way or another. She's not going to write about one of them, but when somebody reached out and said, \"Hey, here's a trend happening and we are one of them.\" Well, great, that's an interesting story. She wrote that and the company that reached out to her got kind of prominent billing because they were the ones who reached out. You know Barbara Corcoran from Shark Tank?\n\nLenny (01:24:14):\nI think so. I think so.\n\nJason Feifer (01:24:15):\nYeah. She's been a regular Shark Tank since the very beginning.\n\nLenny (01:24:19):\nMm-hmm.\n\nJason Feifer (01:24:21):\nShe made her fortune by building a real estate company called Corcoran, realtors, buy and sell property. The way in which she built this company is fascinating. Barbara, before she was Barbara Corcoran of Corcoran Realty, Barbara Corcoran was random New York City realtor Barbara from New Jersey. She was trying to figure out a way to distinguish herself from the masses. She came up with an idea which was to take her own sales data, the only window she has into the Manhattan real estate market at that time is what she is what her clients are buying and selling, which she's facilitating. She has that data, is going up or down relative to last year. She puts all this data together in what she calls the Corcoran Report, and she starts sending the Corcoran Report out to the New York Times and the New York Post and whatever.\n\n(01:25:18):\nBecause nobody else at the time was putting together a report on the health of the Manhattan real estate market, everyone started reporting on the Corcoran Report as if it was an authoritative thing. It's produced by Barbara Corcoran, which immediately put her in the position of being an authority in this space. That was so smart, and I see it happen all the time.\n\n(01:25:37):\nMy inbox will also be filled with, for example, a company that specializes in remote work consulting. Especially remote work consulting, you can hire them, it's a B2B service. It's hard to get press for that, here's what they do. They pay a surveying firm to find all sorts of things. The top states for remote work, the top companies for remote work, the top whatever for remote work. They produce all these surveys and they send the surveys out. The surveys get covered because now they're creating a piece of news. They're creating some context in which they just happen to live in. Hard to write about them, this random company, but you write about the survey, that's interesting stuff. Oh, it turns out that Utah is the top, I don't know if that's true, is the top state for, that's something that people will write about. You're giving people things to write about. Then once they do that, you are a part of the story. I get those pitches all the time. I occasionally bite on them and Fred from Ripple Rug got himself a big feature as a result.\n\nLenny (01:26:38):\nThat's an amazing other strategy. I imagine if I was a founder, I'd be like, \"Hmm, what trends can I think about that I can tap into?\"\n\nJason Feifer (01:26:44):\nYeah. Sometimes you have it in your own data. If you have a lot of data, you might, Zapier. Zapier is a great example. I get a pitch from Zapier every single year about the fastest growing business apps of the year based on Zapier data because they see what people are using and they just compile that together into a top 10 list and people run it. It's very smart.\n\nLenny (01:27:09):\nAmazing. We've gone through all three steps. Is there anything else that you wanted to touch on that we haven't touched on? Anything else that you think would be really valuable for founders or product leaders trying to get press that we haven't already shared?\n\nJason Feifer (01:27:23):\nThis has come up in different ways, but I'll just put a point on it as a maybe final way of thinking about this. Be human, be human. Press releases don't work because they're not human. I don't like interviewing people who are on talking points because that's not human. You're ultimately engaging in a human business. A subjective decision is being made about how to serve an audience of humans. There's no right or wrong. There's no way to know. Media is a sort of barely data-driven industry because every story is kind of different. It's like it's hard. It's hard to optimize the product because the product changes every minute. You're dealing with humans and the more that you can be human in every step of this process, when you pitch, write a human email, don't write a thing that looks like it came off of some marketing copy. Write a human email to another human and then when that person engages with you, be very human with them.\n\n(01:28:26):\nI mean, Lenny, the reason why that fast company reporter liked you, I am very sure was because when they got on the phone with you, you were just like a normal nice guy. If you presented yourself differently because you just wanted to frame yourself in some way or you felt protective or something or whatever it was, the reporter would've thought, \"This guy is a dick,\" and he would've written a totally different story.\n\nLenny (01:28:53):\nMm-hmm.\n\nJason Feifer (01:28:54):\nBe as human as you can and you will be dealing with a human who will receive that.\n\nLenny (01:28:59):\nAmazing advice. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.\n\nJason Feifer (01:29:04):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:29:05):\nAre you ready?\n\nJason Feifer (01:29:06):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny (01:29:07):\nLet's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJason Feifer (01:29:12):\nAndrew Chen's, The Cold Start Problem has come up over and over again for me because they're just really great lessons about network effects. I've been having a lot of conversations about anxiety and perfectionism with entrepreneurs lately, and a book by a psychotherapist named Katherine Morgan Schafler called The Perfectionist's Guide to Losing Control, is, I think, just a really great read.\n\nLenny (01:29:34):\nSuper cool. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nJason Feifer (01:29:38):\nMovie? I don't get to see a lot of movies these days. I have two little kids, but I took my eight-year old to see the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which was great and a really nice way of, I loved them as a kid, and so it was cool to see the modern version. Then my wife and I just finished Better Call Saul like years late, but it was just perfect.\n\nLenny (01:29:56):\nI haven't watched that series yet. I loved Breaking Bad.\n\nJason Feifer (01:29:59):\nOh, it's worth it. You got to.\n\nLenny (01:30:01):\nOkay. Another series I got to get started on.\n\nJason Feifer (01:30:03):\nI know it's too much, too much television.\n\nLenny (01:30:05):\nI usually ask this next question too, like product leaders and growth people, but I'm curious what the answer for you would be is. Do you have a favorite interview question you like to ask people you're interviewing? Usually it's about people you're hiring.\n\nJason Feifer (01:30:16):\nInterviewing a job candidate?\n\nLenny (01:30:16):\nYeah, that's the ideal, but take it either way.\n\nJason Feifer (01:30:19):\nI'll take it a little bit different because we've been talking about press. This is a really great strategy for interviewing people, and I'm going to tell it to you because I think that it's also good in any other context, and it might be a thing that somebody will do to you in an interview. My favorite strategy for interviewing people is to throw a theory at them, and I don't mean a theory of the world. I mean that maybe 10 minutes in after they have told me a couple different things and answer some different questions, I'll make a connection in my head and I'll say, \"I want to run a theory by you. Do you think that the reason why you are really interested in this or you made that decision is actually because of this other thing that you told me a little bit about?\"\n\n(01:30:59):\nYou're listening. It's really active listening, and you're combining things together into some theory. The reason why the theory works so well is because it forces people to think in real time in front of you. I like that because I often interview people who have been interviewed a million times before. I interview Jimmy Fallon and The Rock and whatever. They've been interviewed a million times before, so how do you get them to think in front of you? The answer is to ask them the thing that they haven't been asked. What I love about the theory is that it shows them that you're really listening and you're trying to understand them. \"It's so interesting that you did that. I wonder if it's because of,\" X, Y, Z thing. That gets them to react in a really earnest honest way.\n\n(01:31:49):\nI would say for what it's worth, as a job candidate tactic, it's not that bad either. My favorite job interview that I ever did as a candidate that I didn't even get the job was years and years ago, I interviewed for a job at New York Magazine. I interviewed with Adam Moss, who is not there anymore, but he was the legendary editor in chief. He made me, on the spot, drill down specifically into an idea. He was like, \"What's your favorite section in Strategists,\" which is one of the sections of magazine. I was like, \"I really like the real estate section.\" He's like, \"All right, what would be a good neighborhood that we should feature in the real estate section?\" I was like, \"Oh, I don't know,\" I named a neighborhood. He's like, \"What would be three good elements of that?\" He just kept pushing me, drill down, drill down, drill down. There was no right or wrong answer. He just wanted to see how I thought. I found that to be incredibly powerful, and I do a version of that when I interview people.\n\nLenny (01:32:48):\nAwesome. I love that. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nJason Feifer (01:32:54):\nI use BIGVU, I don't even know how to pronounce it, BIGVU, B-I-G-V-U, all the time. It's a teleprompter app. I spent like $150 buying an actual teleprompter because I make a lot of video and that teleprompter is, it's actually for people who are just listening to this, I'm pointing at another desk across my room where it's sitting there and I've never used it. The reason is because then I discovered BIGVU, which is just a app that runs a teleprompter very close to the camera, either in horizontal or vertical mode. I've tested it out in a million different ways, and it really works like you're reading it and it really looks like you're looking directly at the camera. I love it. It has saved me so much time.\n\nLenny (01:33:33):\nThat is cool. You basically put your phone on your screen next to the camera or wherever your camera is?\n\nJason Feifer (01:33:39):\nNo, no, no. This would be for if you're recording, if you're recording on the phone.\n\nLenny (01:33:44):\nGot it. You're staring at the phone and it's telling you what to say. I get it.\n\nJason Feifer (01:33:44):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:33:44):\nThat's awesome.\n\nJason Feifer (01:33:47):\nYou write a script and then you just import the script and then you choose the speed and you can fuss with it, how many words per minute, and then it'll run the text very close to where the camera lens is.\n\nLenny (01:34:01):\nAmazing. All right.\n\nJason Feifer (01:34:02):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:34:02):\nI'm going to check that out. What is a favorite life motto that you'd like to repeat yourself, share with friends, something that comes up a lot,\n\nJason Feifer (01:34:10):\nSomething that I've been repeating a lot to people is something that I heard, so I recommended Katherine's book, The Perfectionist Guide to Losing Control. I met Katherine because I, we've since become friends, but I interviewed her for the podcast when her book came out. We were talking about feeling overworked and being stretched too thin, and she gave me this question, which I think about almost daily, and I repeat to people all the time, and that is, \"What's the point of building something if you can't maintain it?\" I love that question because I, like probably everyone listening to this, pushes themselves really hard, and at some point you have to step back and think, \"Am I building something where at some point there is sustainability for me here, or is this unsustainable and what's the point of building something if you can't maintain it?\" It's a great reminder for why you're building something and how you have to build it.\n\nLenny (01:35:03):\nI have a very similar quote that my sister's partner once said that has stuck with me forever, which is, \"Life is maintenance. Basically everything that you buy or bring into your life, you have to maintain.\"\n\nJason Feifer (01:35:16):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:35:17):\nWe got a new air conditioner. Now, we have a guy that comes every year to check it. You got a generator, someone's got to check that thing all the time. We got a toy, now I got to think about where does it go and do we throw it away? Do we keep it? Everything that you bring into your life, you have to maintain basically for the rest.\n\nJason Feifer (01:35:17):\nYeah, it's really true.\n\nLenny (01:35:33):\nYeah, so it's really, I think specifically for work, it's like you start a new project, you're going to have to-\n\nJason Feifer (01:35:39):\nYou're going to have to maintain it.\n\nLenny (01:35:40):\n... maintain it, like this podcast, right? It's like, do you want to start a podcast and do it forever?\n\nJason Feifer (01:35:45):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:35:46):\nThat's a part of it. Part starting something is you have to maintain it.\n\nJason Feifer (01:35:49):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:35:49):\nYeah.\n\nJason Feifer (01:35:50):\nI know we're in the lightning round and we've defied the logic of lightning rounds, but I'll just add one other thing to that, which is that I interviewed Michelle Pfeiffer for the cover of the magazine, and one of the things that I thought was most fascinating was that she started this fragrance company, and it's called Henry Rose. She said the major difference between making movies and building a company that she found, was that when you make a movie, all the work happens in the beginning. You make the movie and then the movie is out, and then you are done. You don't have to work on the movie ever again. She was not really mentally prepared for a company being the exact opposite, that the launch of the company is actually the start of the work and there's an endlessness to it. She said that it took her a solid year to adapt to that reality, and then it became fun. I think it's the thing people forget.\n\nLenny (01:36:42):\nMm-hmm, Well, that story, it's cool that you got to interview Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nJason Feifer (01:36:45):\nYeah, she's great.\n\nLenny (01:36:46):\nFinal question. I was reading your profile line and you said that the only reason you were able to achieve what you've achieved in life and got to where you're today is something that you called the opportunity set B.\n\nJason Feifer (01:36:57):\nOh, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:36:58):\nCan you just explain what that is and why that is so important to you?\n\nJason Feifer (01:37:02):\nOh, yeah, sure. In front of you right now, you, Lenny, you everyone listening, watching, there are two sets of opportunities. Opportunity set A and opportunity set B, opportunity set A is everything that's asks of you. If you have a job, it's what your boss expects of you. If you have your own company, it's what everybody expects of you. Doing good at those things is really important. That's a measurement of success. That's opportunity set A, everything that's asked of you. Then there's opportunity set B and opportunity set B is what's available to you, even though nobody's asking you to do it. That could be, again, if you have a job, that could be taking on new responsibilities or joining a new team or something. Personally, it could be pursuing a hobby. It could be starting a podcast because you like listening to podcasts, anything.\n\n(01:38:01):\nWhat I have found throughout my own career is that opportunity set B is always more important, infinitely more important. The thing is that if you only focus on opportunity set A, then you are only qualified to do the things that you're already doing. Opportunity set B is where growth happens and where you push yourself in different directions. I found a long time ago that it was just really helpful to think about these two things. Oftentimes, maybe we don't do opportunity set B because we don't know how it's going to pay off, or we don't know where we're going to find the time. I have always found, always, that engaging in these things of what is available to me, what's available to me right now around me, and nobody's asking me to do, leads to the next growth either because it turns into an actual opportunity or because it informs some future opportunity.\n\n(01:38:58):\nI got to Entrepreneur Magazine, zero, zero people, when I became editor in chief, zero people said, \"You should hit the speaking circuit. You should get really good at being interviewed on podcasts. You should write a book.\" Nobody said any of that. My job was to make a good magazine and direct the editorial of the brand, but all those things were available to me, and once I recognized that, I realized that I can pursue them and in doing so, also think differently about who I am. Am I a magazine editor? Not really anymore. That's one of the things that I do now. I think of myself as an entrepreneur, as a person who is now in the business of helping others. I'm an entrepreneur who helps entrepreneurs. That's what I think of myself as. I only got there because I was thinking, I am here and therefore I can get there. Nobody's ever going to ask me to do it. I have to do it myself. It's the thing that I always think about, and it's the thing that keeps me up at night. What am I doing now that is leading me to something else? I'm the only one who can figure it out.\n\nLenny (01:39:59):\nBeautiful. It reminds me of a recent podcast guest's advice, which is the best way to track your progress in your career and in life too is just measuring how many, \"Oh shit\" moments you have because those are the moments where you're growing, you're doing something. I think maybe it's an example of an opportunity set B where it wasn't the default path that's like, \"oh, I think I should do this, even though it's really hard.\"\n\nJason Feifer (01:40:20):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:40:22):\nWhat a beautiful way to end it. Jason, not only do I want to start working on press, it feels like very achievable to get press now. That was really energizing, like, \"Holy shit, I could do this. I could just find some people, pitch them. Here's how I do it.\"\n\nJason Feifer (01:40:33):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:40:34):\nNot only that, I'm going to look for some opportunities set B routes for myself too. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe pitch you on their story? How can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJason Feifer (01:40:47):\nOh, so Lenny, thanks for all the work you do, which I just really love, and for creating the space for me to share all this insight. How can you find me? Well, I'll offer two things. An opportunity set B, like a good launching point for both of them, I wrote a book, it's called Build for Tomorrow. It is meant for anybody who's going through any kind of change in their lives or their work. There's an audiobook version that I read myself, but also hardcover and eBooks, just find it wherever you get books. Again, it's Build for Tomorrow. Opportunity set B, that whole thing, is actually a chapter in the book, so I go into a lot more detail there.\n\n(01:41:20):\nThen if you want to get in touch and also get those kinds of things, I have a newsletter, which is called One Thing Better each week. One way to improve your work and build a career or company that you love. Again, the kind of opportunities set B, that's the kind of thing that I put out. It's very much about the personal and emotional side of work. You can find that by going to the web address onethingbetter, that's one, O-N-E, onethingbetter.email. Just plug that in. Onethingbetter.email. I said that's a good way to reach out to me because if you get the newsletter and you reply to it, it goes to my inbox. I guarantee I will write back to you.\n\nLenny (01:41:56):\nInside track. Jason, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nJason Feifer (01:42:01):\nOh, thanks Lenny. This was so fun.\n\nLenny (01:42:03):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:42:05):\nThank you so much for listening.

Hopefully, I don't come off as encouraging everyone to be like me. I'm not saying that at all. What I'm saying is, this is a way to be. It's an alternative to what you're often hearing in our industry, which is, \"Go big or go home. Raise a bunch of money and get huge, and unicorn status,\" and the whole thing. That's a way. Just know though that basically almost nobody makes it that way. Really, almost nobody really makes it that way, and there's a lot more room to make it, and to build a successful business, if you throw out that outlier and look at all the other places you can land as a business.\n\nLenny (00:00:49):\nToday, my guest is Jason Fried. Jason is the Co-Founder and CEO of 37signals, which makes Basecamp and HEY, and soon a few more products including a competitor to Slack. 37signals is a very different type of company. They have no investors, no board. They have no plans to go public. They never want to sell their business. They've made a profit for 24 years in a row. They have over 100,000 customers and make tens of millions of dollars in profit each year, which most VC-backed companies never make a dollar of. All of this profit filters down to the founders and employees because they have no investors. Most founders, by default, will go down the venture route raising money from VCs and Angels. For many types of companies, that is necessary. But it's also important to know that there is a different option available, and it can be much more fulfilling and fun, and even much more lucrative, by bootstrapping your idea.\n\n(00:01:43):\nIn my conversation with Jason, we get into why constraints like small teams and less cash often lead to better outcomes. Why gut and instinct is underappreciated as a decision-making tool. Why planning long-term is often a mistake. Why work doesn't have to feel like war. Why we should focus on playing infinite games. When it makes sense to consider raising venture capital versus bootstrapping. How to actually bootstrap your startup, so much more. Jason is fascinating, and he's got a lot of wisdom to share. I'm excited to be able to bring you this conversation. With that, I bring you Jason Fried, after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:20):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates. Within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback. Essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.\n\n(00:02:58):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets, and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location, regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups.

One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career, and something that worked really well for me a few years ago, is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback.\n\n(00:04:15):\nEveryone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today? Jump the growing waitlist of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting Sidebar.com/Lenny to learn more. That's Sidebar.com/ Lenny.\n\n(00:04:59):\nJason, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nJason Fried (00:05:03):\nThanks, Lenny. It's good to be here.\n\nLenny (00:05:04):\nIt's really good to have you on. I have this new segment on the podcast that I call Contrarian Corner, and I have this feeling like this entire episode is going to be Contrarian Corner. I'm excited to dig into all kinds of stuff. I have so many questions I want to ask you. I thought it'd be good to just start with giving people who aren't that familiar with your story and 37signals, a sense of just how successful the business has been. I think people don't quite get the business you've built, and the scale you've built. So whatever you can share in terms of customers, profits, anything you are comfortable sharing, I'd love to give people... Especially things that might surprise people, just a sense of like, \"Wow, this business is not what I imagined.\"\n\nJason Fried (00:05:44):\nWe don't talk about things that don't really matter so much, like revenues don't really matter 'cause you can go broke generating a lot of money. But, we talk about profits. Historically, let's say over the past 10 years or so, we've been profitable every year for 24 years. But let's say over the last 10 years, we've been doing double-digit million dollar profits on an annual basis, which is really nice. We have about a 100,000 plus paying customers, so that's a rough number, and we've about currently 75 or so employees.\n\n(00:06:12):\nSo, a relatively small business in terms of the number of people who work here, big customer base, big profits, and that's how we like to keep it, and that's something that we've always focused on, versus a lot of these other metrics that I hear a lot, and usually there's acronyms attached to them, and of don't even know what they are, and I don't really care about them so much. We just want to make more money than we spend, have good healthy margins which allow us to experiment, and play, and not be afraid to do things that may not work, and just enjoy ourselves. So that's what we've been doing for almost 25 years. Next year will be our 25th year in business.\n\nLenny (00:06:47):\nJust following the same thread, the bet that companies are making, obviously going down the venture route, they're going to lose money for a long time so that they can make much, much more money in the future. So the idea there is, grow as fast as possible, as big as possible, and then we'll make money. You're a big advocate of not raising venture and bootstrapping. So what's your advice to founders for when raising money makes sense? I actually wrote this article, one's called, Your Startup Is Probably Not Venture-Scale, just trying to convince people, you may have a really good idea, but it doesn't mean it's a venture-scale business. I feel like we're aligned on this. What's your advice to founders there?\n\nJason Fried (00:07:25):\nObviously, if you're building cars, or you need a factory, or you're opening a restaurant and there's actual things you need to buy like ovens, and you need to hire people right off the bat, and you need to pay rent, you need capital. It could come from you. It could come from friends and family. It could come from an investor. It can come from a bank loan. There's lots of places to get it, but you'd need it. Software businesses though, and businesses like ours, we just make software, and a lot of people in our industry are like us in that respect. They need a couple laptops and a couple people, and it's pretty cheap. It's really pretty cheap to get going, and the margins are incredibly healthy in software, or they should be.\n\n(00:08:06):\nWhat's interesting is that Silicon Valley has found a way to make the most profitable style of business the least profitable. Software, there's no physical costs. The margin should be close to 80 or 90%. It turns out that they're barely even, most of them positive in the end, or they're just sliding by basically. I don't understand how that... Well, I do. They have too many people and they spend too much money on customer acquisition, and all that. But, it blows me away. Most businesses in the world would love to have Silicon Valley style economics, make something that doesn't cost much to make and then sell it for high prices.\n\n(00:08:50):\nBut everyone, the corner store, the pizza shop, they wish they could do this, and they can't because they have physical products that they have to sell, and they have to buy goods, and they have to get raw materials and convert that into a pizza, and there's just costs involved with that. They can't sell it for too much because the other place down the street sells it for less. So again, I'm getting off track, but if you're going to start a business that really truly requires cash, typically capital expenditures, expensive things, hardware, whatever, of course you need that. But, I don't think you do otherwise.\n\n(00:09:20):\nI think it actually hurts you if you go out and think that you do, because there really is only one outcome for venture-backed companies, which is go huge. If you think about all of the space between a small business and a massive, huge unicorn-y business, there's so much room there that you could normally find your own way, and slide into a slot or a place that makes sense for you. But if you're venture-backed, you just don't even have the opportunity. You blow right past those, or they want you to blow right past those. If you don't, you wither on the vine and die essentially, and it's just too bad.\n\nLenny (00:09:58):\nComing back to something we touched on a bit, is this idea of smaller teams. You tweeted a similar stats, so I'm just going to read these numbers, in terms of your competitors. Asana has 1600 employees. ClickUp has a thousand employees. Slack has 2,500 employees. Smartsheet has 3000 employees. Monday has 1500 employees. You have, I think you said, 70 something employees?\n\nJason Fried (00:10:20):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:10:22):\nYou have similar numbers of customers, about 100,000 to 150,000, and you make a lot of profit and they generally don't. How is this possible?\n\nJason Fried (00:10:31):\nWe run a very different kind of business. We are focused on efficiency, we're not focused on growth. They're focused on growth. So typically, when you have a lot of people, you think you can do more things at once, and you probably can. You do more things at once, and have different offerings to different people, and different tiers, and salespeople, and all the things that build up an organization. We don't have any salespeople. We don't have 15 different versions of Basecamp. We're not after enterprise, so we don't have the enormous support costs and enormous support infrastructure required to service customers like that, and customize this and customize that to keep a whale happy who's paying you $300,000 a year.\n\n(00:11:13):\nWe don't have any of those things. We have one price, basically. Well, we have two prices on Basecamp, one price on HEY. Actually, two prices on HEY. Two, basically. But one code base, one product we offer everybody. Let's take Basecamp for example. Nobody can pay us more than 300 bucks. I don't care how big your company is, the most you can pay us is $299, you get unlimited users. What that allows us to do is to just build one product, do a really nice job, keep it tight, and simple, and clear, and not have the complexity that comes with trying to service and satisfy so many different kinds of companies at different price levels with different price points and different expectations. That's why these companies tend to get bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\n(00:11:58):\nThey also, frankly, build products just differently. We build products with two people at a time. So every feature we work on in Basecamp, or HEY, or whatever we're building is two people, one programmer, one designer, and they have a maximum of six weeks to deliver the feature that they're working on. Most of them are usually a couple of weeks, but they have a maximum of six weeks. So we don't get stuck in these big huge projects, with meetings with 18 people, and slow decision-making, and indecision, and complexity, and all the things that come with trying to do too many things for too many people. Now, all that said, we could still make the mistake of hiring hundreds of people because we could afford to do so. But to spend money because you have it on things you don't need is something that Silicon Valley's gotten quite good at, but we're quite bad at intentionally. I don't want to spend money on things we don't need.\n\n(00:12:49):\nSo we think that constraints, simplicity, small teams actually are where it's at, and keep us honest, and allow us to do great work for our customer base that we know, small businesses, very tight companies like ours, and satisfy them versus trying to go after the big companies, and have to have salespeople, and have long sales cycles, and whatnot. Honestly, if you gave me 1,000 people, I wouldn't know what to do with them. We would fall apart. If you gave me 500 people, I wouldn't know what to do with them. We would fall apart. We would be a worse off company with 500 people. I'd be completely lost. So, that's the other thing. I don't even understand how they run, and the amount of layers they must need, and the amount of complexity organizationally that they must have to... The latticework they have to build up to support all that weight, is just remarkable and it's foreign to us.\n\nLenny (00:13:39):\nOkay. I definitely want to talk about how you operate in your way of working, 'cause it's really interesting and there's a lot companies can take away. But, I want to follow on this thread of small teams. I have a few quotes that you've shared that I love.\n\nJason Fried (00:13:50):\nOh, no.\n\nLenny (00:13:50):\nOh, no.\n\nJason Fried (00:13:52):\nNo, good. No, it's good. Hey, if I said it, I said it. Let's go.\n\nLenny (00:13:55):\nNo, they're awesome. They're great. Around this idea of staying small, one is, \"Small is not just a stepping stone, small is a great destination itself. Also, if you think you're too small to be effective, you've never been in bed with a mosquito.\"\n\nJason Fried (00:14:08):\nNow that's not my quote. That's someone else's, to be clear.\n\nLenny (00:14:10):\nOkay. Okay, you popularized it.\n\nJason Fried (00:14:11):\nIt's a great quote though.\n\nLenny (00:14:12):\nOkay. Then there's one more. \"You don't need to outdo the competition, it's expensive and defensive. Underdo your competition. We need more simplicity and clarity.\" I think a lot of these things point to, there's a few paths to success and goals for people. One is build a massively scaled, everyone's using a product like Figma and Notion, and build a venture scale, $100 billion company. Then there's this path which is, we're just going to make a bunch of profit we're going to make individually. We're going to take home a bunch of cash. We're not trying to have everyone in the world use it. I know your focus is, you call it, the Fortune 5 million versus the Fortune 500. So maybe just whatever you want to share about what success means to you, how you think about what success is for you, for the company your building.\n\nJason Fried (00:14:53):\nFor me, it's really about, would I want to do this again? If the answer is, \"Yeah, that was enjoyable. I enjoyed that. That was worthwhile. I'm glad I did that. I'd like to do that again,\" then it was successful. Now you could carve out some extremes there. I'm sure someone who's addicted to drugs might go, \"That felt great, I should do that again.\" So you got to be careful with that, in a sense. Obviously, I'm not talking about that. Addiction's a whole different story. But in general, with this stuff, \"That was fun. Let's do that again. That worked. Let's do that again.\" Or, \"That didn't work. I didn't like that. That was a pain in the ass. That was too complicated. That took too long. Let's not do that again.\" So it really is about, do you want to do that again? That's what success is to us at a root level.\n\n(00:15:37):\nNow, on the business side of things, we have to be profitable. That doesn't mean that everything we do needs to be profitable. I am not driven by data, or I don't have different P&Ls for each product in a way where we're looking at them very carefully. It's in total, collectively, are we making more money than we spend? That's the only thing we ultimately look at, whether or not this product is more profitable than that product, and this is behind that, it's all the things we do. It's all the things we do. I don't even think you can actually draw lines back to everything and go, \"That was worth it. That wasn't worth it.\" What is the value of saying thank you to somebody? Would you want to A/B test that and, if it turned out that it was worse to say thank you to somebody, would you not do that? No, you would do it because it's still the right thing to do.\n\n(00:16:28):\nSo a lot of our things are, what feels right? What seems like the decent thing to do? What things do we enjoy making? As long as we can, at the end of the year, look back and go, \"Well, collectively, more worked then didn't work,\" then we're okay. That's how we look at it. We don't have financial goals. We don't have OKRs or KPIs. I don't have revenue targets. I don't have growth targets, in terms of the number of customers we need to pick up this year versus last year. I don't look at any of those things. It's just, at the end, \"Did we make more than we spend? We did. Then the things we did this year were worth it.\" That's how it goes.\n\nLenny (00:17:08):\nYou also have no investors. You have no board. You have no plans to go public. You have no plans to sell the business.\n\nJason Fried (00:17:13):\nRight.\n\nLenny (00:17:14):\nThere's this book, I don't know if you've read this book called, Finite and Infinite Games.\n\nJason Fried (00:17:18):\nNo, I've not.\n\nLenny (00:17:20):\nOkay. I think you would love it. The whole premise of this book, it's like a terse, tricky, philosophical book, but it's very short. It espouses, you want to be playing infinite games to be happy in life, games that never end versus games like, I'm going to build a business and sell it. Or, I'm going to go public, that's my goal. Or, I want to achieve this promotion. You get most joy out of things that never end, like building great relationships, building a company you want to keep working at forever.\n\nJason Fried (00:17:45):\nI like that. What's interesting is, I've always thought of my career this way. When I got my first job, I was 13. I worked in a grocery store for a bit, and then I worked in a shoe store. After that, maybe when I was 15, I got a resellers license, which was this thing... This is way back in the day. I think they still exists. A company called Ingram Micro D, which had this huge thick catalog of electronics equipment. If you had a resellers license, you could buy these things at wholesale prices, then I could sell them to my friends for retail, which is almost 2x wholesale. Even though I'm not selling electronics equipment today, I'm selling software instead, I feel like I have the exact same job as I did when I was 15, that this is a long continuum of finding stuff that I like.\n\n(00:18:31):\nIn this case today, it's building things that I like, and selling them to like-minded people who also would find them useful or those things too. So whether or not it's software, or electronics, or stereo equipment, or whatever the heck it is, or music organizing databases, it's all the same to me, and I just want to keep doing it. This is my day job. The other thing that's interesting about entrepreneurship is, sometimes there's a sense of, you can get a job or you can be an entrepreneur. Well, an entrepreneur is a job. This is my job, so I want to create the company that I want to work at, and I want to keep doing this job for as long as I can. As long as I'm useful, I'm good at it, I enjoy it, I want to keep doing that.\n\n(00:19:14):\nSo to get in bed with an investment that would say, \"In five years you have to stop doing what you're doing, you're going to get a big paycheck maybe, but you got to stop doing what you're doing because we're going to sell this business, and you're going to have to go work for this other company for two years and do their thing. Then eventually, after that's over, you'll leave and you'll go start another thing,\" that just has no appeal to me at all. I'd rather just keep doing the thing that I'm enjoying doing, as long as I can continue to make it work.\n\n(00:19:37):\nWhat's cool about having a company like ours, which is an independent business, we don't have to ask anyone for permission. No one can tell us no. So we can turn this into anything we want. It's this vehicle, more so than it is a software business. It happens to be, of course, what it is, but it could be something else as well. There's no limits to what it could be, and that's a fun way to go through life too, in this all-terrain vehicle which can anywhere, on-road, off-road, whatever, and you can get anywhere you need to go. That's what's really quite fun about the kind of business we have.\n\nLenny (00:20:12):\nYou have this term you hold, instead of a startup it's a stay up.\n\nJason Fried (00:20:15):\nYes. I'm so sick of the startups. It's cool to start a business, obviously, but I'm sick of that term dominating. Because, frankly, starting a business is actually way easier than staying in business. Now, none of it's easy, so I want to be supportive of people who are starting businesses. But they should know that that's actually not the hard part. Literally tomorrow, I can start a new business. You can come up with a name, and you can make a thing, and you can put in the app store, and you can sell it for two bucks, and you've got a business going. But, are you going to be there in two years? Are you going to be there in five years when competition rushes in? When you have employees, are you going to be there? Staying is harder than starting. So I'm here to celebrate stay ups. Plenty of other people are here to celebrate startups.\n\nLenny (00:21:01):\nI feel the same way. I always say this about newsletters, and it's also true for podcasts. Easy to start a newsletter, hard to keep it going.\n\nJason Fried (00:21:07):\nTotally. I've seen your newsletter fly. We have a newsletter and it's been pretty flat. I'm like, \"How does he do it?\" It's hard. It's really hard. It's hard to build a podcast audience. It's hard to build a newsletter audience. So yeah, starting something is really easy, but then most people end up in this plateau area, 'cause they get some initial growth, the word gets out, and they end up with 6,000 somethings, and then you're stuck there. Then it's like, \"Well, do you want to keep doing this? Or, are you just high on the growth? Or, do you actually like the thing?\"\n\n(00:21:42):\nIf you want to do the thing for a long period of time, you've got to like the thing because you're going to have to endure these moments of plateaus, which is what staying up is all about. Sometimes those go down. We've had wavy years, always been profitable, but our profit's different every year. Sometimes it's more, and sometimes it's less. Sometimes our margin is more, sometimes it's less. If you compare yourself to the previous year, you can get demoralized to some degree. But I just, \"What do we want to keep doing?,\" and then we're in it to stay in it.\n\nLenny (00:22:13):\nSpeaking of enduring, you've been at this for almost 25 years now, I believe?\n\nJason Fried (00:22:18):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:22:19):\nHave there been periods where... I like that sigh that you just had there.\n\nJason Fried (00:22:24):\nIt's a long time.\n\nLenny (00:22:25):\nSo maybe along that path, one, is there a point at which maybe you started going off track and you realized, \"This is not what I want to be doing. Why did I do this to myself?\" Then two is just, what have you learned being at this for this long?\n\nJason Fried (00:22:36):\nI would say, over the past few years, I've had more thoughts of, \"How long should I do this for?\" I go back and forth. I can tell you, what's interesting is, right now, I'm probably more excited than I've been in many years. But, a year ago I was not so excited. I think that after you've been doing this for a while, you do tend to just compare, what was it like in the early days? What's it like now? All the new things that are harder weren't harder before, and now they're hard today. Do I like doing this kind of hard work, or would I rather do...? You just amass this history, and so you tend to just call back to it, and look back to it. So you opine for the early days, or you reminisce, I should say.\n\n(00:23:16):\n\"Yeah, it was so much easier when we were 20 people.\" \"Yeah, but we weren't doing this, and times were different, and you can't go back anyway.\" But, it's interesting. Next year I'll be 50. We'll be doing this 25 years. I'll have been running this company for 25 years. Part of me thinks, \"Is that enough? Maybe that's enough.\" But right now, I'm really excited about what we're doing. We're doing some really great product work, probably the best we've done in many, many years. Launching this new thing called ONCE, which hopefully we're going to build three or so products next year under that category. I would like to write another book. We finally have another idea for another book.\n\n(00:23:53):\nSo there's just, right now, this outpouring of energy. I'm trying to be very conscious of my energy interest. Right now, I'm getting energy from the business. There are times in the past where the business sapped energy for me. If it SAPs too much, at some point, you start to think, \"Is it worth it? Do I want to keep doing this?\" Right now, I'm fueled again by it. But, I don't know what it'll be like in a year from now. I really don't know. I think I'm more conscious of that than I've ever been given how long I've been doing this.\n\n(00:24:21):\nAlso, I always have this strange fantasy, I'm always curious, \"What would someone else do with this place? What if someone else could just step in tomorrow? How would they run it? No one's ever had a chance to run it but me. What would they do differently?\" I'd have to be completely detached from it to let them really run with it. But, what would they do? I always have this curious about that, I would say. Not curious enough to find out, but still curious. It's always in the back of my head.\n\nLenny (00:24:49):\nWhat do you think they'd do?\n\nJason Fried (00:24:50):\nI think they'd probably be focused on growth. I think there's opportunities that we miss all the time. I think that we are stuck in a certain... Stuck sounds like a negative term, but I don't mean it that way. But, we're stuck in a certain groove. We do things the way we do things. We change the way we do things here and there, but we're not really jumping into a new groove. I think someone would jump into a new groove and run the company differently, maybe make a lot more products than we're making today. Maybe resurrect a couple of things that we did in the past. Probably spend a lot on advertising, a lot of marketing, probably take our margin way down and try to focus on growth. What if we spent 70% of our margin on growth? What would that look like? I just feel like that's what most people would probably come in with a business like ours and do. They go, \"Oh my god, there's so many missed opportunities here. Look at this, and look at this, and look at this. You've got this brand, and people know about you, and you've got 100,000 paying customers. Think about all the things you could do.\" I'm not really thinking about all the things we could do. I'm thinking about what we're doing. So I think someone else would come in and think about the things we could do.\n\n(00:25:49):\nI'm thinking about the things we are doing, with a little bit of a look ahead to things we could also do, but they're still pretty close to what we're doing today. So, that's what I think would happen. It'd be interesting. It'd be neat to live in a reality where there could be a second reality running right alongside you, truly. Not an A/B test, which is hard to do. You can't really A/B test an entire company. I'd seek to A/B test small things. But, it'd be cool if that was something that could happen. Maybe there's some simulation down the road.\n\nLenny (00:26:16):\nI was just thinking-\n\nJason Fried (00:26:16):\nIt's a possibility.\n\nLenny (00:26:17):\nMaybe we're in the simulation variant where you're still running it.\n\nJason Fried (00:26:20):\nIt could be.\n\nLenny (00:26:21):\nAnd there's another... This a cool exercise, actually, just to think about it. If I were to bring in any leader, what would they do? Just as a thought exercise.\n\nJason Fried (00:26:28):\nThis is a weird way to think about it, but I almost would be embarrassed by what someone would come in and look at, and go, \"Oh my God, you guys are missing so many opportunities here.\" I'd be like, \"Yeah, I know. I know we are, but I'm totally fine with it.\" But, there'd be this moment of judgment and reckoning with, \"Do you realize how much you're leaving on the table?\" You could have five different pricing tiers, and make a lot more money, and you can maximize this and maximize that, and squeeze this and squeeze that, and address this market, and you could have special versions of Basecamp. Wow, churches are using Basecamp? We could do a special version for churches, and for synagogues, and religious institutions, or education or nonprofits. Think of all the slight different things you could do with these different...\"\n\n(00:27:06):\nI'm certain that all those opportunities exist on the table. They don't interest me, personally, in terms of making multiple products. But I could see someone else going, \"There's a huge opportunity here. We got to pursue this.\" I'd be really proud if someone did that, and made the business bigger and better. I could never have done that. I'm glad someone else did that. But right now, we're running it our way.\n\nLenny (00:27:29):\nComing back to this as a path people can take with their business versus a traditional venture scale business, this path is essentially build something, sell it, make money, live like a chill life. Not super stressed, growth-focused obsessed, need to build a billion-dollar company. Do you think this path is something everyone should do? Is it a specific type of personality, a specific type of product? Do you recommend people that sometimes do go this big shot venture scale route?\n\nJason Fried (00:27:59):\nI'm glad there are some people who do that. I'm glad that there's some businesses that-\n\nJason Fried (00:28:00):\nPeople who do that. I'm glad that there's some businesses that wouldn't have worked out had they not taken a bunch of funding and went big, clearly. And there's many impressive businesses that do that. But let's face it, those are extreme outliers. The majority of companies on this planet run like ours. They're bootstrapped, they don't have any money. No one's willing to give them a penny and they open up a shop somewhere, they do something, they put their shingle out and they launch a website or whatever and they try to make it work. So most people are doing it our way, even though in our industry it seems like we're the outliers, but we're not. We're actually incredibly boring and mainstream, really. If you were to pick any random business owner on the street, they'd run their business like us. I got to make more money than I spend otherwise I'm out. I don't have this big cushion of millions sitting in the bank that I can just spend on things.\n\n(00:28:48):\nSo they're pretty, they keep an eye on costs. They think about this carefully. But yeah, I'm glad there's people who are going for the moonshot and doing it their way and doing it a different way. And the world moves forward sometimes because of those businesses and it's great. It's great and I admire them. It's just that it's not the path I would take and I think because that's not who I am, and I think this is the important point that I want to get across, is I'm not really, hopefully I don't come off as encouraging everyone to be like me. I'm not saying that at all. What I'm saying is this is a way to be. It's an alternative to what you're often hearing in our industry, which is like go big or go home, raise a bunch of money and get huge and unicorn status and the whole thing.\n\n(00:29:29):\nThat's a way. Just know though that basically almost nobody makes it that way. Really, almost nobody really makes it that way. And there's a lot more room to make it and to build a successful business, if you throw out that outlier and look at all the other places you can land as a business. So my interest is optionality. If I could land in 135 different positions and have a sustainable business, that's great. Versus saying there's only one way I'm going to be successful or happy. Those odds aren't really in anyone's favor. Even though of course some people win the lottery. And I'm not saying it's luck. There is luck, a lot of luck, including we're lucky that we've made it. So there is a degree of that when I say lottery. But really the point is that there's only a few slots for a few companies like that at any one time. Meanwhile, there are hundreds or thousands of slots for other kinds of companies to make it if they don't go for the moon.\n\nLenny (00:30:31):\nJust to close this thought around whether, if you have an idea going the venture route makes sense. What do venture scale companies need to achieve? What investors look for that to even work out? To your point, it almost never works out. What is it you have to do for it to feel like, okay, this is a venture scale idea versus this is an awesome idea. We could just make money every year, every month from it and not raise money and life will be great.\n\nJason Fried (00:30:54):\nI'm probably the wrong person to ask, but I would say there are versions of our... Let's just take Monday for example. Basecamp and Monday are quite a bit different, but they live in the same world. We could have flipped, someone could have had the Monday approach and sold Basecamp that way, and Basecamp could have gone big in that way and Monday could have stayed small in our way. Again, I'd rather be my business than their business. I would not trade Basecamp for Monday's business any day of the week because I love what we're doing. We're profitable, we're happy. We don't have to deal with the things they have to deal with. So I wouldn't trade businesses or places with anybody. But you could imagine it could have been swapped. So it's not that Basecamp couldn't be this big venture scale, whatever you want to call it, although look, hey, we have the same number of customers roughly than they do.\n\n(00:31:46):\nAre we? I guess we are venture scale in that respect. But again, point is is that depending on how you approach it, you can take anything in any different direction. So it's more of a mindset, what are you after? We're not after that and they are. So that's what they do. And we do it a different way. So I don't necessarily think... There's things like Airbnb is a great example that that has to have a certain degree of scale to really be something that no matter where you go in the world, you're like, I can get an Airbnb there. And that's probably going to take money to get there. Same thing with Uber. Uber's another example, and these are easy to pick, but they're great examples really. When Uber was getting started and they had to proliferate all over the country to begin with and all over the world.\n\n(00:32:33):\nSo it was this reliable thing you could think of just you would think of a cab. If I went to New York or Chicago, I knew there'd be a cab. Was there going to be an Uber? I don't know. Well, you have to know that there's going to be one to begin to trust us. So in order to do that, you have to expand rapidly. So there's that kid of, those kind of businesses exist and those are great examples of venture-backed companies that kind of need that massive initial push to be available in all the different places because they're actual physical products. Airbnb's a physical product, Uber's a physical product, Basecamp, Monday, Asana, they're available everywhere instantly anyway. I don't know what you need the money for other than marketing. And it's interesting because marketing's losing them a lot of money. So it's an interesting thing. But anyway, you can talk to them about that.\n\nLenny (00:33:20):\nI want to start chatting about your ways of working, how you operate at 37signals. There's a lot of really unique approaches. One is you mentioned that every project is, I didn't know this. It's two people, a designer and engineer, and then two to six weeks of work. Can you just expand on how you actually do that, how broad development works there?\n\nJason Fried (00:33:36):\nYeah, so we have framework development framework we invented called Shape Up, and if you go to basecamp.com/shapeup, you can read the book, it's free. You can also get a print version if you want. Shape Up is our methodology for actually building products. And part of this is this idea at the root of it is this idea of the six-week cycle. That whatever we choose to do can take no longer than six weeks. So this is not an estimate of time, it's an appetite, which is a radically different approach. It doesn't sound like that much of a different word, but it really is. An estimate is like how long do we think it's going to take? And however long it takes is however long it takes. And most human beings are terrible estimators. We all are pretty much terrible estimators. So that's why things keep going and going and going and going.\n\n(00:34:21):\nWe instead have appetites. And our appetite for any individual feature is no more than six weeks. Essentially that's our budget we're willing to spend. I'm only willing to spend six weeks in any feature. So we have to figure out the simplest, most effective version of that to get that done within six weeks and get it done by two people. Now, not everything gets the full six weeks. Some things were like, we have a one week appetite for this. This is not that big of a deal. If we have it, great. If we don't have it, that's fine. We're willing to spend a week on it. Not that it could take a week, because it could also take 12 weeks if we give it 12 and it could take 24, if we give it 24. Work expands to fill the time available. So for us it's about appetite.\n\n(00:35:00):\nSo the idea of appetites, maxing things out at six weeks, two people max, and then there's a lot of other details, and I could go on for an hour about Shape Up, people can read about it. But it's those fundamental principles, appetites, six week max, small teams and this idea of shaping the work ahead of time, then giving the team a lot of latitude to figure out how to get that thing done. We don't have a spec, we don't create to-dos or tasks or tickets for people. They create the work that needs to get done to fulfill the idea that we've written up and designed essentially, and they figure out how to do it. Then we trade. So they might get into something that we've said, we have about six weeks. Well, we're only give it six weeks and two weeks in they go, we actually stumbled into something we didn't realize.\n\n(00:35:50):\nThis is probably not going to be able to be done the way we thought. So can we do it this way? And then we have a discussion and there's a conversation. There's a lot of molding and changing that happens along that period of time. We call it trading concessions. There's all the trade-offs we're always thinking about. So all these things that come to bear. And then people often ask, well, what if you don't get it done in the six weeks you gave it? Well, so it depends. So in most cases it should die, meaning it just doesn't happen. Because if we say we're going to give it six weeks and we give it seven or eight or nine or 10, then we're not really giving it six weeks, we're giving it 10, then we don't really have a system.\n\n(00:36:27):\nThere are times though, when there's a couple days left when we're on what we're calling the downslope. So we have these things in Basecamp called hill charts. And things that are on, that's actually work... A project's more like a hill. It's not like a linear line. If you're on the left side of the hill, it means you're still pushing this thing up the hill. You're still trying to figure out how to do this. But once work gets to the top, it's downhill from there. It's just pure execution and we know how to nail it. So if we're almost at the bottom of the hill on something and it needs two more days, fine. If there's any work that's left over that's still on the left side of the hill, meaning we're still pushing it up, we don't know how we're going to do it and we're at our time limit, it almost certainly dies. So there are some contextual decisions to make at that point, but fundamentally that's how we approach work. And this prevents long running projects that never end, which by the way are the most demoralizing kinds of projects.\n\n(00:37:17):\nThings that you're stuck on that you don't want to do that never end, sucks. And if people get stuck on a couple of those, they want to leave their job. So the implications here are significant. And so we want to keep people out of that zone of like, I hate this work and it goes on forever. Because sometimes you're going to hate the work. Not all projects are that exciting. Sometimes it's maintenance stuff, sometimes it's updating an internal billing system that's boring and no customers are going to see but needs to be done. But you'll know that, hey, at maximum we've got four weeks on this. I can already see the end from the beginning, no big deal. But if it's like this is going to take nine months and you're on week four and you're like, I hate this, bad. So we want to stay away from that sort of thing.\n\nLenny (00:38:00):\nYou have these quotes along these lines about planning, long-term business planning is a fantasy. I don't plan long-term because I want to do what I think, not what I thought.\n\nJason Fried (00:38:09):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:38:09):\nI love these. This whole idea of appetites, it's very appealing. It makes so much sense. It's like the ultimate impact to effort calculation. The effort we'll put into this is fixed and we'll not go beyond this because the impact we expect from this is pretty clear. And if the effort goes up and up and up, well why did we even do this? But obviously the downside is you can't promise things really to sales marketing, which I think makes sense in your type of business. Do you see this work in businesses that aren't your business this approach?\n\nJason Fried (00:38:43):\nWell, let me talk about promises for a second. Promises are the downfall of every business. Every time we've made a promise to get something out in a certain period of time and we kind of inevitably seem to miss it, it's funny how it's almost like it would've been out in time, but the fact that we'd promised it made it not deliver in time. There's some strange thing that happens when you promise things. So we've learned to not promise anything. We can share what we're working on if we want to. We can tell people we're doing something. And by the way, the worst promise, and by the way, we've made a couple of these recently, we always regret them. It's like by the end of the year. That's the one promise you got to be very careful of, because it's so easy to make. There's nothing easier than promising work later.\n\n(00:39:29):\nAnd the further away it is, the easier it is to promise. And so this whole, by the end of the year, oh, red flag. Just remind yourself whenever you say that to yourself, go, oh, wait a second. Wait, wait, what am I doing right now? Because you're probably setting yourself up for disappointment. So as far as other companies running this way, there are a number of other companies that are running this way and more and more are adopting Shape Up all the time. But it's a struggle. It's hard. It's hard to change the way you work. I think companies form roots and roots go in the ground and once your root structure is formed, the plant that grows from that is the plant that grows from that, basically. You kind of have to uproot. And this is not really a totally clear metaphor because that plant is that plant, but you almost have to plant a new seed somewhere else, let's just say, and then grow something new because it's very hard to change in flight and change what you have and change what you're used to.\n\n(00:40:24):\nSo what we often encourage people to do is keep working the way you're working, but some future project, some low criticality project, try this new method on that. So if it doesn't work, because it's probably not going to work very well the first time, just like if I gave you a guitar and you never played before, it'd be unreasonable for me to expect you to play well. You're going to suck for a while. So go pick some things that don't matter if you suck at them for a while and try this method over there and go, oh, you know what? I'm actually getting quite good. Now let's try to bring this into some more critical stuff. I think that's the important way to approach these sorts of projects, which is to take the criticality out. Because what ends up happening is that when people try to try something new on something really critical and it doesn't work, they'll never try it again.\n\n(00:41:08):\nThey've destroyed all future opportunities to try this again, because everyone knows how bad it went last time on something that really mattered. And they would've gone, we could have done it our old way. Our old way worked. It kind of sucked, but it worked. And so now you're comparing two things that aren't really comparable, but you're always going to go with the momentum that you had versus the new thing. And so you got to be careful with that. So I know I'm rambling a bit on it, but that's my general sense and feel on how to adopt a different way of working.\n\nLenny (00:41:36):\nThere's also this cool down period after one of these, what do you call these? A sprint or what's the term for it?\n\nJason Fried (00:41:42):\nNo, I hate that term. I don't like the word sprint because how do you feel after a sprint? Exhausted.\n\nLenny (00:41:48):\nBut also pretty good.\n\nJason Fried (00:41:50):\nYou can. Yeah, yeah. It's funny because I was a sprinter in high school, so I love sprinting. But if you go all out, you might feel high for a minute, but you can't go all out again. You've got to really catch your breath and you certainly like to sprint. I remember my track coach actually ran in college for a year until I realized that I wasn't good enough. But he made us run 20 200s in a row with just two minutes break in between, and the 200 is an incredibly hard race. You're all out for 200 meters or yards. And after the fifth one I just threw up. I just threw up. It's like that's kind of what work is for a lot of people. It's like 20 200s, they have these sprints and they never seem to end. And there's one sprint after the other, after the other, after the other, after the other.\n\n(00:42:36):\nAnd that's why I don't like the word because you can't layer that back to back to back to back. You cannot sprint back to back, to back, to back in life. And you can't do it at work. People do it at work, but I don't think it actually works. So what we do is after our six week cycles, we typically take what we call a two-week cool down. So we call these cycles, not sprints. A two-week cool down, and we call them cycles because cycles happen again and again and again. Sprints start and end. Cycles happen. There's cycles in life and seasons, and I like that idea that you're prepared for this thing to happen again.\n\n(00:43:12):\nTake two weeks, cool down. That's when people can sort of internally freelance. They're still working, but they're kind of tightening up a couple of things. Maybe we just shipped or working on a couple extra days on something that didn't ship that's going to ship in two days, or kind of fixing some bugs and messing around with some stuff that they wanted to get to, but no one ever had time to and was never scheduled. So that's kind a good time to do that. In the meantime, a few of us are shaping up the next cycles projects and finalizing that and writing the pitches up for that. So that's what those cycles are for. It's not that you're stopping work, it's that you're doing other kinds of work. And that I think is replenishing and refreshing, and I think that's the important part versus back to back to back sprints of the same kind of work all the time.\n\nLenny (00:43:54):\nYou mentioned also that you have no growth goals, that you make decisions a lot on instinct and gut and opinion, which sounds amazing, it's great if you could pull it off. Feels also very hard to operationalize and maybe make the best decisions in times. Can you just talk about how you actually operationalize that and what you find happens when you approach things that way?\n\nJason Fried (00:44:15):\nI'll just admit that that's the only way I've ever known how to work. I don't know how to make decisions by numbers or I don't find any joy in it, frankly. I've always been intuition driven and gut driven. And frankly, to be honest, I think everyone actually is. And this is part of the thing I want to write up. I've been thinking about writing about this. I think everything's a judgment call. And so yeah, data can play a part. All sorts of things can play a part, but unless you're letting a machine make the decision, that's purely rational. If you're asking a human to make it's a judgment call. They're bringing to bear thousands of things they know and don't know about that influence them about this particular decision. And it's why when companies hire executives, what are they looking for in executive? They typically go judgment and experience.\n\n(00:45:06):\nThey're not like they can read an Excel spreadsheet. That's not the thing that matters. Anyone can read that or anyone can read a chart or you can learn to do that. They're looking for judgment and experience, which is a very amorphous thing. It's like, what is it really? Well, they've been around, they've seen a lot of things, they've absorbed a lot of experiences and they're going to bring those undescribable things to bear to make decisions for the business. So out of all the things, data might be one thing, but there's thousands of things that go into a decision that many of which you don't even know. And I just feel like I'm comfortable admitting that that I don't really know why I'm making these calls, but I'm making these calls regardless. And I'm not looking at a number and going, if this is fifty-one percent versus forty-nine, I'm going this way for sure.\n\n(00:46:01):\nThat could be an input perhaps, but it's not the only input. And I think people should recognize that even if you're a data-driven person, there's so much more at play here. So I just feel like just being honest about that and that's sort of how I've always looked at it. And I also will admit, as I just mentioned, I don't know the things that go into my decision-making process, but I'm absolutely fascinated by decision-making. I think it's one of the most interesting human endeavors. And I would just say that give your intuition credit. Give your gut credit. It's absorbed everything. And plus the things that you don't know it absorbed that are valuable.\n\nLenny (00:46:42):\nIt's easier to do that if you're the founder running the company, obviously. Is there something you find that you can do to help your teammates approach things that way too? Do you just trust their instincts also in a similar way?\n\nJason Fried (00:46:54):\nYeah, you're right by the way, it is easy for me to sit up here and say this, I own the place. No one can fire me. I get it, right. I can be wrong all the time, go, my gut just told me to do this. And I understand, I do. I'm self-aware enough to understand that. But I think that by demonstrating that's how we make decisions, it creates space for other people to make decisions that way. And when we have conversations, I'm talking with my team about something, I'll often go, I don't really know. It feels like this. It feels this way. And they'll say, I feel this way. And I'll ask them, how do you feel? How do you feel? What we ask people in general is we say, what do you think? We don't say, what do you know? We often say, what do you think? We might say, what do you know?\n\n(00:47:43):\nBut we also say, what do you think more time. And what does that mean? What do you think is, I don't know where these thoughts come from and I don't know what forms them. So I think it's interesting to look at the things we say and go, we actually do want people to think. And so I'll often say, what do you think or what do you feel or how does this feel? Is something we talk more about at work than pretty much anything else, which is like, how does this screen feel? How does this flow feel? How does this feature feel? How does this word feel? How does this sentence feel? How does this paragraph feel? How does this website feel? How does these colors feel? Because human beings feel.\n\n(00:48:20):\nAnd while we have a logical side to us and a rational side to us, we're primarily feeling creatures. Even if we don't admit it, we are. And so I'm always curious about that. So I bring that up a lot and I ask other people how they feel, and I think hopefully that encourages people to share that side of their opinion. And we almost never, sometimes we look at numbers to sort of be an input, but it's never prove that. I'll never say justify that. That's just not terminology or lingo that we ever bring up. It's not a way.\n\n(00:49:05):\nIt's, how do you feel? It's not like, how certain are you? I try to tend to shy away from anything that's about certainty. We're not after certainty. I want to know how you think it feels. So anyway, I'm rambling again, but this is, I'm rambling because this is actually how things go. When we talk, there is a lot of this, it's not precise in a sense. It eventually becomes precise when it's out in the world, but the thought process is very rambling and very amorphous, and you kind of find your way as you go. And eventually go yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it. That feels right.\n\nLenny (00:49:45):\nThis kind of advice comes up a lot actually on this podcast, especially for product managers, that there's a lot of power in just trusting your instincts and not just being this kind of unbiased participant in a product team, having actual, here's what I think works from your own experience using the product from your own life experience. But this came up with Brian [inaudible 00:50:05] episode. He's running the company, he's telling everyone basically, here's what we're building. A lot of people said, okay, that'd be great if our CEO is also a designer, very product-minded person. Many people aren't that, many people don't have actual enough experience to have built amazing instincts. So, do you solve that by just hiring people that have a lot of experience? Is it like a hiring thing? Is it trust people that have a lot more experience more because not everyone's going to have the right instinct?\n\nJason Fried (00:50:34):\nIt's true. Look, Brian's probably one of the greatest CEOs around today, but I like small businesses. So he knows how to run a bigger organization. I wouldn't. So I can't really step into that answer from that perspective. One of the reasons we stay small, I think, is so we can all rub off on each other. And when we hire, we can be very, very selective because we only hire a few people a year. And so I only hire designers and product people, David hires programmers, and different people in the company hire different people. But when I hire designers, I'm curious about their tastes. I'm curious about what they like. I'm curious about what other products they think are good. I'm curious about what they've seen that they admire or who they... I'm always asking about that because that helps me get a sense of who they are and what lens they see the world through and what kind of influences they're going to bring to bear. So that's the kind of stuff I'm looking for.\n\n(00:51:34):\nAnd one of the things that we do during the interview process for designers specifically and product people, which is the same thing in my mind, is they do a project for us at the end. So the last five finalists will do a project for us. We'll pay them to do the project, they'll have a week to do it, they'll do it, and then I'll critique it with them. Even if I love it, I will push back in certain areas. And one of the things I'll often ask is, if you had another couple days, what would you do with this? And I want to see where people go with that. To me, that is where you can see they don't have any time to think. So where does their gut go? What are their instincts? Where do they arrive after having to riff on the spot with something?\n\n(00:52:18):\nSo what's behind what they built? Because what they built should just be some of what they had in mind. It shouldn't be everything. Now they're exhausted of every future idea. And I've seen some people who we thought were really good, and in that moment, they don't know where to go with it. Now, that's not to say some people don't need time to think and think it through, but I'm still looking for people who just, their gut is filled with ideas. And so it doesn't always translate but that's how I try to suss out whether or not someone has a good gut instinct on where to go. And it almost doesn't necessarily even matter where they go with it because this is raw, just raw gut. But I want to see that they have one and they're willing to lean into it and not be afraid of saying things that may not make any sense.\n\n(00:53:08):\nBut yeah, I've got some other ideas and we could try this, and we try this, and I kind of play with this idea. And I don't know. Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe we try, what if we did that? What about this? And then I would say something and we'd riff and we start riffing. And when we start riffing, there's a synchronicity that I'm looking for. And when I feel that synchronicity and that resonance, the two wavelengths are just perfectly vibrating together, then I know we have something. So that's the kind of stuff I'm looking for when I hire people. And I do think that that translates to people with a better gut feel than someone who's more of a, let's call it an academic product person, which can be very fine at other places, but it wouldn't really work here.\n\nLenny (00:53:46):\nThat's really great advice for someone looking for someone that has a good instinct and gut. And I think it's interesting because that's often the opposite, what you described is what many people don't want. Someone with just a ton of ideas. Because a lot of companies, a lot of leaders are like, we got plenty of ideas. We just need you to help us ship stuff.\n\nJason Fried (00:54:02):\nI don't want that either. So I don't want just ideas. So they have to make something that's clear. First of all, it has to be good and clear. And then they also have to be able to riff on the spot and think about how else they could take this. We've had some people who were just so scatterbrained and they've got a million ideas, but when we asked them to execute something for this project, it was a total mess. You could see their time management skills were off and they focused on the wrong things. That is not a go for me, that's a no go.\n\n(00:54:31):\nWhat's a go is that's a clever design, well executed, thoughtful, clear, and here's where they could take it from here on out if they had a few more days, or even if we had 15 minutes, what would you do you do with that? So that's the kind of stuff that I think ultimately is the meat of it. And so I always think of it in terms of play. This is play. I want to play with this product. I want to play with this design. I want to play with this idea. It's play and play is a thing. It's a very clear thing versus a rigid, boring approach to product development, which again, can be successful, but it wouldn't work at our company.\n\nLenny (00:55:12):\nGreat clarification. I completely agree.\n\n(00:55:16):\nThis episode is brought to you by Wix Studio. Your agency is just landed a dream client, and you already have big ideas for the website, but do you have the tools to bring your ambitious vision to life? Let me tell you about Wix Studio, the new platform that lets agencies deliver exceptional client sites with maximum efficiency. How? First, let's talk about advanced design capabilities.

There's the built-in AI tools, the on-canvas collaborating, a centralized workspace, the reuse of assets across sites, the seamless client handover. And that's not all. Find out more at wix.com/studio.\n\n(00:56:18):\nOkay. We had some questions come in from the audience when we were preparing for this. We both tweeted to see what people wanted to ask. I have two that I picked out. One is from Matt Mullenweg. How cool is that?\n\nJason Fried (00:56:29):\nOh my God.\n\nLenny (00:56:31):\nI think you may have seen this question, but the question is, what is a spectacular failure of someone trying to follow your advice and failing when it doesn't stick? What is the reason?\n\nJason Fried (00:56:41):\nPeople trying to make a rapid, fundamentally, 180 degree changes quickly is a great way to fall flat on your face, basically. I have seen people who try to adopt, let's say, Shape Up, and they come back six weeks later and they're like, \"This sucks. This doesn't work.\" I'm like, \"I'm not surprised to hear that. Tell me how you did it.\" And then, they explain like, \"Oh, the next project we did, we did this.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I'm really not surprised to hear that now.\" Because you can't really do that. You can't turn on a dime. There's this thing called momentum. I always try to think of things in terms of the physical world. The more massive an object, the more energy it takes to change its direction. This is why big companies move slowly.\n\n(00:57:26):\nThis is also why momentum, which is the way you've been working for four years, is going to power you forward in a certain way. It's very hard to turn the corner immediately or turn around. You just cannot do it physically. If you can't do it physically, you can't do it this way. I think that's what I've seen, is these rapid like, \"All right, starting tomorrow, we're starting Shape Up.\" It's like, well, no, it's not going to work. Unless you say we're going to do it on this other thing that doesn't matter so much. That's one thing I would say.\n\n(00:57:52):\nThe other thing is that pretty much every business is a spectacular failure. It just is. It's like, business is really hard and the ones that make it are all outliers. This is why most businesses fail. There's a million reasons why, and it's always hard to pin it down. And we can all look back. By the way, I don't like to look back on things. I'm not much of a fan of looking back on failures and trying to figure out what went wrong so we don't do it again, because I don't think we know what went wrong. I think we can spend a long time trying to analyze it and we're going to find something that we can agree on, and it tends to be what you can agree on so you can move on. But that doesn't mean that's what it was.\n\n(00:58:37):\nJust like we don't really know why you make decisions, you don't really know why things didn't work. Sometimes there are some examples, and I think it's true if you're talking about a mechanistic system. You're stamping metal and it's supposed to have perfect circles and it's an oval. You can go back to that machine and see how the thing worked, and the line. You can adjust that and fix that. A lot of work though is not that way, especially software work, where there's a million different inputs and a million different people. It's not simple stamping machines. It's a different thing. I don't know, but I do think that trying to make big changes too quickly is a primary reason.\n\nLenny (00:59:13):\nYou've seen this approach work at traditional companies, I imagine? It's not just companies that work in your way where there's no investors, they're not obsessed with growth? You've seen Shape Up implemented at traditional public type companies?\n\nJason Fried (00:59:27):\nYeah, it's usually smaller teams. It's not like Airbnb, Brian's not going to go, \"Okay, tomorrow, we're following this thing that these guys over 37signals came up with.\" But it's typically small teams inside larger companies that experiment with this. Sometimes it spreads and sometimes it doesn't, and it doesn't always need to. It could be this one division, this one group that works a different way.\n\n(00:59:45):\nAlso, it doesn't have to be fully Shape Up. It could be 30% of it. Maybe it's just simply the six-week cycle thing is the thing and the rest of it doesn't matter so much. Or it could be this idea of appetites versus estimates, and they can work that into the way they work. Take whatever works. You don't have to go wholesale on any of these things.\n\nLenny (01:00:07):\nAwesome. A second question comes from Leo Polovets, one of my favorite VCs. He works at Susa Ventures. He asked the question a lot of people actually asked. It's just, what does he think he got right and where has he changed his mind, if anywhere? You share a lot of strong opinions, very contrarian opinions. So, maybe just mostly on that second part is what I'm most curious about. What have you changed your mind about?\n\nJason Fried (01:00:29):\nA few years, well, a handful of years ago, we used to make multiple products, and we went to just doing Basecamp. I thought I would be personally satisfied for the rest of my career, working on one thing and just making that thing the best it could possibly be. Essentially, working on one sculpture, and constantly tweaking it and chiseling it and just polishing it, and just making it better and better, and better, and better, and better. I still thoroughly enjoy working on Basecamp. But a few years ago, we built this new thing called HEY, HEY.com email service, because we just felt like we had to make more things again.\n\n(01:01:04):\nThis idea that I thought, that we could be happy as a company just doing one thing really well, which was a major shift. We had multiple products. We basically wound those down. We didn't ever close them down. People can still use them, who were using them before, we just stopped selling them. We even changed the name of the business from 37signals to Basecamp. We're saying, we're signaling all through. We're doing one thing that's just this thing called Basecamp. It's a huge, massive decision to make, and so we were all in on it. And then, a few years ago, we go, \"You know what? We're makers. Let's be honest about ourselves.\"\n\n(01:01:39):\nI'm talking about me, and I was talking about David. But we were just like, \"We want to make more things again. We have some more ideas. Why are we suppressing ourselves? Let's not do that.\" We made HEY and now we're doing ONCE, and we're going to make more products and more products and more products. We're going to probably do another book, as I mentioned earlier. It was that. I think that's the biggest major fundamental 180 degree change that I've changed my mind on, but I changed my mind all the time.\n\n(01:02:08):\nI disagree with myself constantly on small things. Product design decisions or the naming of something, or how we roll something out, or how I'm going to write something or present something or say something. There's probably an answer, I'm sure there's an answer in this podcast that if I listen back, I'd go, \"I would probably answered it differently,\" or, \"I don't even agree with the way I answered that.\" There's a million things like that happening all the time. But in terms of big things, I think that's the best example I can come up with.\n\nLenny (01:02:33):\nIt's clear that you've designed your life and designed your business in this very intentional way. Because the default path, and I'll reference this back to this other podcast episode, the default path is, build a company, raise a bunch of money, build massive business, generate a lot of revenue, exit, try something else. And you've done something very different. You've built a company-\n\nJason Fried (01:02:53):\nCan I speak up to that, though?\n\nLenny (01:02:53):\nPlease.\n\nJason Fried (01:02:56):\nBecause this is the pathless path stuff?\n\nLenny (01:02:57):\nYeah.\n\nJason Fried (01:02:57):\nIs this what that was? Yeah. I'm moderately familiar with that idea. I didn't listen to that podcast, but I saw some clips. I find it interesting because you've designed your life intentionally. It's funny because there are some principles I hold, perhaps, or some direction I'm headed, but I don't think about any of this ahead of time, including the company. We don't have a multi-year plan. I don't even have a one-year plan. I don't even have a six-month plan or a quarter. We think about everything we're going to do every six weeks. Every six weeks, we rethink what we're going to do next.\n\n(01:03:33):\nWe're very much an in-the-now company, making it up as we go. And this is true for me, personally, my career, the whole thing. I didn't have any of this planned out. I didn't decide I wanted to be like this or like that. I just figure out what works and keep doing that until it doesn't. And then, maybe we do something else. But it's very much, I'm not on a path. I can't see the path. I'm on a path. We're going somewhere. I don't want to stand still. But I don't know where I'm going, and I'm perfectly comfortable with that.\n\n(01:04:05):\nFor me, it is really much about making it up as you go, based on, again, being in touch with how things feel to you, what your intuition is, what your gut tells you, what makes you happy. What do you want to do? What can you do? Sometimes, it's things that make you happy and you can't do, just because life is what it is. So, understanding that and figuring out what the trade-offs are. But really, it's figuring out as we go, and I think, frankly, it's the best way to run a business. I think it's the healthiest, most honest way to run a business, which is, to figure it out as you go.\n\n(01:04:37):\nI think the further out you plan, the less you know about the decisions you're making. And by the time you get there, you're probably going to be wrong, or you're going to want to do something else. And then, if you're like, \"Don't do those things,\" then what's the point of planning? People end up doing things they don't want to do because they said they were going to do them. Obligations in the future, I think, are quite dangerous, and I think they send people down a path of unhappiness, actually. I think just staying closer to now is probably the best way to do that.\n\nLenny (01:05:04):\nA lot of this trickles down from the biggest decision you made, which is, don't raise money, keep control of this business. You're the boss. There's no boss above you.\n\nJason Fried (01:05:13):\nYeah, the independence. If you go to 37signals.com, there's 37 ideas. And the first one, there's a 00, which is start here, which is like a read me. But 01 is independence. Independence is the root of all the things we're able to do, and we did make that intentional decision. We didn't know all the tentacles that come up from that and what it's going to impact and touch, but we knew principally, we want to be able to do what we want to do.\n\n(01:05:40):\nWe want to be entrepreneurs and to me, that means working for yourself. The moment you go out and take money or have these big obligations, you end up working for someone else. I do understand why some companies do it, but I don't understand why a lot of people do it, who probably shouldn't do it. I think staying independent is a wonderfully fulfilling experience, and it's very hard to do when you're beholden to someone else's timeframe and expectations.\n\n(01:06:12):\nAnother thing we rarely have here are expectations. This is the point. We launch a new product, I don't know what's going to happen. We launched Basecamp, I didn't know what was going to happen. We launched HEY, I didn't know what was going to happen. We're going to launch some new stuff soon, I don't know what's going to happen. We don't say, \"If this gets 20,000 users, then it's a success.\" I don't know. We don't care. It doesn't even matter.\n\n(01:06:33):\nWe're making it anyway, and we're going to see what's going to happen. The market will tell us what happens. I'll just wait to find out. There's no sense in spending the time thinking about what could be.\n\nLenny (01:06:43):\nJust to push back, I imagine there are expectations of like, \"I hope this works out. I hope people adopt it. I hope it becomes the best email client in town.\" There's a sense of like, \"We want this to succeed\"?\n\nJason Fried (01:06:53):\nThat's pride, though. That's a matter of like, we want to be proud of the work that we did. We really hope people like it, and we want to keep doing it. To me, that's a sense of caring about the work itself. It's not so much about the outcome, which you don't control as much as you might think. Clearly, we want people to accept the work that we do and we want to find enough people who like it to make it sustainable, but I don't have them in mind. This is going to sound selfish, but I have me in mind first. Because if I'm not for me first, it's hard to be for someone else.\n\n(01:07:29):\nI'm for us. We want to make things that we're proud of, that we think are really good, that are unique, that brings something new to the world that doesn't exist, otherwise there's no point in doing it. That bring a different perspective that only we can provide because everyone has their own. We want to make sure ours is very visible in the products that we make, which is why we approach things very differently than most, and our products are very different than most. That's why they should be there. We should provide alternatives.\n\n(01:07:56):\nAs I said earlier, I don't like the word competition, because it almost sounds like you could be making the same thing. I want to provide an alternative, which is a different approach, a different way forward. It could be in pricing. It could be in the way something works. It could be in the flows in the thing. It could be the entire conception of the thing, but it should be an alternative. If it's not an alternative, it doesn't need to exist. Anyway, that's how I think about it.\n\n(01:08:24):\nBut yeah, there are expectations. Or I should say, maybe it's more like there are desires and hopes of acceptance to some degree, because it needs to. Otherwise, we can't stay in business. But really, it's like, are we proud of it first? We're wrapping up the HEY calendar right now, which is the calendar we're building for our HEY email service. I'm really proud of it. I have no idea what's going to happen. It's very unusual. But I'm really proud of the work that we did, and that's enough for me.\n\n(01:08:47):\nI think it's going to do well. I don't know, though, and it doesn't really make any sense to wonder if it will or not. It just, it will or it won't. All I can do is, be proud of the work that we're doing and be proud of the people who are doing it, and feel like we're putting something out in the world that we think should be here. Whether or not people agree is up to them.\n\nLenny (01:09:05):\nYou mentioned the principles of the company and I was going to touch on one of these actually. What's the URL to check these out? By the way, we'll link to it in the show notes.\n\nJason Fried (01:09:11):\nYeah. 37signals.com.\n\nLenny (01:09:12):\nOkay. Right, just the homepage?\n\nJason Fried (01:09:15):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:09:16):\nOkay. Amazing.\n\nJason Fried (01:09:16):\nYeah. Yeah. The homepage, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:09:16):\nOkay. One of them is, work isn't war. You wrote a book about this roughly, about Work Doesn't Have to Suck, but I guess, can you just talk about why war work feels like war, and then what maybe people could do to make it feel less like war?\n\nJason Fried (01:09:29):\nThis is about words in a lot of ways. I'm not looking at the page right now. I could pull it up and read it, but essentially, a lot of work uses war metaphors. You're targeting customers. You are conquering a market. Gosh, now I really want to make sure I get all these right. Hang on, I'm just going to look this up. Because these things are how people talk about work. It says, \"They conquer the market. They capture mindshare. They target customers. They employ a sales force. They hire head hunters. They destroy the competition. They pick battles and they make a killing.\"\n\n(01:10:10):\nThat's how people talk about business. I find that to be depressing. It just feels depressing to me. We use words to establish a perspective in a way of thinking about the world. And if those are the words that are in your head, then you feel like it's this war. This is the other thing. People are always like, \"What do the Navy SEALs do?\" And they're like, \"Heck, yeah.\" That's the Navy SEALs, man. It's not your software business. Why are we always looking to Navy SEALs to tell us how to run our business? \"The military, they've got a group of eight and they do these.\"\n\n(01:10:42):\nIt's like, \"Yeah, okay, that's that context.\" Can we not look at that for a second about ... That's amazing. What they do is amazing, obviously, but what you're doing is you're making B2B accounting software. Let's just chill for a second here, okay? I like to think of words that are more additive and alternative. \" We can exist. Let's exist. Let's make something great.\" Not, \"Let's beat them, let's conquer them, let's make a killing.\" Let's just make something great. I think that matters, and it changes the way you think about the work that you do.\n\n(01:11:16):\nIt's more about pride and excitement and a spirit of creation than it is destruction. I think if you go into it with destruction in mind, you're going to end up in a pretty dark place. That's our point of view.\n\nLenny (01:11:31):\nAwesome, I love that. Coming back to this bootstrap path, there's a lot to love about it. Independence, with that trickles down all these things that you're able to do with your company that other companies aren't able to.\n\n(01:11:43):\nFor someone that's thinking about going down this path and wants to bootstrap their company, that doesn't have a lot of money because it takes cash to start a business, do you have any advice for just how to get started down this path?\n\nJason Fried (01:11:53):\nYeah. First of all, it's hard. This is hard. When you have nothing, especially, it depends where you are in your life, too. You may have a couple of kids and you don't have a lot of time, and you got to pay mortgage. It's tough, so this is hard, but it's the reality for almost every business in the world that starts. The best advice I could give you is, and this sounds so trite, but really it's true, is, stay as small as you can for as long as you can. The only thing you can really control are your costs. You can't control the alternatives in the market. The competition, you can't control them. You can't determine the market itself. You can't control the economy. You can't control how much advertising costs, but you control your own costs.\n\n(01:12:39):\nThe other thing I would encourage people to do is, figure out how to do as much as they can on their own before they bring on a second person. Really work and struggle through something on your own. The moment you bring on someone else, you've got another mouth to feed. It becomes expensive. You got another personality to deal with the more you rely on them. And if they turn out to be the wrong person, you have to lose them. You don't have anyone to do the work that now you have them doing, and now you've got to do it. You're not going to be any good at it. You got to start as small as you possibly can and do as much of the work yourself as you possibly can.\n\n(01:13:11):\nKeep your costs in check. Don't spend any money on branding. Don't go get an office. Don't spend anything on anything, basically, except the tool you use. Let's say, it's your laptop or whatever you're going to use. Get a good one. They don't cost much anymore. 1,500 bucks or something like that, you can get a really nice MacBook Air or whatever. You need an internet connection and maybe you need a host somewhere or whatever, but use Squarespace to set up your site for 15 bucks a month or whatever. Don't go hire a web designer. Find all the efficiencies and keep your costs incredibly low, and don't make things hard on yourself.\n\n(01:13:47):\nThis is the other thing that all businesses at every stage need to keep in mind. While it's hard, things are relatively simple until you make them complicated. Simple can also be hard, but complicated is a lot harder. I think Brian Chesky had a really good bit on this, I think, on your podcast about how companies get complicated. And I loved that. When I was hearing it, I kept hearing this unfolding, this complex shape that you almost can't fold back. It's so complicated now that you don't even see where it came from. Now, it is what it is and you can't put it back in the bottle. It's just a mess, right? This happens really quickly and it can happen at a small scale, too. These are a bunch of things, and none of this is to say it's going to work. You could follow all those things and it could just completely fall apart. And it probably will. It's just the reality. I think something we use at 37signals, David taught me this, it's really a stoic thing, which is just the idea of negative visualization. What's the worst that can happen? You got to be at peace with the worst that can happen. Just role-play that and go, \"What's the worst?\" For example, we're doing these new ONCE products. What's the worst that can happen? Well, the ONCE model is totally different. It's not SaaS. It's you pay once, you download the software. You install on your own server.\n\n(01:15:09):\nWe're putting a lot of effort into this. This could be the wrong time to do it. It could be a total flop. This could not find any traction on the market. What's the worst that can happen? Well, we spent six months exploring something and having a really good time doing it. Our margins are there, so we can do it. I wouldn't suggest someone does this if they can't afford to do it. But we know this might not work, and we're already at peace with the fact that this might not work. That's, I think, how you ultimately are able to move forward, is to be at peace with knowing what's going to happen if it doesn't work out.\n\nLenny (01:15:42):\nI want to touch on Linear. One, it's interesting that you guys have a lot of similar philosophies. What is it about project management, task management software that creates this sort of approach to business? That's maybe one question, if there's something there.\n\n(01:15:59):\nAnd then, the other is, it feels like they have a lot of similar philosophies. Growth isn't a focus. It's gut and instinct. They have paid work trials. They're profitable. They don't spend a lot of time around VC money.\n\n(01:16:11):\nDo you have a feeling like this approach could work in the venture route? And do you see them as maybe an example of like, \"Hey, maybe we could adopt a lot of these things and also raise money?\" Maybe there's another direction here?\n\nJason Fried (01:16:22):\nYeah. I can tell you I don't know enough about them to comment on their ... I've heard some about them and it sounds like they have some similar points of view. Where those came from, I don't know. Maybe they materialized out of nowhere. Maybe they picked them up from someone else. Maybe they came up with them themselves. Lots of different ways to work. It's nice to hear that other people are trying some of these things and it's working for them, so that's great.\n\n(01:16:45):\nThe thing with the VC route, so the idea of having too much money, it doesn't mean you can't work efficiently and thoughtfully. But it does create a degree of sloppiness, because you don't have to. When you don't have to, and when I'm saying have to, you could say have to what? Have to do a whole bunch of things. When you don't have to, we don't have to make money, when you don't have to be efficient, when you don't have to be profitable, you just get sloppy.\n\n(01:17:15):\n\"Let's hire some more people. Whatever, we can afford to. In fact, they need us to spend the money, by the way. They didn't give us the money to save it and earn 6% interest.\" Which would be great now. Three years ago, 0% interest. \"They didn't give us the money to sit in the bank. They gave us the money to spend the money.\" What are you going to spend it on? Two things, people and marketing. Basically, that's what you spend it on.\n\n(01:17:36):\nWe can buy more ads. We can do more of this. We're going to do that. We can hire some more people, build up more teams, do more things simultaneously. There's a certain sloppiness in that. I think it just becomes harder when the environment encourages slop, which is why I think the value in bootstrapping is that it teaches entrepreneurs, it not even teaches, it forces them to have to figure out how to make money. The more time under the curve they have making money and practicing making money, the better at it they're going to get.\n\n(01:18:07):\nI used the guitar metaphor a bit earlier, I'll use it again. If you're playing guitar, if I give you a guitar and ask you to go up on stage and play guitar, you're going to suck. It's going to be horribly embarrassing and you're going to be terrible at it. You might be terrible at it a month later, but you'll be slightly better at it. You do it for six months or a year, you're going to be better and better. And then, five years and you're really getting good. Why do we think that a business that is sloppy, that doesn't have to make their own money, that is just getting pumped full of money by somebody else, can all of a sudden turn on the profit spigot and all of a sudden be profitable?\n\n(01:18:36):\nWhat you see is that they oftentimes cannot because they're just not set up to be that way. They've never played guitar before, and now they're being asked to play guitar. The reason I think it's great for entrepreneurs to start bootstrapping is because they just have more practice making money. They get better and better and better at the fundamental skill you need to have ultimately to run a successful business, which is to make money. If you don't have to do that from the start, you're just not practicing that. You're practicing spending money.\n\n(01:19:02):\nGetting good at spending money is not a valuable skill as getting good at making money. That's why I think it's just harder. But, of course, it's possible. It's just harder.\n\nLenny (01:19:10):\nWhat I'm hearing is, essentially, to do this well. You need discipline. Understand, here's the incentives they're driving me to; spend more money, grow faster, and being really good at not ... And then, also, it sounds like you just need investors that are on board with ... \"We understand. We're not going to focus on growth obsession. We're not going to focus on getting new teams. We're going to give you space to build it the way you want.\"\n\nJason Fried (01:19:33):\nThat exists. It's just also an outlier in that industry. I think what you need are constraints, is what I'm actually trying to get at. You need constraints. When you have just loads of money, you basically have very few constraints. That's what tends to lead to slop. Versus like, \"Hey, if we don't figure this out, we can't make payroll next week or next month.\" You just start to figure things out. One of the best stories I heard about this was Peter Rahal, who started RXBAR. Are you familiar with RXBAR?\n\nLenny (01:20:00):\nMm-hmm.\n\nJason Fried (01:20:01):\nYeah, little protein bars or whatever. There's a great article about this years ago, where he was talking to his dad about, I think, raising money or something. His dad's like, \"Hey, go sell 1,000 fucking bars and come back and talk to me.\" He's like, \"Just sell some fucking bar. Get out on the street and sell some bars, man. You've got products? Sell products. Go, sell.\" Versus all the things you could possibly do. \"Go sell some bars.\" It's just such great advice and it just cuts through all the crap. I like that scrappiness, and you don't get scrappiness from having large S. You just don't. It's just too easy not to have to do anything.\n\n(01:20:46):\nNot to say that VC companies aren't doing things. They're doing a lot of things, obviously, but are they honing the scrappy skills? Are they learning how to make money and have margin and be profitable? If they don't have to, they probably are not. I think at some point, and we're starting to see this now, this is not like an I-told-you-so thing, this is just, this is what happens. This is not me. This is just economic cycles. Money's harder to find, it's harder to get. Even companies who've raised money, investors are not necessarily putting in additional rounds. There's deep cuts happening, layoffs, pain and suffering.\n\n(01:21:23):\nIt's hard to switch from having a lot to not having enough, and then having to work as if you know what to do. I think there's a lot of confusion in the market now, at companies now, I should say, because they don't know what to do. They haven't had to do it before. I feel for them in a sense because, how could they be expected to know what to do? Just frankly, as I said earlier, if someone dropped 10 million bucks on me and 1,000 people, I would have no idea what to do with that. Truly, I would not. I would waste it is what I would do. If you don't have the experience, how are you going to know?\n\nLenny (01:22:00):\nI'm the same way with the newsletter and the podcast. There's no way I can grow this thing with money, really. I've tried a bunch of little experiments and nothing really does anything. It actually comes back to, let me find this quote that you have of just your business strategy in a nutshell. \"Just keep making great shit. Keep your cost in check. Charge appropriate prices for your work. Share as much as you can and let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\nJason Fried (01:22:22):\nThat's basically it. One of the things I don't think I said in there was, enjoy it. Have fun. Enjoy the ride. Love who you're working with and create a great environment to do great work, and so other people can do great work and thrive as well. That's all baked into that. It's not like, set targets. It's not, try to be a billion-dollar business. It's not, aim for an exit. It's not, be on the cover of whatever. It's not many of those things.\n\n(01:22:52):\nMaybe it's the Midwesterness in me, growing up in Chicago. I don't know. It's just that. The best business advice I ever got, I got from my dad. It's just a simple line. It's like, \"No one ever went broke making a profit.\" And maybe that's just my guiding light, ultimately. It's like, because you can go broke generating a lot of revenue. A lot of companies do. But you can't go broke generating a profit, and I think it's just really tight.\n\nLenny (01:23:18):\nWhat a great quote. Final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Let's talk about ONCE. This is a new product/umbrella of products you're developing. Can you just talk about the thinking here? And then, I think you guys are announcing the actual first product within this umbrella?\n\nJason Fried (01:23:32):\nYeah. The idea behind ONCE is, David and I feel like, we're probably a bit early here, but we feel like there's going to be a bit of a turn back towards the way things were. Pendulums always swing. And for the last decade or so, SaaS has been pretty much the only way to run business software. Basically, you rent it. There's really not a lot of alternatives. You rent software. We think that there's subscription fatigue and also some benefits to that, for sure, but there's also a lot of downsides just to ...\n\nJason Fried (01:24:00):\n... that, for sure, but there's also a lot of downsides to subscription software. You keep paying the same amount every month for the thing that you had last month. It's not like a magazine where every month you get literally a new issue. So that's new. I'm paying for new weekly or monthly, okay, that makes sense. I mean, I know there's new stuff that comes out in software products but let's face it, the core of the thing that you're using, 90% of the time is the thing you've been paying for four years now, every month. It just seems like, nah. So we are going to launch this thing called Once, which is essentially a brand and umbrella, a line, a product line of non-SaaS products, of products, not services, things people will download, software business offer products, people will download, pay for once and then install on their own server or a shared server or in the cloud, their own cloud or whatever.\n\n(01:24:53):\nBut they'll run it, they'll manage it, they'll pay for it once and there's no subscription fees, no recurring fees. They get updates, they get support and some of that stuff, but that's it. And so we're going to launch the first one shortly here and then we plan on doing, hopefully, maybe three more next year. And the beauty of these things is that what we're basically doing is we're going out in the market and looking at it, although we already know it because we've been in this world. But we're saying, what are the commodities out there? There are a lot of commodities in business software and there's like 50 alternatives and they're kind of all sort of the same yet they're all still charging luxury prices. In my opinion, if you're paying tens or hundreds of dollars a month or in some cases, thousands of dollars a month, month after month after month after month after month for when there's hundreds of alternatives and there's no price differentiation really between them, that's an opportunity. In every other industry, there's generic peanut butter, there's generic pencils, there's generic everything in a sense.\n\n(01:25:50):\nSo we're out there looking for commodities that are still charging luxury prices that we can create really beautifully tight, simple, essential generics of very high quality that don't do everything that the other products do, but get the core of it right, the 80-20, we get that right at a high degree of quality. And we can build these in typically three months each with two people. And the maintenance cost is zero to us, essentially. There's no marginal cost here because we make the software and we sell it and we don't have to maintain it in terms of hosting and the whole thing, which is what the expensive part of SaaS is. So anyway, that's the idea behind Once. And we, again, don't know what the market's going to think. I have no idea but we're really excited about trying this and seeing what happens.\n\nLenny (01:26:33):\nAnd then could you talk about the first thing you're launching or is that not out?\n\nJason Fried (01:26:37):\nYeah, sure. The first product we're going to be launching is basically an old product that we made way, way, way back when. So years and years and years ago, 2006, we launched a product called Campfire, which was-\n\nLenny (01:26:38):\nOh, of course.\n\nJason Fried (01:26:50):\n... a group chat tool.\n\nLenny (01:26:51):\nHow could you not remember Campfire?\n\nJason Fried (01:26:53):\nWell, some people are-\n\nLenny (01:26:55):\nAre younger.\n\nJason Fried (01:26:55):\n... 22 and they don't know, understandably so. But if you've been around, maybe you remember Campfire, which was a group chat tool, which is I think eight years before Slack came out or something like that. So it was really early and it was really hard to get people to even understand what this thing was, and a lot of people didn't get it. And then Slack came out, of course, and steamrolled it and really, really executed beautifully and did a great job. But chat has become a commodity. There are a million ways to chat with people now, and in the business realm, they're all still quite expensive and they're all month to month to month. You got Slack, you got Teams, and you've got a few others and it's like, you know what... And there are some open-source alternatives, by the way, that are free or cheap. But we want to put something back out there.\n\n(01:27:41):\nSo we're going to relaunch Campfire under the Once brand. You'll pay for it once, you'll install on your own servers, and you'll run it. And it'll do 90% of the things that you want to do every day and these other chat tools and do them very, very well and very, very simply and very, very easily. And we think it's going to be really interesting. And by the way, the other thing we're thinking about with these Once products, which is interesting, just get to this alternative point of view, is that these don't necessarily need to replace things. They can be in addition to. You might still run Slack at your company but you want to back up for when Slack goes down, or you want a special air-gapped chat for your executive team that cannot be leaked by another company where you're hosting data or having other people involved that might have access to it by accident.\n\n(01:28:34):\nYou can run things, you can have different tools doing similar things but for different groups in different contexts. Now, you probably wouldn't want to pay month to month to month to month to month for a backup system when something almost never goes down, but if you only have to pay for it once, it might be really... that's a good thing to have. That's an insurance policy to pay for it once and we just have it in our back pocket. The other thing we're doing with Once product is that you get the code. And so if you're a product team and you're curious to see how this product was built, and we've gone to great lengths to make it exceptionally well-built for this purpose, this is a book, essentially, of how to build this kind of thing really, really, really well on the CSS on the HTML and the Ruby on Rails side, for example.\n\n(01:29:18):\nSo you'll get all the code and you can look at it and you can modify it, you can play with it and you can tweak it. You can't resell it. There's a certain licensing but it's yours. And so if you want to change the layout, go ahead. If you want to add some features, go ahead. If you want to mess around, go ahead, it's yours. And that's another thing that's really novel. You don't get that in subscription software. So there's a lot of things going on that we're trying. There's some other really cool stuff. I'll tell you, one more quick thing about it is that we're trying to make this first prompt especially have as few words as possible, maybe 30 words. So we're picking tools that are... or picking categories that people already know how to use, and so we're trying to keep as many words out of this as possible so it's instantly essentially available for the entire world.\n\n(01:30:05):\nIt doesn't have to be localized. It's just like, it's universal software. We're trying to think about it this way. And when we do have a word, we're going to have a panel that shows that translation in a bunch of different languages. So it's not like you install this pack or that pack, it's like, you can hit this because different people in the world work in different countries. So we have people in different countries that work for us. I don't want to just have the Indian version because people in India might also have people that work in Brazil and they need the Portuguese version. So you can see all the different languages for certain words when we use them, which is a really novel thing.\n\n(01:30:34):\nWe're kind of playing, this is the whole thing like, these tools give us a chance to play and explore new realms and new ideas that we couldn't do with SaaS. This is one of the things I'm getting back to the first question you asked me, I think, or maybe it wasn't the first, but this is why I'm excited again. There's some novelty again, there's some new explorations again. We're able to do things that we couldn't do in other places. So there's an excitement that's building around this creative exploration again, and that's really firing us up.\n\nLenny (01:31:03):\nIt's clear how you're excited about this. You're saying how you thought you'd be happy just building Basecamp for the rest of your life, and clearly, there's a pull here, I'm going to try something totally new and different. Also, the domain is awesome, Once.com, right?\n\nJason Fried (01:31:14):\nYeah, that was fun. And we're still going to do Basecamp in here. So we're still doing SaaS. I still believe in SaaS. This is not going to replace SaaS but there should be an alternative. People should be able to buy what they need versus rent what they need.\n\nLenny (01:31:27):\nI think this is going to be an interesting experiment because this is how we started with software and then SaaS came and everyone loved this idea of, I don't have to worry about anything. I'm just going to pay you monthly and you take care of maintenance and hosting all that stuff and keep updating me with better features. So I think it'll be interesting to see if we've missed something leaving that world. One clarifying question, for updates, do you buy yearly, like a new Campfire every year, or how does that work if there's updates?\n\nJason Fried (01:31:54):\nSo the plan is, is that let's say you buy Campfire 1.0, this is the way software used to work. It's the same approach, which is like, you'll get all the 1.X updates for free. And you'll be able to decide if you want to update yours or not. So we'll say, hey, 1.1 is out and here are the new things and you get to decide if you want to download that and update yours or not. So you can stick with 1.0 if you want or you can skip a version, whatever you want to do.\n\n(01:32:19):\nIf when we get to version 2.0, there'd probably be... you'd probably have to buy it again, but we'd probably have a discounted upgrade rate. But that's like, you also totally optional. I don't know if we'll ever even get there. We might not need to. Have no clue. But we're leaving that door open that if there's a radically new version that we had to sink another six or eight months into or something, it feels right to say you'll need to upgrade. Maybe you get half off because you're a previous customer or something like that. So we don't know but that's the plan.\n\nLenny (01:32:49):\nI think it's also important for people to remember your target is not to replace Slack at big tech companies, like your market is the Fortune 5 million as you described.\n\nJason Fried (01:33:00):\nFirst of all, we don't have a sales team, so it's self-service, it'll always be. If some big huge company says... they look at their bill, their Slack bill and they're going, we're paying 1.2 million a year for this? Wait, wait a second, I can pay less than 1,000 bucks once for this. Maybe that's worth having, or maybe even if we don't use it, it's absolutely worth buying because maybe we will use it, or maybe we can experiment with it in this place. One of the things we're trying to do here is find a price point and it's going to be under 1,000 bucks. I won't tell you exactly where, but we're trying to find a price point where it's kind of becomes a no-brainer, like, you know what? We should buy this, we should have, this should be in our toolkit, and we should use this in certain parts of our business even if we don't replace this other thing, although we still might because we might find that as this group or these two groups or three groups that are using this are making exactly the same progress, why are we spending all this money elsewhere?\n\n(01:33:53):\nSo it's a bit of a Trojan horse, potentially. I don't know what's going to happen. No idea, but it's going to be pretty interesting. The other thing that's really cool about it, this is the tiniest market in the world, but because it doesn't go out to the internet, you can run it in truly air-gapped research facilities. There was a time way back in the day where the White House got in touch with us. This is when Obama was running and wanted to use Basecamp. But they're like, we need to install it because we can't obviously host this stuff on your servers. I know, I totally get it. We can't do that, unfortunately. Sorry. But they have security needs that are just far beyond what most things allow, but this is the kind of thing where they can actually be completely detached from the public internet and run this kind of software, which is really interesting. Again, tiny market, not what we're building it for, but it's a cool byproduct or side effect, I should say, of running things this way.\n\nLenny (01:34:49):\nAnd then did you share when this might come out? I know you don't promise dates but is there something you want to share there or is it-\n\nJason Fried (01:34:54):\nWell, unfortunately, we promised. We said by the end of this year, that's why I was getting to that. But we said by the end of 2023, and we're almost there, here we are in December, so mid-December, we're going to start to roll this out to the first batch of customers. It's probably not going to be available publicly to everyone in the world yet, but that'll come soon after. But the first batch of customers are going to get it and we'll slow-roll it out, figure out what we missed, what we need to tighten up and tweak. It's not really a beta as much as it's just a limited release, which is the smart way to do this, and then we'll open the doors very, very soon after that.\n\nLenny (01:35:30):\nJason, you're breaking your own rule of not saying by end of the year. Apparently, I learned earlier that that's never works.\n\nJason Fried (01:35:37):\nYeah, it's funny, we definitely said that and we said that six months ago and here we are, end of the year.\n\nLenny (01:35:45):\nIt's happening. So maybe sometimes it works out.\n\nJason Fried (01:35:47):\nYep.\n\nLenny (01:35:48):\nBefore we get to our very exciting lighting round, is there anything else that you wanted to share, touch on, or leave listeners with?\n\nJason Fried (01:35:55):\nI think one of the most important things though to remember, and I got to it in another answer, is just like, humans tend to complicate things, and a lot of things are hard but they're still simple until you make them complicated. And just keep that in mind that you can make a lot of progress with two people, and you can do a lot of great work four weeks at a time max, and you can figure things out as you go, and you don't need to know exactly where you're going, and you can be profitable business, and you can find customers who are willing to pay for things. These are all possible things to do. And you don't need to be a big huge company to be successful. And you don't need to be a big huge company to make significant amounts of money. You don't need to do that.\n\n(01:36:42):\nYou don't need to raise money. So it's like, all those things make things more complicated, actually. Some people think they might make them simpler, if I have a bunch of money, it's simpler. It's actually not simpler, it's harder. In a sense, the more... because those things come with expectations and again, they erase your scrappiness, and there are side effects here. Those things come with very, very thick and strong strings attached. And you got to think about what are those strings attach to and what do they prevent you from doing? You don't have a full range of motion anymore. So I'll leave people with that, even if I touched on some of those ideas earlier on.\n\nLenny (01:37:21):\nAnd that's a really great way to summarize it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nJason Fried (01:37:27):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny (01:37:29):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJason Fried (01:37:33):\nThe first one is this book here, so Several Short Sentences About Writing. Do you know this book?\n\nLenny (01:37:38):\nI love that book. I have it on my coffee table.\n\nJason Fried (01:37:42):\nWhen anyone ever asks me, what book do you recommend on writing? It's this one, Several Short Sentences About Writing. I can never pronounce his last name, but Verlyn Klinkenborg, I believe is his name, although I might be bastardizing that. But it's an extraordinarily good book about writing and it's all about the sentence, beautifully written, fun to read, really great. The other one is pretty much anything by Derek Sivers, but specifically, Hell Yeah Or No. I recommend this book to everybody. It's really had a big effect on me and David, specifically. We use this term, hell or no, all the time internally. Is this a hell yeah or no? It really clarifies a lot of things. And the last one is this design book, which is interesting. There's a few different versions of it. The one I have handy, it's called Home-made: Contemporary RussianFolk Artifacts.\n\n(01:38:35):\nAnd what this book is, it's a collection of... it's a beautiful book. It's very simple. Basically, every spread is a person, a story, and a thing that they had to make because they didn't have anything. They couldn't buy what they needed. They didn't have what they needed. So this example here is a guy put a hole in a spoon to make bubbles for his kid, to blow bubbles, large bubbles. This is a TV antenna made out of forks, and it's just like, getting back to the scrappiness, I admire this kind of ingenuity among or over pretty much anything. And I think that this book is full. There's a couple hundred pages. They have a couple different editions of this, but I love this one a lot. Look at this one. This guy had to make a door handle. I mean, in America, we're like, go get a door handle at Home Depot.\n\n(01:39:28):\nThis guy didn't have a door handle, so he made it out of a plastic, looks like a gallon oil can or some water thing, and nailed it to a book, which nailed it to a door. Amazing. And this is also why I've always loved... I know this isn't very lightning, sorry but I've always loved looking at jailhouse creations and tools and how people make weapons out of combs and pens. It's just, I find this like, I have nothing, I need something, I can use my human brain to figure out how to make it. I think that scrappiness is beautiful.\n\nLenny (01:40:03):\nYeah, I was just going to say it speaks clearly to your scrappy mentality. And what is that book called again?\n\nJason Fried (01:40:10):\nThis one's called Home-made: Contemporary RussianFolk Artifacts. And there's also an Eastern European one and there's another one too, but Home-made.\n\nLenny (01:40:18):\nWhat an awesome, unusual selection. Okay, next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nJason Fried (01:40:24):\nI don't watch TV. I rarely get a chance to see movies these days. I really thoroughly enjoyed Oppenheimer though. I mean, I went to the theater to see it, and seeing that in the theater was really special, but I just love the movie, is fantastic.\n\nLenny (01:40:41):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you are interviewing to hire?\n\nJason Fried (01:40:46):\nI think we actually went over this one a little bit, which was, I'm always curious about what else... if you had more time, what would you do with this idea? Another one is, whose work do you admire? So it's not so much about what you can do, but what are other people doing that you think is great? I find that, that really illuminates what kind of pulse they have on the world and what they're looking at and what inspires them and what they think is good. So I like that question.\n\nLenny (01:41:12):\nIn that second question, what do you look for? Is it someone that you also admire?\n\nJason Fried (01:41:16):\nUltimately, in the moment, I don't care who it is. It's more about, tell me why. So someone will say, I like so-and-so, I'm like, why do you like them? What are they doing that you think is interesting? This is kind of the thing I tend to always ask, which is, why do you think that that's interesting? I'm always trying to get behind the words and understand where this is coming from because people can prepare answers and they can sound great. But it's like, well, what's behind that? Where are you going with that? Why? What's the genesis of this? That's what I'm always after. And so whether or not I agree with the work or whatever, in the end, it plays a part to some degree but I'm more interested in, how did you get there?\n\nLenny (01:42:01):\nIs there a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nJason Fried (01:42:06):\nYes, although it's more of a category. I bought an old car, and I've fallen back in love with stick shifts. I learned how to stick, and then I basically have had automatic cars for many years and I got back into sticks. And now it's even deeper than that. I got back into the old analog driving experience and how wonderful it is to feel attached to the machine that you're using, that you turn the wheel and it turns it rod and it turns the wheels, and that your leg muscle actually is what's breaking the car, to some degree. There's something about that direct feel that really surprised me. It surprised me how much is missing in modern cars and it actually... I like to draw these parallels because this is how I see the world. It reminded me of our business, actually. I think we have a very stick shift business.\n\n(01:43:06):\nWe have a very direct business. Everything's very, very tight, very straightforward. There are not a lot of layers of abstractions. There are not a lot of things in the middle between the work we do and the way it feels, and I think of large businesses as automatic transmissions and modern cars where you just... everything's simulated. You don't really know what the road feels like. You can't really feel it in the steering wheel, or maybe there's some fake feel in there now. The brakes are just sending a command to a computer to squeeze the pads. The transmission is like, you don't control it, it just does its own thing. And there's a beauty in that too, but there's also a disconnect that I forgot about until I got back into driving the old car, which is harder to drive and noisier and bumpier and creakier, but there's a real directness to it that's really special, and I think it's actually a good way to look at business and to remind yourself that staying as connected to the thing that you're doing as possible has a lot of value.\n\nLenny (01:44:11):\nThat's an awesome metaphor. Next question, do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat yourself, share with folks, find useful in work or in life?\n\nJason Fried (01:44:21):\nAnd I don't always live up to it, but basically, it's worry less. There's a great Tom Petty lyric. I can't remember which song it's in, but I think it's on Wildflowers on the album. Most of the things you worry about never happened anyway. And it's just so true. I find myself worrying about all sorts of things that don't matter and never happen, and then you're like, God, I spent three days worrying about that, or I went to this appointment and it was fine. The amount of worry, and it's just all in your head, and it's all about anticipating the future that hasn't happened yet, and I try to tell myself that, and I try to tell others that in business. I try to tell myself that in life and in business, but also, I tell others that in business, what if people don't like... I don't know. You'll find out. Worry less about it. It probably isn't going to be a big deal anyway. So that's what I would say.\n\nLenny (01:45:12):\nWorry less.\n\nJason Fried (01:45:13):\nWorry less.\n\nLenny (01:45:14):\nFinal question, I was going to ask you this before you mentioned this, but you said you're writing a new book, potentially, are you able to share what this new book might be about?\n\nJason Fried (01:45:22):\nWe haven't started writing it. I can tell you, or I'm thinking about it, and it's going to revolve around the idea of gut and intuition in business and decision-making. I don't really know exactly how they all play in here in a book, but I think we need to celebrate gut and intuition more in business. And most business books are not about that. They're about the opposite in many ways. Whatever, you can't improve what you can't measure, or whatever these things are. And I think that's true in a lot of realms, like medicine, you can look at your biomarkers and you can do things.\n\n(01:45:59):\nI don't think things are quite as direct in business, and I think that intuition and gut is something to be celebrated. So I think what we're probably going to end up doing is looking at all the ways we use intuition and gut to make decisions at work, whether it's hiring or product decisions or policy decisions or whatever it is. Maybe break down some of those decisions in the past, perhaps, or talk about things on a day-to-day basis about how we employ those tools to move forward. So that's roughly the idea. It's very loose right now but hopefully, we can tighten it up and that's what I'd love to focus on that next.\n\nLenny (01:46:30):\nThat's an awesome topic for a book. I was thinking Worry Less could also be an awesome title for a book, if that's another topic-\n\nJason Fried (01:46:35):\nThat'd be a great title for a book-\n\nLenny (01:46:36):\n... to go down.\n\nJason Fried (01:46:37):\nYeah, that would be.\n\nLenny (01:46:39):\nI'm reading Charlie Munger's Poor Charlie Almanack right now.\n\nJason Fried (01:46:42):\nOh, beautiful.\n\nLenny (01:46:43):\nThere's a whole thing around the way we misjudge and make mistakes with our psychology, just like a heuristic [inaudible 01:46:50].\n\nJason Fried (01:46:49):\nHuman misjudgment.\n\nLenny (01:46:51):\nExactly. And I feel like that would be a part of this story of gut instinct are often right, but here's ways that we are often wrong, so maybe that's something to think about.\n\nJason Fried (01:47:00):\nYeah, it's funny. I had one opportunity to meet with Charlie Munger.\n\nLenny (01:47:03):\nOh, wow.\n\nJason Fried (01:47:04):\nIt was on a Zoom call, and it was four of us, and we got an hour with him.\n\nLenny (01:47:04):\nWow.\n\nJason Fried (01:47:09):\nThis was a few years ago. And I only asked him one question. I was mostly just a student listening to other people's questions. I said, what's your take on doing something well that you know nothing about? Essentially, is there power in being completely ignorant about something? I didn't add this but I've often found myself more creative when I don't know how to do something versus like, well, this is how you're supposed to do it, so you fall into this pattern. And I really loved his answer, which was, \"I would just... trust your instinct on that,\" which is like, a lot of great things happen because you don't know how to do them.\n\n(01:47:47):\nIn fact, a lot of innovations happen because you don't know how other people do them, and all you have is your gut. All you have is your intuition. All you have is how you feel about the thing. You don't have evidence, you don't have other examples to follow. You don't have a list of what to do. You just do. And I'm paraphrasing here. But it gave me a lot of confidence and hope to continue to follow our gut. And maybe this is, ultimately, in a way, what was the seed for this book perhaps, although I hadn't really thought about that until now. But it's a beautiful thing to read and to listen to him speak. I love it.\n\nLenny (01:48:29):\nJason, we covered everything I was hoping we'd cover. Thank you so much for making the time for this. Two final questions. Folks want to follow up and maybe ask more questions. How can they reach you if they can? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJason Fried (01:48:42):\nSo you can hit me up on X, Jason Fried, F-R-I-E-D.

We're not really selling in B2B, we're solving problems. Our job as sales reps in SaaS is to not sell a used car, okay? We are selling a Tesla Model 3 performance. It has competition, I might not need it this week, but it's pretty darn good. Let me help you get you into that Model 3 performance today. I've even got a special discount for the end of this month, and let me just help you. I've spent four calls answering all your questions and I've explained to you all the things and why the supercharging network is better than the regular one that doesn't really work at the charger near your house. I've gone on Google and I've seen there's no charging network near your house. There's only Superchargers. I got you, don't I? That's the job of SaaS and sales because we're not selling commodities.\n\nLenny (00:00:48):\nToday, my guest is Jason Lemkin. Jason created and runs Saastr, the world's largest community for SaaS and B2B founders. He also runs two of the biggest town conferences every year, one in the Bay Area, which attracts over 15,000 people, and one in Europe with over 3,000 SaaS executives, founders, and entrepreneurs. Before Saastr, Jason was the CEO and co-founder of EchoSign, which he grew to over 100 million ARR and then sold to Adobe where he ended up as a vice president of their web services business. If you follow Jason on Twitter or LinkedIn, you know how much wisdom he has to share about all aspects of building a successful SaaS business. \n\n(00:01:27):\nIn our conversation, we focus on what I find most product leaders have the least experience in, building a sales team. We get very practical and tactical on how long you should wait to hire your first salesperson, what your one to two first hire should look like, why you should actually hire two salespeople, not just one initially, how to comp them, how to interview them, when it's time to hire a VP of sales, how to avoid your salespeople flaming out and burning through all your cash. We also get into how to make the product and sales relationship healthier, including how to push back on sales and feature requests, why your head of product should be super involved in your sales process, how long you should make your trials, why you should avoid annual contracts, and so much more.\n\n(00:02:09):\nJason also shares advice for running a conference, which I found super interesting. This episode went long because I just couldn't stop asking Jason questions, but as a result, I'm excited to bring you this incredibly rich episode on building your sales team. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow this podcast in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. This helps tremendously and I really appreciate it. With that, I bring you Jason Lemkin after a short word from our sponsors. \n\n(00:02:36):\nLet me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product popups really annoying, \"Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature.\" These popups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say, they just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product, growth, marketing, and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. \n\n(00:03:10):\nThey use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps, and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny. \n\n(00:03:59):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth. Thousands of fast-growing companies like Gusto, Comm, Quora and Modern Treasury trust Vanta to help build scale, manage, and demonstrate their security and compliance programs and get ready for audits in weeks, not months. By offering the most in-demand security and privacy frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, and many more, Vanta helps companies obtain the reports they need to accelerate growth, build efficient compliance processes, mitigate risks to their businesses, and build trust with external stakeholders. \n\n(00:04:36):\nOver 5,000 fast-growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2 and these other frameworks.

Jason, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nJason Lemkin (00:05:03):\nHey, I'm so excited. Long time. What's the expression? Long time fan, first time dialer or something?\n\nLenny (00:05:03):\nCaller? \n\nJason Lemkin (00:05:09):\nFirst time caller, yeah, first time caller. \n\nLenny (00:05:10):\nFirst time guest. \n\nJason Lemkin (00:05:11):\nI don't know if that exists in 2024 or not, but yeah, that's me. So thank you so much for letting me come.\n\nLenny (00:05:16):\nIt's absolutely my pleasure. I feel like you're the kind of guy that I knew would be on this podcast eventually, and I'm glad that we're finally doing this. I also feel like we can go in so many directions. I feel like you have so many insights on so many parts of building a business, especially a B2B business, but I thought it would be most interesting to dive deep into building your sales team, essentially trying to help people figure out how to start their sales team, scale their sales team, and all the elements they go into it. How does that sound?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:05:46):\nI think it's great. I think it's an evergreen topic, but I think there's remains a consistent set of confusion, fears around how to build a sales team, and it's evergreen. The tools change and the pace has changed, but the issues, I love to dig into them because we keep making the same mistakes as founders and executives again and again and again.\n\nLenny (00:06:09):\n100% agree. It's such a black box to me. Sales, I've never done sales, and I'm always just like, \"I have no idea what's going on here.\" So this is how I learned from folks like you. You touched on this now. Now, I wasn't going to get on this, but I think it'd be interesting just this question of, does everyone need a sales team? Will you need a sales team if you're listening as a founder? Is it simply, if you're a B2B business, you'll need a sales team? How should people think about, \"Will I need a sales team?\"\n\nJason Lemkin (00:06:34):\nIf you truly build a self-serve product, you can either never have a sales team or Slack defer it or Canva really defer it. Canva didn't really build a sales team until they were well north of 500 million in revenue because it's epic self-serve. Slack started all self-serve, and by the time they went public, the majority of their revenue was enterprise sales. So you can sequence things. You can have hybrid models like a third of Asana's revenue is still from self-serve, and two-thirds are from a self-serve motion. So there's all different hybrid things. \n\n(00:07:06):\nThe most important thing though I've found is however you get those first 10, 15, 20 customers, be honest, be honest, and if you've talked to them as a founder and you know that they need a sales type motion, they need effort to deploy it, they have questions about security, they have questions about competition, they have onboarding requirements, and you say, \"Hey, I don't like sales, so I'm going to do a PLG motion,\" you'll fail.\n\n(00:07:34):\nOne of the things that I've done with so many founders over the years, and it shocks them at first, is your first 10, 15, 50 unaffiliated customers, the ones that find you from the ether, they're the next 50, 100, 200, 1,000, and you can either embrace them or run for them. Too many producty founders find that, \"Hey, gosh, I'm going to have to do sales,\" and they exit it. They exit it. \n\n(00:08:00):\nI'll tell you a company I invested in 18 months ago when things were easier, maybe 20 months ago, they were doing 5 million in revenue, growing over 100% with the sales like motion. Things got harder, things got harder as they did for many of us, and they decided to fire the whole sales team, and now they're doing less than one from 5 million with beloved customers. If I told you the logos, your jaw would drop. Over 5,000 20 months ago to 1 million today because they fired the sales team because the founders didn't like sales, they thought it was icky, they didn't want to do it, they were tired of doing it. I can tell you several stories like this. \n\n(00:08:34):\nSo you've got to be honest about the ... Sometimes we get it just right on day zero. Sometimes we know exactly how our company is going to work or Lenny's podcast is going to work. We can predict the future perfectly, but I find in B2B, a lot of times the industry, we end up winning. The segment of the industry, the type of customer is not what we initially thought and either lean into it and be a success or run from it because sales is icky and risk failure.\n\nLenny (00:09:00):\nWhen you talk about being honest, what you need to be honest about is that you need sales help to close customers?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:09:07):\nBe honest about that. Just be honest about, yes, the motion that it will take to get those first 10, 15, 20 customers, and if they were able to find you by putting their credit card and no one had to talk to them, then that's your DNA today. It doesn't mean you won't go up market later like a Slack or a Canva, but if you can get them all to do that and you never have to talk to them, then get really good at viral loops, get really good at almost B2C type motions, get really good at this kind of stuff and hire growth hackers and do the whole almost B2C-ish motion, which we have at self-serve, but if your first 10 customers come in and say, \"You know what, Lenny, I'll pay you $5,000, but you've got to solve this problem I have with online video,\" that is not a self-serve motion. It is not a self-serve motion.\n\n(00:09:51):\nEven worse, sometimes worse is your first 10 customers, five of them sign up online, but it takes a huge amount of effort for 19 bucks a month, and then five say they'll pay you $5,000 a month. Some founders are like, \"I'm going to work on the five that pay us 20 bucks a month, not the five that'll pay us $5,000 a year.\" I find too many folks that don't like sales, too many folks that have not had any life experience in a sales-led environment flee from those customers, and I've never seen that lead to success. We're surprised who our niche is sometimes. We talk about nailing our niche, but sometimes we're surprised that niche that finds us.\n\nLenny (00:10:28):\nThere's a lot of startups I've invested in that start off product-led growth and quickly realized, \"This just isn't working,\" and many of them move to, \"We need to actually hire salespeople and start to go top down.\"\n\nJason Lemkin (00:10:40):\nMost companies are a hybrid. Even there's weird hybrids like there's folks like Mongo and Snowflake. Mongo has, well, maybe Mongo's much better example, Mongo has a free low end version, and there's open source too. It's a little confusing, and then there's not a lot in the middle, and then there's a lot of big. There's all different ways to combine a product-led or self-serve motion with sales-led. Too many founders in the beginning think it's either or. It's not either or. \n\nLenny (00:11:06):\nSo I think the big takeaway here is sales is not a question of if you're going to need a sales team, it's a matter of when. The Canva example is crazy. Maybe that's the [inaudible 00:11:16]\n\nJason Lemkin (00:11:16):\nBut they still have one. But they still have one now. \n\nLenny (00:11:18):\nThey still have one. I think Notion, I think at 10 million ARRs when they hired their first salesperson.\n\nJason Lemkin (00:11:23):\nThat makes sense.\n\nLenny (00:11:23):\nSo I think the question that leads to is, what is a sign that you should start to hire your first salesperson?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:11:31):\nEven if you hate sales, even if you think it's icky, even if you don't like it, as a founder you've, 95 times out of 100, you've got to find a way at least to close the first 10 customers yourself. You've got to find a way. We could dig into how to do that if you don't like sales. The hack though is that even if you don't like sales, customers love to talk to the CEO. The customers love it. Here's the other thing, as a founder, you're really good at the product in the market, hopefully even in the early days. So what's important is even if you don't know how to do outbound, even if you don't know how to send a cold email, even if you don't how to do any of this stuff, and even if you don't know how to ask for a check, even if you don't know how to open or close, almost all founders are A+ middlers, A+ middlers, A+ middlers. Before we started, you and I talked about podcasts and content, and immediately it was an A+ conversation. Maybe you don't know how to close a big sponsor, I'm just making that up, and maybe you don't know how to find one, but once you have someone in your spider web, letting the conversation, you and I just had was A+, and any founder should be there by day one, by day one, and prospects love it. \n\n(00:12:40):\nIf I want to buy CRM, I don't get to talk to Yamini at HubSpot or Marc Benioff, but I get to talk to you and your CRM company. It's magical for early adopters. So bear in mind, no matter how bad you think you are as a founder, you're pretty good at the middle part of sales. So find a way to get any prospects, get really good at the middle, and then work up your courage. Work up your courage, and find how to ask for next steps and money. What would it take, Lenny? How can we get going on Riverside? What would it take? We would love to have you. What would it take to get you going next week? You've got to learn that little motion, but you don't have to learn all the stuff you think is smarmy other than how to go from middle to just ask for how we can get going.\n\nLenny (00:13:19):\nI like this term, middlers. So just to make sure I understand what that means, in the middle of the conversation, you're not great at initiating, you're not great at closing, but you could talk about it.\n\nJason Lemkin (00:13:27):\nYeah, and this is where sales reps are terrible. Most sales reps, once you go beyond the five basic questions, they can't tell you how a database works or how to eliminate hallucinations from your product or how to do payroll in Eastern Southern Guam. The sales rep, and we can talk about this, they need help. They need help from the founders in the early days. They need help from sales engineers or product people, which is my favorite place to get the help as you scale, but they need help. \n\n(00:13:56):\nThe beauty to founders is they don't need help in the middle. You can be 10 times better in the middle than any sales rep at your bigger competitor. If you're running, I am just making up CRM, but if you're running a new CRM startup, you can run circles around 98% of the sales reps at Salesforce or HubSpot. They have the brand, they have the partners, they have the integrations, but they cannot answer the questions you can answer.\n\nLenny (00:14:21):\nOkay. So you close the first 10 customers. What are other signs that, \"Okay. Now is really the time we need to start hiring sales\"?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:14:26):\nI think as soon as you've got those 10 customers and more than 20% of your time is booked up with customers, you need leverage. You need leverage. You've got to get ... If you do it too early, if you're not spending 20% of your time in sales and 20% of your time in recruiting, you're failing as a founder. You need 20% of each, 20% in sales and 20% recruiting. Nothing else really matters at some level as a CEO, maybe not as founders, but as CEOs. Once you cross the 20%, you need leverage or your calendar will die. So you need to hire one rep and you've got to hire two because otherwise, there's no A-B test. You have to A-B test humans. You have to A-B test humans. You've got to hire two as hard as it is, and there's just one cheat code to those first two. There's one cheat code. \n\n(00:15:13):\nI talked to so many founders that screwed up their first sales hires, and they always nod when they hear it. Those first couple reps have to be people you would buy your own product from. That's it. Now we can talk about other criteria. We can talk about normalizing for deal size. We can talk about industry expertise. We can talk about all this kind of stuff, but when you go out as a first time founder and interview 30 reps, and you're going to have to interview 30, and 20 are just going to break your brain because they don't do any work and they don't do any prep and they didn't even go to your website. Then eight of the next 10 are okay, but you know it's not really going to work, but you might hire them if you get tired.\n\n(00:15:50):\nIf you're lucky, one or two of them, they're like magicians. They ask the right questions, which we could talk about. Then take a pause and say, \"Look, no matter how strange their background was, whatever they did, it's not the right background. It's not our same deal size. It's not our industry. They actually weren't very good at their last job. They got let go at their last job, but I would buy from Lenny. I know. I've been doing this for a year. Every day, I would buy from Lenny because Lenny just explained to me my product and my customer's problems in a way that I actually believe. Forget about what's on her LinkedIn or his LinkedIn. I would buy from Lenny.\" \n\n(00:16:23):\nThat rep always works because you can trust them with those leads. Almost every first time founder hires someone because they worked at Twilio or CloudFlare or wherever, and they talk the talk and they can say ACV and NRR, and they can talk all these acronyms. None of which matter. None of which matter. We all get attracted to logos on our resume, but in our gut, I always ask them, \"Did you know that Jason was going to ... Would you buy from Jason?\" They're like, \"You're right. I wouldn't have bought from Jason, but he worked at Twilio.\" So just wait, wait and interview 30 sales reps, however you find them through LinkedIn, through use recruiters, use contingent recruiters. It's exhausting. Do everything. Work your network and then be flexible in the beginning. We're looking for pirates and romantics in the early days. We are not looking for folks with massive sales operations teams and enablement teams. You're looking for that quirky one that's got a few extra IQ points, that for reasons that make no sense has fallen in love with your little product that is so feature poor and does nothing, but they love it, they love it, they love it. \n\n(00:17:28):\nMy first rep I had this back in the day, he had gotten let go by a prior startup and he was struggling and he was living in his brother's garage at the time. This was not your number one person at Snowflake, but of all the 30, he came in and what's now Adobe sign? EchoSign. He described the whole problem. He described how we would solve the problem for our customers in the early days of this category. It was clear, whatever it took we needed him and whatever we needed to backfill the garage or whatever, this was the only one that could sell the product, and he did it for a decade. Closed our first five-figure deal, first six-figure deal, first seven-figure TCV deal. Didn't scale completely. Inside of Adobe was harder to scale inside of a 20,000 person company than it was in a six-person company, but he was still there. He still made that far to the journey, but he was the only one that I knew that I would buy my product from, not that I would buy something from, but I would buy my product from. \n\n(00:18:24):\nLeads are so precious in the early days. It's so hard to find leads. That's the problem. You hire this perfect person from Snowflake and you have three leads a month and you give him two and he doesn't close them, your company's going to die. Leads are so precious. That's what folks don't get. So wait, and I know it's painful, and I know most founders have hired this person with the right LinkedIn that they wouldn't buy their product from. Just keep interviewing. You need that quirky pyromaniac that loves your product and can sell it. They're out there.\n\nLenny (00:18:57):\nAmazing advice. Wow. There's so much there. I'm going to follow a couple threads there. In terms of the level, I know a lot of people make the mistake of going with a VP of sales pretty quickly. What's your advice? I know you talked about general attributes, but what's your advice for the level and seniority of these first two hires?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:19:14):\nTwo things, one that's evergreen and one that's maybe especially apropos for today's environment. The evergreen one, which I've talked about for over a decade, and I think folks that have been through it will see it, which is you need two sales reps hitting quota closing deals before you're ready to hire a manager for them. Almost all VPs of sales, their job is to take you from rep three to 300, to take you from three to 300, to take something that's just starting to repeat, a script that's just starting to work, leads that are just starting to come in. Then take Lenny and Jason, the two reps I have, as quirky as they are, they're crushing it. \n\n(00:19:55):\nThen I'm going to hire a more heterogeneous type of person going forward. I'm going to hire the person from Cloudfare. They can't all be like Lenny and Jason, they're pretty quirky, but at least I can learn from them. What's working? What are the objections? How do we get around that feature gap? We're one year old, we're two years old. We've got a lot of feature gaps. This integration doesn't quite work. How do we box around those issues? How do we sell our 10x feature? Because if you're a startup, your product isn't very good, your software is not very good, and you have a competitor, but you have some 10x feature that is driving people to buy you something you're doing that does not exist in the marketplace.\n\n(00:20:29):\nThe really good reps get insanely good at selling that, and the folks off the street, the new VPs often doesn't even understand the 10x feature. It's too subtle. It's too subtle. Why? The fact that your product is localized in Portuguese magically means you can win these deals. I'm making up something that doesn't quite make sense. So you need two reps that are hitting quota and then you hire VP of sales. If you hire it before then, you're doing a Hail Mary. It ain't going to work. It never, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever works. You're asking them to find product market fit to be the first rep, to be the second rep and scale it all at the same time. It's mission impossible to do all four at the same time. \n\n(00:21:09):\nSo that's the biggest mistake is, Lenny, I can't get sales going at my company. I can't do it, but I raised $4 million in my C+ round. I'm going to go out and hire the VP of sales. That VP of sales will not be there in eight months. You know what else? 2 million of the four will be gone because they'll never understand the product. They will never understand. There's so many things we could talk about, but if there's one thing I could reinforce for this audience, it's that early sales team, they've got to be product gurus for your product audience. They've got to be product experts. Later as you scale, they can't be or you can't scale. \n\n(00:21:42):\nWhen I started, when I came out of my own startup and started interviewing other folks, I remember I would interview a lot of folks at places like GitHub back in the day. I'd be like, \"Do you have a technical background? Are you an engineer? Have you ever built any software?\" They're like, \"No, I don't. I don't know. I don't know,\" and I was like, \"I was curious how you could do it,\" but GitHub was so well-established that it's 10 questions. It's 10 questions and grab a sales engineer. It's 10 questions and grab ... So you got to be really good at 10 and then you grab a sales engineer. That doesn't work in the early estate startups. So you've got to find these sales folks that are a bit of product savants and dropping the VP of sales in that isn't a product savant, which is a big issue. That's all mister or miss process. This is the issue. They're all mister or miss process.\n\n(00:22:24):\nSo the second point I wanted to make, and I was on the fence for years of when you hire a VP of sales, do they need to carry a bag? Do they need to sell themselves or not? Does it matter? Does it matter? I wasn't sure for a long time. The reason I wasn't sure for a long time, it's not that you don't want a VP of sales carrying a bag. I do think a VP of engineering also should commit code. We can talk about that. \n\nLenny (00:22:45):\nCarrying a bag, meaning close sales themselves? \n\nJason Lemkin (00:22:46):\nYeah, not just be a boss. \n\nLenny (00:22:47):\nHave a quota. \n\nJason Lemkin (00:22:49):\nYeah, have a quote. The reason I was on the fence was because I was like, \"Well, listen, in theory it's great, but let's say you're a hot startup and you want to go from two to six this year.\" So I want to add 4 million in new bookings, and let's say I can do 400K in quota per rep. That means I got to have 10 reps. She walks in with two. I'm at a race, aren't I? I got to hire eight in the next six months to hit my plan, and I got to put numbers on the board. If I'm going to out there as an individual contributor sales rep, I'm never going to hire eight people, am I? It's never going to happen. \n\n(00:23:20):\nSo I used to say I don't know if it matters, but what I've learned the last 18 to 20 months when everyone has gotten lazy, Lenny, everyone in tech has gotten lazy, is I see way too many VPs of sales that come in and never have any idea how to sell the product, never, never. They only want to be managers.\n\n(00:23:38):\nNow, whether they carry a bag or whether what they do is they join calls with the reps, whether they backfill the reps, you want your VP of sales in deals 20, 30 hours a week when they start. I see VPs of sales today start, they're in no deals. I'll go to a board meeting and a VP of sales will be there two, three months, and they'll have a look on the board. I'm like, \"How's it going with Airbnb?\" and they'll be like, \"I don't know. I got to ask John.\" Doesn't know because it isn't in the deal, isn't even in the deal. So I see this too often.\n\n(00:24:08):\nAnother company I'm on the board on, I really like this VP of sales a lot. He joined and six months in, sales were down from where, the new bookings were down from where they were six months before. He was honest. He's like, \"The biggest problem is I feel like I didn't have time to learn this product. It's a complicated product. It's more complicated than the product I last sold, and I just didn't have time.\"\n\nLenny (00:24:29):\nJason, this conversation is going exactly how I'd hoped. There's so much actionable advice here. Let me try to summarize a little bit of the things you've said and then keep going. So let me know what I'm missing here. I'm going to try to just highlight some of the important things you mentioned. So in terms of when it makes sense to start hiring your first salesperson, a couple of things you shared is you've closed the first 10 customers on your own as founders. If you're spending more than 20% of your time on sales and you need to start creating more leverage. I'll throw in one other thing I've heard and just to tell me if this is also true, that there's a repeatable process you've created. You can sell consistently enough or you can tell someone, \"Here's how I've been selling.\" Is that right?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:25:08):\nYeah. If you hire a VP of sales before then, it's approaching 100% chance of failure.\n\nLenny (00:25:13):\nI see. So you can hire the first two reps before you're like, \"Here's a pretty good process that has worked for me a number of times.\"\n\nJason Lemkin (00:25:19):\nYeah. Listen, as hard as it is for a lot of founders to even get their arms around, the reason is you've got to be that crummy first head of sales with them. You've got to manage those reps. You've got to be in the field with them. You've got to be figuring it out before you can hire the person. You just have to even if you're terrible at it because you're still going to be a good middler. You're still going to be a good middler.\n\nLenny (00:25:41):\nOkay. A few more things that stood out to me. One is hire two sales reps immediately, not just one. These reps you need to interview about 30 people. Eight will be pretty good, 20 will be terrible, and two, these are people that you can see selling your product and you would buy from them. They're often very quirky and not maybe a traditional sales background. They've never been VPs of sales, essentially. They're more like AEs and things like that historically or maybe not even salespeople historically. Is that right?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:26:10):\nI think you will regret it if you don't hire these first couple of sales reps that have a couple years of experience if you're in B2B with B2B sales. They need a couple of years of experience and they need a certain amount of maturity, and maturity is a real issue, and these are in any early hire because we just don't have time to babysit people. There's no onboarding, there's no training. So they need a couple years of experience, ideally something close to your deal size, we could chat about why, that would be nice, and enough maturity that you can trust them with that lead. You can trust them with your customer.\n\nLenny (00:26:43):\nOkay. Then you hire a VP of sales once you're ready to go from three to 300 reps. Your advice is also give the VP of sales a bag slash a quota slash they need to be doing sales themselves in today's world.\n\nJason Lemkin (00:26:56):\nAt least for a little while. More importantly, if they don't want to, I think in today's world you got to run from them. Exactly whether they fully carry a quota, a half quota, whether they backfill the sales team, you want a salesperson. Here's the thing, Lenny, you want a ... This is going to sound silly, but it's not. Trust me on this. For anyone watching, listening, you want a head of sales that actually wants to do sales. I got to tell you, and I'm still struggling with this myself after the last three years or so, so many folks in all functions, we could talk about other functions too, but especially in sales, don't want to do sales anymore. They don't want to do it. They don't want do it. \n\n(00:27:39):\n2021 was crazy because everything was too crazy. There's too much money, too much going on. 2022 was the knife falling. That was crazy too. 2023 was just hard. Whether it's burnout or whatever out or just too much change, I would say I've probably interviewed for different reasons, 50 VPs of sales in the last 12 months, I would say the majority don't want to do sales. It's my first screening question. That's why they got to carry a bag because it proves they actually still care about the craft. \n\n(00:28:12):\nThe best sales folks love sales. It's a craft. They love money. Yes, they love money, and that does matter. Do not hire a sales rep that doesn't like money. Trust me on this one. There's 0% chance they'll work out either, but they also like the craft. They like honing the script. They like beating the competition. They like figuring out the counterfeit. They like figuring out the weapon and the 10x feature. They like working on a team. They like hunting. They love it, but then sometimes I just think burnout is always a reality, but I just think that the last three years have been so yo-yoed, that folks are just, they're out. They're out. Don't hire them no matter how smart they are, and that's the test. \n\n(00:28:52):\nI'll tell you, I talked with a really great VP of sales candidate that had worked with a top 10 tech company and I asked him what he wanted to do in this next role. He's like, \"I've got a great team. I've got eight people that I can bring with me. We're ready to lock and load.\" I'm like, \"Okay. Well, let me tell you one of my views in today's world is that you've got to actually visit more customers now, not less. In a distributed world, it's more important to visit customers.\" He lived in the East Bay in Pleasanton in the East Bay, which is maybe 20 minutes east of Oakland. He said, \"I'm willing to visit customers, but I won't go as far as the peninsula in San Francisco.\" He's just happy at home. He's happy at home, Lenny, and he don't want to sell.\n\n(00:29:34):\nThis guy has the best LinkedIn and the best references, but he don't want to sell anymore. He needs a job. He wants to be a VP of sales. I see this across the industry and I'm struggling to find answers. I think the biggest hiring ... We talked about a lot of tactical hiring mistakes that you can make today in sales. The biggest strategic mistake you can make today in sales because there's so many veterans, there's so many folks that worked at Twilio and Mongo and wherever, pick any great company you want. There's so many veterans out there, you just can't hire the ones that don't actually want to sell anymore, and there's too many, there's too many.\n\nLenny (00:30:06):\nYou mentioned that you actually just asked them in the interview. The first question is, \"Do you actually want to sell?\" What other questions do you ask for either ... Let's go through both. You said you have these questions that you ask for the early hires and then the VP of sales. What are some tips for people when they're interviewing these folks?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:30:21):\nIt's interesting. VP of sales or VP of product, I look for the same answer. One of the Colombo style questions I ask them, and this is so odd. It barely even counts as a question is, what do you want to do your first 30 days? What do you want to do? Actually, I usually ask, \"What do you want to do your first two weeks?\" In B2B, if I don't hear from the VP of sales or the VP of product that I'm going to go meet customers, out, I'm out. There's too many VPs of product too, Lenny, that don't want to meet customers anymore either. The majority of VPs of products that I interview, they don't meet customers. Every single great VP of product, chief product officer I've ever worked with in my entire career, you know what the first thing they do in the first two weeks? They're like, \"Leave me alone. I'm going to go talk to 20 customers. Leave me alone.\"\n\nJason Lemkin (00:31:00):\nThe first two weeks, they're like, \"Leave me alone. I'm going to go talk to 20 customers. Leave me alone. Leave me alone, I'm going to go talk...\" They don't want to sit out on meetings and look at PRDs and talk out of their navel on endless internal meetings. All the best ones, they say they just leave. They literally say, \"Leave me alone. I will see you in two weeks. I'm going to go meet with 20 customers.\" And that's what products should do. Sales, whether it's prospects or existing customers, it can vary, but they should be like, \"On my first day, I want to join five calls.\" \n\n(00:31:29):\nAnd when you hear that story of, \"I don't want to travel out of Pleasanton,\" or they say, here's what you're going to hear from the wrong person for anything, even up to 50 million in revenue, \"I'm going to spend that first month working on process,\" \"I'm going to spend that first month getting Salesforce up and running,\" \"I'm going to send the first month on territory planning, Lenny, because we really, with our three reps, I really want to make sure we've nailed territories, right? Lenny will do the south, Elaine will do the east, Jason will do the west.\" \n\n(00:31:59):\nWhen you hear process, process, process, from any, from marketing, product, sales, customer success, too, boy, it's the death of customer success. It's just... And it's not that you don't need process, it's just, it's even worse than it was than a few years ago. And I know this is going to trigger some people, but the truth is they don't want to work. They don't want to work. They don't want to work. \n\n(00:32:21):\nI literally just got this LinkedIn email to work with me at SaaStr, from this person who'd been reading SaaStr for eight years. You're like, \"I want to run account management, customer success for you. Here's what's, you're doing wrong, here's how to do it.\" I'm like, \"Oh, this is pretty good.\" And I DMed her back, I'm like, \"Great. To be honest, you realize that you're actually going to have to talk to customers and sponsors yourself in the beginning.\" No response. Just out. Just out. And that was the best one I got the last 30 days. That was the best inbound that I personally got. \n\n(00:32:51):\nI know it sounds triggering or critical, but as founders, we have to be honest that there's this vast pool of veterans with great LinkedIns and great resumes that are so burnt out, Lenny. And let's not blame them. I know it sounds like I'm blaming them or being negative, and I'm trying to not be negative. I'm empathetic. I am empathetic to the burnout, but don't, you can't hire these. There's too many. \n\n(00:33:14):\nThe industry is littered with the burnt out. They're littered with it. And if you hear a touch of cynicism, if you hear anger, if you hear, \"I don't want to meet customers in any...\" and I'm going to say any VP role, product, sales, marketing, customers... If they don't want to meet customers their first, let's make it a 14-day test, you know they're never going to want to meet customers.\n\nLenny (00:33:33):\nThese folks that don't want to do sales that are VPs of sales, I imagine when you're further along, that's more, okay, because you don't need them to be doing sales, right? They want to manage, optimize. No. I see you shaking your head?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:33:46):\nI mean, okay, you think, okay, there's an element, let's call it north of 50 or 100 million, where for, what's sometimes called commercial sales, SMB sales, it really is all process. Okay? So for sure, I agree. But at Salesforce, they're trying to close $100-million-plus deals. You think that the sales leadership doesn't need to be in those deals? You think they can just hit refresh on the dashboards and track them from home? No. Marc Benioff today is still flying to meet customers. He said the other day, why does Marc Benioff go to Davos? He sits, and I've never been to Davos. He sits at the same place, at the top of some staircase. Okay? \n\n(00:34:26):\nAnd Salesforce drops millions of dollars, and he waits to meet customers, prospects, and partners in person all day, because it's efficient. Because it's efficient. Because he can do 50 or 100 customer or prospect meetings a day at Davos. He's still doing it at 30-something billion in revenue. Right? So this idea that, is there some truth at... For example, when I worked at Adobe back in the day, it is true that Adobe, which was, parts of the business, sales literally was dashboards. I get it. Okay, at four billion, 10 billion in revenue, but most of your audience is not ready to hire at four billion or 10 billion in revenue. They're not ready to hire that person. Don't hire them, right?\n\nLenny (00:35:08):\nI don't know, maybe Satya's listening. You never know.\n\nJason Lemkin (00:35:12):\nI think on the sales side of the business, they're flying out to the big deals?\n\nLenny (00:35:17):\nTo close the loop on this thread, when you're interviewing the early sales reps, those first two quirky folks, what are some questions and ways to know if there may be a good fit? You mentioned one of, you feel like you would buy from them?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:35:30):\nOkay. The one, really, the simplest one, and early in my career, I thought this was silly or hated it, this Glengarry Glen Ross. I don't know if it was Glengarry Glen Ross or that toxic Leo movie about sales, which is still entertaining. Yeah, one way or another, Lenny, it's got to be, \"Sell me this pen.\" But it's not \"Sell me this pen,\" it's \"Sell me this app.\" So I don't like surprises, I don't like games. I like to do this in a second interview or whatever. Give them time. And I don't like to judge too harshly, but whether it's the first interview or the second, they got to sell you this pen. They've got to put in the 30 minutes of work and maybe it's two hours.\n\n(00:36:07):\nBut here's the thing, today's world, you can go on YouTube or someone's website... There's an explainer video for every product under the sun, isn't there? I am shocked how many salespeople I have met, Lenny, from SDR to SEB of sales that, by the time... And I'm doing an interview for a portfolio company, this isn't a screener interview, they haven't even watched an explainer video yet. I could be the fifth or eighth interview, and they don't know how the product works. They have not even gone to the effort of searching YouTube or the homepage and watching it. \n\n(00:36:38):\nAnd forget about explainer videos enough. But so many companies do webinars now and they publish them on the... Really good stuff, customer testimonials. Right? If you're a sales rep, you don't actually have to know how the webhooks work or how to provision an API key, but you need to know the product as well as that webinar that's on YouTube. And 98 out of 100 folks won't bother in an interview. They won't bother. They're just going to click on \"Apply\" on the ATS and tell you, \"Hey, I recently stumbled upon whatever. It looks like... Do you have time to discuss.\" Right?\n\n(00:37:10):\nBut that one that actually does enough work and watches the video, and then can sell it to you, and they're going to make mistakes. They're not going to get it right, but they have enough confidence with the core problem to be solved. Because here's the mistake that 99% of founders and sales reps make. We're not really selling in B2B. We're solving problems. And this is why so many people are struggling in 2024, because they can't... their products, as sales reps, as companies, they can't solve big problems anymore. \n\n(00:37:41):\nOur job as sales reps in SaaS is to not sell a used car, okay? We are selling a Tesla Model 3 performance. It has competition. I might not need it this week, but it's pretty darn good. And I'm going to help you understand, Lenny, because you're in the market for the car, why this is the best one. I'm going to be honest about where it's not. I'm going to answer all your questions. I'm such an expert, and then I'm going to ask you, Lenny, when is that... You have 280,000 miles on the Civic? Let me help you get you into that Model 3 performance today. And I've even got a special discount for the end of this month. And let me just help you.\"\n\n(00:38:14):\nAnd I've spent four calls answering all your questions and I'm explained to you all the things and why the supercharging network is better than the regular one that doesn't really work at the charger near your house. And I've gone on Google and I've seen there's no charging network near your house, there's only supercharges. I got you, don't I? And that's the job of SaaS and sales, because we're not selling commodities. And that's why the best reps will also tell reps when not to buy their product. \n\n(00:38:41):\nAs painful as that seems in tougher times, in 2024, the best reps say, \"No, we're not there yet. We're not the right... If you need this feature, if you need this integration, I want you back in six months when you use this big product that isn't that great. But today, we're not the right solution for you.\" That's, the best ones do that. They have the confidence to know to close it. And the rest of the world thinks this is some sort of adversarial transactional thing and it's not. Right? \n\n(00:39:07):\nSoftware... I think hopefully all your audience would agree, when it's done right, software's magical. It solves incredible problems, incredible problems. What Airbnb does, what Uber does, what SaaS... Things solve... I can track my customers, I can manage, I can automate my communications. It's magical. You shouldn't have to use boiler room tactics and use [inaudible 00:39:30] tactics when you have something. But, it doesn't sell itself, except for a little while in late 2020, early 2021, that screwed the whole world up when products actually sold themselves.\n\nLenny (00:39:42):\nI feel like this is a separate podcast we should do of just how to get better at sales and how to sell. But, I feel like that's its own hour of conversation. I did a great episode with April Dunford where, I don't know if you follow her stuff, but she-\n\nJason Lemkin (00:39:54):\nYes. \n\nLenny (00:39:54):\n... essentially describes exactly your approach of help people understand the market, help them understand the entire landscape, and then talk about your problem. So anyway, we'll link to that episode. Has a lot of good advice there. In terms of this interview, selling-me-a-pen approach, to give people something very concrete to do. How do you actually set this up? Is it like, \"Sell me your product,\" and then they put together a pitch for your team and they pitch you on a product?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:40:19):\nI'll tell you, until the boom, until everyone in late 2020 got so desperate to hire anyone with a pulse, almost everyone in sales had to come and they had, during an interview process, they actually had to do the pitch. They would come and you used to do it in person with this screen. You can do it on Zoom now, it really doesn't matter, but do it for real. Do it for real, and everyone would see. And everyone in recruiting change, people stopped doing reference checks, they stopped doing these tests, and they would just hire warm bodies.\n\n(00:40:51):\nLate 2020, I can tell you a funny story in a second, and it was okay until it wasn't. And our hiring processes have not reverted back to pre-March, 2020, and I think it's failing founders left and right. I can't tell you, I would say 95% of the hiring I see out there, people don't do reference checks anymore, Lenny. And we can talk about when they work and when they don't, but no one does them. No one does them. You're going to invest so much... Forget about the salary, it doesn't really matter. So much time, your time, your leads, everything's so precious, to bring Jason into your company and you're going to go through all this recruiting process and you're not even going to do any reference checks? People don't even do reference checks.\n\n(00:41:33):\nAnd they don't, they stopped doing, \"Do me this demo,\" because they were so worried the rep would go to Gusto or would go to Deal, or would go to remote. There was no time. I got to get... This SDR has 50 offers. Lenny, we got to hire this SDR with three weeks of experience. We've got to decide today. And that's the way, and hiring does not come back. If those hires bounce, not only is it bad for you, but it's a disservice to the... It's worse for the hire. I mean, that poor CloudFlare woman that blew up with the thing, there's so many issues there we could dig into, but it's all Cloudflare fault for hiring her. Okay, let's forget about that she didn't close a single deal. Okay, so objectively, in sales, should you retain your job in sales if you can't close a single deal? I don't want to get into some of the triggering things, but remember, if you hire someone and they fail, it's all your fault. She didn't know what she was getting herself into. No candidates can do enough diligence ever. There's not enough time. There isn't enough time. \n\n(00:42:32):\nAnd this is true all the way to the top. And so, as an investor, a board member, it's funny, when I do interviews, I do this thing, I try to be the last interview sometimes, and the founders don't want me to do it. They want me to sell. I don't want to be the last one. And what I want to do is when, Lenny, you've decided to join Ellen at her startup, right? At the end, I said, \"Look, Lenny, I've talked to Ellen, she loves you. You have the job. You've got the job. What I don't want you to do, Lenny is bouncing three months after. So let's slow down, let's talk about the questions you have on your mind, and let's have a safe space where we can make sure you're going to be happy and successful there.\" Right? \n\n(00:43:09):\nAnd sometimes even the founders get mad at me for doing this, because sometimes, the candidate bails. But I'm like, \"I know you're mad at me today, but it is your fault. A hundred percent your fault if any of your hires fail. Don't blame them. And I'm guilty of this. I get upset when people start and they don't give it their all or they don't do it. I mean, what if you hired someone for your podcast and they decided, \"You know what? I don't want to do the podcast this week. I'm tired. I'll do it...\" You're so mad at them, but you should've seen it during the hiring process. Right?\n\n(00:43:44):\nSo, tying it back, that's why you've got to do this, \"Sell me this pen.\" You've got to, before you hire the salesperson, have them sell your product real. Do the demo. And if they need more time, give them more time. Let them watch another demo. Don't have them feel like it's a trap or spook them. Treat them the way you would like to be treated. But if you skip this step, I mean, what's the point? You're not helping them.\n\nLenny (00:44:09):\nWhat I love about this process is it connects exactly to what you recommended you look for in these hires is, \"Would I buy my product from these people?\" So this makes a lot of sense. And you give them this assignment at home and they do work on this and they come in, right? It's not like come to the office?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:44:22):\nIf you talk to a great transactional VP of sales that's hiring tons of reps that do it, they'll make them do... If they're still doing this, they'll make you sell the pen fast in the process. They don't have time. They're doing 20 interviews a week, 30 interviews a week, you've got to sell me this pen. But if you're a founder and I'm talking about you've already talked to a bunch of candidates, you're down to one or two, make them, tell them, \"Look, this isn't a trick. I'm not that great at telling my product myself, but I got to know that you're going to be happy and successful here. So do a demo for me.\"\n\n(00:44:49):\nAnd if they won't do it, they're not a salesperson. And too many people went into sales, not... The other weird thing about B2B sales in good times is actually, a lot of these folks are not really what you might think as salespeople. They can't do outbound, they can't pick up the phone. All they know how to do is to manage leads that come in and say, \"I want to buy today.\" And you need those people, too. Okay? And I'm not saying you don't need those people, too, but that's not always what we think of as sales.\n\nLenny (00:45:16):\nAnother black box for me, and I think a lot of people with sales, is comp and quota, had actually set up their comp for early hires, and then how to actually decide on a quota. What advice do you have for figuring that out early on? What percentage is commission, what percentage is salary? All that-\n\nJason Lemkin (00:45:31):\nYeah, everyone gets this wrong. We worry... Look, at scale, when you're extremely mature, extremely mature, and very profitable, you really got to tweak this stuff very carefully, and we could talk about that if it's relevant. But, in the beginning, we get this all wrong. What matters is, can a sales rep close more than they take home? In the very beginning, that's all that matters. It's just you selling, right?\n\n(00:45:58):\nThe first three months of a new rep, you're lucky if they can close as much as their take-home pay is, their OT. And so, in the really early days, my early, early day comp plan is, look, your first three months, you keep a hundred percent of what you close. Of course, that's not profitable for the business, but you've got to invest in them, right? You keep a hundred percent of what you close. And if you have enough going on in your business, usually, that's enough to put supper on the stove. \n\nLenny (00:46:24):\nAnd that's without a salary? \n\nJason Lemkin (00:46:26):\nNo, no. You pick an OT, a salary, but you got to... Okay, let's step back for a minute. You got to pay market. You got to pay market. And in the early days, if you're bootstrapped or really lean, this stresses folks out. I just talked to this great rep, Lenny, but he wants 150k OTE. And in fact, it's a step down. He had 170k at Slack, but he knows this isn't a startup. He wants 100. He might take 140.\n\nLenny (00:46:53):\nAnd OTE is total comp, overall total comp.\n\nJason Lemkin (00:46:54):\nTotal comp. And the founder panics. \"I don't have, I'm only making 60. How can I pay 140?\" Well, let's break it down for a minute. First of all, let's be tactical. It's usually 50/50, right? 50% base, 50% bonus for a sales rep. So they're really only taking home a 70k base, trying to make another 70. Okay? Then 70 divided by 12, help me do my math. It's not quite 6k month. Well, maybe with taxes it is. You're really only paying 6k a month for a couple months to see if this experiment works out. You're investing 20,000, you don't have $20,000 to do sales? Then don't do sales, if you can't find $20,000. So people freak out too much about this comp-line number, this base and bonus, the on-target earnings, OTE, and they're not more practical about what am I committing to cash upfront? \n\n(00:47:44):\nTwo, you need a plan where it's a win-win. So if this person makes 140, but ultimately, a sales rep's got to bring in four to five times what they take home. That 140's got to be 500, 600 or more. The more enterprise you are, the bigger the multiple has to be, and the higher the comp. But it's got to be 3x to 5x at a minimum, 3x for small businesses, 4x for mid-market, 5... You got to get there, but you don't have to be there on day one and two. When you get there, the reps should be accretive, shouldn't they be? If they make 150 and they bring in 450, unless your marketing costs are out of control, which can happen, but that's not sales fault is it? If your marketing costs are reasonable and you pay a sales rep 150 for closing 450, if you engineer your plan right, you should be smiling, not frowning.\n\n(00:48:34):\nWhere it gets tough is when you have a ton of folks not closing. When you have a ton of folks not closing and you have extremely high marketing costs, then it all breaks. Your cap breaks, your payback period breaks. But, if you have inbound leads, if you have demand, and you have sales reps that can sell you this pen, they're going to be accretive, Lenny, because of that math. And take the pressure off, don't make them close 5x their take on their first quarter, make them close 1x. Let them put points on board, let them eat. And so negotiating, here's the point if you think about it. Negotiating someone down from a 150k OTE to 130, it's not going to make any difference. You want them to close 600 or 700. It's not going to matter. \n\n(00:49:15):\nAt scale, does it matter? For Mongo maybe. Maybe. But, what you care about is how much more can they close and they bring in? And then you, that's why you want them to make a lot of money. You want them to be rich. You want them to take home a lot for a whole bunch of reasons. And so, don't freak out about the acronym OTE, what they take home. Figure out what it's really going to cost you and would you buy from them? And if you would, they're probably going to bring in more than they take home. Right? And on the marketing side, in early days, you're lucky if you can find a marketing channel that is that accretive.\n\nLenny (00:49:49):\nAmazing. Okay. So just to summarize, you start a sales person with, say, 75k in salary and then say 75k in expected sales. And they take-\n\nJason Lemkin (00:50:01):\nBonus, bonus.\n\nLenny (00:50:02):\nBonus.\n\nJason Lemkin (00:50:04):\nBonus from sales, yep. \n\nLenny (00:50:05):\nBonus from sales and the the idea there is they take 100% initially of their sales, for the first month or two, just to make it feel amazing. They're making money. See how they're doing, don't put a lot of pressure on them. And then the plan is, over time, get it to a point where they're bringing into the business four to five times what they're taking home in terms of bonus.\n\nJason Lemkin (00:50:24):\nYeah, yeah. \n\nLenny (00:50:25):\nI set expectations every month or two, or is it every quarter? We're going to revisit your comp and quota and adjust.\n\nJason Lemkin (00:50:32):\nIf you get it right, you never have to revisit it. Not for years. I mean, I'm using the same sales comp plan I have for a lot of years. It still works. Listen, you can make tweaks and you've got to listen, and we're all human beings. And people, and again, remember, your sales team has to eat. They've got to eat, okay? And you've got to be somewhat competitive. But, there's only so much you can tweak, Lenny. I mean, they have to bring, close more than they bring home. Right?\n\n(00:50:55):\nAnd so, you can make tweaks at the margin. The problem is if you make too many tweaks to this model, you burn up all the cash. You're trying to plug a leaky boat, there's no point. There's no point. There's no point. And remember, related to this, for a long time, for most folks, unless you're, even if you're hyper funded, you're better off with fewer, better reps than more reps.\n\n(00:51:18):\nThere is a stage when you get big enough where this concept of capacity planning really does matter. Lenny, if I got to go from 50 to 100 this year, okay? I'm going to add 50 million. If each of my reps can do 500k, I need a hundred, don't I? Okay. And literally, if you have 20, you mathematically cannot hit the plan. So there's a certain truth at scale. In the early days, this is a rookie error. I'd much rather have two reps, each closing a million than 20 reps struggling to close 100k each. Culturally, it's terrible. There's no domain knowledge in the company. Everyone's miserable, everyone's fighting. \n\n(00:51:50):\nWhat you want to do in the early days is concentrate your leads and your best closers, at the same time, bringing new people up. But you've got to concentrate your leads to your best closers. And that means year two, year three, year four, they should be making a lot of money. Lot of money, sometimes too much. I remember the first investment I ever made was a company called Pipedrive, which sold for a billion and a half. SMB CRM, and I put in the first sales rep there. He used to work for me. And the founders got mad at him. They got mad at him, because in three months, he was making more than any of the founders. They were pissed. \n\n(00:52:21):\nI'm like, \"Guys, I know we're have different backgrounds and cultures, but this is what you want.\" But it took them a long time culturally as self-serve... Because Pipedrive was 100% self-serve at the time. They'd never had a sales rep. And I put the guy in, and what he did was he went and he looked, all these self-serve customers, he's like, this was the company was about two million revenue at the time. And he's like, \"Okay, who's bought more than one seat?\" He just did a reverse sort and he called them. \n\n(00:52:48):\nI remember he called AOL back in the day and he's like, \"You guys have 20 seats of Pipedrive. Would you like to buy more for your sales team?\" They're like, \"Thank you very much. We'll take 100 seats.\" And he just went down the list, from the top to the bottom, and he took home 20% of those deals. Now that difference, that extra 80 seats at AOL, he brought it in. So Kim, keeping 20% of that is a great deal for the company, right? But he was pretty good at it and he was the only person for a while, so he made hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars when the poor company, the founders were paying themselves 50.\n\nLenny (00:53:20):\nSo your advice there is don't be sad if your salesperson is making tons of money.\n\nJason Lemkin (00:53:25):\nIf you architect the simple sales fund we talked about, and they're making a lot of money, you're making a lot of money, and your equity is worth a lot of money, your equity is worth a lot of money. Right?\n\nLenny (00:53:34):\nWhen do you make that switch from they're taking home 100% of what they're selling to smaller percentage?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:53:40):\nLook, some people are going to think it's goofy what I said about 100. I just view it as a simple ramp. I think you do it for one quarter max. One quarter. The problem is if you let this go for too long, more than a quarter, if you make it too easy for long a quarter, the problem is the mediocre lean into it too much, and that doesn't help. And not only does it not help you, it doesn't help them. You don't want to make mishires. They're so damn... I mean, you could have a whole podcast only just on mishires. It's probably the single most important thing in scaling startups. It's not hires, it's mishires.\n\n(00:54:12):\nIt's a tragedy if you mis-hire a rep, but you don't want them there six months. It's not good for them either. You want to support them, you want to help them find a place where they're successful. And here's the quirky thing on the mishires, and this is why that first guy I hired was mid-pack. He was less than mid-pack. Here's the thing about sales is, someone can be very good in certain sales environments and completely fail in other ones, completely fail. It's probably more binary than any other function. And so you got to find it before you hire them, but you also got to root it out fast, because those leads are too precious.\n\n(00:54:44):\nAnd it doesn't mean they won't go on to another company and be wildly successful, but you could utterly fail. And the one related point I'll give, if I had to throw one hint on this first, any of these reps, first 10 and VP of sales, one hint more than anything else, trust... got to hire someone whose last product was harder to sell. This is so important. This is a recipe for utter disaster. If you've, take someone in sales and their last product was easier to sell, they will have none of the skills to sell your product. But, this is the... and I'll give you an example in a second. \n\n(00:55:27):\nIf you hire someone from something that was just a smidge harder, a smidge harder to sell, and they come into your company, it's like they're on Mars. It's like weight has been released from their feet. They learned how to sell a harder product and get it done, and then they come to you. And the first example I had, the first SDR I hired was a guy named Sam Blond, who went on to be CRO at Brex, and then now is a partner at Founders Fund. We worked together from the very beginning, first SDR. And he came, before that, he was an SDR at a company called Intacct, which was bought for a billion, which was online financials. Okay?\n\n(00:56:03):\nAnd back in the day, we know what the one thing people didn't want to put in their cloud was? Their financial statements, okay? It just wasn't trusted that. There are some things you would trust to the cloud, like A CRM, but they'd be like, \"These are my crown jewels. I can't put these...\" So he went from desperately trying to convince folks to move a business process to the cloud. They had no interest. And he came to us, and it was hard, but it wasn't that hard. And he instantly was number one. He went from SDR to SMB-AE to mid-market AE to director of sales, to head of this whole sale... \n\n(00:56:31):\nBecause, I mean, there are many reasons he was great, but he came to me and I said, \"Sam, why are you crushing it when everyone else here is struggling?\" He's like, \"This is much easier than Intacct.\" So hire someone like that and don't make... No matter how much you like them, the sell me this pen thing will control for it a bit, okay? But, when we give, we give, we give in the hiring process. We never give what we want. Be very, very careful if the last product was easier to sell.\n\nLenny (00:56:57):\nI love this advice. What is a heuristic that the last product was harder to sell than yours? What tells you that that's probably true?\n\nJason Lemkin (00:57:04):\nBe very careful if it was more technical, very technical. Some folks can go from a business process sale. They can go from selling a Gong or a sales software and outreach, and they can go sell a complicated API to VPs of engineering or VPs of product, but most can't. Okay? So more technical is a tough heuristic. More competitive is a positive. What really works, Lenny, is if you hire someone from the number four in the space and they did well. You take someone that was number four in the space and then you're number two in the space? You think number two's really hard because number one's crushing you? But they're at number four in a space where no one can tell the difference between these products? That's a great one, right? So a space that's more competitive, a space that is a positive, more technical.\n\n(00:57:55):\nThe other one related to technical, on the pure B2B side, is much more complicated business process. I see folks fail in B2B when they've sold us... Yeah, it's hard, but they've sold a simple business process. They go to something that's got a lot of integrations, a lot of complexity, and a lot of business process change, and they just melt because it's too complicated. They just melt, right? There's a company I invested in, it's doing over 20 million today. And for some reason, to simplify what they do, which is pretty complicated, they called it the Gong for X. Okay? The Gong for X.\n\n(00:58:30):\nAnd it's great to get a VC meeting and a few other, but it's not even on their homepage, okay? It doesn't really make sense. And the CEO had me listen to this senior sales exec he hired, and the only thing he could tell the prospect was that they were Gong for X. And the prospect kept asking, \"Well, how does this deep integration with this business process flow and Zendesk works, and how does this go over to Salesforce?\" He's like, \"Well, we're Gong for X.\" That $600,000 deal was lost. Right? \n\n(00:59:00):\nBut, maybe that works in some space, right? And Gong's hard to sell today, too, don't get me wrong. But you see my point, it's just that simplicity, it's too complicated, right? And I know it's not the perfect heuristic, other than this technical thing, but the technical one, man, trust me. Too many B2B type reps melt in B2D. They just melt. They just, selling to VP of eng is a different... It's the same beast, but they don't suffer fools, do they? Not the VP of engineerings I'm close. They don't suffer fools.\n\nLenny (00:59:32):\nI haven't heard this term, B2D before, business to developers. \n\nJason Lemkin (00:59:35):\nTo developer, yeah. \n\nLenny (00:59:36):\nI imagine that what it stands for. Oh, interesting. Haven't heard that term before. Okay, let me zoom out a bit and I want to move on to a different topic. But before we do that, so we've talked about kind of these early days of hiring your first two reps, getting your VP of sales to help scale out the team. To give people a sense of where this goes, as the business scales, what does the org evolution look like? You have these two reps doing sales on their own, then you have a manager. What does it look like over the next couple phases of the sales org?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:00:03):\nLook, to simplify, there's rules of eight. So in sales, I'm actually not sure what the tip of heuristic is in product, because product teams are leaner, at least I hope. I like it when they're leaner. But the thing about sales is there's no efficiency. If you have a sales-led motion, half your company is going to be in sales at 10 millionaire, half your company is going to be in sales at 50, half your company is going to be in sales at 100. \n\n(01:00:27):\nOne of the tough parts of the software model is that there's no, there's actually almost anti-efficiencies in sales. The public companies are actually less, they have the higher CACs than startups, believe it or not, because they have so much market penetration. So you're going to need a lot of people. And it's rules of eight, eight SDRs, outbound reps need one manager, eight AEs, eight sales execs need a director above them.\n\n(01:00:51):\nAnd then when you really scale, eight directors. You don't really ever going to have eight directors, but eight directors could have a VP or eight reports. And so there's rules of eight. If you want to build an organization on it, it's all rules of eight. For a while, for SDRs, thinking this was this high velocity entry-level position, people pushed it to 12. But the more folks I talk to today, the more I hear, everyone's reverted to eight. I'd rather have fewer SDRs, having better conversations. And so it's just, you can build your whole org with eights.\n\nLenny (01:01:21):\nThat is way too easy of an answer. So the idea there is you hire this VP of sales, then you hire six more sales reps, AEs. So what happens next? You hire another-\n\nJason Lemkin (01:01:32):\nGot to start hiring managers.\n\nLenny (01:01:32):\nManager, got it. Yeah. \n\nJason Lemkin (01:01:33):\nYeah. \n\nLenny (01:01:34):\nAnd then you scale eight more reps.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:01:35):\nAnd once you have eight AEs scaled, you almost always are going to start, a VP's going to already... A good VP of sales already be hunting two directors.\n\nLenny (01:01:44):\nTwo directors. \n\nJason Lemkin (01:01:45):\nWhether they're just split up normally, whether they're east, west is a classic way. Another way, you might have smaller and larger customers. That's pretty standard, right? Commercial and enterprise. But a good VP of sales, once you have, she or he has eight reports, will be bringing in two directors, or maybe two VPs if they're an SVP. There's a lot of title-\n\nJason Lemkin (01:02:00):\n... directors or maybe two VPs if they're an SVP. There's a lot of title inflation today, which doesn't bother me nearly as much as a lot of other things we've chatted about. I don't care what your title is if you'll actually do sales or do work, but yeah, we need to bring in managers at 8:00. And folks that can, also, a related point is, a lot of founders were, \"When will my ... \" I really love my head of sales, but she's a stretch. Most of them should be stretches.\n\n(01:02:25):\nIf you hire the seasoned one, they're not going to work, so for 95 out of 100 of us, our first head of sales should be a stretch VP of Sales. And what that means is, usually, they were a director before that or a senior director or sort of a VP, okay? But you should be cautious about hiring your first VP of Sales for their first third VP of Sales gig. They're not willing to do the job anymore. You need a stretch and it's worth it for their career growth. It's worth it for their personal growth. It's worth it for the equity, right? So you're going to hire a stretch. That's an important tip right there. But then, you're going to be a little worried, how far can Lenny go? How far can ... I love Lenny, but he was a director for two years before this, and this is his first rule, and he did so good last year, but I'm worried Lenny's going to break. I'm worried Lenny's going to break.\n\n(01:03:09):\nAnd related to this quote, the simple answer is, Lenny will break if he can't source those directors under him. You can scale forever as a sales leader if you can hire better managers under you. And it's true of any functional area, but what you'll see in sales is, you'll see your stretch VP of Sales drown when they never can hire better managers under them, They'll end up doing some weird internal promotions, which you want, you want to do internal promotions. My rule is you want to promote 50% from within and hire 50% without for your managers, but if, really, the only people you can promote are just junior people on your team, you can't find leaders, you can't scale. I do see this happen too frequently is, a first time out of sales, does it, and then, they're like, \"Here are my managers, Lorraine and Jason, but they really were just reps for two years and they don't know how to do it.\" So you have a whole bunch of people who don't know how to do it. That's when the organization cracks.\n\nLenny (01:04:06):\nImagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers, including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs, and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated 2x to 5x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in.\n\n(01:05:11):\nMake B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.\n\n(01:05:26):\nThere's these terms that we throw, around account executive reps. It might be helpful just to give people a sense of what does this actually mean when someone's an account executive. Is it that they're just sitting there calling and doing sales directly? Whatever the key terms are for the roles or the title might be helpful to quickly summarize.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:05:42):\nYeah, I think the two ones that are probably less obvious for folks that are new are SDR, Sales development representative, and AE, account executive.\n\nLenny (01:05:42):\nOkay, great.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:05:49):\nAnd SDR is, generally, although I wish it wasn't, it is generally an entry level position, often fresh out of school, generally paid on the order of 60K to 80K, OTE and SaaS and US-based SaaS, and their job is to email for dollars, dial for dollars, and in many cases, to screen, to screen inbound leads. It's entry level, and their job is to pass on a lead to a sales executive, an account executive, an AE. Not all companies have SDRs. It's a longer topic, but pretty much all the best teams have some type of SDR function now because we've learned we want to specialize. We want openers opening and we want closers closing, so that's the rough idea.\n\n(01:06:34):\nSDRs are openers in some cases, and account executives are the more seasoned folks closing. And it varies, compensation from account executives that are US-based could be anywhere from like 90K to 200K, depending on, that's with base and bonus split at 50/50, depending on whether they're hunting tiny deals or big ones. That's the way an account executive works. And I think what doesn't happen today ... Those are the acronyms, SDR and AE. I think people can figure out VP of Sales, that's vice president of sales.\n\n(01:07:03):\nI think a thing that's gone on in the industry that founders expect now because there's so much discussion of it on LinkedIn and social media, but I haven't found work, is that an account executive will magically be full stack. They will do outbound themselves, they'll go use ZoomInfo and Apollo and develop a list themselves, they'll manage that outbound list themselves. If they don't have enough inbound, in their free time, you know what they'll do, Lenny, in their free time? They'll just do more outbound. You know what sales reps do in their free time? Today, they sell real estate or courses.\n\n(01:07:36):\nIf you want a tip, for founders, I know you want this full stack AE, and they do exist when they're micromanaged in certain high performance sales organizations, but they don't exist in real life. They're specialized. Most AEs, they want to be closers, they want to be handed a lead, a contact me, a lead. They want to work the lead and close the lead, and you hire some SDRs to help generate more demand. Those are the basic acronyms. What's hard for most founders, here's the tough part, most founders have enough stamina to manage a couple of these AEs, these account executives, these folks who work the leads. Most founders do not have the stamina to manage 10 kids fresh out of college that need to be micromanaged on an hourly basis to call leads. Very, very few founders themselves can manage a team of SDRs, but if you can, it's like a superpower.\n\nLenny (01:08:28):\nThat was really helpful. I did not know what exactly these terms represented, and when you're hiring those first two reps, they should be at the account executive level.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:08:37):\nYes. And they'll do some outbound and they'll do some of this SDR work. It's just, ultimately, people end up specializing.\n\nLenny (01:08:43):\nWhat is the title for someone above the account executive? Is it Director of Sales?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:08:46):\nYeah. There's really no ... It's a meta topic. I wish there were another career path for these ICs. This does exist in product, it does exist in engineering. It should exist in sales, but the truth is it doesn't. There is no senior SDR for this outbound. And for this AE, this person closing, yes, you can go more enterprise and make more money, but there isn't really a senior AE track, but there should be. It's unfortunate. It should be.\n\n(01:09:15):\nToo many of these folks are looking for, they look to go into management for promotion when what they really should look for is to be a super IC, and it's a shame that more folks don't try to implement a super IC role in sales, but that's basically what the career path is in management. And that's why another tip, another mistake that founders often make is, they hire the number one account executive at a hot company to be their head of sales. It's not the same skills. Most sales executives should not be managers. They don't want to be managers. They want to be individuals. They want to be highly paid individual contributors, these days, that mostly work from home and make a lot of money working 30 hours a week. That does not naturally breed great management skills.\n\nLenny (01:10:02):\nI want to shift directions a little bit and talk about product and sales. A lot of listeners of this podcast are product managers or founders building products. How involved should product managers be in sales. And vice versa, how involved should sales be in the roadmap and what's being built?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:10:19):\nI think, in the best run B2B organizations that I've worked with, and my own as well, the great, at least the head of product, the VP of Products, are deeply involved in sales. Deeply involved in sales. Deeply involved in sales. A company I invested in that's just crossing $60 million, they just had a meeting with who will be their largest customer. And the head of product who was there at the board meeting is like, \"Thank God I was there because what they want to do with our product, we sort of do. We sort of.\" Now, the product does do it, but what they want to basically do is deconstruct the product. They don't actually want to use the backend and analytics and some other pieces, but they don't really need the front end of the product. If the head of product hadn't been there, that deal would've been lost. It would've been lost.\n\n(01:11:11):\nAn AE doesn't know that. Even if an AE did know that, a sales rep did know that even. If the VP of Sales didn't know ... A VP of Sales would not be empowered enough to stand up in a meeting and say, \"I know what you want. We can launch tomorrow on this and, in 90 days, we'll tweak the UI so it does exactly what you want.\" You want that in your big deals. If you have that magical VP of Product that truly owns the roadmap, owns it and has the gravitas for that meeting, they become like the mini CEO in these meetings. A lot of CEOs, at scale, I've talked to, I was just talking with Daniel Chait at Greenhouse, he does this, they're over $200 million, when they have that head of product, they divide and conquer with the big customers. And the CEO can do some and the VP of product can do others.\n\n(01:11:52):\nAnd sometimes, the VP of Eng, if they're very producty, can also do that role too. Sometimes, you get these three weapons. In the old days, sometimes, your VP of Customer Success could do this, but unfortunately, and I know this is going to trigger some people, I don't see customer success stepping up for this pseudo product role anymore and I see them shrinking more and more into process. But that magical VP product, they give you that scale, that CEO level scale.\n\n(01:12:17):\nCan a product manager or a director do that? In my experience, the best ones, absolutely. The mid-pack ones that are working on the color of the pixel, I'd rather not have them in the deal. You have to be utterly fluent in the product, the entire product. You have to be the one that knows how to connect the pieces that don't ought to always connect themselves, and you have to have the gravitas to work with a large customer, to make commitments. That deep knowledge and commitment, it's hard below the VP level, but if it does exist, I love it. They become one of the greatest strategic weapons of a B2B company is bringing the product team, because the VP of Sales never quite goes that deep and can't make the commits, and the CEO can't be everywhere.\n\nLenny (01:13:04):\nThe bane of many product managers' existence is the flip side of sales is involvement in product. Do you have any advice for how you've seen the best SaaS companies handle requests from sales going into product, how product teams should think about requests from sales and making that work?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:13:21):\nI think this one is so simple and I'm surprised people make it so complicated. I know we all release 28 times a day, but the reality is, software still goes on quarterly release cycles no matter what we say, okay? Your customers cannot process 88 releases a day, okay? The maximum a customer can process is two big releases a year and maybe quarterly, so let's simplify. That's how customers think. Forget about how we build software.\n\n(01:13:46):\nEvery quarter, give your head of sales a certain budget, whether it's story points or 10% of the pie chart, however you do it, give them a budget. And when you do this, things will radically change then. They radically change because even the best VPs of sales, they change the wind. On Monday, what they really need is the HubSpot integration. And they're like, \"Oh, my god. We weren't going to do that for two years, but I guess we could change everything on Monday,\" but then, on Wednesday, a new prospect comes in and, \"We need SAP, but we just spent two days spec-ing out.\" You need SAP. And then, on Monday, it's Salesforce, right? And it's not that sales isn't honest, it's just, the big deals, the big ones always, the tail's wagging the dog and it burns out the organization. Even with the best sales leaders, I find it burns out, especially because the stressful deals, they overreact, and as good as they are, they're not product people, so they don't really know how to prioritize and force rank. If you say, \"Okay, Lenny, my VP of Sales, great. HubSpot, SAP, whatever you want, you've got 10% of the budget, you've got a hundred story points, whatever metric or heuristic you use, but you've got to decide now each quarter.\" And if you want to change during the course of the quarter, if you want to disrupt our whole engineering product team, you can do it, but understand there's a high cost, and the later you do it in the quarter, the less successful it's going to be because we already started the HubSpot integration. Not only will it demoralize the team, but we're going to run out of ... You already used your budget.\n\n(01:15:10):\nI just don't see enough product leaders being objective here, saying, \"Listen, here's your budget. You get it, period. No one can take it from you. I guess the CO can steal it if she really wants to, but it's yours, VP of Sales.\" And they will do the low balancing across their team. They will do it. They will listen and they'll say, \"Maybe I don't need that HubSpot integration after all. Maybe.\" Right?\n\n(01:15:32):\nBecause what a VP of Sales should be doing is taking ... The CO has to look five years into the future, product has to look about two years into the future, and you really can't ask a VP of Sales to look more than 12 months into the future because that's where they're next on the line, but a good one will load balance feature requests across the year and they will listen to all the ... Because they'll actually be in sales, they'll actually be in deals, and they'll be listening and they'll realize, look, even though we're going to lose this deal to HubSpot, I've gotten four SAP requests the last ... I'm going to take that bet. Even if I'm wrong, I'm going to take that bet. You got to give them that ... And you got to talk about it every week and say, \"Look, here's your budget, Jane. Here's your story points, your whatever, your 10%. This is what we're building now for you, objectively, and this is what we're currently planning for the next two quarters. Would you like to change the ones for the next two quarters? Because we haven't committed any code yet, and if you really want to change what's in process, you can. Otherwise, it's going to be hyper disruptive,\" but you got to at least pretend to be objective, for sales.\n\n(01:16:29):\nIf you're too emotional about it, you break the organization. You've got to say, \"Listen, I know we've already written 80% of this upside integration. If you really need us to put us on the shelf and drop everything for a million dollar deal, we're a startup, we'll do it. But understand, just, is this really really what you want?\" And if you involve them every week as a stakeholder, magic happens. But I don't see the VPs of Product that I work with, I know I'm not in all the staff meetings, but the meetings I'm in and the board meetings, I don't see this back and forth happening.\n\nLenny (01:16:58):\nThis might be the same exact answer you just gave, but say you're a PM and a salesperson comes to you, \"Hey, we're about to close this deal. We just need this one feature. Can we just get this on the roadmap?,\" what's the best way to help that sales person understand why it's not happening, help them feel like, \"Okay, I get it\"? Is it exactly what just said? \"Okay, we could change everything. Here's the story points you have this quarter.\"\n\nJason Lemkin (01:17:18):\nWell, are you assuming that PM is the head of product or empowered enough to make the decisions?\n\nLenny (01:17:24):\nI'd say, yeah, that PM could put something on the roadmap if they think it's important.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:17:29):\nThe reason I'm a little confused, just because I want to get it right, is what I'm hearing, which maybe isn't what you said. What I'm hearing is, a junior IC rep is talking to a more mid-level product person about the roadmap, and you want to have that. That's one of the reasons we actually go to the office. Because those discussions don't happen on Zoom, Lenny. They don't happen. And you want those discussions to happen, but you don't actually want them empowered. You want them to say, \"Listen, I will talk to my boss.\" That's the right answer. It's too confusing.\n\n(01:17:58):\nThis stress between product and sales is a good thing. It's a sign of a well-run B2B company when there is stress between product and sales. It's a good sign. If there's no stress, you're not in enough deals. You're not in enough deals if there's no stress. But the stress has to have enough process, even in a startup, that it doesn't break because your question alludes to the fact it can break organizations again and again. People get people resented on either side.\n\n(01:18:27):\nThis is one thing where the answer has to be, \"Look, we can chat about it over lunch. We can chat about this, and actually, you've got a good idea. You're an individual contributor. I'm going to tell my boss, on Monday, that I think we should do that. I'm going to use a little social capital and say we should do this,\" but you got to push the decisions up. That's as far as you're going to make recommendations. Otherwise, instead of that one stressful conversation with the VP, you've got a hundred, you've got 10 times a hundred, and again, they're fun lunch conversations, but they'll wreck you.\n\nLenny (01:18:54):\nSo the advice there is, basically, \"Talk to your manager, I'll talk to my manager. They need to hash this out. It's not my call.\"\n\nJason Lemkin (01:19:00):\nI think you got to push it up and I think you got to force the VP of Sales and the VP of Product to have this weekly meeting about the budget, and that will force them to have enough, just enough organization on their team so that it can all be surfaced up. Because that means they each have to have a meeting with their team for 30 minutes each week and say, \"I'm going to put up on the whiteboard guys, so my sales team's going to say ... And I've been to many of these meetings where you force the sales team to force rank what they want and you end up, I tell you, Lenny, 100% of the time in the sales meeting, when you do a whiteboard force rank, you end up walking out with very different outputs than when you start the meeting in sales 100% of the time.\n\n(01:19:36):\nOn the product side, you need to do the converse. You just need to say, \"We owe sales 10% of our points, so in our team meeting, we're going to put in 15 minutes of our team meeting and we're going to make sure we have the priorities right from the sales team. Let's go over what I got from Linda. This is what she says. Is she wrong? Should we do something? How can we help the sales team be even more successful? And what inputs is the team hearing?\" And they can raise their hand and say, \"Look, I just had this all the way conversation with Bobby, but honestly, Lenny, I can build a HubSpot integration in a day.\" \"What? I thought it was really hard.\" \"No, I did it my last company. And listen, actually, we can actually outsource it to Bob and Linda at this agency I know for 20 grand. They'll build it next week.\" That's a magical moment. That's a magical moment. But you've got to each have these parallel meetings. The good thing, that tension can become debilitating. We've all seen those fights, those almost fights that break out, and they come from a place of passion, but you got to have structure.\n\nLenny (01:20:30):\nGreat advice. Another trend I've been noticing is that product teams are taking on P&L responsibilities and revenue goals. What's your sense of, is that good? Is that bad? How do you think about that for product teams?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:20:42):\nYou want everyone to be aligned on the big picture revenue goal for the end of the year. Is the question, you mean having financial bonuses and stuff tied to hitting the plan?\n\nLenny (01:20:51):\nMore that their KPIs and their OKRs are essentially this much revenue, you need to drive this much revenue from your experiments, from your product launches.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:21:00):\nAs you can see, I have a lot of opinions on things here that are data-driven and they're live experience. This one, I need another year in the oven, and I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. What happened in the last 18 months is, in customer success, which is, in the old days, it was related to product. Now, it's less so, which I think is unfortunate. In customer success, in the last 18 months, this happened all across the industry. 24 months ago, customer success's goal was happy customers, measured in retention, sometimes NRR, net retention with upsells, sometimes with GRR, just logos, how many logos. That was your only job, happy customers. Happy customers.\n\n(01:21:35):\nThen, things got harder in many areas of B2B, and every customer success team last year, their goal was revenue. You need to bring in more revenue from existing base, and it destroyed customer relationships. There is a leading public company, I will not name them, I'm a positive guy. I will tell you, a company we all have used for years and loved, and they did this to their customer success team. And they came to us last year, we paid $299 a month for this product for our team. They asked us for $50,000 upfront or said they would turn it off that day. That week. Maybe it was that week. $50,000. That's what happens when you weaponize ...\n\n(01:22:10):\nSo customer success, and I know this is going to trigger some people, but it is true, when I talk to leaders, customer success got weaponized and I don't like it, okay? I don't like it as a product. All founders are product people, I think. I don't like it as a product because I think it's bad for customers. That experience I got was horrific, wasn't it? That $50,000, being told. And it got walked back. And the fact that it got walked back is almost even worse because it wasn't true. It was a threat. So do I want to weaponize the product team? I want the product team aligned with revenue. These are the tough decisions for founders. But I think we're going to regret, to some extent, weaponizing teams that we don't need to weaponize.\n\n(01:22:50):\nHaving said that, I will tell you, and again, no knock on Adobe, but when I was a VP at Adobe, and it was a long time ago, when product was in another building, in some cases, that was not great. And I love Scott and the whole team, it was a great experience, but I can just tell you, what I learned is, that did not work for me as an agile guy, having groups that would do this work in isolation.\n\n(01:23:08):\nAnd the problem was they would never talk to a customer. So I know I want product constantly talking to the customer. I know I want the VP of product with a lot of equity, wanting to hit the bookings number for the year. Do I want your average PM weaponized and forced to bring in revenue from an experimental feature when everyone agreed it's the test we're going to run? We only can run so many. You say, should they have revenue for new feature launches, for new product expansions, for new things? Yes, but everyone's got to make that decision. There aren't that many of us that have 1,000 extra engineers sitting around with nothing to do.\n\n(01:23:44):\nEven the smallest experiment, no matter what it says on the internet, again, that we release 100 a day, I would argue bringing any product extension to market's very expensive and risky because you're taking away from something else. These are expensive decisions, and if you punish people for the mistakes in product, this is something that big companies are actually better at than startups, which is, they don't fire you if the new initiative fails. Because then, no one at a big company would ever join the new initiative. There are exceptions, but no one at Adobe or Google would work on the new product if you got fired if it didn't hit $100 million its first year.\n\n(01:24:21):\nOne thing I saw that was very, and I don't know how to bring to startups in my big company experience, was it's liberating to some extent to let people fail, up to a point. It's liberating. Because the cost of failure in a startup is so high. It's just so high. I know that's not what the exact question, and ask me in a year, but my advice is, just be careful that you don't weaponize functions.\n\nLenny (01:24:44):\nI probably should have clarified. I think this is mostly true in PLG companies where most of the growth is coming from product, but I imagine the advice is still the same, as be careful putting too much pressure on the product team to focus on revenue.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:24:55):\nWell, that's how you get dark stuff. Back in the day, I remember my sister worked at Vistaprint for online business cards, and her entire job was to force people to buy upsell of additional products on the checkout page they didn't want to buy. That was her whole job. And she was paid a large variable comp to get people to buy third party products without realizing in their checkout, and it worked. That's all she did for three years was figure out dark stuff, I mean, darkish, grayish stuff so that when I bought my business card, I also bought GoDaddy and 11 other things that I didn't want. It works, but it doesn't create high NPS, does it?\n\nLenny (01:25:34):\nMm-hmm. No.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:25:34):\nThe thing is, here's the thing that you have to think about. What's crazy, Lenny, now, and I talk to a lot of these folks is, there's so many SaaS companies that are a billion or more in revenue. I just wrote up, there's just Pimcore, which is SaaS for [inaudible 01:25:49]. I just wrote up, it just crossed a billion in revenue. So many folks are at a billion. CloudFlare just crossed a billion. And the only way you can do that is if your revenue compounds.\n\n(01:25:59):\nAnd in fact, just myself, I just interviewed Matt Mullen from WordPress, 20 years he's been doing this, and he said the number one thing he didn't understand at WordPress, at Automatic, was the power of compounding. When you do these things that are customer hostile, and a lot of us were under stress this last 12 days, to hit the numbers, right? This is your job as founders, is you got to load balance the fact that the cash has to last and my investors are mad with me, but nothing matters in B2B that it compounds. And some of this dark stuff you're talking about on PLG, it anti-compounds, right?\n\n(01:26:30):\nAnd I would say, let me flip it around. The magical thing at the high level that it compounds, if you have a self-service model, a PLG model, I actually think the number one most important metric is churn. It's going to this churn, churn, churn, churn. And when I meet any startup for investing or anything, if the churn is not top decile for a low end product, I'm always out. It's almost unsolvable. It's almost unsolvable. This 3% to 4% a month churn rate that a lot of SMB stuff, it's almost unsolvable. I think that's where the energy should go, is relentlessly bringing down churn so that, 20 years from now, we all have billion dollar AR companies. That's what we want.\n\nLenny (01:27:11):\nI have a rapid fire set of questions before, actually, the lightning round. We'll see if we have time for all these things. I just have a bunch of random questions that I'm going to fire at you and and see what comes up. Sounds good? Okay, cool. I got a thumbs up. Let's do it. Okay.\n\n(01:27:23):\nWhat is just one thing a founder or product leader can do to become better at sales?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:27:28):\nThe number one thing they can do, and this is very tactical, at the end of each meeting, because again, both of them are good middlers, the head of product and the founders are good demos, they're good at talking shop, they're good at talking in the industry, they're good at talking workflows. Learn. This is the only school you have to learn. Even if you're not comfortable asking for money, learn to ask for what's the next step, Lenny. This is what all great salespeople have learned to do. Actually, mediocre salespeople are terrible at this. The best salespeople never leave a meeting without a next step. The next step does not have to be a check. Don't break the relationship, but what's the next meeting? The next meeting might be, \"Lenny, is there someone else at your company that I could do a demo for?\" People are lazy, they don't want to do multiple demos.\n\n(01:28:06):\nBut in 2024, we all have to demo multiple stakeholders. In 2021, it was one stakeholder. Now, it's a four-stakeholder sale. If you don't know what to ask at the end of the call, ask, \"Who else? Lenny, is there someone else? I know you're excited to buy our product, but who else? Is there someone else in the organization? Can I help you? Can I just do a demo?\" A demo is not threatening. Whatever the next step is, \"What's the next step we can get on our books?\" And listen. The best salespeople march deals step by step by step by step. And then, they put in the time. They've done the demos, they've done the pilot if they need to, they've helped them get going, they've helped them see the value. And then, if it takes six steps to say, \"Okay, Lenny, now, we've got five folks at the organization using it. They've seen, here's the deal. They love it. What can we do, Lenny, to get going? Can we get a contract signed so we can get going on February 1st?\" It's just very natural.\n\n(01:28:56):\nAnd founders just end the Zoom. They end the zoom, and they wait. They wait in their inbox for the next step to come, but it doesn't, it rarely comes on its own. That's the number one tip is, make sure yourself and you log it in your CRM that you always have a next step after. You don't have to be great at sales. As long as you're moving the ball down the field, then, get it into the red zone, and then, figure out how to ask for the money. But you don't have to ask for the money until it's in the red zone.\n\nLenny (01:29:21):\nAmazing. While we're on this topic, is there a book or a course or anything that you'd just recommend folks go to get better at sales? Just, is there some tactical, \"Go read this thing, it'll help you?\" Or is it just, it's hard, you're not going to figure it out reading a book?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:29:35):\nI am a voracious reader. If I only wanted to plug myself, and I usually wouldn't, two things that we have, we have something called SaaStr.University. SaaStr dot University. It's free. There's a pretty good course on learning about sales. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good. It just organizes a lot of the stuff we're talking about and it's free. I think it's pretty helpful. We actually wrote a book called From Impossible To Inevitable that sold about 100,000 copies.\n\nLenny (01:29:59):\nOh, wow.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:29:59):\nI did almost none of the work, although a lot of is my content. Aaron Ross did it. It's actually really good, and it interviews a lot of top sales leaders and goes through a lot of stuff we did. I don't usually hype it, but for 15 bucks, I think this ... And actually, I've never made one dollar. I've never even gotten a check for these 100,000 copies, but I do think it's actually ... The second edition's pretty good. I think, if you like what we're talking about, the SaaS University and the others. I just hyped my own course, which is free. I don't think I'm selling something if it's free. The book, I don't make a dollar on. I'd be very cautious, and this is tough, maybe this is something we can work on together. There's so many courses and so many people selling stuff the last two years. Just be cautious. Just be cautious.\n\n(01:30:39):\nThe last thing I will say is, there is another community called Pavilion, and I do think it's great, Pavilion. It does have a lot of networking and stuff for sales and connecting sales with founders, and I am a super fan of what they're doing. That one's worth investing. But be careful about Bob and John's sales courses on the internet. There's too many.\n\nLenny (01:31:00):\nAwesome. All right. We'll link to all those things in the show notes.\n\n(01:31:03):\nNext question, what is the ideal trial length for a free trial for sales team? Is it 14 days, a month, years? What do you recommend?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:31:11):\nTomas Tsangaris did a whole SaaStr presentation just on free trials and free trial legs. It was really good, but the one thing you didn't know, which I know just being an old timer is, one of the reasons we have 14-day trials on the internet is, in the old days, the Salesforce sales team, when they were SMB focused, wanted to close deals that month, so they forced Salesforce to move from 30 to 14 days. There was no evidence it was better for the customer. There was no evidence that it got usage going or people ... They just wanted to close deals the same month.\n\n(01:31:41):\nThat's something to be cautious about, these metrics. And be cautious, since we're talking to product folks, be cautious that they're customer centric. Salesforce is very enterprise now, but in the old days, it pushed it to 14 days so the sales reps could close deals faster. What we learned from Slack and Zoom until recently was infinite trials work pretty good. So does Canva. Slack and Canva, and until recently, Zoom, were okay waiting four years to convert. And those are epic companies. Those are epic companies.\n\n(01:32:12):\nAnd these are one of the things that only founders can make these decisions. I wrote this post years ago saying, \"Who's your VP of Free?\" Because who's got a VP of Free? Do you know anybody that has a VP of Free? I got a VP of Growth, I got a VP of Product, but if you have this massive free base, who's your VP of Free? I know almost no one that has a VP of Free. And usually, it's some kind of collaboration between product and the CEO. They're the VP of Free, but even then, you need a VP of Free, and we don't have one. There's no perfect answers, but in a world where we're tightening nooses everywhere on trials, we're tightening nooses everywhere, be careful the advice you get, be careful the short-term advice.\n\n(01:32:49):\nFor example, another related terrible piece of advice VCs give you is switch to annual contracts. This is terrible advice. Terrible advice, Lenny. Terrible advice from people who've never built products and aren't in the field. Going to annual contracts, on a spreadsheet, looks great. On a spreadsheet-\n\nJason Lemkin (01:33:00):\nGoing to annual contracts on a spreadsheet looks great. On a spreadsheet, it looks great. You know what's better? Letting customers pay what they want to pay. If it's you or me buying for ourselves, Lenny, we're still going to put it on a credit card, aren't we? If it's our own personal... And we want to pay monthly, usually, we don't know. We usually want to just try it monthly. Big companies want to pay annually because they have procurement departments. Why force people to go the way they don't want to go? So, just start, this is a product audience. Product needs to be the voice of the customer. It's not so much customer success as it used to be. It's not so much sales. You've got to be the voice of the customer together with the founders and push these things.\n\n(01:33:39):\nThink about, I would do the longest possible trial that is still customer-centric and understand there's tension. Understand there's tension, right? I say anytime I'm in a board meeting where some VC says, \"Let's do annual for an SMB.\" I mean, I'm like, \"No. Show me the money. Show me the evidence that this is better for the customer.\" Right? How many times have you gone to buy something for yourself and it's 19 bucks a month? And that's annoying because it's an [inaudible 01:34:05] credit card charge. But do you want to pay 240 up front? I mean, maybe you do it for a Riverside or something you use all the time, but some random product you just discovered, you're just going to bounce.\n\nLenny (01:34:14):\nYeah.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:34:14):\nSo, who's going to show the data in the bounce, right? A related point for like in sales. No one does enough. Everyone does these win-loss meetings, but no one talks enough about the deals they lost. Everyone talks about the deals they won. All the lore, the tribal lore in sales is how we won the deal. People should be spending more time talking about deals they lost than the deals they won, right? And same thing for this PLG motion. If you make your... Yes, I give everyone a pass for 2023, everyone whose growth plummeted and did things they shouldn't. Did price increases they didn't earn, cut the free trials, hid their free editions. I'm going to give you, look, you've got to give your team a little stress relief, right? So, I'm giving every person I work with, every portfolio, everyone a one-year pass, but the past is in the past. We got to get back to being customer-centric and building businesses that build to 1 billion ARR on their own because they're wonderful businesses that are product-centric, right? That recur. And every time you rip a customer off, you lose, the relationship's damaged, isn't it?\n\n(01:35:21):\nAnd a controversial thing I say to the product team, but I think this is the right thing if you're going long, is look, everyone raised prices last year, as you know, right? Everyone raised prices. The question I ask folks is, \"Did you earn it?\" What feature did you [inaudible 01:35:36]? If you raised prices 8% last year, did you add 30% more value to your product? In the old days pre these crazy years, the answer usually was yes. People would wait up, they would wait a couple years, right? And the whatever product from four years ago was so much better. It really was. Really had earned 1995 instead of... Last year, no one earned their price increases. No one came out with an amazing new edition, an amazing new functionality that earned it. They just sent you an email saying, \"You're paying more.\" So we get one pass, but earn it. Earn your price increase.\n\n(01:36:12):\nHave the longest free trial possible. Own it. And this VP of free thing, it's got to be founders working with product because no one else cares about the free. You can't expect the sales team to care about free, can you? You can't expect the marketing team to care about free. Unless they can immediately monetize them, right? Unless they can ram them into conversion. People abuse their long tail in the last 18 months, but your long tail is... These are your... Even if they don't convert that much, they're your advocates. I mean, how many people read your newsletter? 500,000 people, right?\n\nLenny (01:36:42):\nAlmost 600,000.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:36:42):\nOkay. 600,000. Now, not all of them convert, do they?\n\nLenny (01:36:46):\nNo, no. That's exactly how I look at it. It's kind of this Brian Belfort is this... Yeah.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:36:49):\nWhat about the 590,000 of them that love Lenny that don't convert, right?\n\nLenny (01:36:49):\nYeah.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:36:53):\nIf you over monetize them, then Lenny's community doesn't exist if you over monetize them. But when you bring in a VP of sales for Lenny and a VP of growth and... You can't expect them to care as much about that long tail as you, right?\n\nLenny (01:37:10):\nI love your passion around this. So, what I'm hearing partly is you're a big fan of freemium, essentially, right? And the benefits of product-led growth where there's something you could just use indefinitely, or do you still think that's a trial where it needs to end at some point? Or is it just like, \"No, freemium is great in a lot of cases.\"\n\nJason Lemkin (01:37:26):\nListen, I'm a big fan of long tails when they work. They don't always work for enterprise products. I'm a big fan of delivering more value than you take out for your customers. And I am a big fan overall of free, because, and I know you'll agree with me this, every founder figures this out at some point, free products are better software. Products that cannot offer a free edition cut corners because they don't have to be good at onboarding. The products that do not have a free edition have human beings that bridge the gap between buying and deployment. And that's okay at ServiceNow, and that's okay in certain products, but the best products invest the engineering cycles to have a free edition. Whether that's truly free, whether it's an extended free trial, whether it's a long tail or a medium tail, the amount of... All of your product is better if people can actually, if you have a free edition, all your customers benefit, even your enterprise customers benefit, they all benefit.\n\nLenny (01:38:28):\nThis idea of VP of free, I think technically it's probably the head of growth for a PLG company or the person leading the self-serve part of the business.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:38:36):\nBut even in the organizations I work with that have those structures, that person is focused on monetizing that tail. Who stands up for the 590,000 other readers of Lenny? Who's their champion?\n\nLenny (01:38:50):\nYeah, and you're 100% right. That's exactly how I think about the newsletter. There's this free audience and ideas over time, they get convinced, \"This is worth my money and let's give it a shot.\"\n\nJason Lemkin (01:38:58):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:38:59):\nSo, yeah.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:39:00):\nAnd your growth person, let's say 1% converts. I'm just making that up. Going from 1 to 1.1 actually is a big deal at that scale or 1.2, right? That's okay. But you've got to nurture the 490,000, not spend all the calories just ramming the paid edition through, right? But only it's a fun thing, because once you hit a little bit of scale, this is part of your job as founders and product leaders is who's going to be this VP of free? It's not growth. I don't think it's the growth team or something. They got to hit their goal when their goal is to get another half million out of the newsletter this year. And that's their bonuses side to it. You think they're going to work on the free ones? No chance.\n\nLenny (01:39:43):\nMakes sense. Oh man, there's so many things I can go into and want to go into. I also want to let you go. So with that, is there anything else, Jason, that you wanted to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round? Anything you want to leave listeners with?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:39:59):\nI think just make this the year of the customer guys. And I really think that sales has been under so much pressure the last 18 months. Customer success has changed. Product teams have to step up. This is your time to do great things this year as product people. Be the voice of the customer. Be the VP of free, be the whatever. Be the champion. Stick your neck out. Work harder, folks. Work harder. The funnest part of anything in startups is working hard, but in product it's extra fun. By working harder, you have the more fun conversations. Find the delight in... The delight in product is making customers happy. It's not worth it otherwise. Otherwise, it's drudgery and it's endless PRDs and Gantt charts and mindless discussions. Make your customers happier this year, you will be happy. This is the year of product and we all get a pass for whatever bad deeds we did or mediocre deeds we did in 2023, get back and be the vanguard in your companies.\n\n(01:40:53):\nStartups need, and bigger companies, they need someone to inject energy again, in many cases. Energy has been lost. And it would be great if product can do it and say, \"Listen, let's do something, even if we're not exactly sure how to get more leads, okay? Even if we're not exactly sure what to do, there's one thing under our control is the code we write and the product we ship. Let's do three great things this year. Let's just do them not good, great. Let's do three great.\" And what you'll find is the whole company will respond, including sales, including marketing, including... If we start shipping great thing. Few things inspire teams more than when you're shipping great products. So, be... If you weren't the leaders the last two years, if you were being forced to weaponize your customer base somehow ship three great things this year. That's my challenge. Ship three great things.\n\nLenny (01:41:39):\nI love this. This is the year of product, that might be the title of this podcast.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:41:42):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:41:44):\nJason, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:41:50):\nOkay. I'm worried about the first one, but go for it.\n\nLenny (01:41:52):\nThey're very non-surprising, because they're always the same. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:42:00):\nThat's the one I just want to take a pass on. I know they're the same. I read more than anybody else in the planet, but I wish I had those two great, great books that have changed my mind in the last 12 months, but hopefully I've added some value. But this one, I think I got to take a mulligan on it [inaudible 01:42:14] perfect answer.\n\nLenny (01:42:15):\nAcceptable answer. Is there a favorite movie or TV show that you really enjoy?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:42:20):\nOh, the Terminal List.\n\nLenny (01:42:22):\nThe Terminal List?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:42:24):\nThe Terminal List, yeah. I'm not into the Chris Pratt. I'm not into that goofy superhero movies he does, and I know people like it, but The Terminal List, it's pretty, it's I got it, it's written by this ex Navy SEAL that I think tech people don't read the... Everyone, but outside of tech reads this author, but Amazon did this thing with The Terminal List and I think the reason it gripped me, it's like this post, it's like a lot of tech is right now is we're trying to do the right things, but are we doing the right things? It's just confusing. So this one, I couldn't put down, The Terminal List. That was my favorite show. The other one, the one I liked that I couldn't believe. You want the second one? Even though as product people, Maverick, and I'll tell you why. This movie Maverick, okay, you wouldn't think I'd be a Maverick guy, but the quality of this product, it was so high.\n\n(01:43:18):\nAnd what's interesting, you remember Maverick was supposed to come out before COVID, right? And Tom Cruise said no. He's like, \"This is such a good product, we're going to wait years for this thing to come out.\" I'm like, \" I'm not going to like this. I mean, cocktail was pretty good, but I'm not going to...\" But as a product, when... I've watched this movie three times from a product perspective and just like software, when something is done that well, no wasted calories, no... You see everything tied together. That's the kind of software we love, right? It just delights us when it works better than we expected. So, those are my two.\n\nLenny (01:43:53):\nYou also did all his own stunts, which I think is a good metaphor for the VP of product, maybe being involved in sales?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:43:57):\nActually do the work.\n\nLenny (01:43:59):\nYeah, exactly. Oh man, I'm stretching it. Okay, next question. You answered a few of these already, but do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing salespeople, especially?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:44:09):\nI answered it, but I'll bring it up again in case you do it again, is, \"What do you want to do your first 14 days to head of product or head of sales? What do you want to do your first 14 days?\" It's not a technical 30-day plan, you don't have to do 28 slides. It's what I call a Colombo question. Not that I really watch Colombo, but Colombo is this old detective on TV who, I don't know if you ever, he would ask these dumb questions, right? And then the murderer would thought Colombo was so dumb, but by the end of the episode he'd always incriminate himself because the question. So, when I interview, I always do Colombo questions. They're never tough ones, right? They're always nice. I don't know if I'm nice, I'm honest, but the interview [inaudible 01:44:42]. But Lenny, what would you do your first 14 days as VP of product here? And they don't want to visit customers. Don't hire them for either all sales or product. Just don't hire them.\n\nLenny (01:44:51):\nI've got the answer now. That's exactly what I was going to say. Next question, what is a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really like?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:45:00):\nMy two aren't really amazing, but I'll answer them. I love this Opus Clip app for making clips from video. I know you have a whole team, so you probably don't need it, but I produce a lot. I mean, a lot of us do content marketing, right? Whoever does it. I produce a lot of content. I don't have enough time to do this. So, the only AI tool that I've found helpful so far is Opus Clip, which takes all of the incredible amount of YouTube content we have, force ranks it and turns it into 59 second clips. And I'm a case study on the website, I tried the earlier products. They were almost there, right? But it's not, is it as good as a clip team? Right? Is it? No.\n\n(01:45:41):\nBut literally in 60 seconds, what's interesting is it can do something, I don't have time to, I could never make YouTube clips. I could never make Instagram shorts. I could never make... It just would never happen, right? It would never happen. And the fact that one product enables you to do something at a minimum viable quality you couldn't do before, I'm a super fan. It's pretty interesting. So, that's my favorite. And my other one is this one. This is the folding phone that's finally as good as a normal phone. See, there's The Terminal List that I've got folded up and it just works.\n\nLenny (01:46:11):\nThat's wild. [inaudible 01:46:12].\n\nJason Lemkin (01:46:12):\nWeighs the same as an iPhone.\n\nLenny (01:46:13):\nWow.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:46:13):\nAnd so the reason it's cool is this has changed the way I do productivity. One Plus, it's the One Plus. One Plus, yeah, it's the first one that's the same form factor, same weight, same... So there's really no, there's no loss, right? And I can use my normal phone here like I'm using, it's a little funky, but it's the same... And then to be able to do content, to be able to check, to be able to do full email, full account, full everything like an iPad.\n\nLenny (01:46:39):\nWe see your Tesla where it's going, that gets parked. That's very cool. So, it's basically like an iPad plus a phone in one.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:46:47):\nYeah, I probably use this 50% of the time of the iPad.\n\nLenny (01:46:50):\nWow.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:46:50):\nSo, that's it. That is it. The other ones that-\n\nLenny (01:46:52):\nAnd that's an Android?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:46:53):\n... Make sense to me. Yeah, it's a Android, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:46:55):\nAmazing. I had not seen that. That is extremely cool.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:46:55):\nVery cool.\n\nLenny (01:46:58):\nTwo more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends or family, find useful in work or in life?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:47:07):\nIt's, \"Be kind.\" When I reflect on my career, right? Mistakes, I don't think I'm mean. I actually think I care more than most people on the planet. I like to think I've helped a lot of people, but it's not taking the time to be kind at times and not taking time to be kind when things don't work out. Not taking time to be kind when you leave a situation. Not taking time to be kind when maybe someone's done the wrong thing, right? Not taking time to be kind to a customer that leaves, right? I remember in the early days of Adobe Sign of EchoSign, we had a top tech customer, and I killed myself to close this customer, right? Famous, huge, huge tech company today. And then our champion changed, right? Champion changed is the big issue in software and product and came in and brought in DocuSign instead of us.\n\n(01:47:56):\nAnd man, I was just so mad. I just tore into this guy. This guy had actually had dinner at my house, right? And he actually never, he just did it because it was good for his own career, right? And I was so mad, but I broke the relationship forever, right? That's just one random example. And I just think there's so much advice to fire fast and to be relentless and do all these things, right? But you've interviewed so many people, Lenny, right? I mean so many great leaders. I haven't done what you've done, but I've talked to almost all the top CEOs in SaaS, okay? And they're kind. It doesn't mean that they're soft, they're not soft, okay? They make tough decisions every day, but they're kind. And so in this world where everyone feels like they're getting ripped off or they're not paid enough, or I want founder pay for founder work, this motto, really it's troubling.\n\n(01:48:51):\nEveryone is founder pay for founder... \"You want me to work more than 30 hours, Lenny? I need 30% of the company. I need founder pay for founder work.\" It's like, I hear you. But you'll find that by being totally committed, going to 110% and also finding a way to be kind, that will endure across your whole career. So, I know it's... Because I think I'm good, but not always kind. It's how I challenge myself all the time. Be kinder in that conversation. And the big epiphany, we already talked about it, it shouldn't have taken me this long to realize that anytime an employee fails, it's your fault, be kind. You hired them. They never knew what they were getting themselves into. If the job's too hard, if they lack the skills, if there's not enough budget, if there's not enough people, if it requires too many hours to work, you should have known that. Not them. Be kind. Be kind to every single person on your team that doesn't work out. That's not just putting together an email spreadsheet and sending it out. Try, try harder. Be there for them. Be kind.\n\nLenny (01:49:44):\nBe kind. I love this. I know that you actually, your username on Twitter includes, \"Be kind.\" In your actual-\n\nJason Lemkin (01:49:51):\nIt's a reminder.\n\nLenny (01:49:52):\nYeah.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:49:52):\nIt's a reminder.\n\nLenny (01:49:52):\nSo, you really back this up. Amazing. Okay, final question. You're on a giant conference, SaaStr.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:49:58):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:49:59):\nFirst of all, just talk about what it is so people know and explore it and check it out. But the actual question is what would surprise people most about running a conference like this? Things that they know, think about it goes into running a conference like this.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:50:13):\nAny business, no matter how weird it is, that's at scale, the best one in it, it's always interesting, I think for case studies, right? The best, pick anything, the best cup maker, whoever it is, whoever makes the best... This is not an interesting business, the Starbucks cup on its own, but the best person, I pretty much guarantee you there's a good story there, right? SaaStr is a community as well like you have. We started this really early in 2011, 2012 for B2B founders back when that seemed like a weird thing to do. Now it doesn't seem so weird. So, we built a lot of content and we started doing events and meetups. I never did a meetup. You do a lot of meetups, but when I did meetups, I'd never actually even been to one. So, I did meetups in 2012 and 2013, but 1,000 people came to the meetups.\n\n(01:50:56):\nThat will make sense to you today, but a decade ago for B2B, it was pretty, people were like, \"Why are all these people here? We thought there was six of us that cared about B2B.\" So, then we did a big event. We did a one-day SaaStr annual in 2015, and 3000 people came including the evening. And so we just kept going. So, we get about 10 to 12,000 people together a year. What that means is change. It's no longer novel. I'm not the only person producing B2B content anymore. I'm not the only founder that sold their company like in the old days. There's plenty much more successful founders and better, I certainly, I don't do very many podcasts, because I'm not a hundredth as good as you. I do one a quarter, for example.\n\n(01:51:34):\nBut the events have become this meeting place for founders that have hit scale, that are somewhere between 1 million and 20 million. And especially folks that aren't in Silicon Valley, especially folks that aren't sitting in Hayes Valley or wherever, that don't have a community. And that surprised me in the beginning how many international folks would fly all the way to the Bay Area. I remember this founder came from Perth, Australia for the first afternoon. I'm like, \"Thanks for coming, but this is a lot of work.\" He is like, \"I didn't come for you. I came because there's no one like me in Perth.\" So, it's taken on a life of its own. There's a lot of learnings. I think, I didn't intend to do mass scale events. I intended to just do meetups, because I had a community like you do meetups. So, it was absolutely an accident. The learnings are, it's extremely expensive and it has this weird curve. Okay, that's this weird curve where, and this is more because I think actually all founders, all startups should be doing events for their own customers, at least steak dinners I've written about. You should get your customers, if you get your customers and prospects together, you sell more. Get your customers and... It does not need to be a million dollar or 10 million event. It can be Roots Chrises, it can be whatever. It does not even need to be fancy. Just get them together.\n\nLenny (01:52:39):\nIt has to be steak though.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:52:41):\nYeah, well, no, but steak does work. I mean, I'm not a big steak guy. It could be any, just something nice where they want to go. It, just where they want to go. Your customers will sell your prospects for you. Your customers will do the selling for you [inaudible 01:52:53] bring them together.\n\n(01:52:55):\nWhen you do it really small, it's cheap, because how much does that back room cost at the steakhouse, right? It's worth it if you get one big deal out of it, right? And then you graduate and then you'll do a meetup and you'll do it at someone's office. Some tech company, they'll give it to you for free, they have an extra office. That costs nothing, right? And then you're like, \"Well, that went well. We got 100, 200 people came to Lenny's thing at Digital Ocean.\" And then you say, \"I'm gonna do an event.\" And then you rent a theater, a disuse. And these theaters are actually kind of cheap because they're dark during the day. There's not a lot going on and a lot of... Not movie theaters but music. So, those are cheap. But then you're like, \"Well, there's only one stage and it smells like beer.\"\n\n(01:53:34):\nSo, then the next year you do a hotel and a hotel's pretty expensive. It's like half a million, 800,000 and I hated hotels. But you know what I learned from the business model? It's turnkey landing. So, your marketing manager can call up the Hilton in any city and in two weeks spool up some mediocre AV, some mediocre chicken wings and drinks, okay? And you and I don't like to go to the Hilton that much. The ballroom C, we don't like to go to events [inaudible 01:54:00], but it turns out your customers don't care. They want to be together and talk about your app, right? And then if you do community like you do, you could probably charge a couple $100 for tickets and get some sponsors and bring in some revenue, right? But then after Hilton Ballroom B, it costs $2 million to turn the lights on.\n\n(01:54:16):\nAnd SaaStr annual... So, our Europa event in London's in early June, June fourth to fifth, please come if you want. That costs $2 million to turn the lights on in London. To turn the lights on in the Bay Area for 12,000 people in September in the Bay Area, which is the most expensive place, right? It's $10 million to turn the lights on.\n\nLenny (01:54:32):\nHoly shit.\n\nJason Lemkin (01:54:34):\nIt's $10 million to turn the lights on. Now, I'm being a little expansive in what I mean by turn the lights on, but this is what it's going to cost you. It's going to cost you about $1000 per attendee in the Bay Area or Las Vegas to have a mass scale event. Not smaller, not one day in Grand Ballroom B, but a multi-day event, right? The AV is 1.5 million. The food and beverage is 1.5 million. The tenting is $800,000. I can keep going. So, once you get to 20, 30, 40 million in revenue, quietly, there's public companies out there.\n\n(01:55:04):\nThey have software like Margins at that scale, but before that, it's brutal, right? And when I started doing these events, I interviewed the head of it back before March 2020 when tech companies did their own events, they've pretty much given up, which is an interesting side topic. Big ones like big, not small ones, but big ones. Biden View, the head of events at everyone, right? At Twilio and Marketo and dah, dah. They all be like, \"Well, how'd the event go?\" It'd all be the same. Well, we brought in about 1.5 million revenue. \" Oh, okay.\" \"And we lost 2 million.\" Everyone lost 2 million. Every single one lost 2 million. And you could see in the financial state, even Zoom at that scale just announced how much money they lose at Zoomtopia. So, it's a terrible business. What I like to say is it has diseconomies of scale. The Lenny's little free meetup costs zero, right? And then the one at Cloudflare's office costs zero.\n\n(01:55:50):\nAnd the one at Hilton B maybe costs $200, but then it costs $1000 per person at scale, right? Even more like Moscone like in San Francisco is probably the most expensive. You're approaching $2,000 per person, because you have to buy about 15 to 20 million of hotel nights to do an event in Moscone, right? So I don't know if that's... We could, I mean it's a side topic, Lenny's side podcast for people that care. But this diseconomies of scale. But there are a handful of public companies that do Lions, Money 2020, Shoptalk, a few others that are at SaaStr scale. And they cobbled together these very profitable public companies. But they all got to do at least 20 to 30 million, because you've got to get over a 10. And it's intimidating to get over a $10 million net, right?\n\n(01:56:33):\nAnd so what it means is we have to spend 14 to 16 months each year planning for SaaStr annual because it's not that fun if you fall six or $8 million behind. That's what happened in March 2020. We were the first major event to be canceled by COVID in March 2020. The first one, RSA happened for security the week before then we got canceled. So, we lost $10 million in one day and it took a long time to dig out of that hole, Lenny, especially since we monetize nothing, it took a long time, but they're worth it.\n\n(01:57:04):\nI know you don't do traditional events, but you do do meetups in your community, and I know they're worth it. I know they're worth it. Bringing your customers together, bringing your community together, and we talked about this offline before we started. Second tier, third tier events I do not think are worth it because they do not attract the best people. It's just a fact. Most people, it turns out from our founders are our core ICP. They go to two events a year on average, two events a year, okay? And they'll do other steak dinners. So, if you go to one of the two that they're at, you just might bump into Jeff Lawson or Eric Juan or whoever the next one. They might be there. That might be one of their two, but they don't go to number three through 10. They don't go to these. So, my role in general is people wonder, should I go to events? Is it worth my time? It's a waste of time.\n\n(01:57:49):\nAnd I know you've thought about it. And the irony is, even though we produce events, I used to think that. I didn't want to do events, I just wanted to do meetups, right? I was shy, I just wanted to do meetups. But then I learned over time that the best events bring the best vendors, the best executives, the best everything together. So, pick the one or two best events in your industry. And even if you're antisocial, try to go to one or two a year, go along. It pays off. It pays off, but maybe don't bother with the rest, even if they're ski slopes or they're fun that the subscale, subscale just doesn't work for meeting and marketing to people. It just doesn't work.\n\nLenny (01:58:25):\nI said at the top of this podcast that there's a billion things that we could talk about, and I think that's exactly what happened. We can go in so many directions. And that alone was extremely interesting, because people want me to run a conference and I really don't. And I really enjoy the meetups that we have now. And we actually do have sponsors that cover drinks and food and things like that, and they're very chill, and I really love what happens at those things. But yes, this is really good information. Jason, I have two more questions for you that I ask everyone. I think we went through a couple of these things, but just real quick, where can folks find you if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on some of the stuff you talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJason Lemkin (01:59:03):\nIn general just go to this kooky, URL, SaaStr, saastr.com. That's a way to access a lot of what we're talking about. If they want to reach me to be transparent, I get a lot of impound, like I'm sure you do, to be honest, guys, it is hard to process the amount of inbound that folks get, right? But I'll give you an insider tip. I do see almost all of it. So, if you want to reach me, if you just want an hour of my time randomly, I'm sorry, honestly, I'm sorry, I don't have that hour of time, okay? But if you want to interact lightly, I mean, I'm on Twitter all most days @Jasonlk. I'm on LinkedIn a lot, just search for me, Jason Lemkin. LinkedIn's pretty cool. I have 260,000 followers. We have really good conversations. And I will tell you, if you have a question like you really need some help in your business or you want to do a pitch, if you send me the world's best email pitch, I will read a 100% of them.\n\n(02:00:00):\nTrack it, put it in Mixmax, put it in HubSpot, put it... You'll see I'll open that email if the title's good. It doesn't mean I can respond. I'm sorry, no, Lenny can't respond, but realize it is going to be read. If you need a favor, like a help, if you ask the question super discreetly like, \"Jason, here's the LinkedIn, I'm Lenny. I'm trying to hire this person. I'm at four millionaire doubling. Should I hire her?\" There's a chance I'll look at that LinkedIn, I can tell you, or if it's one question, but if it's an hour or coffee, it isn't going to work, but it is going to get read. So, do that by email. Do it even by LinkedIn. I didn't used to read those LinkedIn emails, but if it's really good, I will read it and I probably respond to five or six of them a day.\n\n(02:00:35):\nI give to the extent that it's helpful, free answers, free advice. Not that I charge for anything, but make it good. Don't ask for coffee. So, many folks have written this, the most important people in the world read email. It's an open medium, right? And a subset of those folks actually read their social media. Even Elon Musk reads his, before he bought Twitter, he read it. You can access almost anyone in this industry. Just be super strategic about how you do it. Again, put yourself in your shoes. Would you answer this? Would you do this? But I would say half the stuff gets open to read. So, I know that's a rambly answer, but first, we talked about sales. You can reach anybody in the world via email. It's magical.\n\nLenny (02:01:11):\nI'm sorry for the many emails you might get from this podcast. That is actually really good advice. Resonates deeply with me as well. Jason, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJason Lemkin (02:01:21):\nThank you for all the time, Lenny. I'm a super fan. It's great to be here and let me know anything I can do to support you or your community going forward.\n\nLenny (02:01:28):\nI really appreciate that. And the same in reverse. Bye everyone.

It starts from a place of I need to disagree, I need to say no. It's a very negative mindset, purely based on the word that has come to label a behavior that alternatively could be about how do I shift the direction on something, or how do I help the business actually succeed when I disagree with somebody about something, and that's a very different mindset. And so, the two things that I've seen be most successful would be, I think number one is actually understanding what a goal is or what somebody's kind of issue is with something, and then actually aligning those things in some way.\n\nLenny (00:00:53):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Jason Shah. I was lucky to work with Jason while I was at Airbnb, and when I started working on this podcast, I knew that I wanted to have Jason on. He was actually my very first guest on this podcast when I was pre-recording some episodes, but as you'll hear in our chat, we decided to take another crack at it for reasons you'll soon understand.\n\nLenny (00:01:28):\nIn this episode, we cover what it's like to be a PM in Web3 and how that's changed as crypto winter has returned, how to lead a team through ups and downs, which leaders in Web3 know all too well, including how to keep morale up and people focused when so much is changing around you. We also get into a ton of killer advice on leadership, hiring, pushing back on your CEO, working backwards, career advancement, and a lot more juicy stuff. Jason is a gem and I am really excited to share this episode with you. With that, I bring you Jason Shah.\n\nLenny (00:02:05):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda's an all-in-one doc that combines the best documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place. I actually use Coda every single day. It's my home base for organizing my newsletter writing. It's where I plan my content calendar, capture my research, and write the first drafts of each and every post. It's also where I curate my private knowledge repository for paid newsletter subscribers, and it's also how I manage the workflow for this very podcast. Over the years, I've seen Coda evolve from being a tool that makes teams more productive. It's one that also helps bring the best practices across the tech industry to life, with an incredibly rich collection of templates and guides in Coda Doc Gallery, including resources for many guests on this podcast, including Shreyas, Gokul, and Shishir, the CEO of Coda. Some of the best teams out there like Pinterest, Spotify, Square, and Uber use Coda to run effectively and have published their templates for anyone to use.\n\nLenny (00:03:03):\nIf you're ping-ponging between lots of documents and spreadsheets, make your life better and start using Coda.

Hey, John.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:03:36):\nHey, Lenny. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:37):\nJohn, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:03:49):\nWell, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop. Think collect data, inform bets, ship experiments and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So, the big aha was seeing how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach, and send data to other destinations. Experiment in CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.\n\nLenny (00:04:09):\nAnd supporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:04:14):\nYeah. So, Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.\n\nLenny (00:04:22):\nAbsolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John, and head to amplitude.com to get started. Jason, welcome to the podcast.\n\nJason Shah (00:04:34):\nThanks so much, Lenny. Really excited to chat with you today.\n\nLenny (00:04:36):\nSomething listeners don't know that we know is that we actually recorded an episode between you and I back in April. It was actually my very first episode that I ever did for this podcast, and it was before I launched. It was kind of like a pre-launch launch episode, and interestingly enough, by the time the podcast launched and it was going to go out, well, let me also add that we chatted mostly about Web3, forgot that detail. So, most of our chat was about Web3 in the state of Web3 and PMing in Web3, and by the time the podcast's supposed to come out, Web3, things have changed in the world of Web3, and so, it kind of felt a little stale and out of touch, and so, we decided let's do it again. And so, how do you feel about that?\n\nJason Shah (00:05:15):\nI appreciate that, Lenny. I'm honored that you would have me back. I'm going to count it as the personal record of two times on Lenny's Podcast, even if the world only knows it as one.\n\nLenny (00:05:26):\nWow. Good one. Okay, first ever guest and first two-time return guest. Amazing. Okay. To set a little context for folks on your background, your career, could you just give us a 60-second overview of your background and your career and how you got to what you're doing today?\n\nJason Shah (00:05:45):\nYeah, for sure. Thanks again for having me, Lenny. So, my career has all been about solving important problems in a unique way. I think the latter part is the youngest child in me who has to be special and do things different than other people, and the former is about making sure that my time is spent well since we're all limited there. So, I actually got started in a sense in tech when I was 15. I started my first company, much like a lot of teenagers, it was around test prep and getting people ready for college, and it was my first exposure to using technology at scale to help people, and I just found it addictive ever since.\n\nJason Shah (00:06:20):\nAnd so, I ran that company for seven years through school, was lucky to do a small acquisition to a partner of ours that we had worked with throughout, and then I would just hooked, and I moved to San Francisco without a job. I was really arrogant. I said, \"I'll never work for anybody else,\" and then lo and behold, Yammer comes along, I'm super excited about it, I had been working on a product actually in the same space. And so, that was actually my first formal product management role, and I stayed at Yammer, I stayed through the Microsoft acquisition back in 2012. Low and behold, I was at the world's largest productivity company at Microsoft, and most people there in my opinion were wildly unproductive and I wasn't shipping a lot. I got the itch again, so started another company called do.com and ran that for about four years, and then eventually, we found a better fit with Amazon. They were growing their AWS offering, SAS products. So, we partnered with them to kind of do a small acqui-hire and help build the team out and the product there for a little over a year.\n\nJason Shah (00:07:18):\nAnd then again, to be honest, I got bored and excited about what Airbnb was doing and the mission around belonging. That's why I was lucky to meet you and so many other really wonderful product leaders and just human beings in general at their core, and then to keep things brief for now, I got to work on a lot of really exciting products and businesses there, but eventually got the itch for Web3 after being a kind of observer from afar, investor, and I wanted to be a builder in Web3 specifically, and to me, it's a new vision of a better version of the internet. I'm really excited about that. So, I've been with Alchemy which is a blockchain infrastructure company for the last year, and really excited about all the opportunities. I've gotten to work on products that have been part of most people's everyday lives, and I'm hopeful that we'll get to do that with Web3 and Alchemy as well.\n\nLenny (00:08:05):\nAmazing. I just realized as you're chatting there, do.com, I'm pretty sure I used that back in the day. I think I just realized that.\n\nJason Shah (00:08:12):\nI hope so. That would be a new, I'll add that to my second podcast achievement is if I got Lenny to use a product that I worked on, especially a startup.\n\nLenny (00:08:20):\nWow. Cool. Okay, so we're going to go a little bit backwards through your career and start with Web3. We're not going to spend most of the time on Web3, but just thought it'd be good to chat about some of these things, partly because you guest authored the sixth most popular post, online newsletter of all time, currently at number six, and it was about how to be a PM in Web3. Basically it's called The Product Manager's Guide to Web3. And so, a few questions there I wanted to touch on. One is just like, how would you describe the current state of Web3? We're recording this at the end of July, and so, we'll see when this comes out. But I'm just curious from someone working within it, kind of going through the boom and the busts, not the bust, the winter that we're kind of in a little bit right now. Yeah, how do you feel about it right now?\n\nJason Shah (00:09:01):\nYeah, for sure. So, as much as I'm a techno optimist, I'm also realist, and with that being said, I genuinely believe Web3 is in the strongest position that it's ever been in. I think it's important to remember that the term Web3 has barely existed in kind of popular lexicon for barely a year. We've definitely had crypto for more than a decade now as technology, arguably as a financial instrument of some sort, but specifically the number of companies that I'm seeing be formed, the number of products that are starting to actually achieve some form of early product market fit, some products that are starting to scale. There's definitely been obviously a huge drop in price. There's definitely been some huge scandals in terms of financial mismanagement and the contagion from that.\n\nJason Shah (00:09:46):\nBut I think it's been my experience that a lot of new technologies don't move up in a straight line, and Web3 is especially challenging here because so many things have been financialized from the outset, whereas generally speaking, you'll see startups or new technologies mature over many years, whether it's the internet itself, artificial intelligence, QR codes, all sorts of things that kind of have gone through different periods of adoption, and so, I think we're seeing things kind of record Ethereum transactions happening, new Layer 2 technologies launching all the time that are going to help scale Layer 1 Blockchains, Solana has announced its phone that's going to be the first sort of Web3 native phone out there. So, there's so many new exciting product developments and users entering the space that as much as prices have come down, I'm really optimistic about the state of Web3.\n\nLenny (00:10:32):\nI think about a little bit is going through this shift in excitement about Web3 as a PM within a company working in this space, I imagine it tests some of the core skills of a PM, like keeping people focused, prioritizing effectively, keeping morale up. If people are getting like, \"Oh man, all my cryptos going down,\" I'm curious how you've been able to leverage those skills and what you've learned going through this experience, keeping people focused, morale up, prioritizing effectively, those sorts of things.\n\nJason Shah (00:11:00):\nYeah, it's a great question. It's really important, right, because we've seen in this space that there are these cycles, and I think that morale and ability to keep building are the determinants of long-term success, and if everybody kind of takes the ball and goes home, that uncertain future won't necessarily materialize. So, in my opinion, I think that the only way to maintain moral is to make progress. I think that no speech, no sort of extrinsic motivators like we're going to give everybody some free crypto to keep motivated about it or something like that really works. I think people get really excited when they see progress.\n\nJason Shah (00:11:37):\nSo, for example, at Alchemy, we see more developers than we've ever had on the platform today, and then we're shipping, we just launched Solana support and people are like, \"This is real.\" We're actually doing things, building things. We just had our team out at EthCC which is a big conference in Paris for the Ethereum community, and it was wild the number of people that were there, products being built. Pretty much every crypto conference has a hackathon, and so, it keeps the spirit of building so alive.\n\nJason Shah (00:12:03):\nAnd so, I think it at Alchemy and just in other situations that I've been in as a leader over time, I think it's all about a focus on progress and moving forward. We saw this at Airbnb when the business had a draw down in revenue, and I know you'd covered this with Sanchan recently, right? It was 85, 90% revenue and you didn't know when it was going to turn around, right? It's not just like, \"Oh yeah, this will come back in six months and we can just keep plowing forward.\" But I think what worked was making progress and actually focusing on product and your customers, and ultimately if you hire the right people who are motivated for the right reasons, I think that recipe keeps people highly motivated and highly effective at building for when things do eventually turn around.\n\nLenny (00:12:44):\nOne of the most interesting and maybe surprising points you made in the post that you wrote about being a PM in Web3 is that there's much less need for a PM, especially early stage Web3, and it feels like, the stuff you're talking about feels like a PM's really helpful along these lines. So, I'm curious, are things changing at all there? Have you changed your perspective on PMs and Web3, and then I don't know, where do you see the evolution of product management and Web3?\n\nJason Shah (00:13:09):\nI actually am seeing things change a lot, and one thing in Web3, if one learns nothing is the ability to admit when they're wrong or when things change. And so, I think that that's exactly what I'm seeing. So, basically, I'm specifically noticing a lot of teams hiring product leaders, more product managers. Those product managers are actually now working kind of increasingly in sort of more traditional product management fashion, in addition to some of the differences that we discussed in the post around the community management and role in marketing and things like this, but specifically, Uniswap just made a big hire out of Meta. I saw that Gemini also did the same. We're seeing OpenSea hire a lot of talent along these lines too, even through the ups and downs that their business has seen, and at all levels. Whether it's kind of product manager, senior product manager, director, VP or CPO, you're seeing it across the board.\n\nJason Shah (00:14:03):\nAnd so, I think that's partially happening because you're seeing a maturation of products, right, and so, maybe you can start early with a few engineers, a community manager, get the ball rolling, but eventually the product is more mature, the complexity has grown, the role of the product manager is far more useful than they can differentiate. I also think the market is getting increasingly competitive. So, there's many NFT marketplaces. There's many Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains. As a result, I think product is always a competitive advantage, right? If it's working, it improves strategy, it improves execution, and improves team collaboration. And so, maybe that was less of a difference maker before where these teams didn't need that competitive advantage as much because maybe they launched a token and the token was mooning, and so a bunch of people were adopting the product, but that only lasts so long, and first principles still come come in to focus, whether it's one day or one month from now.\n\nJason Shah (00:15:00):\nSo, I'm definitely seeing it shift. It's definitely making a huge, positive difference in the cases that I've observed, and my hunch is we're only going to continue to observe this because with more user adoption comes new challenges, and for all these players that are growing and getting some form of adoption, the product complexity is only going to grow, and having somebody to help lead teams, help prioritize between all the different products that they could build or strategies they could pursue is going to only increase in importance.\n\nLenny (00:15:27):\nI know we're like we're PM people talking about the value of PM, but something I find is that people that are kind of anti having a PM or don't see why they need a PM in my experience just haven't worked with a great product manager because my experience, you find a great PM, they just make everything better, and so, it's not surprising to hear what you're sharing which is people are kind of discovering that value of bringing on a product manager, even if it's mostly engineering work. And so, that's promising, and I wonder if that's just a natural evolution of a new space where people are like, \"Eh, I don't need PMs in this one,\" and then like, \"Oh, okay, well, I see. All these things aren't happening. We need someone to help. Who can do that for us? Maybe it's a PM.\"\n\nJason Shah (00:16:06):\nYeah, that's a great observation. I think that combination of having a direct need for something that emerges as well as if somebody's had either a bad experience or not even had any experience with somebody who can play this role which is quite common in Web3, especially because a lot of folks are relatively early in their career, given the kind of accessibility of the space, and I think frankly the more adept understanding of the space naturally that a lot of people have when they're early in their career and less set in their ways. And so, that's a great point, and as a result, the better PMs we see in Web3, hopefully the value will prove itself out over time.\n\nLenny (00:16:41):\nAnd hopefully they do well so people don't keep getting burned out by bad PMs.\n\nJason Shah (00:16:45):\nWe're rooting for all PMs, but definitely Web3 PMs too.\n\nLenny (00:16:49):\nYeah. What's surprised you most about working in Web3 as a PM?\n\nJason Shah (00:16:53):\nI mean, I think that the biggest surprise to me, despite what we were just talking about, was how big some products have gotten without kind of the traditional either product manager role or without the playbooks that we're so used to from the last 20 years of the internet. And so, for example, Uniswap has done more daily volume on certain days than Coinbase, and Uniswap is about a hundred people versus 5,000-plus at Coinbase, right? So, that's astounding to me.\n\nJason Shah (00:17:21):\nI think a lot of these NFT collections and communities that have grown. I met with a lot of these at NFT.NYC recently, and a lot of them, aside from the price speculation and things like this, have actually built, the Bored Ape Yacht Club is actually building a metaverse project that does look better than some of the digital games that I've used in the past of Second Life and things like this. Obviously, a lot of time has passed and so there's a greater foundation of technology to build off of and they're working with a partner on that product as well, but there's a ton of progress being made without some of the traditional product structure or individuals. And so, again, I think PMs play a really strong role, but it's been incredibly surprising to see how far products can get without the product playbooks and resources that somebody who's worked in the internet space from the last 10 or 20 years is so used to.\n\nLenny (00:18:11):\nAwesome. Okay. We're going to move on from Web3 and chat a bit about some of your other career accomplishments and companies you've worked at. So, you worked at, you mentioned Yammer, Microsoft, Amazon, Airbnb. I'm curious which of those companies has most informed the way you approach product and build product and run teams because they're all so different in how they operate, and I'm always curious what company is the formative experience for you that's like, \"Here's how I like to build product most.\" I know it's always a combination, but how do you think about that?\n\nJason Shah (00:18:39):\nYeah, it's definitely a combination, but I would say if I had to pick, Amazon, even though I was only there for about a year after the acquisition. I say that because of this blend between product and business thinking that is especially present there. And so, people say Google is an engineering culture. People said Facebook is a product culture, Airbnb or Pinterest, sometimes a design culture or things like this, and I think that Amazon was a place where you couldn't divorce business and product. You couldn't be a product manager without thinking about revenue growth, without thinking about go to market, and I really like that because as a startup founder doing product in a bigger company, it gave me the chance to exercise a lot of those skills.\n\nJason Shah (00:19:24):\nIt's very similar actually to how I feel at Alchemy now where I remember my first month there I was like, people ask me how's it going, I'm like, \"I feel like an athlete. I feel alive again.\" I can do M&A one day, I can be doing product another minute. I could be figuring out, oh, we need to hire our first lawyer to write onboarding plans for employees the next minute, and it wasn't as siloed as sometimes a product role can be. So, I think Amazon, I went there to learn and understand. That was my biggest goal was this is an incredible company that's gone into... The Whole Foods acquisition happened when I was there, and I was wondering how does the same company kind of within retail win with the AWS, go create studios, and I think the Amazon culture ultimately more than anything else around ownership, being vocally self-critical is right a lot as one of the leadership principles. All these things combined I think created a really unique culture.\n\nJason Shah (00:20:12):\nSo, I would say Amazon's had the biggest impact on me, and there have been certain lessons that I've taken from, like you said, all these places, but Amazon was by far the place that I think left the biggest mark on my view on product and leadership.\n\nLenny (00:20:26):\nThat's quite amazing that you were there for a year and that's the one that's most informed and impacted you. Do you feel like people should try to go work at Amazon as a training ground as a PM? Is that something you encourage PM to try to do?\n\nJason Shah (00:20:37):\nIn general, I certainly had a positive experience, but I think that as you know and as I'm sure you've advised countless people, it's so context dependent. Are you learning the zero to one? Are you learning the one to scale? What's your aspiration? Is somebody trying to start a company eventually, or are they trying to work the ranks of the product leadership trajectory? And so, I definitely enjoyed it a lot, and I think to your point, there's often a non-linear sort of correlation between factors that we traditionally think are linked, right? So, my time there was one of the shortest, but my learnings were some of the greatest because I was really intentional and maybe because of the sort of moment in time and what I wanted to get out of it.\n\nJason Shah (00:21:17):\nThe same way for what it's worth, while we're talking about this disconnect, when I went to Yammer, I also interviewed with kind of... This was the era of TaskRabbit. I talked to Square and I remember people always say, \"Well, what stage do you want to join seed, Series A, Series B?\" And the crazy thing is that Yammer was, it was already passed a hundred people, it grew to 500 by the time of the acquisition, and it felt almost like the culture was so tightknit, it felt like a seed stage company at some points, even though eventually it kind of felt like... Well, once it was acquired from Microsoft, we'll just say it didn't feel like a seed stage company anymore, but it felt smaller than a lot of the actual smaller companies than I was at. So, I think that's something I've noticed a lot is that a lot of the proxies don't necessarily match the internal realities in certain cases.\n\nLenny (00:22:01):\nYou mentioned you picked up a bunch of tactics and kind of lessons from some of these companies. What's one concrete process or tactic that you took it away from either Amazon or one of these other companies that stuck with you that you like to kind of share with folks?\n\nJason Shah (00:22:14):\nYeah, definitely. I mean, I think one that Amazon is well-known for is the working backwards process, and for those that don't know, the idea is try to define effectively an ideal end state which funnily enough is very similar to some of what we both experienced at Airbnb and took away, and usually the mechanism for doing this is what's called a PRFAQ, and that's a press release and frequently asked questions, and it forces a certain degree of clarity to have to actually write a press release about the product that you're going to eventually launch.\n\nJason Shah (00:22:44):\nEvery employee goes through actually like a business writing class after they start at Amazon. They give you a little card with five tips that you're supposed to keep on your desk about concision and specificity in the words you use. For example, you should never write the word great in an Amazon press release. You should write user friendly in X, Y, Z way and will save customers time 20 minutes each day through this. It's intended to be very concrete in a way that avoids some of the fluffiness that frankly... It's funny, when people try to move from slides to docs, they really just import the same mindsets that they use in slides, but just with more words now.\n\nJason Shah (00:23:22):\nAnd so, I think the working backwards process of establishing the long-term goal using a mechanism like a press release and the FAQs where every word matters, and even the FAQs, for what it's worth, there's a section for external FAQs that you would include for example as an appendix, but also internal FAQs that are meant to de-risk launch or raise the elephant in the room or dogs not barking as Amazon likes to call it often. So, that was a really helpful process that felt very true to me as a way I like to live my life as well, and then also very applicable.\n\nLenny (00:23:55):\nThe tidbit about not using the word great is so interesting. Is there anything else there that you could share about just basically just like how to write effectively and communicate and launch. Is there any other tidbits along those lines?\n\nJason Shah (00:24:07):\nYeah, that's a good question. In addition to not using the word great and words like it that are either subjective in what they mean or unclear in what they actually mean, definitely using numbers more than adjectives. Strict concision, I would go over these documents countless times, and there's a phrase, I can't remember, it's either Mark Twain or another famous writer who said kill your darlings, right? Cut, cut, cut, and just remove. And so, I think I found that really useful in emails I write or documents I write to this day is just going over, not because you're saving ink by cutting words, but because it forces clarity of thought. Fewer words means every word is 10 pounds in weight instead of one, and that means that the decisions you're making, the trade offs are far more intentional, and in the case of great, if you say something is great because we're going to deliver something in two hours versus Amazon's great because the selection is very wide, the implications on strategy are completely different. And so, that's one of the benefits of being very specific and very concrete in language.\n\nLenny (00:25:12):\nI didn't intend to go too deep into this topic, but no one's ever covered this working backwards process on this podcast, so it's kind of interesting to talk about it a little bit more maybe. How does that actually work? So, you sit there and you actually write out a press release that would go out when you launch this thing. Is there like a template used? Is there anything you could share for folks that want to try this out and/or point them to a resource that will help them down this road?\n\nJason Shah (00:25:36):\nYeah, definitely. That's a great question. So, there definitely is a template, and so, it's a combination of an internal training where you have to write one of these documents. You review kind of good, bad, medium versions of this. It's generally used if there's let's say a proposal for a new product or even a proposal to buy a company. This helps really simulate what it's going to be like.\n\nJason Shah (00:25:56):\nWith respect to a template, what I recall is it was often sort of an introduction where you get kind of right to the point. You say what you're announcing. Then usually you would describe the problem in one paragraph and in very clear language. Again, all of the writing is this way. Then the solution, you briefly describe the product. After that, there's always a customer quote, and this is an example of this customer obsession that Amazon is so famous for that many companies like to say or emulate, but I think it really kind of may not be true if you evaluate the mechanisms that they use, for example, product specs that either don't have customer data or don't have quotes from customers, things like this. And so, there's a customer quote, and you have to literally put yourself into the shoes of... Let's say you were launching Prime. Put yourself in the shoes of Lenny from San Francisco. What exactly is he going to say when he has access to this, and how's it different than his life today, and what are the words that he's going to use?\n\nLenny (00:26:52):\nYou can't use great.\n\nJason Shah (00:26:53):\nI mean, if great is one of your favorite words, maybe you could stretch it, but I think if you were in a room with your peers at Amazon, they might put some red pen through any greats that are used there. So, I found that really helpful, and it also helps force out of this box that product managers, product leaders tend to get into of thinking that they are always the customer and being a little sort of intellectually lazy, where I'm like, \"Yeah, I would like Prime, so let me write the quote for what I would like,\" but maybe I'm only a small segment within our total customer addressable market.\n\nJason Shah (00:27:26):\nSo, anyhow, there's a customer quote, then there's one leadership quote similarly that this achieves a complimentary goal, like how does this fit into our strategy in a way that you would express to the public but is still true to what the internal sensitivities and mechanisms would be. And then a call to action towards the end, and not just download here, but this will be available to customers next month. They can go access these portals within these Whole Food stores at this state. It again forces clarity of thought with respect to not only the rollout plan, but taking a step back. When you read it, do you feel like you would actually want this product? Would you use it? So, I found that really helpful as a structure.\n\nLenny (00:28:05):\nCan you just summarize those again real quick?\n\nJason Shah (00:28:07):\nFor sure. So the structure of the PRFAQ docs was generally an introduction where you're announced the product, problem, solution, customer quote, leadership quote, and a call to action.\n\nLenny (00:28:17):\nSo, interesting how similar that is to a one pager potentially. The other thought I had while you're chatting, so the Airbnb approach is work back from the ideal, Brian talks about it, the 11-star experience versus the Amazon approach which it doesn't need to be the ideal, it just needs to be an awesome launch. So, that's an interesting difference, both effective in different ways.\n\nJason Shah (00:28:37):\nI think people tend to, when they see that both companies have some sort of working backwards process of thought, I would say working backwards on one hand and then 11-star experience on the other. Listening to how you describe it, I want to almost frame it as working backwards from sort of a moment in time or a launch like you said with Amazon versus working backwards from a quality standard in some sense of an 11-star experience.\n\nLenny (00:28:59):\nGoing in a slightly different direction, one of the things I wanted to chat about is you worked at all these different companies and they have different types of leadership and different approaches to leadership. And so, I'm curious, what have you learned about effective leadership watching all these awesome operators work, and what kind of separates them in your experience from folks that maybe aren't as effective?\n\nJason Shah (00:29:18):\nYeah, it's a great question, and to briefly recap, right, I've gotten to see somebody like David Sachs who've been the CEO of PayPal and then the founder of Yammer and gone to do many more things since then. I've gotten to see sort of Jeff Bezos at a distance. I was never that close to him obviously and never got to work with him, but got to observe his impact on the organization. Obviously, I've gotten to witness Brian Chesky and his leadership in sort of the pre-IPO days as well as through the ups and downs of COVID, and then also now at Alchemy, our co-founders, Joe and Nikil are leaders that have really had an impact on me as well, and I would count myself, but I've also see myself as a bad leader in the start of [inaudible 00:29:56] and learn from that.\n\nJason Shah (00:29:57):\nI think it's a really important thing to reflect on, and I think for me there are three things that have stood out the most. I think number one, nothing is above them. I've seen whether it's Brian caring about the full bleed image on the homepage, whether it's Jeff Bezos who famously would receive customer emails, read many of them, forward them, and he's famous for question mark emails where for his time's sake he would just forward an email to a leader with a question mark and you would just have to figure it out and then report back in 24 hours with the resolution thereof. But nothing's above them, and a lot of founders or a lot of CEOs or even CPOs and leaders think you get to a certain point and then I'm above a product spec, I'm above looking at the data running a sequel query, and I think that that is a mistake in a lot of ways, especially from a standpoint of who people come to respect as well as efficacy at one's job.\n\nJason Shah (00:30:51):\nAnd then the other two things would be, I think they're in the details. So, it's less about being above something, but this is kind of Amazon's famous for auditing the details for example, and leaders are... For example, when we were going to launch Prime, order a bunch of Prime things and see what happens and really test things out, and write up a long feedback email on Saturday or something like that, and make sure that things are moving forward.\n\nJason Shah (00:31:12):\nSo, I think in my opinion, some of the best leaders, David Sachs would do this too. He actually ran the product reviews. It was the CEO of the company doing product reviews, not some kind of middle tier of a director of product who was just running them. They were force involved and there were things to delegate and activate around, but Sachs was in all of those details and ran those product reviews himself and would talk to the product managers directly, and I think that was really impactful, and it also, I think from an accountability and culture perspective, when you're PM and you talk to the CEO and you feel like you're presenting something at product review, it's totally different, and it creates a certain amount of responsibility and quality, frankly, that I think is really important, and it's a way to coach obviously as well for those leaders to really make a mark on the organization.\n\nJason Shah (00:31:59):\nAnd then lastly, I think they adapt, right? I think that are a lot of leaders who are like, \"I've worked 20 years to become a leader in this way and I have a playbook,\" either based on past experience or based on some sort of philosophy that they've developed over time that they feel committed to in some way, and I think coming back to some of these examples of watching Brian lead through COVID or watching Joe and Nikil now through this particular crypto winter shift gears and figure out exactly like we're still building the core business, but how else can we lean into this and adapt to the unique opportunities that are in front of us. I think that's really powerful. So, what I've seen is nothing is above them, they're in the details, and they adapt to new information and new situations. That's what I've seen the most that I've appreciated in the best leaders that I've gotten to either observe or work closely with.\n\nLenny (00:32:46):\nAwesome. That's super interesting. The first two are kind of connected which is really interesting, and it just reminds me of Brian and how detail-oriented he was about everything. He used to review every product launch and every screen of every new product. We had to show him here's what we're launching this week, and he just kind of went through and either blew it up or let it pass. And then I just remember the founders, when they were designing the office space, just looking at pictures of listings they wanted to... Because Airbnb, the office conference rooms were modeled after Airbnb listings, and Jim just looking through hundreds of listings that the team brought him and he'd just picked the ones that he wanted to turn into conference rooms. Also, obviously Steve Jobs. This is a really interesting through line of great leaders is just this huge attention to detail, and there's probably something about once they let go that thing start to kind of diminish. Is that what you find?\n\nJason Shah (00:33:39):\nYeah, that's such a great point. You mentioned the Jobs example and there's a great book that you've probably read or in your community seen, I believe it's called Creative Selection by Ken Kocienda about the early days of the iPhone, and I think it was Project Purple or something like that, and you're absolutely right. There wasn't no slides, none of this. They brought in the prototypes for each of those reviews and things like how to do typing on a tiny screen and those early keyboards and how to do auto complete, and Jobs was totally in those details from Ken's telling in this book.\n\nJason Shah (00:34:10):\nSo, I couldn't agree with you more, and it's something that people miss because most of their exposure to leaders is on a YouTube video or at all hands, and so, they don't really get to see that side of leaders I think, and it's also not what I think from an ego perspective is kind of what people want it to be about. They want to be about making big decisions or commanding a large group of people, and I think it's hard to do that without these pieces.\n\nJason Shah (00:34:34):\nOne other thing I just wanted to briefly touch on to your point on how they're connected, it's a really good point, and at the surface it almost seems like they could potentially be the same thing. One thing worth calling out though I think is the idea of something not being above somebody or a person not being above things. I think the biggest thing I take away from that is humility is that nothing is not my job, right? Anything, could be picking up paper off the floor and putting it in the trash, or it could be reviewing a product spec, whatever it is, and then begin the details in my opinion is about craft, right, and really understanding things at a low level such that you're able to reason about it and make good decisions, like Brian with the homepage or Bezos in some cases with customer processes that he got in the weeds on. I think the two together, humility and being excellent at craft, I think is a very potent combination, especially when you throw in the last thing of being able to adapt to any situation.\n\nLenny (00:35:29):\nThat's really interesting. What it also makes me think about is the reason things are less good often if there isn't a person at the top that's being very detail-oriented, and I find this with the newsletter and this podcast and other stuff is no one's going to care as much about it. No one's going to be like, \"Oh my god, I really need to get this right so much because I'm just like, I'm personally feeling responsible for the quality of this stuff and it's like it's on my shoulders to make this awesome.\" And so, I think that's probably why a lot of the best stuff is led by a singular leader or singular opinion or singular person. A lot of the best startups are just someone's vision is like, \"Here, this is what we're going to do,\" and then the more it becomes a community-driven thing, the less often it ends up being successful.\n\nLenny (00:36:16):\nThis episode is brought to you by Maven. I've been an investor, an advisor, and a customer of Maven from day one. I even taught my product management course through Maven. Maven is a cohort-based learning platform where you learn alongside peers with a direct connection to your instructor. Maven's got a ton of courses for product managers, founders, and executives to help them level up in all kinds of ways. Over 10,000 people from Airbnb to Coinbase to Google to Tesla have taken courses from real experts and operators that have spent decades honing their craft. As part of their fall season which Maven just launched, there are over 100 new courses starting in the next few weeks. Many of the people I've had on this podcast are teaching courses like Jackie Bavaro on product strategy, Arielle Jackson on startup branding, Emily Kramer on B2B marketing, plus Annie Duke on decision-making, Nir Eyal on behavioral design and how to break into product management with Marily Nika. Check out all of my favorite courses and learn more at maven.com/lenny.\n\nJason Shah (00:37:19):\nI feel like you're totally right, especially, I mean this is the natural progression, but it doesn't have to be that way right? And I think to your point, I think a lot of leaders focus on accountability in an organization once they get large, and so, you see things like performance reviews and things like this. It's a very top-down approach to trying to drive results, but is opposed to a sense of accountability if you drove a sense of responsibility. If people felt like this is my company too, this is my product, this is my office floor. I don't want trash on the floor. I'm going to pick it up and throw it there. Even if we have somebody whose job it supposedly is to clean that up, it's like I take pride of ownership in this and I'm connected to it, and I think that makes all the difference in terms of... At Airbnb, I think people who felt that way were willing to push back on certain things, or they're willing to propose new ideas because they felt invested in the company.\n\nJason Shah (00:38:12):\nI see it at Alchemy all the time. I see an engineer hop in and fix something at 3:00 AM because they feel committed to the code base, and it's not a thousand-person engineering organization where my only job is to make the iOS app 2% more effective at engaging users.\n\nLenny (00:38:27):\nSo, you touched on the skill of pushing back on a founder or CEO, and I know that's something you're really good at. I've seen you do this. I'm curious what you've learned about how to effectively do that as a PM at a company pushing back on a CEO or founder when you disagree.\n\nJason Shah (00:38:40):\nI mean, I think this is one of... I actually think it's one of the most misunderstood terms in a sense because I think language like we were talking about earlier is so important, and yet what you call something ends up defining I think 90% of what people understand about a concept, right? And so, pushback is, I couldn't imagine a word more viscerally that makes you feel like you're sort physically going against what somebody else wants, and it gears people into a mindset of then, well, how should I push back. It starts from a place of I need to disagree, I need to say no. It's a very negative mindset, purely based on the word that has come to label a behavior that alternatively could be about how do I shift the direction on something, or how do I help the business actually succeed when I disagree with somebody about something, and that's a very different mindset.\n\nJason Shah (00:39:34):\nAnd so, the two things that I've seen be most successful would be, I think number one is actually understanding what a goal is or what somebody's kind of issue is with something, and then actually aligning those things in some way. So, in coming back to Airbnb, I remember Airbnb had bought a company, Luxury Retreats. There was a goal to integrate that business and that product into the full Airbnb suite, and there was a lot of potential with that, but I remember that there was part of the product experience that was oriented around chatting with somebody and the idea that the business had had a very large team of wonderful people who helped you as concierges basically for your trip, and so, this was a team that I was on that, to be honest, had fairly low morale. It's always difficult to integrate an acquisition with a company, especially when we were based in different places, et cetera.\n\nJason Shah (00:40:26):\nI remember hearing from a leader who had been at Airbnb for a while who's very effective at persuading senior leadership, and they understood why this was a problem because this chat product was growing in complexity. You'd have to build all these features into it, and nobody could successfully shift the direction, and as a result, it was just this... It was a mess as a result, and there was very low morale because we were taking on too much scope, people weren't sure it was the right product, it was being built up as one giant launch as opposed to an iterative thing. And what was really interesting was that this leader was very effective at understanding that the goal wasn't about building a bunch of features. It was about, as often discussed at Airbnb, a magical experience.\n\nJason Shah (00:41:06):\nAnd so, when we took a step back, it was reimagined as trip designers, not concierges, and their goal was to design your trip, and part of that meant a very elegant, simple chat experience so that you could have a efficient, fast, positive experience with that trip designer and move on. And it shifted the pushback of like, \"We can't build this thing, it's too many features, we don't have enough time, we don't have enough resources\" to, \"Oh, we all want a really elegant, really smooth, slick experience for our customers. How do we do that? What's a trip design or a new concept that is actually going to elevate things? We're not telling you we want a payback scope. We're not saying we want to settle for less. We're actually just not only going to call it something different, but also envision a simpler experience which is more elegant. It's more on brand with luxury.\"\n\nJason Shah (00:41:51):\nBoom, all of a sudden, everybody gets what they want. It's a better customer experience, less scope, and it wasn't about saying no. It was about understanding what we're all actually sharing as a goal which was a great simple customer experience and then actually building that. So, I saw that to be really effective and I think that that's something I try to bring into my career. I have a couple other examples if it's useful, but that was a big one that I learned from Airbnb.\n\nLenny (00:42:16):\nYeah, another example would be great. One thought there though is do you think it was mostly the name and the concept or was it that it was a bigger idea? What do you think it was about reframing it that way that got people, \"Oh wow, okay, now I'm really excited about it again\"?\n\nJason Shah (00:42:30):\nThat's a great point. I think it was a big idea, right, with a good reframing, and I think it's like many things where there's the substance of something and then there's the communication of it. And so, this is true often, for example, if a company is changing strategy. Oftentimes people might walk away feeling like, \"Yeah, I guess I kind of agree with the strategy, but the way was communicated was really poor,\" or vice versa, like, \"Yeah, they told us in advance and they sat us down all hands, but I really disagree with this strategy and I'm going to be dug into my heels and not disagree and commit now.\"\n\nJason Shah (00:42:58):\nSo, in this case, I think you're totally right. If it was just window dressing of... Founders are too smart, especially at all these companies we've talked about, to be fooled with a simple renaming of something. But I think the combination of a bigger idea, more exciting idea that was at the heart of what we were all going after together, combined with a simple way of communicating it because I've also seen big ideas that are poorly communicated fall flat on their face and not achieve the intended outcome. Those two together, I think were a really potent combination.\n\nLenny (00:43:28):\nAwesome. I'd love to hear another example.\n\nJason Shah (00:43:30):\nYeah, for sure. So, a recent example at Alchemy actually, right? We're growing, we're hiring, but there are a lot of roles, especially being in Web3 that are not yet created. For example, there's traditionally growth, product growth marketing, we've created new area around growth operations which I'd be happy to talk about if we want to get into it. But it's a really interest interesting area, and we were going back and forth on should we hire for this role, it's not even a real thing. We've looked at some candidates, we're not so sure about them. And when I realize with our founders who are incredibly smart, very talented, have built the company over so many years now, they want to win. That's what they care about at the end of the day. They are so driven to win at the end of the day.\n\nJason Shah (00:44:10):\nAnd so, ultimately, it wasn't like, \"Let me make some rational argument about the role of growth operations or let me defend some issues with this person's resume that maybe you're spotting when we make this hiring decision,\" but, \"Oh, you want to win? Oh, we want to grow faster? Awesome. This is the way to do it, and that's how we're going to actually become the generational company we want to be.\" Again, a reframing in this case around, yeah, we might disagree or squabble about certain things at a detail level, but I understand what we all came here to do and let's focus on that and how this is a part of that versus just focusing on maybe the means to an end versus the end itself, and the end always brings a lot of clarity in my experience.\n\nLenny (00:44:49):\nWhat's cool about both these examples, and another guest touched on this, when you're trying to influence the CEO or the founder, coming back to your working backwards concept, you almost want to work backwards from what are they excited about, how do they see the world, what's important to them, and then pitch it that way. So, in the first example, I imagine they were pitching to Brian and he's like, \"Yeah, drip design, that sounds like something Brian would love.\" Then in the second example, \"Yeah, we're going to win. Here's how we win.\" So, that's a really interesting takeaway there.\n\nJason Shah (00:45:15):\nI mean, I think we all forget that we're all just humans, and at the end of the day, we all are busy, et cetera. It reminds me of a lot of sales, right? I was very unsuccessful when I was trying to do outbound sales in the early days of my last startup do.com because I didn't understand this. I'm a product person. I'm not a sales person. I didn't listen to what people cared about. I didn't kind of work backwards from what a CRO or head of people that we might have been selling to cared about. I was just about features and here's what we can do for you and this and that. But all they cared about were one or two things, right? Maybe the CRO's growing revenue. Maybe the head of peoples worried about culture or scaling their talent organization, and we were nowhere near that list.\n\nJason Shah (00:45:56):\nAnd so, I think it's similar for CEOs, and there's a huge disconnect when say a PM walks into a meeting with the CEO and they're talking about something that CEO is 10 miles away from thinking about, and certainly even the mindset that they're bringing to the conversation is totally different. I think Casey made a lot of great points about this in the recent podcast as well.\n\nLenny (00:46:16):\nSweet. Casey Winters, podcast plug. Okay, so something else that you're really good at is you don't kind of focus career-wise on working your way up the ladder and being like the top PM, and you seem to be really good at kind of following with what's interesting to you and your interest and your curiosity. Is there something that you've learned there, something you could share for folks that are just like, \"Oh my gosh, should I just keep in with this job and work my way up? Should I try something new?\" What have you learned about that sort of thinking?\n\nJason Shah (00:46:46):\nThere's the framework I like is ladder versus map, and I think that you can be either person that any point in your life. Sometimes there's a bit of a set mindset that somebody might have one way or another, but I like ladder versus map. Ladder is about moving up. It's more influence, more power, a higher title, things like this, whereas map is I just want to go wherever's interesting, right? I literally think of it, I think of my career very similar to travel. I want to go to Greece. I want to be hungry, walking around in India, sweating in a hundred degree weather. I want to go to Australia and kind of get locked out of my hotel and see what that's like.\n\nJason Shah (00:47:23):\nI'm okay with discomfort because it's interesting. Sometimes, for better or worse, maybe this is a privilege, it's certainly a privileged thing to say, but I care more about living a really interesting life than let's say a good or comfortable life. I think that's where the growth comes from. That's where the stories come from. That's to me the things that I'll remember the most.\n\nJason Shah (00:47:42):\nAnd so, when I think about product and I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to care about the products I built and how they affected people. Nobody's really going to be looking at my LinkedIn, hopefully for their sake and mine, at my funeral. Sorry, it's a very morbid analogy, but I think thinking of the future provides a lot of clarity about what am I going to care about a long time from now, and I think that applies to all facets of life. That's how I thought about my life partner. That's how I think about my career. That's how I think about where I want to live, San Francisco. San Francisco, a lot of people like to talk negatively about it, but I believe in the community. I believe in the place I'm interested in the long term, even if you know the short term it has some challenges to it.\n\nJason Shah (00:48:21):\nSo, I personally believe really strongly in this kind of ladder versus map distinction, and I think a lot of people are very intentional in the micro. They think about their next job, their next title, how much salary and equity there is. In good ways too, they think about the team that they're going to work on next with, but they're very unintentional about the macro. What's the big picture? What do I care about as an individual? There's not a lot of classes for that. There's not a lot of blog posts in the product management field about the touchy-feely side of this, and who are you as a person, where do you get energy from. So, for me, I found that really clarifying and it makes career decisions that have seemed risky to other people seem inevitable to me.\n\nLenny (00:49:03):\nIs there a story of or example of how you use this approach to make a decision at where you end up going, and/or or is there something that you maybe regret or are really happy with in terms of the kind of the fork in the road, looking back, using this way of thinking?\n\nJason Shah (00:49:18):\nA few concrete examples, actually. I'll keep them brief though. One is when I first moved to San Francisco, and I had mentioned I did a small sale of that education company, and I could have done a lot of more productive things with my career in the short term. I had all my peers from college who had gone off to their great jobs at Google or whatever. I said, \"I'm looking to move to San Francisco and work at my dining table, and I have a little bit of savings from this, so why not? Let's see. It's going to be super interesting.\" I mean, it was also very boring at times, and so, I didn't want a lot on the sort of micro level, but I built five or six products. I became much better at programming as a result.\n\nJason Shah (00:49:56):\nI remember one time, it's kind of a goofy story, but I was working at my dining table, and I saw Ron Conway on the street. I was disheveled because I was just working from my apartment and I wanted to go pitch Ron Conway on this terrible idea for a startup, and so went out there, and maybe it was fortunate to not shove me to the side, and he listened to me for a minute and then I emailed him after. These are random things that happen that over time I think make us who we are. Are you the sort of person who's going to hustle and do that? When I was building that education company, I went and put flyers in people's cars in various high schools, and I was trying to get things started, and coming back to leadership, that would be below most people. It's like, \"Wait, you own a company and you're sticking flyers in people's windshields?\" It was like, \"What's wrong with you?\"\n\nJason Shah (00:50:40):\nSo, anyway, I think that was an example of time where it was like, \"Okay, if I'm on the ladder,\" I'm like, \"I got to get the best entry-level job or whatever.\" Even if I had been an entrepreneur before that, I would've thought about my structure in my career, and I was more like, \"This is going to be interesting. I'll figure it out. I believe in myself enough that I'll figure it out.\" So, I did that. Yammer and leaving Yammer was similar where I could have stayed. My equity was finally worth something. I could have learned a lot even I'm sure from the Microsoft structure, but I was bored and I had been talking to a couple angel investors who were willing to put money into whatever the thing was going to be, and I felt like raising money's actually going to be really hard for me. This is going to make my life a lot easier and I can focus on product and so on and so forth.\n\nJason Shah (00:51:25):\nThat was a really hard four years. Things like an M&A offer falling through the day before your wedding, or chewing glass and submitting to the Apple iStore and being a featured app and then resubmitting because we wanted to fix a bug, and then actually now it crashes 90% of the time. It's Memorial Day weekend and you can't get in touch with the Apple business development manager who can help you out to reapprove something. It was a really stressful four years, but using the map analogy, that's like getting lost in Croatia and having to find your way out or getting lost to to your hotel in Australia or getting bitten by a dog in Thailand, which actually did happen to me. But these are interesting experiences that I think build characters.\n\nJason Shah (00:52:05):\nSo, I'll pause there, but I think there are a lot of career decisions I've made. Do I have regrets? At times, for sure because you see what would've happened if you had joined a different company at that time and it would've been like, \"Oh, I would've met so many great people. I would've worked on these products. I mean, my equity would've been worth more,\" whatever. But I think you only lived once, and I think that these rare experiences have been very true to me and taught me things that I wouldn't learn otherwise.\n\nLenny (00:52:28):\nWhat's really cool about that analogy, ladder versus map, is a lot of times you think you're climbing a ladder and you think it's innately going to be great, and sometimes that ladder falls over and the company doesn't go anywhere and/or the job sucks, your ladder's heading to some terrible place. And what I find in my experience is anytime I try something totally new and take a risk, especially following things that give me energy, and I'm just like, \"Let's just take a leap on this thing,\" in my experience at least, it's always led to better opportunities and much more interesting work. And so, it's kind of this get off the ladder to get on a different ladder, and sometimes you think you're on a nice ladder and it's not going to get you anywhere anyway. So, explore other ladders. So, I'm kind of picturing a Chutes and Ladders.\n\nJason Shah (00:53:15):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (00:53:15):\nThere's many ladders and you want to explore the different ladders across the map. How about that?\n\nJason Shah (00:53:20):\nI mean, I think you're totally right, and the only brief thing I would add to the way that you put it which I think captures the essence here is I think we all have a lot of false precision about what we think a given career move is going to lead to or what it's going to be like, and we forget that a lot of career decisions are made out of maybe 10 hours cumulatively talking to a team and getting signals.\n\nJason Shah (00:53:44):\nSo, I think that that false precision sometimes gives us comfort in making certain decisions and folds us back from a bolder decision that might be better, but maybe the ladder is just hidden behind some fog if you really want that, and you can get both. Maybe you can go to the most interesting place in the world, and have the success in life and progress and so on and so forth. It's just that I think a lot of people think it's totally either/or. They think that they've already figured out the precise outcome that's going to happen, and to your point, the ladder often does fall over. If that's what all your hopes are pinned on, it's a very fragile career decision I think is really difficult to navigate.\n\nLenny (00:54:19):\nThe flip side, you also don't want to be bouncing around over and over and over. As much as I talked about how I shifted and tried new things, I'm a very serial monogamous in terms of work. My first job, I was there nine years, then a startup for a year and a half, and then Airbnb for seven years, and then what I'm doing now may be forever. And so, there's a lot of value to sticking around and kind of seeing things through. And so, I guess, I don't know if you'll have an answer to this, but do you have any wisdom on when to stick with it and keep exploring opportunities at a place you're at versus trying something new?\n\nJason Shah (00:54:54):\nMy hope is that there's a balance here in the sense that the map shouldn't give the impression of 180 countries, let's do 180 tech companies and shorten the tenure from two years down to a month, and we've just created a generation of job hoppers which is even easier because we're all on Zoom. It's a good point and I really respect people like you who have stuck it out through the ups and the downs and somebody sees seven years on paper, but I mean, seven years, I don't know. How many chapters of Airbnb, how many crises moments?\n\nLenny (00:55:26):\nFelt like 300.\n\nJason Shah (00:55:27):\nThere you go. So, I think there's a balance, right? For example, I want to be in Web3 for more than a decade. I want to stay at Alchemy for a very long time and help build the company. So, I guess when I think of map, maybe an important way to think about it is maybe when somebody is 50 or 60 or 70 and they might choose to stop working, a lot of people when they start their career actually have 30 years to play with or 40 years or 50 if they're lucky. That's a lot of chips you can play. You could do five, 10 year rounds, right? And so, I think that in terms of sticking it out, maybe I'm biased, I think that some of the absolute sort gems, if you will, in Silicon Valley and tech are the teammates that are willing to stay around for 4, 5, 6, 7 years, and they have institutional knowledge that nobody has. They have a positive impact on the culture that is impossible if there's constant employee turnover.\n\nJason Shah (00:56:19):\nSo, to me, I think that you could simultaneously be somebody who's committed to companies, stays for a very meaningful amount of time, but zooms out and looks at their career. Actually, I think maybe this was even more, right? You're now a famous podcaster. You were a successful startup founder. You were a product leader. All these things form a map and I think a really interesting career and life, frankly, that's pretty full with a lot of really interesting milestones and learnings and networks and people that you get to interact with.\n\nLenny (00:56:47):\nYeah. To your point about how long a career is, when I thought about it recently, this is my fourth career. First it was an engineer, then it was a founder, then a product manager when I got to Airbnb, and now this weird thing that I do, and there's so much time to explore and try new things. I will say though, I feel like the early things you do seem really important. Airbnb for me was not early, so maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like you want to work at a company where people look at that on your resume and are like, \"Oh, okay, this person's probably good.\" So, I feel like there's that piece you got to get right at some point.\n\nJason Shah (00:57:21):\nYeah, I totally agree with that. For example, I think for let's say a new grad who's thinking about a product career, and let's say on the spectrum there is maybe Goldman Sachs because that's what a lot of people are doing. They're like, \"Yeah, I want to do product, but I also feel like I need this gold star or whatever.\" And then in between is you could join a hypergrowth company of some sort where they definitely have good product people you can learn from, but definitely still room for you to do more than what a very junior person would be assigned to be doing. And then on the other end of the spectrum is I'm going to have no job, I'm just going to completely bounce around from my own projects or just work with a new startup every two months.\n\nJason Shah (00:57:58):\nPersonally in that spectrum, I tend to be more towards the middle of that where build a track record, build a network. I mean, it's crazy. Even just this week, next week I'm seeing maybe five people that I know from my Yammer days, and to your point on formative nature, some of those people, that's how I learned how to do product. That's how I learned things like AB testing. It's how I had the first angel investors in my next company. That's how I hire. I still hire people, maybe much to their chagrin, they still get LinkedIn messages for me trying to push them for the next thing.\n\nJason Shah (00:58:27):\nSo, I totally agree that those early days are really formative, and there's maybe a balance between nobody wants to be a job hopper, but at the same time maybe there's ways to also not just be a career person who spends kind of 30 years working up the ladder or is fixated on I need to be CPO but is willing to give up a director title to go be a hustler at some startup because they really believe in it and they want to take a bet or risk in their career.\n\nLenny (00:58:50):\nYou touched on hiring, and that's something I wanted to ask you. So, you're in my Talent Collective. You're a company that's hiring, Alchemy, and I was looking at the stats recently, and you're one of the most successful companies at getting candidates to talk to you, and generally I think you're just really good at hiring. So, I'm curious what you can share with folks about hiring.\n\nJason Shah (00:59:10):\nI appreciate that, and I get a lot of value out of meeting some really talented people from the Collective. I think hiring, it's funny, it reminds me of sort of push back in a sense of what you call it has such an impact on how people think about it. It's hiring, recruiting, but if people reframe it as the people you are going to work with every day or the people who make the company what it is, it shifts the mindset. It's like how is that not the most important thing to be thinking about as a leader or as a founder. A lot of people have benchmarks. I think maybe on the Google podcast I talk about 30%, 40% of a founder's time maybe spent on recruiting because I think deep down everybody understands that that's incredibly valuable.\n\nJason Shah (00:59:53):\nI think that for me personally, I was reflecting ahead of the podcast on how I approach things now after different stages of hiring, and for context, for what it's worth, I've been at the zero person startup. It's just me and I'm trying to convince some Google engineer to come join us which is incredibly hard and has a low hit rate, to a place like Amazon or Airbnb where you have a large world-class recruiting organization that is effectively doing sourcing for you and setting up interviews and such things like this, and there's formal calibrations and interview panels, to a place like Alchemy where it's very sort of scrappy. We need to figure out who we even want to hire. The founders still meet with every candidate. It's a really different environment.\n\nJason Shah (01:00:34):\nSo, this is kind of the spectrum that I've seen, and I was reflecting what do I think works the best, and I like to think of it in very similar motions to a business where I think there is a marketing aspect to it, there was a sales aspect, and there is a product aspect to it. What I mean by that is that on a marketing level, I think what has a person heard about your company. Do they know anybody who works there? Do they read your LinkedIn post about things and already know that you're a known quantity before they even step in the door to interview? Are they even willing to interview based on what they know about the company? And so, I think that the marketing aspect in it, and I mean it's sort of lower case marketing in this sense of course because I think a hard sell of any sort or anything that's not authentic is probably going to fail ultimately, but it's about developing a really positive kind of brand and reputation for a company but also as an individual.\n\nJason Shah (01:01:26):\nAnd then if you pass that threshold, I feel like there's a sort of a sales process, and we were talking about how bad of a salesperson I am, for example, because I didn't listen to people's pain points and understand the one or two things that were most important to them. I think similarly in this context, if they're an engineer, do they want to work in a world-class engineering organization? If they're a product person or they're just really excited about crypto and they want to find a way in, a place like Alchemy's the best place for them to learn that is how to think about it, and it's not about misdirecting on or matching whatever they say, but it's about really understanding who they are and what motivates them and what they're excited about because I'm as concerned about the kind of post-hiring step as I am the pre-hiring and want them to work out and be happy and be effective.\n\nJason Shah (01:02:12):\nAnd then lastly, I think there's a product angle to it that not a lot of people think about or talk about a lot because I think the product, it's one of those rare cases where job descriptions are almost like product specs, right? They're here's what the responsibilities are, here's what we need you to do, here's the qualifications we're looking for. And what's really funny about that is that product is very iterative, but somehow we just write a job description, and then it's bait, it's done, it's posted, and nobody thinks about it again until the person's hired and then they take it down.\n\nJason Shah (01:02:41):\nI think taking a product mindset where I meet people all the time now where I don't really know exactly what role they're necessarily going to fill, I'm not really sure about exactly their seniority, maybe they don't have a lot of experience, but maybe they would just totally be a rockstar on our product team. And looking at a product that we can mold flexibly and think of the same way if at Airbnb, if we were going to build Airbnb Plus, if we just kind of came back to the Amazon working backwards and just wrote a document and it was over, that's one thing, but we didn't do that, right? We went and actually built rooms and homes that were supposed to be Airbnb Plus, and then we iterate on it and we changed the pillows and we changed the entrance and we changed the scent that you feel when you walk in. We coach host and learned about that.\n\nJason Shah (01:03:21):\nSo, I think a product mindset on hiring and iterating on it based on the candidates you're meeting, the needs of the business. So this kind of marketing, sales, product combination has been what I've found to be really effective at getting people excited, understanding who they are and what they need, and then crafting a role that actually makes the person successful, rather than just checks a box in your recruiting software as some new headcount that was hired.\n\nLenny (01:03:45):\nOne last question before we get to our lightning round. For PMs that are listening to this maybe early in their career, what skill have you found to be most important in helping you and helping PMs in general advance in their career?\n\nJason Shah (01:03:59):\nYeah, this is a really important question, like the others, but I think that understanding and defining what problem matters is the most important skill that I think I've taken away, and it applies to so many things. It can apply to a specific product we're building. It can apply to what a company's mission is. I think I've found it really effective because it affects pretty much everything. It affects what we're going to build. It affects is the team motivated by what we're doing. So, specifically for example, at a place like Alchemy where, yeah, we're a developer platform, but should we build an SDK so there's abstraction that is easier for developers to use? Should we build an NFT API because we think that's a really important stack to move into and an important use case to support?\n\nJason Shah (01:04:45):\nWell, the question is what problem are we solving? It's not this versus that just in a vacuum. It's is the problem developer experienced and we want to make things easier to develop. Is the problem that an NFT marketplace, a whole suite of them are trying to grow and need more support from us, and not understanding these problems clearly? And it goes back to my first company. It was an education company, and the problem was that low-income students didn't have access to the same resources to get into college as other students, and that guided everything. That guided the pricing model which was basically free for a long time, and then we monetize on sponsorships from colleges, right? The problem matter, whereas the problem solve was there's not a... A different problem was there's just no good college readiness program. Fine, then you focus manically on the pedagogy and the curriculum and so on and so forth, rather than say the business model and an initial product that you think can work.\n\nJason Shah (01:05:34):\nSo, that's what I've found to be the most useful, and I can give her other examples if it's helpful, but understanding what problem we're actually trying to solve and really getting crystal clear about it, I think has been incredibly useful to me and energizing as well.\n\nLenny (01:05:48):\nIt's such a good reminder, even though it's such a cliche of product managers being, \"Well, what problem are we trying to solve here?\" People hate that, but Michael Paul, and I mentioned this on a different podcast too, he makes this point that when you do drugs sometimes, you have these epiphanies that you come out and you're like, \"Love is all you need, man.\" It's like, okay, yep. But it feels so right. You really feel it. The reason that it's such a cliche is because people have found it to be so true for so long that it's annoying now, but it also tells you how true it is. And so, I think it's a really good reminder of yes, it's annoying to ask that question, and people make fun of PMs for that, but that's because it's so damn important.\n\nJason Shah (01:06:28):\nJust a brief kind of additional, what you share there, I mean, I completely agree. I think it's very true in life, right? It's like, well, what matters? And it's like, well, your health, your family, your sense of purpose. It's like nobody's unfamiliar with the answer, but like most things, it's about the application of it and about the nuance of it, and I think that's what product is ultimately sort of all about too.\n\nLenny (01:06:48):\nAwesome. Are you ready for our lightning round where I'm just going to ask you five quick questions, tell me what comes to mind and we'll have some fun. Does that sound good?\n\nJason Shah (01:06:58):\nThat sounds great. Ready.\n\nLenny (01:06:59):\nOkay, cool. I think I'm going to start adding music to these things. I got to figure that out. For now, no music. Okay. What book do you recommend most to other PMs?\n\nJason Shah (01:07:07):\nThe Hard Thing About Hard things.\n\nLenny (01:07:10):\nCan you add why?\n\nJason Shah (01:07:11):\nI think it teaches product managers to chew glass and care about outcomes the way that a CEO has to, and I think that's a really useful mindset to have.\n\nLenny (01:07:21):\nMan, this chew glass metaphor, I don't like the sound of that.\n\nJason Shah (01:07:24):\nI saw you cringe. I was a little worried about that.\n\nLenny (01:07:27):\nOh my god. What a great job we have here, chewing glass. Okay. Other than Alchemy, what's a company you recommend most to PMs to go look for new gigs if they're looking around?\n\nJason Shah (01:07:37):\nI would suggest Polygon, Salon, or MoonPay. I know it's three, but I wanted to give some breath in the Web3 space that might be exciting to people.\n\nLenny (01:07:45):\nGreat, great choices. What's a favorite TV show or movie that you've recently watched?\n\nJason Shah (01:07:48):\nThe Ken Burns Vietnam War series. I'm really into documentaries and history, and it's a really kind of compelling version of history that I've never seen before.\n\nLenny (01:07:58):\nAwesome. Love that. Okay. Favorite interview question that you like to ask.\n\nJason Shah (01:08:02):\nWhat is a risk you regret not taking, why, and what did you learn about yourself?\n\nLenny (01:08:08):\nWhat do you look for in an answer there?\n\nJason Shah (01:08:10):\nI think the biggest thing I look for is a growth mindset, to be able to reflect on an experience like that and be vocally self-critical without unproductively being hard on one's self, and I think that the dimension of asking about risk gets at their psychology and how do they think about not only their career, but if they were to work with me, how would they approach problem solving and taking bets on the business.\n\nLenny (01:08:33):\nAwesome. Okay, final question. What's your least favorite vegetable?\n\nJason Shah (01:08:36):\nBroccoli. I just removed some from a pizza last night that I really didn't want to eat.\n\nLenny (01:08:41):\nWow. Oh wow, okay. Even like steamed, cook, all the things?\n\nJason Shah (01:08:45):\nThere are no circumstances under which I'm excited about broccoli.\n\nLenny (01:08:49):\nOh man, you got to eat those veggies.\n\nJason Shah (01:08:51):\nI know. I'm working on it.\n\nLenny (01:08:52):\nOkay, Jason, this was amazing. Lived up to what I was hoping our second episode would be. Definitely better than our first which we'll leave on the cutting room floor. Two last questions. Where can people find you online? I assume Alchemy's hiring, so maybe pointing people there. And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJason Shah (01:09:08):\nYeah, definitely. So, if you're interested in Alchemy and Web3, go to alchemy.com and click through to our jobs page from there. I'm online @0xShah. That is my crypto pseudonymous handle and happy to engage with folks there. And in terms of being helpful to me, I would love any feedback on anything that came up. I would love any products that people are working on. I also invest, and we also partner with a lot of products and teams at Alchemy, and I would love to meet anybody that's listening on the podcast too because I know Lenny's all about community and has kind of given so much back over the years that I would love to meet folks that are out there and get a chance to spend time talking about the products that you're all building.\n\nLenny (01:09:46):\nAwesome. Thanks, Jason.\n\nJason Shah (01:09:48):\nThanks, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:09:50):\nThank you so much for listening.

We all love to talk about the art of the possible, everything we're going to enable in the future, but that's often really a sale that's going to resonate with another founder. For everybody else, particularly enterprises. You're avoiding the risk of not making your revenue target next quarter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):\nI've heard a lot about how you think about go-to-market as a product.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:00:55):\nWe buy a lot of things because of how we feel about them. The experience that you have of being sold to will increasingly actually differentiate a company and drive buying decisions if products are only different at the merchant. And so then you really want to create a customer buying journey that feels like very unique experiences.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:17):\nSomething I've heard from so many people you've worked with is that your superpower is building a sales org that doesn't feel like a sales org to engineers.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:01:23):\nThe litmus test I have always given my sales team is if you are an account executive in my org and I put you in front of 10 engineers at our company, it should take them 10 minutes to figure out you aren't a product manager.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:38):\nToday my guest is Jeanne Grosser. Jeanne was chief product officer at Stripe where she built their very early sales team from the ground up. She's currently COO at Versel where she oversees marketing, sales, customer success, revenue ops and field engineering. Jeanne has built world-class go-to-market teams at multiple unicorns and has advised dozens of companies on doing the same. In our conversation, we go deep on what a world-class go-to-market team looks like, including what the heck is go-to-market, the rise of the go-to-market engineer and how this role is already enabling her team to operate 10 times faster. A bunch of very specific tactics to level up your go-to-market skills, a primer on segmentation, how to think about your go-to-market process like a product, her favorite go-to-market tools, her hot takes on PLG and sales comp and sales hiring, and so much more. If you are looking to get smart on the latest and greatest in go-to-market thinking, this episode is for you.\n\n(00:02:34):\nA huge thank you to Claire Hughes-Johnson, Kate Jensen and James Ditt for suggesting topics for this conversation and Kelly Schafer for the connection. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It helps tremendously.

Head on over to Lenny's newsletter.com and click product pass. With that, I bring you Jeanne Grosser after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:03:14):\nThis episode is brought to you by Datadog, now home to Epo, the leading experimentation and feature flagging platform. Product managers at the world's best companies use Datadog, the same platform their engineers rely on every day to connect product insights to product issues like bugs, UX, friction and business impact.\n\n(00:03:32):\nIt starts with product analytics where PMs can watch replays, review funnels, dive into retention, and explore their growth metrics. Where other tools stop, Datadog goes even further. It helps you actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop-offs and bugs and UX friction. Once you know where to focus experiments, prove what works. I saw this first hand when I was at Airbnb where our experimentation platform was critical for analyzing what worked and where things went wrong and the same team that built experimentation at Airbnb built Epo. Datadog then lets you go beyond the numbers with session replay. Watch exactly how users interact with Heatmaps and Scrollmaps to truly understand their behavior. And all of this is powered by feature flags, that are tied to real-time data so that you can roll out safely, target precisely and learn continuously. Datadog is more than engineering metrics. It's where great product teams learn faster.\n\n(00:04:25):\nFix smarter and ship with confidence. Request a demo at datadoghq.com slash Lenny. That's datadog hq.com/Lenny. This episode is brought to you by Lovable. Not only are they the fastest growing company in history, I use it regularly and I could not recommend it more highly. If you've ever had an idea for an app but didn't know where to start, Lovable is for you. Lovable lets you build working apps and websites by simply chatting with AI. Then you can customize it at automations and deploy it to live domain. It's perfect for marketers spitting up tools, product managers, prototyping new ideas, and founders launching their next business. Unlike NoCo Tools, Lovable isn't about static pages. It builds full apps with real functionality and it's fast. What used to take weeks, months or years, you can now do over a weekend. So if you've been sitting on an idea, now is the time to bring it to life. Get started for free at Lovable.dev. That's Lovable.dev.\n\n(00:05:29):\nJean, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:05:32):\nThanks for having me. Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:34):\nWhat I wanted to get out of this conversation by the end of this to basically have this conversation be the thing that we send people when they're like, \"I want to get better go to market. I'm trying to figure out what to do and get to market.\" We send them this versus having to hire someone for a lot of money and usually they can't find amazing people, because they're all snatched up. So let me start with just the basics. When people hear at the term go to market, what does that mean? What does that encompass?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:05:57):\nI think there are two answers to this. Often what people think of is sort of the tip of the spear of what drives revenue, which is marketing and sales. For me, I think of it as any function that is going to touch a customer or make a dollar, and actually my remit at Vercel is that, so that includes marketing, sales, all of your technical sales roles like sales engineers or post-sales platform architects is what we call them at Vercel. It's customer success, it's support, it's partnerships. And the reason I say that is my experience throughout my career has been that those functions often have this Venn diagram strategy where marketing's pursuing one thing, it overlaps with what sales is pursuing, but not perfectly, which also overlaps with what support is pursuing but not perfectly. Examples of this would be slightly differing segmentation frameworks, et cetera.\n\n(00:06:57):\nAnd so one of the things I think you're going to want to see more in this particular moment is that that become a really integrated lifecycle. In particular, I think we're going to see a lot of the functions of go-to-market get redefined, so we've gone through a period of hyper-specialization in go-to-market depending on how you count them. There are, I think somebody quoted 17 different roles within go-to-market these days and I hypothesize that a lot of those are going to start to collapse. And so if you think of go-to-market more holistically, I think you can kind of go back to what are the jobs to be done from making a customer prospect aware of your product all the way through to high LTV, five years on the platform, fully wall-to-wall, and you're going to want to map that out and orchestrate it the way you would think about that within your own product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:54):\nAwesome. We're going to go through that whole cycle of go-to-market, but so is it safe to say just for most companies that are especially starting out when they say go-to-market, that mostly is sales and then there's marketing as maybe a smaller fraction of that and then as you become more advanced and grow, customer success plays into it, tech sales, things like that?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:08:12):\nYeah, that's probably where most start is getting sales or frankly just because a lot of companies also start PLG, you might actually start with marketing and then you're layering in sales when it's time to do the sales assistant and ultimately sales led portions. So I think it can, depending on your product and your initial target market, it can either mean marketing or sales or a combination of those two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:33):\nAwesome. So essentially it's like the term go-to-market tells you what we're talking about. How do you take your product to market, get people aware of it, using it, sticking with it?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:08:42):\nYep, absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:44):\nWhat has most changed in the world of go-to-market over the last few years? You've done this for a long time at Google, at Stripe, you built it for sales team, now you're doing that at Vercel. What's changed most in the skill and art of go-to-market?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:08:55):\nThere are a number of things. So when consumption-based business models started, I think you saw go-to-market shift into being meaningfully more consultative because often that first land was the very beginning of the journey and represented a very small percent of what you were ultimately going to do with that customer. And so you had to go from being transactional to a lot more. You had to more deeply understand what that customer was trying to do so you could align that ultimately to your product. I think that has played out that much more with an AI because right now everyone knows they need to change, but they don't necessarily know exactly what they need to change to, whether that's their customer-facing product or their internal productivity and workflows. And so I think you're seeing a lot more of go-to-market orgs leaning into the art of the possible best practices, helping you actually think things through as if they were a consultant.\n\n(00:09:52):\nAnd so one of the things you see more of right now is forward-deployed engineering, which on some level is kind of a rebrand of professional services but kind of not. And a big part of that is, hey, how do I actually get into your environment, ride alongside you better understand what you're trying to do and then help you actually bring the technology to life and learn a lot along the way.\n\n(00:10:18):\nOften you're not only making that customer successful, but you're then taking all of that back to your product and engineering organization to figure out, okay, what was generalizable that we ought to build into our offering versus what is something that ultimately is going to be more of a professional service in the fullness of time. So I think that has been a biggie, is actually just really getting embedded with your customer. And then unsurprisingly, I think bringing AI to bear on the sales process is another big one. And so you've seen the rise in probably the last 18 to 24 months of the go-to-market engineer, which different folks define slightly differently, but it's kind of bringing one technical prowess to bear on go-to-market in general so you can have a lot better tooling, data use, et cetera. And then two, increasingly bringing AI to bear as well to re-architect your workflows and also make it so that it's easier to have a personalized experience with customers but do so at scale.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:23):\nAmazing. Okay, let's follow the thread on this go-to-market engineer, so what was it like before and what are these engineers doing at companies?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:11:33):\nSo I think maybe an interesting story to tell. When I was at Stripe, we went to launch an outbound SDR function. So outbound prospecting and Stripe always ran lean. The company at that time had an operating principle which was efficiency is leverage. And so if you looked at the sales organization I was running, most companies out there probably would've had 30 SDRs and I was going to get four. So there's no way I was going to do the typical SDR approach and be successful. And so we thought to ourselves, okay, what can we do? We'll be super data-driven. And so we went and we started building project Rosland. Rosland is the scientist who originally mapped A-DNA. And what this was was effectively a company universe. So you can think of this as a massive database. Every row was a different company on the planet and every column was an attribute about that company that would help you sell to them in a more targeted fashion.\n\n(00:12:39):\nSo at Stripe an example would be knowing that their business model was a marketplace was super helpful, because that would mean you wanted to sell Stripe Connect versus vanilla payments. And so the goal was basically, hey, can we create a mad Libs where I will come up with sort of a predefined email template, but 80% of it will be fill in the blank based on the different attributes of that customer. So if they're this industry or this business model, then pull this customer, reference this value prop, send it to this persona, not that. And we were trying to do this in 2017 and it was very hard and didn't actually totally work our ability to the false positive rate and we worked deeply with DSI and it just never really got there. And now that we're literally redoing here at Vercel as we speak and it actually works and you can bring AI to bear on it.\n\n(00:13:41):\nAnd so what's different is we now, I have a data scientist just like I did back in 2017, but I have a go-to-market engineer whereas before I just had someone in systems that was helping me configure outreach or sales off and my go-to-market engineer is helping me build an agent where we're coming up with, okay, well what's the human workflow that you would've done? And then how do you encode that using Vercel workflows as an example in actual code that's both deterministic and less so where an agent's going out and trying to replicate what a human might've done to produce that, fill in the blank, matlit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:21):\nI love the ambition of that project. What is this, like eight years ago?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:14:25):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:26):\nI love the big thinking there. We're going to map the entire universe of companies and then here's how we sell to them. And then just I'm trying to picture doing that without AI. It's like crazy to imagine trying that without AI and that's so much simpler to even imagine.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:14:38):\nWell the thing that's amazing about that, just to geek out on a second, so I was working on that with a bunch of folks at Stripe on my team, obviously at a gentleman named Ben Salzman who went on to go to ZoomInfo and then actually recently just founded a go-to-market startup that is basically sort of productizing that concept of a company universe and then layering AI on it on top of it. And ultimately his view is actually AI will get to the point that you won't have to do outbound prospecting because it will just sort of company and product match. So it's fun to sort of see back in 2017 some of the folks doing that now work at OpenAI, they work at Anthropic, they also are doing GTM Eng. You've got him starting a totally AI native GTM company and then here I'm at Vercel trying to do the same.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:29):\nOkay, so what's cool is this is an emerging role, an emerging skill that I don't think a lot of people have recognized as something that is happening. So one example I'm hearing of what this role does is they automate outbound emails essentially and outbound outreach. They figure out, they write workflows and agents that figure out here's the company to go after, here's how we message them. Does that end up being kind of like an email that's custom designed and written for this prospect?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:15:54):\nThat's one version. So it's broader than that really. Basically the full remit of GTM Eng will be to go through each of the different functions within go to market and break down all the different workflows that they do and then turn those into agents where AI is better placed than the human to do that task. So right now we started with actually inbound and are now moving to outbound because that workflow is most legible. And by legible I mean you can basically write it down. It's relatively replicable, mostly deterministic. So it's more likely that AI will do it well and we actually built the agent and then we keep a human in the loop. But from there we're starting to look at outbound and with an outbound we're starting more at the lower end of the market, where you tend to have slightly less customization because there's a single decision maker at the company.\n\n(00:16:56):\nBut I think it'll take a while before we're able to really do that in a very large enterprise. There we might use an agent for research but maybe not all the way to actually send a message and that's just within the prospecting function. So other places that we're looking at this would be for install-based sales. So again there it's a little bit more deterministic because you've got awesome internal data on what a customer is and isn't using, what's the next best action? What's the thing they should get most value from? So that's where we're starting to map, hey, what does that ideal workflow look like? But basically you want to get to a state where as long as I've been in sales, they release these annual reports that help us all benchmark ourselves relative to one another. And one of the stats is what percent of time do your sellers actually spend in front of customers?\n\n(00:17:44):\nAnd for the 20 years I've been in sales, it's always been somewhere around 30% to 40%. So the minority of time is actually talking to other humans and I think we're getting to a point where with layering in agents, ideally we finally get salespeople to a point where they're actually spending 70% of their time interacting with humans and we can get the research, the follow-up, the things that are a little bit more rote and don't use the entirety of your human capacity done by an agent and then sort of unleash you to go deeper with your customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:17):\nI love that this is such a great example of where AI is contributing in a very meaningful high ROI way, taking on all this work that people... like, you have to hire say 50 SDRs as you described to do and now you could do with a lot more. So it's a really cool example of leverage that AI gives you. One thing that I know a lot of people think about when they hear this is, okay, I'm going to get more of these really bad emails trying to pitch me on stuff and just like this isn't going to work. I can tell this is AI. What have you learned about how to do this where people actually receive emails that actually convert and do well?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:18:51):\nOur processes all always have human in the loop. And so basically where we'll start is we take a go to market engineer and we have them shadow the highest performing individual in that function. And so you can go and you shadow an SDR and you can see, oh wow, they've got seven tabs open. They're looking up the person on LinkedIn, they're reading about the company, they're doing chatGPT on this, they're looking in this database to get these sets of attributes. And so that's how you sort of inform the initial workflow. And then what we do is we let the agent make a call. So in the specific example with inbound, you have to determine whether or not you think the lead is likely to be qualified and then you have to determine what to say to it. And so we'll let the agent make those two calls.\n\n(00:19:44):\nIt ultimately then does some deep research, pulls in a bunch of information from our databases and crafts a response, but we have a human review all of those and actually hit send. Now for us, we had 10 SDRs doing this inbound workflow and now we just have one that is effectively QA-ing the agent. The other nine we deployed on outbound, so we got to move them up the value chain. At some point I think we'll get to a place where we feel like, \"Hey, the human reviewer is saying yes enough of the time that we feel confident that these will be on brand targeted, et cetera,\" but right now we're still trying to train the agent and it incorporates feedback on what we choose to reject, edit, et cetera.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:31):\nAnd you shared that it's already having a lot of impact. Like you said, you had 10 SDRs and now one can do the job of 10.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:20:39):\nSo before we did that move, I mean the other thing that's just incredible about this is the person who built the lead agent was a single GTM engineer. He spent maybe 25-30% of his time on this. It was six weeks before we felt confident going from 10 to one. So it wasn't like this was a multi-quarter process, it actually moved super quickly and then again now we just sort of keep that agent manager working with the agent to get it to a point where we say, \"Hey, we're ready to roll.\" Actually throughout the process we also tracked all of the KPIs that you typically would hold an SDR accountable to. We were looking at our lead to opportunity conversion rate, we're looking at the number of touches it takes the time to convert, and basically what we were able to do is hold that lead to opportunity conversion rate flat. So the agent is as good as our humans were, but it's actually condensed the number of touches it takes to convert because it's so much quicker at responding relative to leads inevitably sitting in the queue or coming in at nighttime and no one can get to it, that type of deal. So that's sort of when we knew it was ready to pull nine people off and shift them into outbound.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:56):\nThat's incredible. Okay, that's interesting. So you shift them to outbound. What I love about this is this SDR that is now doing this is, as you said, doing the things they enjoy more, they're talking to customers more, they're not doing all this kind of top of funnel rote work. I don't want to get into whole jobs AI discussion, but there's always been this talk about AI SDRs basically replacing SDRs. It feels like that's one thing where everyone's like this is a hundred percent going to be AI in the future. What I'm hearing here is it gives one Aster a lot more leverage and obviously you still need people running the show. Thoughts there? Just like do you think AI will replace all this at some point? And then I don't know, you don't need salespeople?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:22:32):\nI think on prospecting it can replace a fair amount because the average SDR wasn't doing overly sophisticated research in the first place. So where I, think the last part to go as I mentioned will be in deep enterprise prospecting where you can be at multiple layers in an org chart, you've got to pick between business lines, you've got to triangulate those. But I do think for the things that are more repetitive that often don't take that much time to learn and get ramped, AI will be good at that. And in my view, no one graduated from college and was like, \"Yes, I just went to college for four years to become an SDR.\" It was more, \"Okay, that's where you are forced to start.\" But I think the average SDR could have gone straight into outbound or straight into an SMB closing role. And so basically what we're just doing is shifting folks into something that uses more of their full capacity right out of the gates rather than sort of the forcing function of working your way up the totem pole.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:48):\nAwesome. Since a lot of people listening to this aren't salespeople don't have a lot of background in sales, we've used this term SDR, there's also the term AE. Can you just help people understand what is an SDR, what do they do, what's an AE, and then what's the role above?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:24:01):\nSure. So SDR is typically in charge of generating pipeline. They're meant to talk to prospective customers and get them to a point where it is worth investing time to run them through a sales process. You typically have two types of an SDR, have an inbound one. So this is where people come to your website, they fill out contact sales, they'll be the first call to make sure that it's actually worth a more expensive account executive to go and run a sales process or you then have outbound. So this is where when you want to grow faster than your inbound demand, they will go out and at this point you probably have a point of view on where you think you have product market fit. And so they will target that part of the market and try to drum up interest from folks who weren't otherwise raising their hand saying, I'd like to talk to you.\n\n(00:24:54):\nSo that's sales development basically. Pipeline generation account executives are closers. So it's their job to take somebody from, \"Okay, hey, I'm interested in learning about your solution, I have a legitimate problem. I potentially could make a decision,\" to, \"I now believe that your product is the best in the market for me and I'm willing to pay for it.\" And then account executives, depending on the segments that your company sells into E.G. small business, mid-market enterprise, et cetera, they may work their way up the food chain from selling to a smaller company like an SMB or a startup. Those tend to be a little bit more of a transactional sale. You often have a single decision maker to then going into a mid-market or a commercial role where now maybe you have an economic buyer like somebody in finance and a technical buyer like somebody in engineering to getting into enterprise where you have procurement and you have committees and 10 people have to weigh in and you've got to help them figure out how to de-risk the fact that they're probably migrating from something so much more complicated coordination effort to sell.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:05):\nThat was extremely helpful. So SDR, pipeline generation, i.e., closer. Such a simple way of thinking about it. Okay, this is great. Going back to the GDM engineer, a few questions for people that may want to try this at their company, what scale do you think it makes sense to start hiring for this role? Having someone automate in the go-to-market process?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:26:25):\nWhat's interesting about this is it will force companies to be more rigorous about their sales process early. So often startups when they go from founder led sales to say, I'm going to have my first sales person, whether that's an actual account executive who has sales experience or your general athlete, wicked smart, who's going to go figure it out. Often founders will just say, \"Okay, sales is showing up and talking to people. Isn't that what I just did for the last couple of years?\" But actually sales is more than that. It's a skill just like writing code as a skill or building a financial model as a skill, it's about discovery. So asking all the right questions that help you identify challenges in pain, willingness to pay, et cetera, and then going through a process to handle those objections and showcase where are you at enough value such that somebody ultimately wants to hand over some money.\n\n(00:27:24):\nSo often startups will get, particularly ones with strong product market fit to pretty significant scale without really having a replicable process. And you can't really apply go to market engineering unless you actually have a point of view on what best practice should look like. And so I think basically this is going to force folks to have more of a playbook out of the gates, what's working, what's not? Can I document it? Do I have content for the different parts of the sales process? And then once you do that, which maybe 10 people is a good size and scale for that, ostensibly a GTM engineer can come in and turn that into an agent. You could also argue that if you're a founder who wants to bring in a general athlete profile and that person is technically minded, that you could have a hybrid AE GTM engineer who figures out what their best practice is and then tries to turn that into an agent that's riding alongside them and making them more effective as well.\n\n(00:28:26):\nSo I don't know that I have a point of view yet on what's the optimal size and scale, but I forever have given founders the advice that you often want to bring in revenue operations, which is basically the analytical arm of sales earlier than you think because having data, having process is actually what gives you insights as a founder into what is and isn't working. And so I would argue just like it's a good idea to have that sooner than later, increasingly it'll probably be a good idea to have GTM engine and be looking to bring agents to bear on your process at the outset.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:05):\nWhile we're on this topic, just a quick tangent, the advice for hiring your first salesperson that I usually hear is wait until you're around a million in ARR. When you have a repeatable process, you can teach someone anything there. Does that seem right? What would you recommend?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:29:18):\nYeah, I think that seems about right. I do think as a founder you want to stay deeply connected to customers and get it to a scale and get it to a point where you use the word, there's some repeatability there. I think that's one of the things that not all founders get right is founders are incredible salespeople. They convinced a VC angel investors to fork over a bunch of money, so clearly they're going to inspire people to buy. But if you're getting to a million in ARR and the set of customers you have look nothing like one another, you still have very much like an evangelist sale, very much founder led sale versus if you can say, \"Hey, I now have an ICP here, or ideal customer profile, e.g something you can write down. We are good. Our product fits with startups with less than a hundred employees who are typically building SaaS applications,\" something like that.\n\n(00:30:14):\nThen you're probably ready to hand over the reins. And then what founders have to remember is to actually hand over the reins. So you've got to enable the person who comes in, what is it that you're doing effectively, what's your content, what are the discovery questions you are asking? How are you handling objections so you can transition that knowledge but also don't handle them over entirely. You want to stay connected to the customer because you still have a fair amount of R&D to do to figure out where is the product next going to resonate, where are you getting stock as you scale, etc.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:52):\nTo close the loop on the go-to-market engineer, what's the profile of the ideal go-to-market engineer, may be your first.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:30:57):\nWhat we have found works really well is somebody who does have go-to-market experience. So at Vercel, our first three go-to-market engineers we're actually sales engineers. So Vercel hires very technical sales engineers, all of them were front end developers before they decided they wanted to get into sales. And so we just said, \"Hey, three of you, congrats.\" You're now founding members of our GTM Eng team. And the thing that works well there is you do understand aspects of what is good GTM, what does a process look like? It's been really interesting actually. So the gentleman who runs GTM Eng for me, we were going through this lead agent and QA-ing it. And so I'm going and I'm looking at some of the responses that we've ultimately had the lead agent send and realized, \"Oh, I wouldn't have sent that and that's because I have 20 years of sales experience and we modeled the lead agent off our best person, but our best person who has two years of sales experience.\" So it actually is important to understand the art and the science of sales and how you bring best practice to bear. Either you've done it and so you know some best practice or you're going to geek out on sales, read a bunch of books, learn a thing or two, and try to incorporate some of those into your agent development.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:28):\nThat is really interesting. So come from the sales side, not from the engineering side. And I imagine this is such a cool opportunity for salespeople to do something completely different and move closer to engineering.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:32:38):\nYeah, I mean we're having a lot of fun with it. At Vercel in particular, we basically get to be customer zero. So everything that we're building with agents, we're building on Vercel's AI cloud. So these agents now have multiple steps that they go through. So we're using Vercel's workflow SDK and workflow offering. We use the AI gateway to call the different models that we use to do deep research or other enrichment that we do. So for us it's great because we basically sort of bang on everything the engineering team is building and get to go be a discerning customer before we actually get it out the door to real customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:22):\nWhat a fun time to be alive. I could tell the fun that you guys are having, just from the way you describe it.\n\n(00:33:29):\nStripe handles the massive scale and complexity of many of the world's fastest growing enterprises, including 78% of the Forbes AI 50 and more than half of the Fortune 100 enterprises like Atlassian, Figma and Urban Outfitters use Stripe to create fully branded and customized checkout pages with access to more than 125 global payment methods. There's a reason I've had more leaders from Stripe on this podcast than any other company. They know how to build great products that scale and that people love. And Stripe is a lot more than payments. They've also got a category leading billing solution and a highly optimized checkout experience built specifically to increase your checkout conversion. Join the ranks of industry leaders like Salesforce, OpenAI and Pepsi that are using Stripe to grow faster and to grow the world's GDP, learn how Stripe can help your business grow at Stripe.com. Zooming out a little bit in terms of you mentioned tools and tools that you use. I'm curious just what are kind of the state of the art tools within the go-to-market stack that you love that you'd recommend?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:34:33):\nWell, so I'm going to have an interesting answer to this, so I'll give you one. And it's not state-of-the-art per se, although I don't mean that disparagingly, it's just that it's been around for a while now and a lot of folks use it, but I think Gong has gotten just meaningfully more interesting in the last year. And then second half of my question I will get into, I think the calculus on build versus buy is changing. So all right, Gong. Gong is incredible because you can run agents against it now. So we take all of our Gong transcripts and we dump them into an agent called the deal-bott, and that deal-bott then can do a bunch of things. So the first thing we had it do was lost opportunity review. So we had just finished Q2, we had a list of our top losses for the quarter sorted by deal size, and we ran it against that and it was incredibly interesting.\n\n(00:35:39):\nSo the biggest loss that quarter according to the account executive was lost on price. And when you ran the agent over every Slack interaction, every email, every GONG call, it said actually you lost because you never really got in touch with an economic buyer. And when you talked to somebody about ROI and total cost of ownership, it was clear from their reaction that they didn't really buy your mass. And so really the reason we lost was an inability to demonstrate value, which upon reflection I've got work to do to build out how we quantify the value of Vercel, which actually is very easily quantifiable. It's one of the things I love about selling this product, but we got to codify that for the go-to-market team. So that was incredibly interesting and now we run it against all of our lost opportunities and actually do a much better job of categorizing why it was we really, really lost.\n\n(00:36:38):\nAnd then either feeding that back into the engineering team or back into marketing sales leadership on, hey, where are we falling short in the sales process? And so that was awesome, but then we're like, well, it's not very fun to lose, so why don't we pull that forward? And so we went from lost bot to deal-bott and now the deal-bott is running in real time and we basically feed insights into Slack. Vercel is incredibly heavy users of Slack, so we have a channel for every single customer, either opportunity or existing one. And so now we're feeding insights into that Slack channel which is, \"Hey, you're this far into the sales process and you haven't talked to an economic buyer, you should think about that.\" Or, \"Hey, you just got off that call with an economic buyer, didn't sound like it went that well. Here's some things to consider and how you might follow-up.\"\n\n(00:37:34):\nAnd last thing before I pause, the other thing that's really interesting and how we're using this too is we are in this moment where I have never seen an iteration velocity exists now in my career. My 20 plus year career has all been in tech. And so for go-to-market teams, that's really hard. If you are launching something every other day, the ability to be enabled on that is actually quite challenging. And so this bot agent is now also letting us, where we're starting to go with it is we'll release something, we'll do our best to enable the team, then we'll go run the agent across calls, interactions, and we'll diagnose where we did a bad job of objection handling, where we're getting stuck. And then at the end of the week we can have a huddle and say, okay, what are all the places that our agent would suggest we aren't selling effectively?\n\n(00:38:34):\nAnd then almost like an engineering team, we'll now run sprints, which is like those are just bugs. They're bugs in your go-to-market process, so you should not have them. And by the next week we're going to add content to our objection handling to guide. We're going to add content to a discovery guide, we're going to figure out something we need to change about our demo, so on and so forth. So that's early. That's a little bit of a preview, but that's where we're talking about taking things right now within our go-to-market orgs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:00):\nJeanne, you're blowing my mind in so many ways, it just sounds so fun and just you guys are going to win is what I'm feeling when I hear all this. Incredible. What I love about this is this AI tool, this agent you built sees things that humans were not seeing. The fact that you were surprised of just like this is a completely different conclusion is such a big deal. This is the whole promise of ai, it's going to do things we aren't even thinking about or capable of.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:39:26):\nIt is. We had a really interesting, one of the things we're doing at Vercel, we have an AI cloud, so people use that to put AI-native features into their customer-facing applications, but they're also using it to build internal applications to improve productivity or outcomes. And we are talking to a very large airline and that airline obviously gets tons and tons of support queries. So of course they would want to go apply AI to hey, how can we have AI answer these so that our cost to support goes down, sort of the obvious thing. But the more interesting conversation was actually with one of the C-level executives who said, we also actually transcribe every single one of those support calls. And so what I really want to know is why are they calling and how do I make it so that fewer people call the next week? And so again, this is now with AI, you can rapidly go through all of that content and actually be able to much more quickly than having a human in your CRM sort of pick some status why it was that folks were calling the airline this week and what if anything you can do to make it less the case next week.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:39):\nI imagine many people hearing this are like, \"I need one of these deal-botts and lost bots.\" These are all internal products that you all built?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:40:46):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:47):\nIs there anything that you've learned about making them this good? Any tips you can share of here's how to make a really good bot for sales?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:40:54):\nYes, so actually that's the second half of my answer that I forgot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:00):\nThat's perfect.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:41:00):\nWhich is sort of like bill versus buy calculus. So I think one of our learnings is that it's not that hard to build these agents and they aren't that expensive either. So I mentioned the lead agent that was a six-week process with one human, a third of his time, that deal-bott, the lost bot version was two days basically we riffed on it, he had it 40 hours later. Now we're continuing to refine it for the other things I mentioned. And what's also interesting about them is they for better or for worse for Vercel, but that lead agent which runs full stack on Vercel, will cost us about a thousand dollars to run for the entire year. If you remember I told you we had 10 people in the SDR function, so I'm paying well over a million dollars for that from a salary perspective.\n\n(00:41:57):\nI got that down to one. And then behind that I have a lead agent that costs a thousand bucks. So that's like a 90%-plus reduction in total cost there. And there's lots of software for agents out there right now. And I think one of the things we're learning is because this whole space is so nascent, often your own esoteric context, your content, your workflow is really key to unlocking the power of the agent. And so I think there's real value in experimenting with your own internal agent development. We may ultimately end up on better integrated agent platforms in the fullness of time, or we may find that the CIO increasingly goes from a procurer of software to a builder of software and you'll have an AI internal platform with a thousand agents running across your org. I'm not really sure yet. But I certainly think there's value in trying it yourself because you may find that it's meaningfully easier than you think and you get returns pretty quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:10):\nSo what I'm hearing here is that you're finding that there are not tools out there to plug and play. The alpha is essentially in building your own stuff.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:43:18):\nI think that's partially true, and I think because you also have all these tools proliferating right now, you get into the perennial problem where you wind up with 20 of them to do the 20 jobs to be done basically, rather than an integrated platform that's doing all of them. I'm hearing this a lot actually when I'm talking to customers right now where their biggest issue in deploying AI is actually just getting through procurement and it's because got an AI mandate, you kind of have a blank check. I recently heard the term of instead of ARR, it's ERR, which is experimental run rate revenue, which is to say everyone's out there sort of, Hey, we're going to give this thing a go for a year and then TBD on whether or not we keep it. But basically you're having to procure 20 different things. Most things are getting off the ground and so they're solving something relatively narrow and that'll change in the fullness of time. But I do think there's an opportunity to figure out, hey, where do I likely have a more specific workflow internally. For that it might be worth building your own agent and then maybe for the things that are a little bit more generalizable, you go get something off the shelf.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:34):\nAre there any platforms or tools that you want to shout out that allow you to build these agents so quickly? I know they sit on Versel, so shout out Vercel. But just anything that you point people to you to... These SDR, these GTM engineers, they're former salespeople. Are they learning to code? Are they byte coding these agents? How does that work?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:44:52):\nSo our sales engineers all have CS degrees. So they were engineers in a sales capacity, so they're writing code and actually these agents, they're building directly on Versel. So you get the AI gateway that lets you call different models. You have a sandbox if you're running untrusted code, you've got workflows that let you build the process. You've got fluid compute, which lets you really efficiently use compute when you only need it. So we're just sort of building it from the ground up here. Again, it's not that hard. Now you do need to write code for that. Certainly there are a lot of vibe coding tools out there that also give you more workflow builders that are somewhere between fully WYSIWYG, almost like drag and drop and a little bit more code forward. So you've got a bunch out there along those lines. But I do think we've sort of found one of the reasons actually the GTM Eng team at Versel can build these agents so easily is because the Versel platform is making it that easy to use our framework to find infrastructure and get that agent onto into production very rapidly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:11):\nWhat a neat, unfair advantage you all have to do this stuff.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:46:13):\nYes, it is fun to... I mean, I do think this company is better than any I've seen at eating its own dog food and just everyone is constantly, we say Versel builds Versel with Versel. So you're just always looking for ways to, Hey, how can we use our product to go do what we need to do? And as a result, either understand then what a customer would want or what's missing from our product that we could go make better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:37):\nAlong these lines, something that's already come across a lot in the way that you described this stuff is I've heard a lot about how you think about go-to-market as a product. A lot of people listening to this, as I've said, are product builders. So I think this is a really nice way of thinking about go-to-market. I'm guessing you've already talked about elements of this, but just what's a way to think about go-to-market as a product?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:46:56):\nYeah, I've always, so I had this realization probably a little over a decade ago in my career. So my first job out of college was working on Gmail in 2004. So Gmail launched on April 1st, I joined on June 1st. And as I'm sure you'll remember as well, Gmail was this incredible innovation, massive JavaScript application that didn't really exist at the time. And it had this gig of storage. It was a full year before Yahoo Mail caught up and even longer before Hotmail and others did. So that was the level of technical differentiation between Gmail and the next best. And a decade later, you had cloud computing enabling folks to do stuff that you never would've been able to do previously. And so I kind of felt like, huh, software's starting to commoditize a little bit. And so when that happens, when technical differentiation kind of narrows, what are other things that will differentiate you?\n\n(00:48:01):\nAnd I was started thinking outside of tech, we buy a lot of things because of how we feel about them. And so I started to develop this thesis that actually the experience that you have of being sold to will increasingly actually differentiate a company and drive buying decisions if products are only different at the margin. And so if you believe that, then you really want to create a customer buying journey that feels like very unique experiences. And so we did a lot of this at Stripe and now we're looking to replicate this here. But an example of one of the things I think we did really nicely at Stripe was a lot of companies sales, the first call after you're qualified, we've decided you're worth engaging in sales process is discovery, which is basically let me ask you a lot of questions to try to under-uncover paint, figure out where buying power lies, et cetera.\n\n(00:49:03):\nAnd so that is kind of boring sometimes for a customer. You're basically being quizzed often on the phone. And so what we started to do at Stripe was that first session was a whiteboarding session, and we would actually get together and have you draw your architecture for payments and all the other things that were under the hood to enable you to take money and drive customer outcomes. And through that we would learn a ton about what was in your stack, what we were going to have to compete with, displace where value lied. But the customer also learned a lot themselves because in many cases they'd never drawn their architecture diagram. And so they left that meeting with an asset and a sense of like, \"Wow, this is a really collaborative person who's deeply interested in helping me develop a mental model for how to think about this.\" And then we had other things that we would do.\n\n(00:50:00):\nSo that's sort of how I think about building go-to-market-like a product is basically you need to go through from the first time you become aware that the company exists to again, that sort of five-year heavily retained wall-to-wall customer a set of experiences. And those experiences can feel transactional, flat, boring, or they can feel very human, personalized and unique. And so we try to go map those out and figure out how do you bring the product to bear, make it really human, and hopefully that creates a customer for life in the end.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):\nI love that whiteboarding example. Are there any other examples of what you've done to make it actually work really well in this way?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:50:43):\nYeah. Another principle, we really developed this at Stripe too and I brought it to Vercel, was just the idea of adding value at any touch point regardless of whether or not that customer bought. Because even if customers don't buy, you often find that if you miss them on that buying cycle, three or four years later when they're in another buying cycle, they do come back. I was at Stripe for nine years and so I saw the number of customers that we lost and then half a decade later, here they are and they bought. So that was sort of another one. So examples of this that were doing at Vercel is there's great data on the internet that helps people understand the performance of their website and how fast your website is actually impacts SEO. And SEO impacts AEO and everybody's thinking about AEO right now. And, so one of the things we try to do when we reach out is actually give folks insight immediately into how they're performing on an absolute basis, how they're performing relative to peers. So ideally that piques your interest and you want to learn more from us, but even if it doesn't, you still have insights that you may or may not have been aware of that maybe make you contemplate whether or not you've got the optimal setup.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:07):\nAwesome. So what I'm hearing here is when you say, think of it like a product that's basically a product person thinks about the experience of their product, that every step of the journey, here's the flow, step 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, how do we make every step awesome, keep them going along that journey. And so what you think about is just from the prospect's perspective, how do we make every step of that journey awesome, continue them down that journey.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:52:30):\nYeah. How do you make it be an experience rather than a transaction\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:35):\nVersus just feel like sales coming at you trying to sell you stuff?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:52:37):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:38):\nOkay. Staying along this track of staying tactical, I want to go even further there. So what are just some go-to-market tactics that you find really effective these days for people trying to just to be more successful in getting people to pay attention to their stuff, to buy their stuff?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:52:57):\nI mean, one I would sort of say dovetails with where I just ended, but is what are the unique insights that you can bring to bear about your product or how that customer may be in a suboptimal state? So I do think investing in data to tease that out is one thing. I think the other thing this is straightforward but often not done enough is a lot of good companies invest in docs, good thing to do, but they stop there. And particularly if you are selling into a slightly larger company doing things like, AWS calls it well-architected guides or blueprints, a lot of customers, particularly larger ones, really want to know the best practice for how exactly to implement your product with their particular setup. A great example of this, this is from Stripe, was Stripe was excellent at marketplaces. Most, Lyft, Instacart, DoorDash, they were all on Stripe.\n\n(00:54:07):\nAnd so Stripe definitely knew the best way to set up payments for a marketplace because we'd seen them all. And so when you then would go and sell a marketplace and say, \"Oh yeah, we've got docs, go check them out.\" They didn't like that, because they're like, \"Hey, every marketplace runs on Stripe. I don't want to look at generic docs. I want you to tell me what's the best way to set up payments for a marketplace.\" And so I think that's another key thing to be doing, particularly as you move past that sort of solo developer startup founder as potentially a target audience.\n\n(00:54:39):\nAnd then, I don't know if this is a tactic per se, but I do think just a good reminder for founders in particular who are still in that maybe founder-led sales moment is just the value of really good discovery. I often find founders are so excited about talking about their product or you ask one question and now they've got a hook of like, oh, I can fix that for you. But excellent salespeople typically will talk well under half the time in a conversation because they're out asking questions, probing often helping a customer arrive at conclusions on their own. And so learning how to do five why's, go deep rather than immediately going into problem solving mode. If they ask a question, you respond often. If they ask a question, you should ask a question about the question and then respond. So learning to be great at that, I think differentiates people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:43):\nSo the last tip, I think there's something a lot of I bet everyone could learn is just listen more and talk less.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:55:48):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:49):\nOn that first piece of advice, this kind of sharing unique insights and how your suboptimal, is there an example you could share of how you did that? Maybe a story of just how you convinced someone you're selling Striper or Vercel like care or something you're missing. Here's how this could help you become much better.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:56:04):\nSo with Vercel, sort of giving an example, but I'll make it more specific. So the performance point, you can go and look at core web Vitals, and so we can actually see the different things within their site that are fast or load correctly, et cetera, so anyone can go look that up. But what we can do is actually then help with benchmarking relative to peers. So that's been a big one that we've gone out and done. The other one that we've spent some good time on is just around helping customers understand MCP servers and when it would make sense to use one. So I think those are all the rage, but often people don't know how to contemplate them within their own product. So that was another one that we've gone pretty deep on and then related to, the first one is AEO Answer engine optimization is actually somewhat tangential to Vercel right.\n\n(00:57:09):\nSo we drive performance, performance drives SEO. SEO is an input into AEO, but we have spent a ton of time sharing insights on AEO because we ourselves focus deeply on it and think we understand it better than many. And so again, as part of just building a trusted relationship, folks may go from those AMAs or that content into, okay, great, you taught me a lot and therefore I want Vercel to help me with performance. But in many cases, they actually now are just like, \"This is a company that seems insightful, it seems like one I can learn from, and now I'm going to pay a little bit more attention to them.\" And over the fullness of time, maybe they see something that triggers them to decide, \"Now is the time I want to go investigate that aspect of Vercel.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:55):\nAwesome. So what I'm hearing here in many ways, and this resonates, I had Jenna Abel on the podcast recently and it was all about sales skills and how to sell.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:58:02):\nNice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):\nAnd one of her tips is you don't want to be focusing on here's the pain and problem we're solving and instead focus on here's how you will be better than your competitors. Here's the big gap and alpha that you can achieve. If you use Vercel, you were missing out on speed and you're going to get screwed in AEO and all these things. Here's how you can architect your entire payments system to be top tier. Does that resonate?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:58:27):\nYeah, I was told this stat. It's round numbers, so I can't imagine it's entirely accurate, but basically that customers, 80% of customers buy to avoid pain or reduce risk as opposed to the other one out of five to increase upside, which is a good thing again for startup founders to understand. So we all love to talk about the art of the possible, everything we're going to enable in the future. It's very exciting. Everyone's visionaries, but that's often really a sale that's going to resonate with another founder. And for everybody else, particularly enterprises, you're avoiding the risk of not making your revenue target next quarter, the risk of being outdone by the competition, the risk of having brand damage, et cetera. And so it's really hard actually for many startups to make that pivot because it feels off brand, but it does actually drive more buying behavior, is setting up a little bit of that concern that either I might not be well positioned or again through good question asking. I know exactly where I'm not well positioned and you can help me, that\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:53):\nThat is such an important stat you shared. This has come up actually before in this podcast that buying, people are buying in large part to reduce risks, to basically not hurt themselves in their career, not hurt the company. That's a bigger factor in the buying decision than, \"I have this problem I need to solve. And okay, thank you, this is solving.\" And the way April Dunford came in the podcast and talked about this of just like it's such a massive career bet. We are going to bring in product X and it's going to become, like Stripe, let's say, let's not talk about Versel. But let's say Stripe, we're going to adopt Stripe. That's a huge decision. If it doesn't go well, your career is hurt, your manager is going to be mad at you, it's going to set your company back. So a lot of the buying decision, as you've said is I just don't want to screw this up.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:00:36):\nRight. Absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):\nOkay. Along the line of tactics, something that I know you're a big fan of and help people think about is segmentation.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:00:45):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):\nThis is something a lot of founders struggle with. They know, \"Okay, I need to figure out my segmentation strategy and here where we're going after.\" Can you just give us a primer on segmentation, what people should know about why this is important and then how they might approach this.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:00:59):\nSo segmentation is basically how do you carve up the world of companies that exist on the planet to reason about them where they buy differently? So I'll give examples from Stripe and Versel to bring this home. So a very typical company segmentation is small, medium, large. That's a rational way to do things. Small, you often have a single decision maker, medium, a small team, and large, it's complex, it's a committee, et cetera. So the buying process does change across SMB, mid-market enterprise, but if you stop there, you are likely missing. But what are the things within your offering that also change the way something gets sold? So at Stripe, there were two ways we further cut the business. Way one was, so think of segmentation as a graph. So X-Access was size, so small, medium, large, y-access was growth potential. And that was important for Stripe because it was a consumption-based business.\n\n(01:02:10):\nSo if you were going to grow at 200% year-on-year, you were more valuable to Stripe than if you were going to grow at 8% year-on-year. And so we wanted to spend more time, spend more money going after the 200% growers than the 8%. So that was one that informed your strategy on who you targeted. And then for Stripe, the other thing that we cut it was business model. So are you a B2B? Are you B2C? Are you B2B2B, E.G. a platform or B2B2C, E.G. a marketplace and why is that relevant? Well, if you're B2B, you are going to need business payments. Credit card was useful for a PLG function or PLG sale, but you were going to need ACH wires, etc. And you probably had a recurring business, so you were going to want Stripe billing. If you were B2C, that's consumer.\n\n(01:03:00):\nSo you're going to want consumer payments. Apple Pay is super important. If you were in the platform or the marketplace, you were going to buy our connect product. So it helped us basically then craft a more targeted and replicable sales. Vercel, sort of similar deals. So small, medium, large buying complexity. We also do the same thing on growth potential because we are similarly a consumption based business, but for us, a couple other things on the X-axis, we layer in promote, which is one of the things that is observable is traffic, site traffic on the internet. So Google publishes a Crux score, which is basically they have a bunch of data in Chrome, and so they know that Lenny's site gets a million XC amount-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:48):\nMillions.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:03:48):\n... volume that Jeanne's site does. And so basically if you are a small company but you have super high traffic that's going to be more complex, Vercel is going to make more money and so we want to promote you.\n\n(01:04:02):\nSo great example of this would be OpenAI. OpenAI, I forget these days how many employees it has. Let's say it's 3,000, it's probably more than that at this point, but so that's going to put it in the mid-market at most companies, but they're a top 25 traffic site on the internet. So for us, that's going to push them in our enterprise because we need to go lean in with a much more in depth sales process. And then the other thing we layer on is a workload type. So if you are an e-commerce company, that's going to be a very different sale. You actually use different language. You talk about product listing pages and product description pages, and you've got an order management system as the back end. Super different from a crypto company where you might be running soup to nuts on AWS. And so again, that helps us start to then have a really different buying content for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:06):\nOkay, this is awesome. So essentially what you do is you break up this universe coming back to your original story at Stripe to help you sort essentially which companies are most likely to buy your product. And what you're coming up with is these attributes that are correlated with they're likely to be great potential customers.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:05:22):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:22):\nDo you recommend using this XY axis as the approach versus something else? There's like a spreadsheet with five columns. I don't know, how do you start?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:05:31):\nThere's probably something to be said for X and Y. like do you think size is going to play into most buying decisions and then these days there is a fair amount of consumption happening? So there'll be aspects of this that I think are somewhat universal. But I think basically when I came to Vercel, because new product market product offering, for me it's a new market. I had a lot to learn, but this is one of the first things I did in the first 30 days. And so basically I sat down with the gentleman Abhi who leads data science here and said, okay, what drives revenue? So what are the things that you can look at X ante about a customer to know this person's likely to pay us a hundred thousand dollars versus a million? That's probably going to be part of a segmentation framework. And then similarly, okay, what attributes would we look for to cluster where we seem to be winning repeatedly? And that was how we ultimately got at, okay, Crux rank is going to be super important because what you pay Vercel is correlated with your traffic. And then workload type was super important as well.\n\n(01:06:46):\nAnd for Vercel, when we did that, it was really interesting because we saw, wow, we have a lot of penetration and e-comm not that surprising actually, given that we drive highly performant sites and e-comm having a superfast performance site really matters. But at the time, if you looked at as an example, an enterprise SaaS companies, we didn't have a lot of penetration, even though you would've thought, okay, front-end cloud, very developer oriented. Of course software companies would be on us, but in enterprise, most of those companies built that SaaS offering before Vercel existed. So migrating 2 million lines of code to Vercel, that's a big lift. So it helped us really understand where are we winning, where are we not? And now as an example, within SaaS companies and enterprise, we're actually seeing a lot of interest in the AI cloud. Those are some of the earlier adopters of, \"Hey, let's add AI native functionality to our existing SaaS app.\" And so again, it helps us figure out what to target where.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:55):\nSo essentially you're doing this regression analysis on what's working and then here's the attributes that are most correlated with success. Something I always recommend when founders ask me for how do I figure out my CPE? How do I figure out where to focus, my heuristic is just think of three attributes that narrow them down. So it's like series A company that's angel-led, that's the marketplace, something like that. Does that feel like a good just rule of thumb just to start?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:08:18):\nYeah, I think beyond three, that's getting pretty detailed and reasonably speaking, you're not going to cut. You have five sellers. So, what, you're going to put one seller in five different segments? So I do think three is something you can reason about. The other thing I'll say on this topic that I think is really important is a lot of times folks think segmentation is a go-to market thing. I really think it's a company thing. So when you Vercel, I actually deliver and every new hires first week, one of our company values is KYC, know your customer and I deliver the KYC section and talk through our segmentation framework how our customer base maps into those segments because it's really important as those new product managers leave the room that when they're building something, they think to themselves, okay, I'm building a new back end product. Who is this targeted at? Is it targeted at an enterprise or a startup? Basically, do I have a point of view on where I'm trying to win and why? And if you're doing that out of the gates, then it's much easier to then go speak the same language with the go to market org and figure out, okay, how are we going to take that to market in line with the other emotions that we have in play?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:36):\nOkay, this is a great segue to, there's a couple other things I want to talk about. One is something I've heard from so many people you've worked with is that you are amazing at building a go-to-market org that works really well with product and engineering. So I'll read this quote from your former colleague, Kate Jensen. She said that your superpower is building a sales org that doesn't feel like a sales org to engineers. So the question she suggested asked just what does it take to do that? What are the ingredients to building a sales org that engineers and product teams really like working with?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:09:59):\nThe litmus test I have always given my sales team is if you are an account executive in my org and I put you in front of 10 engineers at our company, it should take them 10 minutes to figure out you aren't a product manager. And what I'm trying to get across is you need to have incredible product depth. And the reason for that is twofold. One, it gives you credibility with the product and engineering org. And two, I also believe that the best go-to-market orgs on the planet are equal parts revenue driving and R&D and D. And the reason I emphasize the latter is if you think about a product management organization, you may have a UXR team out doing research, product managers certainly should be out talking to customers. Well, if I have a 20-person sales team, think of the number of customers that we talk to in a week. And so if we can do an excellent job of translating all of that feedback into signal and then feeding that into the road map, we can be actually an extension of the product management org. But that takes being really good at discerning signal from noise, understanding when something is an objection that should be overcome versus an opportunity in the market. So I think those things have helped.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:27):\nI just love this as a product manager, maybe form a product manager. I don't know what the hell I am these days. I just love the idea of the salesperson. Like you not knowing the difference between a product manager and a salesperson. The most classic challenge is sales orgs ask for all these features and PMs are constantly having to push back and think about does this fit into everything. So it feels like that's a big part of this is to understand that deeply.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:11:51):\nYeah, you want a sales org that can think like a general manager, so that's not just trying to get deals done but is trying to help build a business. And so again, knows when to say no, knows when to do objection handle versus knows, Hey, I've actually heard this on the last three calls and I do think this would be a really big unlock that would make us more competitive, would be something that new that nobody's doing. So I think that takes looking for a profile that both has sales skills but also is going to think with that product mindset.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:31):\nI love that. Okay, so another quote from Claire Hughes Johnson, former podcast guest, amazing sales leader, worked with you at Stripe. She said something along these lines, but a little different. Jeanne is probably the best go-to-market person at connecting with product and engineering, deeply understanding the product and providing the most valuable input to her counterparts of any I've ever seen. It sounds like just another ingredient here is just sales feeling like a real partner to product engineering actually, not just being like, \"Hey, do these things for me, but actually feeling like a partner.\"\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:13:01):\nUltimately company strategy is basically product strategy meets go-to market strategy. And so I spend guess as a go-to market leader, I'm constantly trying to figure out how do I make more money more efficiently? And you typically do that by having a winning product in the market that is well commercialized. And so that means that I really lean into thinking about product strategy and thinking about pricing strategy because if those two things are optimal, you're going to win more often and there'll be less friction in it. And so that's sort of where got to put as a revenue leader, like a GM hat on and not just think, how do I sell? But actually how do I enable the insights I'm getting from talking to customers constantly to have the company strategy be more effective?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:00):\nSpeaking of product, going in a slightly different direction, PLG product-led growth, it felt like it was very hot for a while where everyone's like, \"You got to go PLG, that's the only way to win. It's impossible to do sales. The future is PLG.\" It feels like that's gone away. And in large part, obviously still companies grow through PLG and work through PLG. What's just kind of your thoughts on PLG and when does it make sense for a company these days to actually think this is how they'll grow for a while?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:14:28):\nPLG makes sense for a lot of companies at the outset, unless you are very explicitly building a product for enterprise. So Sierra as an example, right? They are very clearly going after Global 2000 or something close to that. PLG is not going to be overly useful to them because they are trying to win eight-figure deals from day one. But for a lot of products, folks are targeting a startup audience at the outset and then they're adding more functionality so that they can ultimately continue to scale up market. So I think PLG is still super relevant. It's a major driver of Vercels growth. It was a big driver of Stripe's growth. The thing that folks get wrong is it does typically have a ceiling. So people are generally not going to give you $1 million via self-serve flow. So at some point if you want to sustain growth rates, you're going to have to have your deal sizes get bigger and bigger. And where I think folks get stuck is waiting too long on PLG because it does take a while to build a replicable sales process and a sales process, which often you're getting fed by inbound at the beginning and then you got to add outbound. It takes a while actually to turn outbound into a predictable engine. So I think where you see companies hit walls is just when they don't add the sales portion of it soon enough.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:00):\nSo essentially every company ends up having to build a sales org, some start product-led and then at sales, some just start sales and have it from the beginning.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:16:09):\nYeah, I would agree. There are probably some good examples of large vertical SaaS platforms that are SMB, but even they wind up with Velocity sales team. So yeah, I don't know that I can think of a 100 billion company that's PLG-only.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:30):\nYeah, it just feels like you're leaving money on the table even if you are growing really fast. I know Atlassian was a long-time PLG company but eventually succumbed. I don't know if that's the right way to put it. Okay. You mentioned pricing. I know you have strong opinions on pricing and pricing strategy. What's just a couple of tips you might share with someone thinking about how to price their product?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:16:52):\nYeah, this is kind of on the theme, but I think the first thing is you got to think about pricing like a product. So it's another one where it actually really matters how you choose to price a product. Do you really understand where customers are going to drive value? Do you really understand where you incur costs? And are you doing a smart job of aligning those things? You've got lots of examples of companies grossly underpricing, you're sort of afraid to charge for the value that you actually provide. I think there are a lot of examples where people default to including a freemium strategy without that actually being a strategy. A good example at Stripe, we launched Stripe Billings years ago. It had a freemium strategy because that's what you do. And then we sort of looked at it and we're like, \"actually integrating straight billing takes a little bit of work.So if you do that, you're probably going to stay.\"\n\n(01:17:56):\nAnd so we killed that, killed the free trial to zero downside. So that's another one. At Vercel, we've been going through that transition where we're a consumption-based business model ultimately, but at the outset we basically kind of bundled that into what looked like a SaaS-like price and as we've added a lot more functionality that wasn't working anymore. And so we did an unbundling and right now actually we did a pretty substantial pricing change in August where we have an enterprise at a pro-skew. And if you looked at the enterprise skew, it's called Enterprise for a reason, enter, it's meant to be sold to an enterprise. And actually about half of the folks on the enterprise skew were startups, which suggests that there's stuff in the enterprise skew that a startup really wants. So we kicked a lot of that stuff out of the enterprise skew and made it so you could buy it self-serve online and what do you know, people are.\n\n(01:19:03):\nSo now that's really driven a lot of growth in our PLG funnel, which is awesome for startups because it's super efficient. They can just buy things, they want that. It's awesome for us because you don't have to have a human intermediate that. So getting all of these knobs really tuned is a key to both a great customer experience and optimal revenue outcomes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:24):\nMaybe just one more question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. It's going to be a combo question. I hear you have a hot take on sales comp, how to comp salespeople that's different from other people and also who to hire when you're hiring folks in sales. Can you just talk about your takes there?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:19:41):\nI struggle with sales comp because it's all about pay for performance, which I'm obviously a fan of, but it makes your organization less flexible because you basically have to decide 12 months in advance, these are things I value and particularly in this moment that could be different. As a great example of this, when we wrote the sales plans for this year at Vercel, the AI cloud did not exist. We were selling our front-end cloud and we were selling VZero and introduced the AI cloud halfway through the year. Now we had all sorts of good ways to still incentivize that, but I think you want to be able to be innovative and pivot and when you have a well-designed sales plan or a very structured sales plan, that can be challenging.\n\n(01:20:44):\nSo that's a little bit of my hot take is just I'm trying to figure out how do you have the upside of sales of motivates people. It's a quantitative function, which is great, but also the flexibility to change your mind because I think a lot of companies right now are having a hard time doing annual planning. So that's one. On profiles, I have always valued just sort of a diversified portfolio. So I strongly believe that sales is a skill and so you want salespeople with actual sales experience in your organization, but I think there's value in pairing them with more nontraditional backgrounds, in particular consulting or banking background. Those folks are really good at more quantitative and analytical aspects of sales. So getting into that consultative part, which I think we talked about at the outset. And so I find that when you mix these together, the sort of consultant banker profile realizes, \"Oh wait a minute, sales is a skill and I didn't really have it.\" And so they go learn from your account executives with that background and then your AEs learn more about, okay, how do I think about a P&L? How can I talk to a CFO? How do I present a TCO analysis more effectively? And so just creates a much richer learning environment where people are bouncing ideas off each other.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:22):\nThat is awesome. I love that strategy. Okay, final question. Just is there anything else you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:31):\nOh man. I feel like we've been very thorough.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:34):\nAll right, thanks So too.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:35):\nYeah, you stumped me on that one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:38):\nOkay. That's the goal. With that Jean, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I'm going to make it very quick. I know you got to run. I'm going to ask you just two questions.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:46):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:46):\nOne is I'm going to skip to your life motto. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in worker and life?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:54):\nI do. I actually have found that I'm known for saying a handful of things that I didn't necessarily realize it, but when you leave an organization, people tend to tell you what stuck with them. But there is one that I think I am known for saying growing up, my mom always said to me, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. And in sales, you're always going to have a quarter when you're not on pace. And so that's one that I feel like I pull on, not infrequently because in my view, there's another version of this, my mom also always says was where there's a will, there's a way. So I think you can always choose to find a path forward even when that's not super clear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:45):\nI love these. Okay, last question. I read that you were a very competitive diver in college early on. I'm just curious if there's something you learned from that experience that brought with you that helps you be as successful as you've become?\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:23:59):\nWell, I mean, first of all, I should say I was generally coming in third place out of three on my team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:04):\nThird place, that's not bad.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:24:07):\nI managed to do it in college, but that was the extent of that career. So diving is a precision sport and it is a repetitive sport. And it is also a sport where when you land flat on your back, and literally as you are swimming to the side of the pool, welts are forming on it, you always 100% of the time will be forced to immediately get back on the diving board and do that exact same dive again. And so I think that has a lot of stuff that's transferable to work and to sales. So for me, I just have an obsession with excellence and within sales. sales is about replicability. How do you drive predictable outcomes, how excellent are you at your ability to forecast? And so I think I bring that to bear within sales a lot. And then similarly, you get a lot of nos in sales. So another phrase that a sales guru said to me once or in a training was yeses are great, nos are great, maybes will kill you. And so how do you get really comfortable that no is a great thing and that just gave you data and now you can go do something with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:25):\nThis is a really inspiring and empowering way to end the conversation. Jean, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:25:33):\nThanks so much for having me, Lenny. It was a lot of fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:35):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:25:37):\nThank you so much for listening.
