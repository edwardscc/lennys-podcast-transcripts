What the labs need is labor marketplace. They actually need extraordinary professionals that can measure model capabilities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:17):\nThey found this pocket, maybe the biggest business opportunity in history.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:00:20):\nWe grew from 1 to 400 million in revenue run rate in 16 months, fastest ascent in history.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):\nWhy is this so valuable?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:00:29):\nThe market is bound by the amount of things where humans can do something that models can't. The lab's primary bottleneck to improve models is how they can effectively have some way of measuring what success looks like for the model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):\nThere's this tweet that you retweeted. \"If you really think about it, we were put on Earth to create reinforcement learning training data for labs.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:00:49):\nIt's highly likely that the entire economy will become an aural environment machine, building out all of these worlds and contexts. And I think the narrative in AI over the last three years has almost entirely been one of job displacement, but very few companies and people have talked about this new category of jobs that's being created.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:08):\nI talked to a lot of people about what should I be studying? Where should I be getting better?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:01:12):\nHow can they leverage this technology to do so much more? We'll give people interviews where we say, \"Use whatever tools are available to build a website and let's see what product you're able to build in an hour.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:24):\nToday, my guest is Brendan Foody, CEO and co-founder of Mercor. Mercor is the fastest-growing company in history to go from 1 to $500 million in revenue. They did this in 17 months, less than a year and a half. Brendan is also the youngest unicorn founder ever. They just raised $100 million at $2 billion valuation. Mercor, if you haven't heard of them, helps AI labs and AI companies hire experts to help them train their models using AI. They've never had a customer churn, their net retention is over 1,600%, and they're on a nine-figure revenue run rate.\n\n(00:01:59):\nIn our conversation, we talk about the increasing value and importance of evals, the landscape of AI training companies like Mercor, and why they've become so important and valuable, how Brendan discovered this opportunity, his insights on what product market fit looks like, the core tenets he's instilled within his organization that have allowed him to build the fastest growing company in history, what people writing evals for labs are actually doing day to day, which skills and jobs are going to last the longest with the rise of AI, why he doesn't think we'll see AGI or superintelligence anytime soon, and so much more.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:05:45):\nThank you so much for having me, Lenny. I'm a huge fan, and so excited to have a conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):\nI'm really excited to have this conversation as well. I'm a huge fan of yours. I'm excited for more people to learn about you and what you're building.\n\n(00:05:57):\nI want to start with a tweet that you have pinned at the top of your Twitter feed right now, and here's the tweet. \"We are now working with six out of the Magnificent 7, all of the top five AI labs, most of the AI application layer companies. One trend is common across every customer. We are entering the era of evals.\"\n\n(00:06:19):\nThe reason this caught my attention is that's one of the most recurring trends on this podcast, people talking about the increasing value of learning how to do evals well and the value of evals for companies. It feels like still people don't know what the hell this is what we're talking about, why this is so important. Talk about just what you think people are still missing, what they need to know, what this era of evals means.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:06:39):\nIf the model is the product, then the eval is the product requirement document. And the way that researchers' day-to-day looks is that they'll run dozens of experiments where they'll make small improvements on an eval set. And reinforcement learning is becoming so effective that once they have an eval, they can help climb it. If you look at just how fast people were able to saturate Olympiad Math once they focused on it, how fast we're even saturating SWE-bench once we focus on it. And so in many ways, the barrier to applying agents the entire economy to automate every workflow is how do we measure success? How do we eval it? And write the PRDs for everything that we want agents to do, which Mercor is obviously a huge part of doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:25):\nSo people hearing this, they're like, \"Oh, yeah. Okay, shit. I got to really pay attention to this eval stuff.\" Any advice about learning how to do this well? What companies that are doing this well are doing differently? Help people get better at this thing.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:07:39):\nYeah. I think that for enterprises especially, the core way to think about it is how can they build a test or systematic way to measure how well AI automates their core value chain? So if it's an architecture firm that's producing these architecture diagrams of what they provide to their end customer, how can they effectively measure that? And each company has its own value chain or maybe a handful of them if it's a multi-product company. And just thinking about how they measure that is the prerequisite to really effectively applying AI throughout their entire business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:21):\nI saw you talking about this on the No Priors podcast with Sarah and Elad, and I don't know if it was after this or before this, but Sarah tweeted, \"Evals equals your new marketing.\" What does that mean? What do you think she's saying there?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:08:32):\nYeah. Well, it ties to what I said earlier about how if the model is the product, evals are the PRD, but also subsequently the sales collateral, right? Because evals are what you give to researchers to show them what they should be building and going on, but they're also the way that you demonstrate the efficacy of capabilities.\n\n(00:08:51):\nAnd historically, everyone's been pointing to these academic evals of PhD level reasoning with GPQA, Humanity's Last Exam, or Olympiad Math, but now it's moving towards the capabilities that people practically care about of how do we get models to automate the way that we build a software platform or automate the way that we do an investment banking analysis. And I think labs as well as application layer companies will increasingly use evals to demonstrate the capabilities of their models and their products.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:26):\nOkay. So let's build on this and zoom out a little bit and talk about the landscape of the market that you're in. And I was just reflecting on this as I was preparing for this conversation. If you think about the companies growing faster than any company's ever grown in history, there's essentially three buckets. There's the foundational model companies, there's vibe coding apps, Cursor and Loveable and Bolt and Replit and all these here, and then there's data labeling data companies like you. So I've had the CEO of Handshake on the podcast. I have the CEO of Scale coming on. There's also Surge. There's you guys. Help us just understand the landscape of what this is all about because I think people don't really know what the hell's going on and see all these companies growing like crazy.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:10:06):\nYeah, I'll give a little bit of the origin story, incorporate in that and how it frames the landscape. Because when we started the company, I met my co-founders when we were 14 years old. We started the company together when we were 19 initially, in January 2023, initially hiring people internationally, matching them with our friends and automating all the processes of how we did that. So similar to how a human would review a resume, conduct an interview, and decided to hire. We automated all of those processes with LLMs, bootstrap the company to a million dollar revenue run rate before we dropped out of college.\n\n(00:10:40):\nAnd then a handful of other things happened, but we met OpenAI and we saw that there was this enormous transition in the human data market where it was moving away from this crowdsourcing problem of how do you find low and medium skilled people that can write barely grammatically correct sentences for early versions of LLMs and moving towards this sourcing and vetting problem. How do we source and assess the best professionals, the experienced? Think software engineers, the investment bankers and doctors and lawyers that can actually help to evaluate and interpret all of the capabilities that people want models to have.\n\n(00:11:21):\nSo from there, we start working with all of the top AI labs. We grew from 1 to 400 million in revenue run rate in 16 months, and it's been an extraordinary journey and super exciting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:36):\nOkay. First of all, that is out of control. I don't know if people understand. I think this is the first time you're sharing that number. I know we're recording this, you'll have announced it by now, but 1 to 400 million in revenue in 16 months.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:11:49):\nExactly. So fastest ascent in history, which is an exciting statistic we're very proud of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):\nOkay. So something big is happening here. Why is this so valuable? What is going on here? So it's just to try to summarize what you guys do simply is you help hire people for labs to help them train their models, and you help them find not just generalist labor, but experts, helping them with very specific gaps in the model's knowledge.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:12:21):\nYeah, precisely. And so it really ties to your first question around the era of evals that's framing all of this, which is that the lab's primary bottleneck to being able to improve models is how they can effectively have some way of measuring what success looks like for the model, both to use it as the eval for the tests that they're measuring their progress against, as well as the verifiers in an RL environment to then reward the model, improve capabilities, et cetera. And they need this across every domain for every capability that models don't know how to use. And the wealthiest companies in the world are willing to spend whatever it takes to improve model capabilities where Mercor is sitting at the forefront and the primary bottleneck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:12):\nOkay, what are these people actually doing? So what's an example of a kind of person that is sought after? And then what are they doing sitting there at the computer?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:13:19):\nEffectively, the market is bound by the amount of things where humans can do something that models can't. So I'll make that very concrete. Say you have a model that you want to write a red line for a contract in the way that a lawyer would, and it makes a handful of mistakes, misses a bunch of key points in doing so. What you could do is have a lawyer create a rubric similar to how a professor might create a rubric to create a deliverable for what are the things we want the model to be able to do?\n\n(00:13:50):\nSo it can effectively score that, right? Plus however much of it identifies this or XYZ key point. And that's really the foundation to measuring what does progress look like for models? Is this model achieving the capabilities that these professionals want? As well as how do we use this as training data to reward and to reinforce a lot of the capabilities that people want models to achieve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:19):\nOkay, so they're essentially writing evals just to connect it back to original conversation.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:14:23):\nExactly. Well, that's an interesting thing is everyone talks about RL environment. I feel like the two hot button things are like RL environments and evals, but one thing like Andrej Karpathy's tweeted out about a bunch is there's not actually a nuance. It's in the data type. It's more just a different semantic way of describing what it's being used for. But ultimately, it's just some stasis point for how do you measure what good looks like? And you can use that either as the benchmark to the sales collateral, as Sarah was saying, to say, here is why are models the best model in the world and here's the capabilities that we've been working towards, or you can use it on the post-training side to reward certain model trajectories and achieve those capabilities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):\nOkay. So say this lawyer, this person is writing, \"Here's what a great red line contract looks like and here's the rubric of what excellent is.\" Then are they also providing data, like actual examples of red line documents as a part of that?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:15:22):\nThey may. The data landscape historically has included two kinds of data. The first is supervised fine-tuning data, which is input/output. When people think about fine-tuning in the historical sense, that's what it is. The second is RLHF where the model will generate a couple of examples. We'll choose which is the most popular example.\n\n(00:15:43):\nWhat everyone is generally moving towards is reinforcement learning from AI feedback instead of human feedback where you have instead the human defined some sort of success criteria, some way to measure that. And examples in code, it could be a unit test. We can scalably measure success and other domains that could be a rubric. And then you use that to incentivize model capabilities. And it's far more scalable and data-efficient, and so that's why a lot of the broader trend in the market across the board is moving towards RLHF to both eval models as well as improved capabilities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:24):\nI had one of the co-founders of Anthropic on. He said exactly the same thing. That's what they've done at Anthropic, is move towards AI-driven reinforcement learning.\n\n(00:16:32):\nSo essentially, if I can understand this correctly, I'm the lay person here trying to understand this on behalf of the audience. So essentially a lawyer is like, \"Here's what correct looks like for redlining,\" and then it's AI is just on its own almost, just like, \"I'm going to try to get this. I'm going to try to improve on this and I know if I'm heading the right direction based on this eval/rubric I've been given.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:16:55):\nExactly. Applying all of the criteria of what good looks like similar to how the TA might apply the professor's criteria of does the student's response meet this criteria or this criteria plus however many planes, et cetera.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:10):\nAwesome, okay. Let me shift to talking about the broader labor market here. So there's two parts to this question as we talk about this. One is just how long will we need to do this? You guys grew so incredibly fast. Is there a point of like, \"Okay, we don't need humans. We're tapped out.\" So let's start there and then I'll ask a broader question.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:17:29):\nSo the key question is how long there's going to be things in the economy that humans can do that AI can't do? And I think there's certainly a bucket of people that say we're going to have superintelligence within three years and humans won't play a role in the economy. And that's one school of thought.\n\n(00:17:46):\nOur perspective is very different. Our perspective is that these models are extraordinary and automating a lot of things very quickly, but there's a lot of things that they're horrible at. Even still, it can't schedule time on my calendar. It can't draft emails for me. It can't use basic tools. And we need evals for everything. For everything that the models can't do, we need evals for the tool use, evals for the long horizon reasoning.\n\n(00:18:12):\nImagine in 10 years when we want models to be able to go out and build a startup for 30 days. We need evals for that to effectively reward it. And I think that that road to improving models will last for as long as there is anything in the economy that humans can do which models can't and be a huge portion of what the future of work looks like. And so our mission is creating the future of work, and I think that this is a really exciting industry and giving us a glimpse into the direction that everything is headed towards.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:49):\nThere's this tweet that you retweeted that I want to ask you about. \"If you really think about it, we were put on Earth to create reinforcement learning training data for labs.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:18:59):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:00):\nWhat does that mean to you? What is this person implying? And it's basically what you're saying is we're just helping train models.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:19:06):\nIt speaks to conversations I've had with a lot of researchers and executives at top labs, which is that it's highly likely that the entire economy will become an aural environment machine, building out all of these worlds and contexts for us to then have rubrics or other kinds of verifiers. And that is really exciting in so many ways.\n\n(00:19:32):\nBecause I think let's draw an analog to other revolutions where when we had the industrial revolution, everyone was freaking out about losing their jobs, but there was this whole new class of jobs of how do we build the machines? How do we have knowledge work? How do we create everything new? And I think that the narrative in AI over the last three years has almost entirely been one of job displacement, right? Sure, there's ChatGPT is growing fast and it's very cool that everyone loves using it, but from an economic standpoint, people talking a lot about job displacement. But very few companies and people have talked about this new category of jobs that's being created and what that's going to mean and how people can prepare and upskill for that. And I think that the most exciting thing possible is creating that future of how do humans fit into the economy and how will that evolve over time?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:22):\nI talk to a lot of people about just what should I be studying? Where should I be getting better? People in school right now are just like, \"What is even going to be valuable in the future?\" You're at the center of a lot of just what jobs are most in demand, how hiring is evolving. So let me just ask you a very concrete question. What jobs do you think will remain in the future/what skills are still worth investing in for younger people, especially?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:20:47):\nIn terms of jobs, I would respond with a category of things that have very elastic demand are going to be super exciting. Because when we make people 10 times more productive, we'll build 10 times, if not 100 times as much software as an example. And so I think the product managers that can now do so much more are going to be extremely well-positioned. And so far as the skills, I think it's people that can leverage AI to do whatever their day-to-day workflows are.\n\n(00:21:16):\nI have had a couple conversations with teachers where they get my thoughts on how they should be assessing their students because we originally started out curating all of these AI interviews and assessments for people and have thought about this immensely. And what we realized is that you don't want to fight against them using the models. It's similar to when the calculator came out, you don't want to give people all of this arithmetic work of how do you get them to do it and not use the calculator. You want to tell them, \"Use the tools and let's see what you can do.\"\n\n(00:21:49):\nAnd so we'll give people interviews where we say, \"Use ChatGPT and Kodak. Use Claude code. Use whatever tool cursor and whatever tools are available to build a website and let's see what product you're able to build in an hour.\" And so I think that I give that an example in so far as talent assessment because I think it pertains also to the skills that people should be honing in on of how can they leverage this technology to do so much more in whatever industry or vertical they're operating in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:17):\nWhen you talk about elastic, being elastic, is it generalists being good at just a bunch of different things, or what do you say? What do you mean when you think elastic?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:22:25):\nSo I more mean how much capacity for demand there is in that industry. So I'll give a couple of examples. In accounting, I think realistically we only need so much accounting in the world. Maybe there's areas where we can do more and that'll be good, but it doesn't feel like the world needs 100 times more accounting.\n\n(00:22:46):\nOn the other hand, in software development, I think we can ship 100 times more features for our products, move 100 times faster, build so much more. There's just it feels like there's unlimited demand for the industry. And I think Mark Andreessen tweeted about this recently, that software is the most elastic industry of all where when we increase productivity, there's so much more that will be built. And it's definitely characteristic of a lot of other domains as well. And so I would focus on those domains where if we make everyone 10 times more productive, that'll increase demand, not reduce it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:23):\nOkay. So you're in the bucket of learn to code, still useful as a skill. You take computer science. And so in terms of elastic categories of jobs, sounds like engineering, product management is in that bucket. Great. A lot of people listening to this are PMs. What else, like design users? I don't know. What else do you feel is in that bucket from what you've seen?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:23:44):\nYeah, I think that there's a lot of things where the whole value chain of building companies has a lot of these variable costs, even large portions of operations or consulting. Imagine if we could have 10 times as many McKinsey consultants, what would be possible in so far as the research we could do, the analysis, et cetera. But I think the companies and people that are going to succeed are those that lean into this narrative of abundance of how do we do so much more rather than fighting back against it of how do we try to stop displacement.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:20):\nSo along those lines, I think about your second bucket, which is the people that will be most successful. It's not like a specific skill, but it's being good with AI, using AI to become better at what you're already doing. This reminds me of Elon's whole thing with Neuralink, which I don't know if this is how we put it, but the way I've always heard it is you wanted to build Neuralink because in the future when AGI and superintelligence is around, we need a way to compete and the best way to compete is plug our brains into a superintelligence so we have a chance. And it feels like that's what AI is. Getting good at AI tools is essentially is having this super superpower.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:24:58):\nFiguring out how to leverage them and incorporate it will definitely be of paramount importance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:04):\nIt just comes back to this almost cliche quote now. It's, \"AI won't replace you. People that are really good with AI will replace you.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:25:10):\nI think it's totally spot on. And I've definitely seen this at the enterprise level as well where there's certain enterprises we talk to that are almost fearful not wanting to engage, not wanting to eval their businesses because that'll provide the evidence that their value chain is being automated. And there's others that... Literally some of the most recognized sophisticated Fortune 500 businesses that have this mentality and there's others that are leaning into it of if we have the ability to do 10 or 100 times more, what will that mean and how do we lean into that future? Because there's so many things that are going to change over the next 10 years, and I think those are the kinds of businesses that are going to be successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:54):\nLet's talk about labor markets more broadly. You guys, so it's interesting though. You started not feeding people to AI labs, not training models. It was just like help people find jobs, help companies hire, and then you're like, \"Oh wow, this whole opportunity.\" You have this really interesting view on the future of just labor markets and hiring. Talk about that.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:26:14):\nYeah, it's interesting. I remember when we started the company, as I mentioned, we were 19, and just had this gut intuition that it felt so wildly inefficient that labor markets are so disaggregated. And what I mean by that is when we would hire someone internationally, they would apply to a dozen jobs. When we as a company in the Bay Area were considering candidates, we would consider a fraction of a percent of candidates that were available in the market. And the reason for that is that there was this matching problem that everyone's solving manually where they'll manually review resumes, they'll manually conduct interviews, and manually decide who to hire. But when we're able to automate that matching problem at the cost of software, it makes way for this global unified labor market that every candidate applies to and every company hires from facilitating a perfect flow of information in the economy.\n\n(00:27:08):\nAnd I think that that future is undoubtedly what we're heading towards, but what we've realized over time is that the nature of work is also changing dramatically. And part of building that future over a 10-year time horizon is creating that future of work and all of the more tactical things we do and building these incredible data sets across evals and RL environments for our customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):\nWhat I've seen in how hiring has changed, I'm doing research on this with a partner, Gnome, it's so much easier to apply for companies that everyone's just applying now, to hundreds of companies. AI is just making it easy to adjust their resumes and cover letters and make it feel like, \"Oh, I applied to more of course very specifically, but it was one of 100 places.\" And then on the flip side, hiring managers are getting flooded with applications and so now they need AI to filter. So even if we didn't want to get to this place, we're almost being pushed into this direction of so much volume on both sides. We need something really smart at filtering and helping us hire and select, and this is exactly what you guys have been building for a long time.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:28:13):\nPrecisely, yeah. And the fascinating thing a lot of people ask, do we think about ourselves as a labor marketplace or do we think about ourselves as a data company? And I think that the reason it's an interesting question is our realization on from what the labs need is that they actually need a labor marketplace. They actually need these exceptionally high caliber people. And of course we'll layer on some project management and some software platform associated with it. But the really core thing that they want is how do they find these extraordinary professionals across all of these different domains that can measure model capabilities and work to build that future work together?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:56):\nThis episode is brought to you by Enterpret.

Once they recognize, it doesn't fully understand this. Humans are actually helping them learn these things.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:30:29):\nExactly. Well, so the way it works, at least what most people's understanding is there's a lot of complexity in how the models work, is that pre-training gets a lot of the knowledge into the model of what are all the different things that see into the world. And then post-training and reinforcement learning is for all of the reasoning of what are the pieces of knowledge that are accurate, what are inaccurate, and what to prioritize at any given time to make a decision. And so behind that, there would've been radiologists that worked on the post-training data set to create some stasis point for here's the diagnosis and rewards and penalties associated with it. And it's really the quality of those people that went into the quality of the decision and recommendation that ChatGPT ultimately made.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):\nSo let's actually follow that, right, because that's really interesting and I don't know how many people understand it. I understand it. So the work that you do and these experts do is post-training. It's not feeding data into the model that it's trained on. It's, \"We have this model GPT-5. Now here's all the things that's missing. Let's add to it.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:31:31):\nExactly, yeah. It's really unlocking, allowing the model to focus on all the right tokens, from pre-training all the right things in model context, up weighting the effective reasoning chains to enable the models to reason better in a more generalized way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):\nWhat's the scale of people just working on the stuff. It's like thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:31:53):\nTens of thousands at any given time, hundreds of thousands more generally. It's huge. And the most exciting thing is that it's growing really quickly. I think that to your question also about the competitive landscape, historically there were all these crowdsourcing companies that would get these super high volumes of low-skilled people. I think Scale and Surge were the primary companies that pioneered that industry. And then in this transition to higher-skilled labor, what people realized is that actually you can go a lot further with just getting higher caliber people even in smaller amounts initially, and now subsequently scaling that back up once they're able to meet the quality bar.\n\n(00:32:35):\nAnd I think that there's a bunch of companies that after our success and very rapid revenue growth that started early last year have chased after that, which makes sense. And seeing that the market was changing very quickly, we were taking off, and trying to pursue a similar thesis on the market.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:56):\nIt's interesting. There's always been these companies, AlphaSights and GLG, that did this before AI or is paid to connect to an expert and ask them questions about stuff. And essentially, okay, it turns out this is really useful for models. We don't need the person in the middle.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:33:11):\nExactly, yeah. Well, but one core difference is that AlphaSights would generally be a one-off call versus a lot of our work is really hiring people for projects of how do they work on something for a longer period of time. And so that's, I think, one of the reasons that some of the traditional expert networks have struggled to get into this. And also how do you retain those people and think about all the incentives where it actually looks more similar in some ways to one of the traditional labor marketplaces of an Uber or DoorDash, just with much higher-skilled talent that's treated exceptionally well?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:50):\nIt's such a good opportunity for me to learn so much about this, so I'm going to ask questions.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:33:55):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):\nIt's so interesting to me. How much of the experts are focused on specific concrete knowledge versus personality and softer skills? How much of it's like, \"Here's how you do an exam. Here's how you do an x-ray\"?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:34:09):\nIt depends on the lab. It's a lot of both. I think that previously it might've been more softer skills, but now a lot of the labs are focused on their business models of what are the economically valuable capabilities that drive revenue and leaning a lot into these professional domains. But I think the creative side is also still really important to everyone. And so we're seeing a meaningful amount of both. We hired all the people from the Harvard Lampoon a couple of months ago, their comedy club, to help with making models funnier. And so do all sorts of stuff like that, hiring Emmy award-winning screenwriters and everything across the board on creative capabilities that you'd look for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:51):\nThat is amazing. What a cool story. I'm excited for this to kick in. How fast do these things turn around? Say you hired this team, how fast are we going to see the impact potential? Is like months? Is it years?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:35:03):\nWell, so it depends, because some models or some labs will release iteratively where they'll just improve the model behind the scenes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:11):\nWithout announcing a new model?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:35:12):\nExactly. Every couple of weeks versus others do these big releases. And so it depends a lot. We're behind all of them, but we move really fast. It would be a customer gives us a request of we need these award-winning screenwriters, and within 24 hours we'll turn around the experts. And then there's also this really interesting dynamic where in a set of 100 people that we hire, oftentimes the top 10% of people will drive majority of the model improvement. It's like a company. If you have 100-person company, oftentimes the top 10% of the company will drive majority of the impact. And what that means is that when we're able to build proprietary advantages in identifying who are those top 10% of people, both in so far as how do we have them on our platform but also identify and match them effectively, it creates so much value for customers that it's difficult to compete against.\n\n(00:36:08):\nAnd so it really does tie back to the founding thesis of the company, which is how do we find these extraordinary people and identify them so that we can reliably deliver these top 10% or top 10X experiences for our customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:25):\nSo on that, so is the idea, you hire Jane. She's incredible at coding and she now works for Anthropic and that's her full-time job doing this? Or is this a part-time thing? Is this a project thing mostly?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:36:38):\nIt would sometimes be part-time. Sometimes it would be full-time. I would say most often it's part-time where it's like someone might work at a thing company where they're underemployed, maybe one of the ones that's moving slower where they have an extra 20 hours a week and then they're able to do this on the side or whatever the equivalent is across a bunch of different industries. But we also do a lot of 40 hour a week roles as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:08):\nAnd how much are they making? Is it meaningful enough for a AI engineer to spend time on this?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:37:13):\nYeah, very meaningful. So our median pay rate in the marketplace is $95 an hour, but it can flex up, well up into $500 an hour based on the depth of someone's expertise. And one thing that highlights this difference relative to a lot of the crowdsourcing companies is if you look at the economics of the crowdsourcing companies, oftentimes they would pay $30 an hour to town as the average. And so think about the people that you can hire, the undergrads for $30 now versus the Goldman bankers, the McKinsey analysts, the Fang software engineers. And ultimately it comes down to what are the capabilities that labs want their models to have? And it much more falls in the latter bucket than the former one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:02):\nI know there's only so much you can talk about with this stuff, but so Anthropic, Claude has been so good at coding so much better historically than other models. I also use it for writing, giving feedback on writing. What is it that allowed them to get so good at this and continue to be so good at this?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:38:19):\nWell, I can't go too much into detail about customer work, but I think that it's this trend of reinforcement learning and being very thoughtful about defining the right rewards that we're releasing across the board. And how we could mitigate reward hacking, set up the right rewards, that's super impactful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):\nEvals. Again, evals is all you need.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:38:44):\nBack to evals.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:45):\nYeah.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:38:45):\nOne of my favorite quotes from customers is that, \"Models are only as good as their evals,\" which has always held true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):\nI think Greg Brockman tweeted this once. \"Evals are all you need.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:38:56):\nYeah, truly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):\nLet's talk about Mercor a little bit more. One of the maybe, not even maybe, I believe the data tells us it's the fastest growing company in history.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:39:07):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:09):\nI want to understand what you did to make this happen. So let me just ask, what do you think are some of the core tenets of how you built Mercor that most contributed to being this successful?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:39:20):\nI think the most important thing is looking at the leading indicators in fast-moving markets. I remember when I used to think... Everyone in venture talks about the why now, and I used to think about the why now of how from a product standpoint, less from a market standpoint of now we can automate the way that we review resumes or the way that we conduct interviews, et cetera. But ultimately there is this legacy market that's has all these incumbents and it's relatively stagnant. But what matters a ton is actually figuring out what are the new markets, the new pockets of demand that are changing very quickly where the wealthiest customers in the world are willing to pay whatever it takes to improve model capabilities, and how do we focus on the leading indicators of those markets to make sure that we have the best solution for the flagship customers in the market and optimize everything around that.\n\n(00:40:18):\nAnd that's what I found has been most impactful in building the business. I think maybe that's one thing is leading indicators in markets. If I had to choose another, it's customer obsession. We have had for the last... We're starting to have a couple of product managers help out with go-to-market, but for the last year and a half of the business, we've had no one in sales and marketing. And so we're immature from a sales and marketing standpoint because we focused 100% of company resources on how do we build great products and experiences for our customers. Just getting word of mouth, the people that have worked with us at other businesses want to keep working with us and leaning into creating those great experiences. And so that's where I spend all my time. And I think that some founders can get caught up in how do they get really good at marketing before they've figured out the thing that really drives a lot of customer love and creates the six-star experiences that you're used to building.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:19):\nI'm going to go back to that first point, which is like, okay, you found this pocket, maybe the biggest business opportunity in history. How did you first find... What was that moment of, \"Wait, this could be really big\"?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:41:31):\nSo there's some crazy stories here. I remember we started the company as I mentioned in January 2023. And then in August 2023 when I was still in college, one of our customers introduced us to the co-founders of xAI over a Zoom call saying how we had these really smart Indian software engineers that were great at math and coding. So we met them and we explained how the software engineers we had were really good at math and coding because they weren't distracted by all the humanities. They didn't have to study history and English and all these other things, and they loved it. So they had us in two days later to the Tesla office and we met the entire xAI co-founding team except for Elon, while I was still a college student. And xAI was just getting started at that point and they were super excited about our focus on the quality of the experts.\n\n(00:42:22):\nAnd so while they were still doing pre-training, they weren't ready for human data at the time and we didn't start working with them at that point. We just knew from that point forward before we even dropped out that the market was about to change radically and we needed to be at the frontier of that. And so then fast-forward a few months, one of the crowdsourcing players came to us and actually used our platform to hire over 1,000 people where this is very interesting experience because we started getting flooded with support tickets about how those people weren't getting paid. And we obviously felt horrible because we had referred them to this opportunity. It was this reputable company. And we realized that a lot of the incumbents were resting on their laurels with respect to what was needed in the experiences they were creating for talent in their marketplaces to help improve models. And there was this opportunity to work directly with the labs in a way that kept the dignity of the experts in the marketplace, paid them extremely well, and cut out the middlemen.\n\n(00:43:31):\nAnd so we started doing that in May of last year, and then the rest is history.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:37):\nWow, okay. Hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue since. So what I'm hearing here is you were very open to looking for poll. You saw some poll, you explored it. And then once you saw that there was something really meaningful there, you just went deep on making that an incredible experience as amazing as possible.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:43:57):\nExactly. I think if I had to distill it into advice for founders, one thing I've realized is that I spent a lot of time trying forced product-market fit. And in some ways you should be persistent. You should have these theses that you have conviction about how the world will change. But sometimes you just need to sheer it from the market and know that it's there, the poll, to know the right places to focus. Because if it's difficult to sell, if it's extremely difficult to sell the marginal customer, you're not going to be able to grow a huge business. What you actually need to find is the customer that's surprisingly easy to sell into where you're going to be able to grow with them. You know that it's a large pain point. And so it's some combination of being stubborn with respect to your thesis around how the world will change, but also very open-minded with respect to exactly what form that takes and how the market's developing and how your company will fit into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:55):\nThat's an amazing insight. In the moments you described, felt like it was a combination of this xAI meeting feeling like, \"Oh wow, they really, really want this thing that we have. We're now doing an amazing job,\" and then it's 1,000 people hiring in the platform. Was that those two moments that are like, \"Wow\"?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:45:09):\nExactly. And those happened, keep in mind, while we were a seed company, right? Well, so the first one was before we even raised any seed funding, we were totally bootstrapped because we bootstrapped the company to a million dollar revenue run rate and have always remained super capital-efficient. We've never burned money. We were lifetime profitable. And then we raised our seed round in September from General Catalyst, and it was the other experience after we raised our seed round where we really knew that there was an enormous amount of demand in this market where we saw the volume and we saw that the incumbents were sleeping with respect to how the market was changing and the kinds of people that were needed to make that change happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:50):\nIt's one thing to see this opportunity and start to execute on it. It's another to actually succeed at this scale and consistently win. You guys have very specific values within the business. Talk about those. It feels like that's a big part of your success too.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:46:04):\nIt totally is. So I'll give the three and maybe a brief story associated with each of them.\n\n(00:46:10):\nSo the first one is having a can-do attitude, which everyone gives me a little bit of a hard time for because it's a funny saying, but we've always set these ridiculously ambitious goals, and then somehow the trajectory of the company forms around those goals. Where I remember when we were talking to Benchmark before they led our Series A, we were at 1.5 million in run rate. And I said we'd be at 50 million in run rate by the end of the year. And they said we were absolutely insane, right, as anyone would. And plus or minus two weeks, we hit it. And then we've now well blown past the tracking to 500 million in run rate, which was initially our goal for this year. So setting these incredibly ambitious goals with respect to the revenue scale of the business, the caliber of experiences for talent, all those dimensions is super important to first have a can-do attitude.\n\n(00:47:04):\nThe second thing is really high standards, which is who we hire and what we expect of them. We have an incredibly high hiring bar where we hire tons of former founders, people that have incredible experiences. We just hired or partnered with Sundeep Jain who joined us as president. He was previously the chief product officer and chief technology officer at Uber and joined our relatively small in the grand scheme of things company to help scale up all the processes where Uber is of course the largest labor marketplace in the world. So super high standards is of paramount importance.\n\n(00:47:41):\nAnd then the third one that we really lean on significantly is intensity. And that if you look at the early cultures of the legendary companies, thinking of Meta or Google, they have these incredible, intense early-stage cultures of people just moving heaven and earth and doing whatever it takes to push the frontier of model capabilities. And so still very much output-oriented of what do people achieve rather than input-oriented of the specific hours they work, but recognizing that it takes a lot to build a legendary business, and that's ultimately what we're optimizing for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:18):\nI could see why this works. Can-do attitude plus high standards plus intensity, I could see how that leads to success. There's a lot of talk these days about this 6-9-9 culture, working six days a week, 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. A lot of people are like, \"Why? That's terrible. Why would you make people do that?\" But at the same time, I'm just constantly hearing this from the most successful AI companies. This is just the way it is to be successful. Things are moving so fast. This is an opportunity you'll never see again. Just talk about your thoughts on that.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:48:50):\nYeah. Well, to clarify, we've never mandated hours. It's more been a byproduct of people that care a lot where we care a lot about the trajectory of the business. And so a lot of people come into the office and stay late. But if they need to leave early and get dinner with their kids or travel on the weekend, of course that's totally fine. And for us, it's much more about finding people who have a lot of ownership and are really bought in, less so about the specific hours in the office, even though we found that oftentimes it's the people that are most bought in, not always, but oftentimes it's the people that are most bought in and that burn the midnight oil with us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:30):\nWhen you say high standards, is there something you could share that gives us an example of what you mean there? Because a lot of people think they have high standards and they don't.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:49:37):\nIf you are very patient, there's always some trade-off between speed and quality when hiring. And I remember especially for our first 10 people, we were just so patient and disciplined about finding some of the best people in the world. Half of them are... Our second employee, Sid, as an example, our second employee in the US, Sid was previously the head of growth at Scale who joined us when we were a seed stage company. Daniel who joined us was previously scaled to consumer apps to over 100,000 users and all sorts of just extraordinary backgrounds of our first 10 hires. And I think that that initial talent density shaped so much of what the rest of the org looks like as you scale it up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:28):\nI know you also have this perspective that people talk about waiting to hire, to hire really slowly, but it's actually not necessarily the right advice. Talk about that.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:50:39):\nIt's painful because it's a double-edged sword. On one hand, I'm thrilled that our first 10 people are so phenomenal and I think that that has paid dividends for the business. But on the other hand, I think that companies do get to the point where you just need to hire really fast. And there's some things where you need a lot of people to do them and you need to recognize that there's going to be some variants associated with hiring, but moving quickly is the priority.\n\n(00:51:07):\nAnd I think that in some ways, we move too slowly with how we scaled out the team. And so the benefit is that everyone is extraordinary. We have this super high bar and we want to maintain that over time. But I think the downside is that while the company has grown incredibly quickly, we likely could have grown even faster if we had moved a little bit more quickly with especially ramping from call, like 10 to 100 people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:37):\nOkay, I was going to ask. So it sounds like the first 10, be very careful, take your time, 10 to 100, maybe speed up a bit.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:51:44):\nYes, though I wouldn't say it's necessarily 10. It's determined by the point where you know it's really working. And I know that's still not a bright line, but it's like once you know that there's so much more demand than you can handle, that's when you want to step on the gas and optimize for speed in a lot of ways. But I think especially until then, it's important to be patient, be disciplined. Get the best people is always important, but speed becomes more important once you find the market opportunity, the market vacuum.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:20):\nI know you've started a couple companies in the past, much smaller scale. In this new role as CEO of this massive hyper growth company, what surprised you most about where you spend the time most or just what the role involves? Because a lot of people want to start companies dream about being in your shoes. What are they maybe not understanding about where a lot of your time goes?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:52:42):\nYeah, it's actually not too surprising. The top two buckets are always working on hiring and time with customers of how do I really deeply understand what customers need and how we can support them? And then how do I build the team and a lot of the processes around that? Of course, there's all of the ad hoc things I didn't expect of dealing with the people questions of how do we set up our levels and our comp bands and all of that, which you learn as you scale a business. But I think that the core places that I spend my time are in line with what I expected as well as what I love doing, which is very fortunate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:27):\nSo these two companies you've started in the past, maybe share what they work because they're fun, and then how do they help you be successful in this? What's something that they taught you that helped you in your current role?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:53:38):\nYeah, so there's been like a dozen, but I'll choose my favorite two. So when I was in eighth grade, I started Donut Dynasty where I saw that Safeway Donuts were selling for $5 a dozen, and I was amazed because I felt like as an eighth grader, this was such an incredible deal. And I started to bike down to Safeway, buy Safeway Donuts for $5 a dozen, and then go back to my middle school and then sell them for $2 each, running really good margins of course. It sold out super quickly. And so then I need to scale up. So I would pay my mom $20 to drive me in her minivan down to Safeway, buy 10 dozen donuts, go to my middle school, sell them all out.\n\n(00:54:19):\nAnd then the school tried to shut me down because I was selling food on school campus, which they didn't like. So they had me in the principal's office asking me to not do that. And then I moved my donut stand over 50 feet, so it was off school campus, saying that they could no longer police me. I remember we had competitors pop up where the competitors were charging. They bought these Chuck's Donuts, which if anyone in the Bay Area knows, are higher end donuts than Safeway Donuts, but they have a higher cost basis. They cost a dollar per. And so I dropped my prices to $1 for two weeks to run them out of business before I knew what anti-competitive practices were. And I'd hire all my friends, paying my friends in donuts because they perceived the donuts as $2 each where they could sell them throughout the school and I could have a lower cost basis on them.\n\n(00:55:12):\nSo I had all of these fun experiences in selling donuts, and then I could talk more about my high school business as well, which was a more significant scale. But I think the takeaway from that was just like you can just do things. So many people have ideas, but the barrier to more companies being built, I think, is just initiative and taking the steps to build the product or experience that customers want and investing the time and the ambition to scale that up. And so I think it was really getting reps of that that enabled me to realize that I should do it later on at a much larger scale.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:51):\nAmazing story. I love how wholesome that is versus drugs, selling donuts.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:55:56):\nThen my mom was very worried. She was like, \"Oh, is there any pot of these donuts?\" I was like, \"No, mom, I assure you these are pure donuts.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:05):\nI love that you paid your mom $20 to drive.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:56:07):\nYeah. She was adamant it couldn't be a handout that she was taking her time to drive me, so she needed to make a little bit of money off of it. We haggled over her title where eventually she wanted to be head of global operations, which we found very entertaining.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:22):\nI hope that's on her LinkedIn.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:56:24):\nNot yet. Maybe she'll have to add it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:27):\nSo you said that you've started a dozen companies?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:56:29):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:29):\nWow. Okay.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:56:30):\nWell, a dozen projects, but I think it was that, and then my AWS company were the two that I scaled up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:39):\nWhat's the story behind Mercor as the name?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:56:42):\nMercor means marketplace in Latin or to buy, sell, trade. And we want to build the largest marketplace in the world, the marketplace for how everyone finds jobs, and that was really the draw to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:55):\nOkay, maybe a last question. This is going back to earlier in discussion because it's something I've been thinking about as we're talking. There's been this shift from data as the fuel for models, and now it's experts. Do you think there's a next step, or is this just will take us to AGI, superintelligence?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:57:15):\nI don't think it's necessarily changing from data to experts. It's more just the paradigm of realizing that labs need this close collaboration with experts to help understand what are the evals that they're building and how can they push the frontier. But I think it's very clear that evals are evergreen, that so long as we want to improve models, we'll need experts to create evals for them and to create the post-training data for them to learn those capabilities. And of course there might be changes in the exact way that people do training with RL or otherwise, but they will always need an eval to measure what does success look like across every domain that they want to build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:01):\nOkay. So then building on that, a question that comes up a lot these days is, and I know we're talking about fun stuff but I'm getting to serious stuff again, scaling laws and just progression of model intelligence. A lot of people are feeling like, \"I don't know, it's slowing down. We're not going to really get to superintelligence at this rate.\" What is your sense?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:58:21):\nI totally agree with that. I know there's been some executives to big labs that say we'll have superintelligence in three years, but I think the truth is that it's a longer road. And that's not to diminish from how extraordinary the models are. I think we'll be able to automate a majority of knowledge work tasks in the next 10 years for sure, but that long road is paved with all of the evals that help to make those capabilities possible. And it's not going to be 10X more pre-training data that gets those capabilities. It's much more going to be all of the post-training data sets that are far more data-efficient and thoughtful that help us get there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:05):\nDavid Sachs tweeted this interesting point that the situation we're now is almost the best case scenario where AI is not in this fast takeoff to superintelligence. There's a lot of competitors keeping each other in check. Models are already very valuable and only getting valuable, more valuable, but there's not just this winner superintelligence taking over the world situation.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:59:26):\nYeah, I think that's true. I think a lot of the super intelligence fearmongering is probably overrated, but at the same time a lot of people's framing around that is even if there is a 5 to 10% chance of this P-Doom, then we should be careful, which seems logical. But I think that it's going to be an extraordinary 10 years for all of Silicon Valley and all of the world as this technology is able to create abundance and giving everyone better medical treatment, the best access to legal recommendations, and the ability to build great products more than we've ever seen before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:06):\nAnd education feels like is transforming.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:00:08):\nAbsolutely, right. I even have felt bits of this over the last 10 years where I remember ever... My parents would give me a hard time for not going to classes in college and I'd be like, well, there's way better lectures on YouTube. Why not just listen there? But I can only imagine as the models get extremely good at conveying information, better than the best professor, what that'll mean and access to all sorts of information to better forward humanity and upskill everyone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):\nSo I'll use that as a segue to a final question. I'm going to take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on the podcast. What's some way that you personally use AI to do better work to help you in life?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:00:52):\nWell, let's see. I use it a lot to write documents, as you would expect. I also talk to get advice on problems. I find it helpful to just reason through almost as a thought partner because, yeah, I don't know. I find I think better sometimes when I'm talking something through, but I can't talk through everything with colleagues or people around me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:15):\nAnd so this is like ChatGPT Voice Mode mostly or something else.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:01:16):\nYeah, I like ChatGPT Voice Mode a lot. There's stuff-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):\nMe too.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:01:21):\n... or room for improvement, but I am very excited about the future of Voice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):\nLet me show you something I built, actually. I wasn't planning to talk about this, but there's this guy, Eric Antonow, who's been recommended by a lot of people to get him on this podcast. He's this creative product person that's under the radar now. He's at Facebook for a long time. He built this project called Pirate GPT, which is you basically put ChatGPT into a stuffed animal to talk to it. So built a little wise owl. I don't have it on right now.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:01:25):\nWow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:49):\nBut basically you sew in a little speaker right here and you put a little magnet underneath and you can put it on your shoulder and then you just talk to it.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:01:57):\nThat's so cute. Wow. I love it. I'll have to get one of those. Because I have some of the voice assistants in my apartment, but I really want a ChatGPT voice assistant, so I'm excited for-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:07):\nI was just thinking that. Yeah, just come on. Why can't we have a ChatGPT voice just sitting around listening to us all the time. And you can't on your phone because it goes to sleep and it's like, \"Hello, what?\"\n\nBrendan Foody (01:02:17):\nExactly. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:18):\nYeah, so it's what this is trying to be. Well, there's a kickstarter he started that we'll link to that. You could help out.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:02:22):\nThere we go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:23):\nThat's really easy.\n\n(01:02:25):\nBrendan, is there anything else that you wanted to share or touch on or maybe leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lighting round?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:02:32):\nTying to the point around initiative and that you can just do things, I encourage everyone, especially with AI and it being so much easier to build, just take the initiative to go out and build products and talk with customers and take that leap of faith because I think that that is in so many ways, the largest barrier to more innovation, the economy in any way that we can support that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):\nYeah. There's so many people that just, let's not bash the podcast, but just listen to podcasts, read posts, just keep reading and listening and don't do anything with that information. And there's never been an easier time to actually build stuff and try stuff.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:03:12):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:12):\nSo definitely take that advice. Just you can do things. You can move your donut stand 50 feet and get out of their jurisdiction.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:03:21):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:21):\nOkay, Brendan, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:03:26):\nAll set.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:27):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:03:31):\nLet's see. I would say in order, High Output Management is a phenomenal book on running companies. Second is Zero to One, which of course is a classic. And then third is Shoe Dog, where I just find it to be a really inspirational story.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:46):\nWhat is a recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:03:49):\nI really liked Oppenheimer. My favorite TV show of all time is Suits, so I know not recent, but if I had to choose a recent one, probably Oppenheimer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):\nVery cool. Suits, first time someone's mentioned that. Favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:04:05):\nI love using Codex, like the new version. I know it's sort of new in terms of version. Yeah, I think it's incredible and just a huge, huge improvement. So yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:19):\nDo you have a life motto that you find yourself coming back to, sharing with folks, finding useful in work or in life?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:04:25):\nI think it's you can just do stuff, what we were talking about earlier. Take the leap of faith.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):\nI thought you were going to say can do, which is in your Twitter profile.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:04:34):\nCan do as well, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:36):\nTwo great ones. Final question. So we were chatting before this about things that we could talk about and you shared this interesting thing that you haven't shared anywhere else, which is that you're dyslexic. Why don't you share that with folks? And just how do you get around that having built the fastest-growing company in history?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:04:55):\nI don't hide it at all. I think a lot of my colleagues know. And I think on one hand it definitely makes it difficult to go through 1,000 emails a day or read every document that I'm supposed to, but on the other hand, I feel like it helps me to think a little bit differently, to be more creative, and perhaps see that markets are changing that not everyone sees. And so it's turned out okay so far. And so I think one thing it's helped me realize from a management standpoint is that we focus much more on how we can leverage people's strengths rather than helping to improve weaknesses, because there's some things that I'm not great at and I'll never be the best in the world at, and there's others that I can hopefully refine and strive to be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:46):\nThat's such a also recurring theme on this podcast of just focusing on strengths and not focusing over all your focus on weaknesses.\n\n(01:05:53):\nBrendan, this was incredible. I learned so much. I have a billion more questions, but you got shit to do. Two final questions. What should people know about what you're doing and roles you're hiring for? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:06:06):\nAbsolutely. We're hiring a ton across the board on our team. We're hiring strategic project leads on our operations team, software engineers in our engineering team, as well as researchers. And so please go to mercor.com and we would love to work with you, and that's the largest way that you can help us. Share it with your friends as well. Over half of people in our marketplace come from referrals because we have a platform of people that love us. And so any jobs that you want to apply to or send your friends to, we would love to have you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:37):\nBrendan, thank you so much for joining me.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:06:39):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:41):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:06:43):\nThank you so much for listening.

You are a co-CEO of Salesforce, you're chairman of the board at OpenAI. How do you think the AI market is going to play out?\n\nBret Taylor (00:00:07):\nThe whole market is going to go towards agents. I think the whole market is going to go towards outcomes-based pricing. It's just so obviously the correct way to build and sell software.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):\nThis makes me think about, I had Marc Benioff on the podcast. You guys were co-CEOs. He was extremely agent-pilled.\n\nBret Taylor (00:00:21):\nIt's so hard to sell productivity software, which I learned the hard way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):\nWhat's a story that comes to mind when you think about your biggest mistake?\n\nBret Taylor (00:00:27):\nI was the product manager for, it was called Google Local had a pretty tough product review with Marissa and Larry, and to not do that well with a link from the Google homepage is embarrassing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):\nI think it's really empowering for people to hear it's possible to succeed in spite of a massive failure like this.\n\nBret Taylor (00:00:41):\nThey gave me another shot to do the V2 of it that resulted in Google Maps. We got about 10 million people using it on the first day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):\nWhat mindset contributed to you being successful in such a variety of roles?\n\nBret Taylor (00:00:52):\nWaking up every morning, what is the most impactful thing I could do today?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):\nToday, my guest is Bret Taylor. Bret is an absolute legendary builder and founder. He co-created Google Maps at Google. He co-founded the social network, FriendFeed invented the like button and the real-time newsfeed, which he sold to Facebook. He then became CTO at Facebook. He then started a productivity company called Quip, which he sold to Salesforce for $750 million. He then became co-CEO of Salesforce. He's also currently chairman of the board at OpenAI. At one point he was chairman of the board at Twitter. Today, co-founder and CEO of Sierra an AI started building agent to help companies with customer service sales and more.\n\n(00:01:32):\nIn our conversation, we cover so much ground, including what skills and mindsets have most helped Bret be so successful in so many roles, why we're all still sleeping on the impact that agents are going to have on the business world. How coding is going to change in the coming years, where the biggest opportunities remain for startups, lessons on pricing and go-to-market in AI, the story behind the like button and so much more. This is a truly epic conversation with a legendary builder.\n\n(00:01:57):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

There's so much that I want to talk about. You've done so many incredible things over the course of your career. Just boggles the mind, the things that you've done, and we're going to talk about a lot of that sort of stuff, but I want to actually start with the opposite. I want to talk about a time that you messed up, a time that you screwed up in a big way. We have this recurring segment on the podcast called Fail Corner, and so, I thought it'd be fun to just start there before we get into all the great stuff you've done. What's a story that comes to mind when you think about maybe your biggest mistake in building a product?\n\nBret Taylor (00:04:43):\nIt may not be the biggest, but it was my first prominent mistake as a product manager at Google. So for me, it feels big because it was very formative for me as a product designer. So I joined Google in late 2002, early 2003, and I was one of the earliest associate product managers at the company and first, was working on the search system, essentially expanding our index from 1 billion webpages to 10 billion, which was a big deal at the time. It seems quaint now. Then I did a decent job and so my boss, Marissa Meyer, gave me the opportunity to lead a new product initiative, which was a big bet on me and it was both an opportunity to do something for Google, but I was also being pretty scrutinized just as a young new product manager and the premise given to me was work on local search.\n\n(00:05:40):\nAt the time, the Yellow Pages was still dominant and well, Google was really good at searching the web. It wasn't really good for finding a plumber or a restaurant just because it wasn't really a huge part of the internet at the time. So this content wasn't necessarily on the internet and even if it was, you didn't really want to find plumbers in Manhattan, you wanted to find plumbers in San Francisco, if you're me. And so it was both a technical problem and a product problem and a content problem.\n\n(00:06:11):\nWe launched the first version of that product that I was the product manager for, was called Google Local and it was, I'll be a little bit more critical now than I might've been at the time, but it was a little bit of a me too version of Yahoo Yellow Pages, essentially grafting on Yellow Pages search on top of Google Search and with a properly crafted query you could see those listings at the top of your search results but a standalone site at local.google.com. Actually, it was an important enough initiative that actually, there was on the Google homepage, it had Web, Images and Local was up there as well, so it's got top bill.\n\n(00:06:54):\nI mean you could put almost any link on the Google homepage and get a lot of traffic to it. And despite that, it didn't do that well and to not do that well with a link from the Google homepage is embarrassing. There's not much one can do more than giving you that kind of traffic to give you an add that as a product leader or a product manager. And the product was fine, it worked, but it really wasn't differentiated. And in many ways, I think, again, I think I've had these reflections more sense than at the time, that I had some of the time, but why use this instead of Yahoo Yellow Pages? But more than anything else, why use this instead of the Yellow Pages? It was a digital version of something that had come before. Had a pretty tough product review with Marissa and Larry and others and it was fine. I wasn't about to get fired or something, but it was, I don't know, the shine on my reputation was waning a little bit.\n\n(00:07:52):\nAnd they gave me another shot to do a V2 of it and I got the impression it wasn't like my last shot, but I certainly was feeling a little dejected from going from a hot shot, new PM to a new thing. So, we spent a lot of time thinking about how can you make something that's just much more compelling and not just a digital version of the Yellow Pages and not just so similar to some of the other products out there. And that ended up being the thread that we pulled that resulted in Google Maps. We had licensed from MapQuest, the ability to put this little map next to the search results, it was always the ugliest part of the product and we always made these backhanded comments about it internally and we spent a lot of time saying, what if we inverted the hierarchy here and made the map the canvas?\n\n(00:08:49):\nWe ended up finding Lars and Jens Rasmussen who had been working on this Windows mapping product and we got them into the company and started exploring this space and it ended up where, through that exploration we ended up integrating a lot of different products. We ended up integrating mapping local search, driving directions, like all of these products at the time were actually separate product categories and ended up with something that redefined the industry and certainly my career. But it took, I think for me as a product leader, it changed the way I think about product just because there's feature and functionality and then there's like why should I use this thing in the first place? And it was notable, there was a couple of interesting moments.\n\n(00:09:34):\nWhen we launched Google Maps we got about 10 million people using it on the first day, which at that scale of the internet at the time was huge. And then in August of 2005, we integrated satellite imagery from a recent acquisition called Keyhole, which became Google Earth and we got 90 million people using it on the same day. Everyone wanted to look at the top of their house when the imagery came out. And it was really interesting because there's so many subtle product lessons in there. First is, I think as you have these new technologies, rather than literally digitizing what came before, if you can create an entirely new experience, it answers the question for a new customer, why should I give this the time of day? And so, really disassembling the Lego set and reassembling into something new rather than just digitizing what was there before. Certainly, that was the lesson I think in Google Maps, really was native to the platform in a way that a paper map couldn't be and that was a really meaningful breakthrough.\n\n(00:10:35):\nAnd then with satellite imagery, it honestly wasn't the most important part of Google Maps, but it was the sizzle to the steak and it created, I don't think the term viral was a thing people said back then, but it created a viral moment. We were on Saturday Night Live, which is the coolest thing. Andy Samberg in, I think it was called Lazy Sunday rapped about Google Maps and Lars and I were texting each other. We did it. We're on Saturday Live. Mission accomplished. And it was also showing that as you're there thinking about products, there's the why you decide to use a product and then what is the enduring value. And those are deeply related but not all the same thing. And I just learned so many lessons that I took with me for every subsequent product that I worked on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):\nThat is an awesome story. One I think it's really empowering for people to hear, even you Bret, who I'm going to share all the successes you've had, have had a massive failure with the CEO of Google [inaudible 00:11:30] just like Bret, you screwed up. And it was such a big bet. So one, just it's possible to succeed as you have succeeded in spite of a massive failure like this. And then some of the product lessons you shared, just to highlight a few of these things because I think this is great, is just you will often not win if you just make something that's a better copy of something else, what you want to look for is something that is an entirely new experience, something that's differentiated, something that's a lot more compelling. Let's flip to talk about what you've learned from actually being very successful at a lot of things.\n\n(00:12:02):\nSo I was looking at your resume and you basically have been very successful at every level of the career ladder and in such a huge variety of roles. So let me just read a few of these things for folks that aren't super familiar with your background. You were CTO of Meta, you were co-CEO of Salesforce, you're also CPO and COO at Salesforce. At Google, you joined as an associate product manager where you famously, you didn't mention this but you rebuilt Google Maps on weekend. We're not going to talk about that. You're chairman of the board at OpenAI. You were chairman of the board at Twitter. You've also founded three different companies, one social network, one productivity docs company called Quip, and now, Sierra. Fun fact, at FriendFeed you invented the like button and I don't know if people know that and also just the newsfeed, I'll just throw that out there to give you some credit.\n\n(00:12:50):\nSo you're basically an associate product manager, an IC product manager, an engineer, CPO, COO, CTO, CEO of three different companies including a public company. Very rare that somebody is successful at all these types of roles and all these levels. So, let me just ask you this question. What mindsets or habits or just ways of working have you worked on building in yourself that you think have most contributed to you being successful in such a variety of roles and levels?\n\nBret Taylor (00:13:19):\nYeah. It's actually something I am proud of. I like the fact I've worn different hats. It's actually amusing when I meet colleagues that I've known from one of those jobs, they'll often think of me through the lens of that job. And so, I'll go to meet folks from Facebook and they think of me largely as an engineer. I'll meet folks from Google, they think me largely as a product person. At Salesforce, a lot of the folks there interacted with me as like a, lack of a better word, a suit, the boss. And I'm not sure they think of me as an engineer at all, even though I was still probably coding on the weekends for fun. And one of the things that is a principle for me is to have a really flexible view of my own identity. I probably would self-describe as an engineer, but more broadly I think of myself as a builder and I like to build products and I think companies are one of the most effective ways to build products.\n\n(00:14:17):\nThere's also things like open source, but I think I'm a huge believer in the confluence of technology and capitalism to produce just incredible outcomes for customers. And as a consequence, I think to really build something of significance, I think to be a great founder, you really need to be able to not have such a ossified view of your identity that you can't transform into what the company needs you to be at that point. And every founder you'll talk to, one day, I think selling is a big part of being a founder. You have to sell investors on wanting to invest in your company. You have to sell candidates on wanting to work at your company. You have to sell customers to want to use the product that your customer produces. You have to have good design taste, not just for your product but for your marketing and essentially, soliciting your customers.\n\n(00:15:09):\nYou have to have good engineering. If you're building a technology company, the technology comes first. It's why this industry is so transformative. I probably credit, and I've told this story before, but I'm very grateful for her, but I probably credit Sheryl Sandberg for really changing the way I approach new jobs. The story, and I might be embellishment a little bit, but I think it's broadly accurate. So I had just become the chief technology officer of Facebook and when I first got the job, it was the flavor of CTO or that relatively small group reporting into me, but contributed almost as a very senior architect on a number of projects. And then at some point, Mark Zuckerberg reorganized the company and split it into a bunch of different groups. I ended up with a very large group, 100 under me and I was essentially running our platform and mobile groups, products, design engineering.\n\n(00:16:10):\nSo I went from a handful of reports to, I don't know, over 1,000 or something. It was a big group. And it was the largest management job. I had become a manager at Google, but a modest team. And so, I was doing okay but not great. And I had this moment where Sheryl saw me, I think I was editing a presentation for a partner just because the presentation I got didn't meet my quality bar and I was editing it and griping about it. She pulled me into a room and gave me talking to a little bit about holding my team to as high of a standard as I have. If someone wasn't meeting my expectations, what was my plan to manage them out of the company or... Just giving me management one-on-one.\n\n(00:16:57):\nAnd she's a remarkable mentor in the sense she can give you feedback that's very direct and often, a bit uncomfortable, but you know she cares about you. And so it was the type of feedback you listen to. I went home that night and I was stewing on it and not very happy. I was like, you get naturally a little defensive in those moments. Is that really true? Am I really fucking it up or is she overreacting? And then I woke up the next day, I was like, \"No, she's right.\" And I had realized this subconscious limiter that was limiting my success in the job, which is, I was trying to conform the job to the things I thought I liked to do. So, I was spending a lot of my time on some product and technology things that I was passionate about, thinking I'm the boss. I should focus on what I want to focus on instead of thinking about, okay, I'm running the mobile and platform teams at Facebook. What's the most important thing to do today to make our mobile and developer platform successful?\n\n(00:18:03):\nAnd when I reframed the job that way, I did different things. And the thing that was the biggest pleasant surprise to me was I liked it. I thought I liked engineering and product, but in fact, when I changed an organization and it turned out to be more successful, I derived a great deal of joy from seeing that success. Our developer platform had a lot of partners and when there was an issue there and I'd spend time on partnerships and it worked and our platform became healthier, the partner became more successful. I took pride in that success and then I just started being better at my job and I realized that the actual act of engineering or product design or all the things I thought I liked, what I really liked is impact.\n\n(00:18:49):\nAnd so, that conversation led to my waking up every morning, sometimes literally, but certainly, in the broadest sets of the words saying, \"What is the most impactful thing I can do today?\" And really thinking almost like, if you had an external board of advisors telling you what are the things where if you focus on them, you can maximize the likelihood that what you're trying to achieve will happen? Sometimes, it's recruiting, sometimes, it's product, sometimes, it's engineering, sometimes, it's sales. And I've become much more self-reflective just about what is important to work on. And I have become much more receptive to doing things that I previously would've said aren't my favorite things to do because I derive so much joy from having an impact that I enjoy a lot more things now. And so, I really credit Sheryl, I'm so grateful. And actually, it's interesting, I think a lot about this when I give feedback to people now, just those moments that can change the trajectory of your career. I give her all the credit for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:53):\nThere's so many people that share stories of Sheryl Sandberg giving them advice and that changing their life. What a mensch.\n\nBret Taylor (00:20:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):\nMy biggest takeaway from this, which is this question of what is the most impactful thing I could do today? Such a powerful heuristic just to keep in mind. To your point, you may realize you don't want to be doing sales or hiring, but if that's the most impactful thing and you end up doing it, you may realize I like this and I'm good at this and have thought about-\n\nBret Taylor (00:20:18):\nCan I double click on that though for a second?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:19):\nAbsolutely.\n\nBret Taylor (00:20:20):\nI think it's really hard. One of the dangers for founders and product managers, but I think particularly for founders is incorrect storytelling. People don't like my product because of X. And if you tell that to yourself and you tell it to your team, all of a sudden, it goes from being an intuition to being a fact. Well, you better hope you're right because if you orient your strategy around fixing a problem and you're wrong, your company's going to fail. So why did you lose a deal? You could talk to the salesperson who is on the account or perhaps maybe a product manager was involved in the conversation. It's very important to have intellectual honesty in those moments because you could say something like, \"Oh, they didn't buy it because the platform cost too much.\" And that's something a salesperson might say.\n\n(00:21:16):\nMaybe the real reason is they didn't actually see much value in your platform. So it was communicated to the salesperson as it was too expensive. But in fact, the problem was product differentiation. And you could end up going into a discussion on pricing when in fact, there was a much deeper, much harder problem to solve there. But just like when you break up with someone, you don't say, it's because I don't like you anymore. You say it's not you, it's me. You say all these pleasantries because we're all social animals and you want to be pleasant with the people around you. So literally taking what a customer says or what a user says in a focus group or a usability study is rarely correct. It often is related to what the truth is, but it's very important to get right. And so, I think one of the things I've observed with first time founders in particular is you're often a single issue voter based on your skillset.\n\n(00:22:14):\nSo if you're a great engineer, the answer to almost every problem in your business is engineering. If you're a product designer, the answer almost to the proverbial redesign, I joke, it's like the dead cap balance of a consumer product like this next redesign will fix all of our problems. I don't know if it's ever, ever worked. And then I met a lot of entrepreneurs who come from a business development background, they're always thinking about partnerships and oh, if we just get this partnership done for this distribution channel, everything's going to change. And I think it's really important when you're a founder to be self-aware that you will naturally, subconsciously pick the thing that is your strength, your superpower as a solution to more problems. And in fact, if you think that's a solution to your problem, it may be right, but you probably by default should question it.\n\n(00:23:03):\nIf you think the thing that you've been doing your whole career is the way to fix your problem, it's at least 30% likely that you've chosen that because of comfort and familiarity not truth. And so, I think one of the skills I think is, it really goes around to do you have a good co-founder? Do you have a good leadership team? If you're a product manager, you're a partner in engineering, you're a partner in marketing, you really want to have very real conversations to ensure that you're actually working on the actual correct thing. And I think it's easy to say what's the most impactful thing to do today? My guess, if a lot of people try that, they'll lie to themselves more often than not. And it's a very challenging question to answer. The question's interesting. Being able to answer it accurately is actually the hard part.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:50):\nThis feels like such an important lesson you've learned. Is there an example that comes to mind where you learned this the hard way where you actually ended up-\n\nBret Taylor (00:23:57):\nOh, yeah. You just want to spend this whole thing on my failures, but I'm fine with that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:02):\nYou've had too much success.\n\nBret Taylor (00:24:04):\nFrontier was my first company. At our peak we had 12 employees, 12 of the best people I've ever worked with. Started the company with Jim Norris, who's an engineer I've known since Stanford and Paul Buhite and Sanjeev Singh who Paul started Gmail. Sanjeev was the first engineer at Gmail, so we had the Google Maps people and Gmail people. It was a pretty awesome founding team. We made a social network, as you said. We invented a lot of concepts that became popular in the newsfeed. We invented the like button. It was really neat. It was a fun time. We were only really popular in Turkey, Italy and Iran, and at one point, we were blocked in Iran, so we were only popular in Turkey and Italy and Silicon Valley. To this day, actually a lot of folks in Silicon Valley are like, \"I love FriendFeed.\" I'm like, that's awesome.\n\n(00:24:51):\nIt wasn't really a successful business. We were a follower-oriented social network, not a friendship-oriented social network, which meant a lot of our content was more like X or Twitter than it is Facebook in that respect. And a lot of sharing newspaper articles, interests, scientific communities, things like that. And there was a period when Twitter, which was one of our competitors at the time, that there was a lot more social networks at the time. I am probably screwing this up a little bit. I think Obama, Ashton Kutcher and Oprah Winfrey all went on Twitter in a summer and we just got our ass kicked.\n\n(00:25:31):\nAnd it was a great example of you... I think 11 of those 12 people were engineers and we were just making product and I think it was Biz Stone. If you talk to the Twitter folks, they could give you the history on this, but I think Biz was really focused on getting celebrities and public figures onto Twitter, which is totally obvious. If you have a social service that's oriented towards following people, put some people on there worth following and instead, we were exclusively focused on polishing the product.\n\n(00:26:00):\nAnd we actually, I think at our peak of popularity, we were very confident just, I think it was a time when Twitter had the fail whale and it was down half the time and people couldn't even use it. And our product, we were innovating faster, we had more features, people liked it and we were up 100% of the time and we totally lost for no reason related to product at all. And it was an example of, I think somewhat famously not a lot of great entrepreneurs have come out of Google because Google was so successful, I think it's hard as a product manager to see distribution and product design and even business model when you have AdWords and money's raining from the sky. There wasn't as much scrutiny and I think folks like the PayPal Mafia I think learned a lot more about entrepreneurialism than a typical PM at Google. So, we're just getting punched in the face and learning this the hard way.\n\n(00:26:57):\nAnd so, that was probably the most prominent example of it and I think we probably did have a... I can tell you all the flaws of that product, but I don't think that was the reason why we lost. There's a lot of reasons. I think there was a lot of flaws of the product, but it was a lot of other stuff. And so, I've learned, accumulated these skills over time, but I say the hard part of that question is answering it correctly, is it's hard when you don't have experience in something, than to have intuition in it. So I think if there's probably a structural flaw, it wasn't that... I don't know if I could have figured out how to reach out to Ashton Kutcher [inaudible 00:27:28], it's not he's on my Rolodex. But I probably wasn't soliciting advice from the right people.\n\n(00:27:36):\nI think that what's great about the technology industry is there's a lot of advice. Choosing whom you listen to is actually quite difficult, but I think we're somewhat myopic. We're in our own little world, creating this product and we weren't asking people from the outside in to say, what are you seeing that could go wrong? What are you seeing that could go right? What are you seeing in the industry that we're not doing that you think we might want to do? And this is why boards are important. This is why finding the right advisors, the advisors will actually tell you what you not [inaudible 00:28:09] want to hear, but you need to hear. I think that was probably the missing part. I'm not sure I was great at market at the time, but if I had solicited the right advice, I could have learned that that was a shortcoming. And I think that was a deep lesson I took from that. I'm a huge believer in boards and getting good advice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:26):\nAny heuristics or advice for people to know whose advice to listen to? What do you pay attention to when you're like, okay, ignore this person but listen to this person?\n\nBret Taylor (00:28:35):\nYeah, that one's tough. It does come down to good judgment and being judge of people's character. One thing that is particularly hard is there's not a strong correlation between the confidence with which someone expresses an opinion and the quality of that opinion. I don't want to say it's inversely correlated, but that's funny, with all the podcasts out now, if there's topics I know a lot about, sometimes the most eloquent, confident statements about things I know a lot about, are the least accurate and it sounds extremely persuasive. And so, it does require very good judgment. One thing is I think, not just asking for advice but asking people, who should I talk to get good advice? And you'll find some common answers there and that's often a really strong signal of good judgment.\n\n(00:29:26):\nAnd then one thing I found is when you ask for advice, don't just ask what to do but why. Be an obnoxious two-year-old kid, why? Why? Why? Why? And really try to understand the framework that someone is using to give you advice. The interesting thing about advice is people are often extrapolating from relatively few experiences. So they will say, never do this or always do that. And it's because they had one experience where something backfired or something could have gone better if they had done it. So it's a useful anecdote, but if you don't ask why and understand they had one experience and here's what happened, it can come across as a rule when in fact, it's [inaudible 00:30:08] data and if you ask advice of three people and they all have very similar interactions, you can create a first principles framework from which that advice emerges. And when you start applying it, you're applying it with a degree of nuance that you couldn't if you're just following a rule. So, I think one is, it does come down to good judgment, I think. I don't know how to teach that.\n\n(00:30:30):\nI'm a huge believer in good judgment. It's one of the things I hire for. I just think that's something that probably comes from a mix of self perfection. You really need to hold yourselves accountable as an entrepreneur, as a product manager. If you made a bad decision, spend time reflecting on it, number one. And really, try to understand why and try to always improve your judgment. I think at the end of the day, that is why you are a good entrepreneur, a good product manager. And number two, when you get advice, really understand where it's coming from and why so that you can create your own independent view of where that advice came from and recognize that no one's advice is statistically significant or very rarely is it. If you're getting advice on investing from Warren Buffett, yeah, okay, it's statistically significant, but most advice is like something happened to you once and you have regrets.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:28):\nI love that you're like, I don't know if I have a great answer then you just give us an incredible answer to this question. I want to go in a different direction. You mentioned that you describe yourself as an engineer. I know I heard you code to relax still. Let me just ask you this question, something a lot of people in college are thinking about. Do you think it still makes sense to learn to code? Do you think this will significantly change in the next few years?\n\nBret Taylor (00:31:47):\nI do still think studying computer science is a different answer than learning to code, but I would say I still think it's extremely valuable to study computer science. I say that because I think computer science is more than coding. If you understand things like Big O notation or complexity theory or study algorithms and why a randomized algorithm works and why two algorithms with the same Big O complexity, one can then practice perform better than others and why a cache miss matters and just all these little... There's a lot more to coding than writing the code. The reason I think that is I do think the act of creating software is going to transform from typing into a terminal or typing into Visual Studio code to operating a code-generating machine. I think that is the future of creating software. But I think operating a code-generating machine requires systems thinking and I think that computer science, there are other disciplines as well, but computer science is a wonderful major to learn systems thinking and at the end of the day, AI will facilitate creating this software.\n\n(00:33:08):\nWe may do a lot more in the next few years we can't even imagine, but your job as the operator of that code-generating machine is to make a product or to solve a problem and you really need to have great systems thinking and you're going to be managing this machine that's doing a lot of the tedious work of making the button or connecting to the network. But as you're thinking of the intersection of a technology and a business problem, you're trying to affect a system that will solve that problem at scale for your customers and that systems thinking is always the hardest part of creating products.\n\n(00:33:40):\nI'll just give you, it's this cheesy simple example, but I think it's representative. At Facebook, we spent a lot of time designing the newsfeed and if you ever had a really, really good designer and they showed you at the time, a Photoshop mock-up of the newsfeed, it was just all as beautiful. The photos, the family was happy and the photo was a perfect photo and the posts were all perfectly grammatically correct and of a completely normal length and the comments and there was the like... Everything was just perfect. And then you'd implement that design and you'd look at your own newsfeed and it looked like shit because it turns out not everyone's photos were made by a professional photographer. The posts were all these different lengths. The comments were like, you suck and... All that stuff.\n\n(00:34:29):\nAnd then all of a sudden you realize that designing a newsfeed, Photoshop is the easy part. You need to actually design a system that produces both in content and visual design, like a delightful experience given input you don't control. And that's a system, it's sort of a design and it's just, what we did practically, I am sure it's changed a lot since I left in 2012, but we made a system so designers had to show their newsfeed designs with real newsfeed data that was messy rather than anything artificial because I think it forced the process to be more realistic.\n\n(00:35:10):\nBut I say that because I think that whether AI is writing code or doing the design or doing all these other things, you need to learn how to have a system in your head. You need to understand the basics of what's hard and what's easy and what's possible and what's impossible. And AI can help you do that too, by the way. But I do think that's a really useful skill. I think in general, with the advent of AI agents and AI approaching super intelligence in certain domains, I think the tools with which we do our job will change a lot. I think it's very important to have a very loose attachment to the way we do our jobs and that story that we won't talk about when I rewrote Google Maps, everyone talks about that story and I think it's because of Paul [inaudible 00:35:57] who told it on some podcasts and that's where it made the rounds.\n\n(00:36:01):\nI think that's going to end up this vestige of the past, almost like the human calculators at NASA before the computers were invented, like wow, a person was a calculator? Whoa, that's fun. Tell me that story. I think just what I was good at will no longer be useful in the future or certainly not valuable in the future and that's okay. So I think we need to have a really loose view of it, but the idea that you shouldn't study these disciplines, it's like people say, I don't want to study math because I'm not going to use it in my career for X. Well, studying maths is quite important. It teaches you how to think. It teaches you how the world works, physics, math, and I think computer science especially, at least the foundations of it, will continue to be the foundations of how we build software and understanding that when you're interacting particularly with something that's smarter than you, producing code you might not completely understand how you constrain it and how you get it to produce these outcomes. I think it will require a lot of sophistication actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:59):\nThat's such a great answer. There's this always sense of this binary, should I learn to code or not? And your point here is learn to understand how engineering works and how systems work and what your code does and how it all interconnects, but the way you actually do the coding at your desk will change significantly. This reminds me of something you mentioned on a podcast recently. This idea that you think there's going to, or there should be a new programming language that is more designed for LLMs versus humans. Can you just talk about that because I think a lot of people aren't thinking about that?\n\nBret Taylor (00:37:27):\nI don't know if it's a language, I would call it a programming system because I think language might be too limited. My reductive version of the past, what 40 years of computers maybe more, is we created the hardware for computers, then we created punch cards, which is the way in the late '70s you would tell a computer what to do or maybe mid to late '70s. Then we invented early operating systems and time-sharing systems from the invention of things like Unix at Bell Labs and Berkeley, you ended up with the C programming language, Fortran and a lot of higher level programming languages. I think Fortran and then C.\n\n(00:38:15):\nAnd we moved up the layers of abstraction. No one does punch cards anymore, obviously. Few people write assembly language. Some people write C, some people write REST. But a lot of people write Python and TypeScript and things like that. And as we've invented more and more abstractions, we've made it easier to do high-leverage things. So, if you look at how remarkable Google was back in the day or Google Maps, you could probably give a lot of react programmers the task of make a draggable map now and I think a lot of people could do it. That was true RND back in the day.\n\n(00:38:54):\nWhen Salesforce was created in 1998, just putting a database in the cloud was hard and that alone was a technical moat that is now trivial with Amazon Web Services and that technical moat is comically narrow, but the product moat is quite large. I think that if the act of writing code is going from something that is very costly to the marginal cost of that going to zero, how many of the abstractions that we've built are based on human program or productivity? I think a ton. I always laugh that I assume Python is probably the most common generated code just because of how much it's in the training data and data scientists love Python and I love Python too. It's such a comically bad thing for AI to generate just because it's one of the most inefficient programming languages of all time. If you know the global interpreter lock and just slow. And I've written a lot of high-scale web services and it's just quite slow and it's very hard to verify.\n\n(00:40:00):\nIt's not as bad as Perl, but if you have a big Python program, how many errors will you find at runtime versus before releasing it? So, Python was designed to be very ergonomic, almost looked like pseudo code for humans, for me to write code in a delightful way. That's why data scientists love it so much. So as we move to a world where let's just postulate, and I'm not sure this will be completely true, that we're not going to write a lot of code as people. We're going to be operating these code-generating machines. We probably don't care how ergonomic the programming language is. What we care about is when this machine generates code, do we know that it did what we wanted it to do? And if it doesn't do we want it to do, can we change it easily? I think there's a lot of insights in programming languages that could serve this.\n\n(00:40:48):\nSo Rust I think, is interesting because if I asked you to look at a C program and say, \"Does it leak memory?\" You probably couldn't do it that well just because it's really hard and if it's a very, a million line C program, it's going to be very, very hard. If I asked you to verify that a Rust program doesn't leak memory, you would just have to compile it. And because it has compile time, memory safety, just the act of compiling successfully tells you that's true. I think we need more things like that because if an AI is generating this code, by definition, if you have to read every line that is going to be the limiting factor for producing the code or worse, you're just not going to read every line and you're going to emit a bunch of unsafe unverified code into the wild.\n\n(00:41:36):\nAnd so, the question is how do you enable humans to have as much leverage as possible? Which means using computers to do the work on your behalf. You could have obviously the simplest form of this, is AI supervising AI and doing code reviews and that's great. Certainly, self-reflection is a really effective way of improving the robustness of an AI system. But I do think if it doesn't matter how tedious it is to write the code, you could probably layer on some techniques that are out of fashion, like formal verification, unit testing, other things. And if you layer all these on, I'm thinking about it as, I as a... It's like the guy in the matrix with the green letters coming down, how can I make something so I as a operator of the code generating machine can produce incredibly complex scale software, incredibly quickly and know that it works?\n\n(00:42:26):\nIf you start with that as your design center, I think you'd probably changed the languages, you'd probably changed the systems, you'd probably change all these things and you're probably going to bring to bear a lot of things. And what's really fun about it is you can loosen a lot of constraints, like coding is free. Okay, so that's neat. With that in mind, what do you want to do? What would be best suited for the language, the compiler for testing, for self-reflection, for supervisor models, all these things. I think that's more of a programming system than a language, but I think when we create something like that, it can really enable creators, builders to create incredibly robust, incredibly complex systems.\n\n(00:43:04):\nAnd I'm super excited about VibeCoding, but I don't know generating a prototype has been the limiting factor in software ever. It's actually building increasingly complex systems and actually changing them with agility. If you look at the famous Netscape one to Netscape two rewrite, somewhat, a lot of people attribute that to part of their failure against Internet Explorer. It's like making these things is not hard. Maintaining them is hard and ensuring they're robust is hard. And I think we're in the very early phases of defining what this new system for developing software looks like and I'm very excited to see what emerges.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:42):\nI feel like we're definitely living in the future when someone like you is suggesting that we build a matrix like experience and that's going to be potentially the future of coding and building. I can't wait for that. It feels like a great opportunity and a fun project.\n\n(00:43:57):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta and I'm very excited to have Christina Cacioppo CEO and co-founder Vanta joining me for this very short conversation.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:44:06):\nGreat to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:09):\nVanta is a long time sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:44:16):\nSure. So we started Vanta in 2018 focused on founders helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 2701. Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies including some start-up household names like Atlassian Ramp and LangChain, start and scale their security programs and ultimately, build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:46):\nThat is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:44:54):\nThat is very much our experience, but before the company and to some extent, during it. But the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):\nWe appreciate you for doing that. And you have a special discount for listeners. They can get $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny. That's V-A-N-T-A .com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:45:25):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:26):\nOkay. One more question along these lines and then I want to zoom out on just where AI is heading and something I love to ask folks like you that are at the cutting edge of AI is what you're teaching your kids. I know you have kids, I feel like the world is going to be very different when they grow up. What are you encouraging them to learn that you think is different maybe from previous generations to help them be successful in a world of AI abundance?\n\nBret Taylor (00:45:53):\nI don't know if I'm teaching them differently, but I'm really trying to encourage them to make AI a part of their lives. I was reflecting actually when I took the AP calculus exams in '97, '98 AB and BC, I could use a graphing calculator. And I haven't done this research I was meaning to plug this into ChatGPT before our conversation, but I'll do it after. Did the calculus exam change before and after they allowed the calculator in the exam? I assume it did. But essentially, to when you allow the calculator in the exam, you need to make sure that none of the questions benefit people for having a calculator or not, which actually forces you to rethink the problems to test calculus knowledge that don't benefit from like road arithmetic or the other things you can do on a graphing calculator.\n\n(00:46:47):\nI think that a lot of education doesn't presume you have a super intelligence in your pocket. And so, if you ask someone to write an essay on a book that they read, you could probably hallucinate one pretty easily from one of the big providers like ChatGPT. And maybe if you are skilled enough that prompting, maybe even your teacher won't know it's written by an AI. So what do you do? How do you teach kids differently? It's really hard for teachers right now because I think we haven't gone through the transition of adding calculators to the exams. So, I think a lot of the mechanisms we have to evaluate students are broken by the existence of ChatGPT and the like. So I think we're in a very awkward phase, but I think we can still both teach kids how to think and teach kids how to learn. And I think our education system can catch up and I actually think these models can be one of the most effective educational tools in history.\n\n(00:47:46):\nI don't know if you're a visual learner or reading learner. I like to read. I didn't love going to lectures. I don't learn that well from them. I like to read the book and if you have a teacher who doesn't teach in your style, you can now go home and ask ChatGPT to teach you in another mechanism. My kids use ChatGPT to quiz them before a test. You can use audio mode or chat mode. It's better than cue cards. My daughter took home a Shakespeare book, she took a picture of a page she didn't understand and ChatGPT explained it to her way better than I would've as well. I think every child in this world has a personalized tutor that can teach them in the way that they best learn, visually, over audio, reading. We have a platform that can test you, that can quiz you. I think it's really an amplifier of agency.\n\n(00:48:39):\nI think the kids who have agency, who have aspirations to learn something, I think you have what is the best combination of every teacher you've ever had and these models and you can use it. So with my kids, my oldest daughter learned how to code and she was making a website and every time she had a question for me, I would just make her use ChatGPT. Not because I was trying to be an obnoxious father, but I'm like she needs to learn to use this tool because it's amazing.\n\n(00:49:13):\nSo, I really am trying to have them learn how to use it constructively in their lives. But all that said, I just feel a ton of empathy for public school teachers right now. It's very hard because the technology is moving faster than our educational system. And I think particularly as it relates to evaluation, it's just really challenging for teachers right now. And I worry because these technologies amplify agency, the opposite can also be true. If you are a student trying to not learn something, I think these tools probably provide a lot of mechanisms to avoid it as well. And so, I think there's a challenge for parents and teachers and I think we're going to end up with a handful of years here.\n\n(00:49:53):\nBut I brought up the calculus AP exam because obviously, a graphing calculator is not ChatGPT, don't get me wrong. But I think we've been able to figure out a way to conform homework and in-class learning and tests around the technologies available to us fairly successfully to date. And I'm fairly confident we'll figure it out and I think it's going to... And on the much more positive side, I don't know, I went to public schools, I don't know if you did too. You end up with some pretty bad teachers at times and now, you have an outlet. You don't need to be the rich kid who can afford a tutor anymore to get tutoring. If you are a kid who excels in math and your school doesn't have advanced statistics classes, well, now you do.\n\n(00:50:40):\nSo I think this is just an incredibly democratizing force with kids who have agency and I think that's very exciting. I'm hopeful that there's a 11-year-old right now who's going to start a really amazing company 10 years from now whose ChatGPT is going to be their primary tutor that led to that outcome. And I think that's pretty cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:02):\nI have a two-year-old and it feels like there's a new milestone of, there's like when to give them a phone, when to give them, I don't know, Snapchat, whatever kids use these days and then it's like when to give them their first ChatGPT account. Well no, I wonder how soon that's supposed to happen.\n\nBret Taylor (00:51:16):\nI think my personal take is, it's different than the former two. I don't think mobile phones are great in school or great for kids and I personally advocate for waiting a long time. But I think that ChatGPT is more like Google search and it's one thing to have a device in your pocket that's addictive and has push notifications, but it's another thing to use AI to learn. And so, I think the two are different. And I really think of AI fundamentally as a utility. I don't think a lot of parents before ChatGPT said, \"When should I let my kid use Google search?\" That's a different type of tool. I think thinking of it like that is the way I think about these technologies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:55):\nIs the form factor for your kids like an iPad or a laptop or something?\n\nBret Taylor (00:51:58):\nYeah. They use the computer on the desk.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:01):\nGot it. All right. Good tips. This is good for me to learn all these things as my kid ages. Okay, I'm going to zoom out and let's talk about business strategy AI. One of the biggest questions a lot of founders think about these days is just where should I build? What will foundational model companies not squash and do themselves? Being someone building a very successful AI business and also being on the board of OpenAI, feel like you have a really unique perspective on what is probably a good idea and it's probably not a good idea. How do you think the AI market is going to play out and where do you think founders should focus and also just try to avoid?\n\nBret Taylor (00:52:36):\nI think there's three segments of the AI market that will end up fairly meaningful markets and then I'll end with how I think it's going to play out. So first is the frontier model market or foundation model market. I think this will end up the small handful of hyperscalers and really big labs just like the cloud infrastructure as a service market. And the reason for that is that creating a frontier model is entirely a function of CapEx. And you need a company with huge amounts of CapEx capacity to build one of these models. All of the companies that were startups that tried to do this have already been consolidated or almost all of them, inflection, adapt, character and others. And I think there doesn't appear to be a viable business model for a startup because of the amount of CapEx required and there's just not enough fundraising runway to get to escape velocity. And also, the models deteriorate in value fairly quickly as an asset class.\n\n(00:53:33):\nAnd so, you need just a lot of scale to make a return on the investment for a model that deteriorates in value so quickly. So, I think that's going to end up probably no entrepreneur should build a frontier model. That's my take.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:47):\nUnless you're Elon.\n\nBret Taylor (00:53:51):\nYeah. Oh, yeah. He's different. And he has the capacity to raise billions in capital and my guess is most of your other listeners don't, and then he is the greatest of all time for reason and he's different. You don't compare yourself to him. The other part of the market is the tooling, and I think there's a lot of folks selling pickaxes in the Gold Rush. This is data labeling, services. This is data platforms, it's eval tools. More specialized models like 11 Labs has a great set of voice models that a lot of companies use that are really high quality and it's like if you're trying to be successful in AI, what are the different tools and services that you need?\n\n(00:54:31):\nThere is some risk to the tooling market because it's pretty close to the sun. So, if you look at the infrastructure as a service market and the cloud tooling market like the Confluent and Databricks and Snowflake, a lot of the Amazon and Azure and others have competing products in those areas because they're very adjacent to the infrastructure itself and every infrastructure provider is trying to differentiate by moving up the stack and you're right there.\n\n(00:54:57):\nSo, there's some real meaningful companies as I mentioned, like Snowflake, Databricks, Confluent and others, but there's a lot of others that were obviated by technology from the infrastructure providers themselves. So those companies probably are the most at risk for a developer day from one of these big foundation model companies releasing exactly what they do. So there's probably a lot of people who need your tool, but the question will be if or when is probably the right way to think about it, one of these large infrastructure providers introduces a competitor, why will people continue to choose you? So it's a good market but it's a little bit close to the end as I said.\n\n(00:55:38):\nThen there's the applied AI market. I think this will play out for companies who build agents. I think agent is the new app. I think that's going to be the product form factor. There's companies like Sierra, we help companies build agents to answer the phone or answer the chat for customer experience and customer service. There's companies like Harvey that make agents for both a legal, paralegal profession, anti-trust reviews, reviewing contracts etc, etc. There's companies that do content marketing. There's companies that do supply chain analysis. I think this is like the software as a service market. They'll probably be higher margin companies because you're selling something that achieves a business outcome as opposed to being a byproduct of the models themselves. They will almost certainly pay taxes down to the model providers, which is why those model providers will end up extremely large scale but probably slightly lower margin and I think the market for them will be probably less technical.\n\n(00:56:37):\nIf you think about the purest form of software as a service, it's not like you ask what database do you use? It's really about the feature and function. I think that's where agents will go. I think it's going to be more about product than it is about technology over time. Just going back to my metaphor, in 1998 when Mark and Parker started Salesforce, just getting that database running in the cloud was like a technical achievement. Nowadays, no one asks about that because you can just spin up a database in AWS or Azure and it's like no problem. I think today, orchestrating an agentic process on top of the models, sounds really fancy and it's really hard and all that stuff. I'm pretty sure that's going to be easy in three or four years. It's just like just as the technology improves. And so, over time you say, what is an agent company? Well, it looks a little bit like [inaudible 00:57:30] as a service.\n\n(00:57:30):\nYou talk a little bit less about how you deal with the models in the same way modern SaaS, few people ask what database you use, but you'll probably ask a lot about the workflows and what business outcomes that you're driving. Are you generating leads for a sales team? Are you minimizing your procurement spend? Whatever value you're providing, it's going to slowly evolve towards that.\n\n(00:57:53):\nI'm very excited. I don't think startups should probably build foundation models. But you can shoot your shot if you have a vision for the future, go for it. But I think it's probably a challenging market that's already consolidated. I'm very excited about the other two markets. I'm particularly excited as building agents becomes easier, to see a lot of long tail agent companies come out. I was looking at a website for the top 50 software companies in the stock market and obviously, the top five are the big, big boom ones like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, all that, but the next 50 are all SaaS companies and some of them are very exciting, some of them are super boring, but this is how the software market has evolved and I think we're going to see something similar with agents.\n\n(00:58:38):\nIt's not just going to be these huge markets like we're in customer service and software engineering. It's going to be a lot of things where people are spending a lot of time and resources that an agent can just solve, but it requires an entrepreneur who actually understands that business problem, and deeply, and I think that's where a lot of the value is going to be unlocked in the AI market.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:00):\nThat is incredibly helpful. This makes me think about, I had Marc Benioff on the podcast, you guys were co-CEOs and he was extremely agent-pilled. All he wanted to talk about was Agentforce. Clearly you're also very agent-pilled. What is it that-\n\nBret Taylor (00:59:14):\nI've never heard the term agent-pilled [inaudible 00:59:18].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:18):\nClearly you guys saw something that was just like, okay, we need to go all in on agents. This is the future. What is it you think people are missing about just why this is such a critical change in the way software is going to work? What are people not seeing?\n\nBret Taylor (00:59:31):\nIf you talk to an economist like Larry Summers who, on the OpenAI board with me, they'll talk about what is the value of technology? Will it help strive productivity in the economy. And if you look at one of the big jumps in productivity in the economy was in the '90s, and I think a lot of folks I talked to think it was actually that very first wave of computing where people made ERP systems and just put accounting into computers and databases, even mainframes, we're talking like the PC era. Because it was such a huge step-up, just imagine the ledgers of numbers that you'd have for a large multinational company before and it truly just transformed departments.\n\n(01:00:14):\nI'll give you a little toy example. My dad just retired. He was a mechanical engineer and he was talking about when he first started his career in the late '70s and he went into a mechanical engineering firm, the majority of the firm were drafts people. So basically, you take an engineering design but you needed to do all the different vantage points and for all the different floors and to give to the contractor to do the thing. Now, there are zero drafts people at his company. You just make the design in first AutoCAD and now Revit and it's a 3D model and the drafting has actually been eliminated. It's just not a thing one needs to do anymore. The actual design and drafting, drafting is not a thing that exists. It's just a design. That's true productivity gains, right? It's like the job of the mechanical engineering firm was to do a design. The drafting was this necessary output for the contractor, but it wasn't really adding value. It was just like the supply chain change.\n\n(01:01:12):\nIf you look at the history of the software industry from the PC on, there's been meaningful productivity gains but just not nearly as meaningful as that first huge jump. And I'm not smart enough to know exactly why, but it is interesting, the promise of productivity gains from technology hasn't been as realized I think as some people thought. I think agents will truly start to bend the curve again like we did in the very early days of computing because software is going from helping an individual be slightly more productive to actually accomplishing a job autonomously. And as a consequence, just like you don't need drafts people in a mechanical engineering firm, you just won't need someone doing that thing anymore. It means they can do something else that's higher leverage and more productive and you can actually... A smaller group of people can accomplish more and truly drive productivity gains in the economy.\n\n(01:02:15):\nAnd I think if you've ever sold enterprise software, you end up in these discussions as a vendor with the customer where you'll have a value discussion and you'll do these somewhat convoluted things like okay, it's like you're selling a sales thing. Okay, well, if every salesperson sells 5% more... And you should pay us a million dollars. And it's roughly that conversation and it's so unattributable especially... And it's why it's so hard to sell productivity software, which I learned the hard way, it's just hard to know what's the value of making everyone 10% more productive? Did you actually make them 10% more productive or did something else change? You don't really know all these things. But now with an agent actually accomplishing a job, not only is it actually truly driving productivity in a very real way, but it's measurable as well.\n\n(01:03:10):\nSo all those things combined means I think this is actually a step change in how we think about software because it does a job autonomously, which is more self-evident, a productivity driver. It's measurable so people value it differently as well, which is why I also believe in outcomes-based pricing for software.\n\n(01:03:32):\nAnd all of that combined to me, it feels like as significant as the cloud or I think more technologically, but just in terms of how it transforms the business model of the software industry where there's going to be a before and after. I don't know how many people still sell perpetually licensed on premises software, but it's de minimis at this point. I think we're going to go through a similar transition. The whole market is going to go towards agents. I think the whole market is going to go towards outcomes-based pricing, not because it's the only way, but the market is going to pull everyone there because it's just so obviously the correct way to build and sell software.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:08):\nLet me pull on that last thread. So we had Madhavan on the podcast recently, pricing expert, legend, monetizing innovation author and he talked about pricing strategy for AI companies and he was very much in your camp of, if you can, you need to price your product as an outcome-based product and the access uses exactly what you shared, which is, you can do that if you can attribute the impact and it's autonomous, it's running on its own. And he actually used Sierra as one of the shining examples of this being successful. Can you just briefly just explain a little bit what is outcome-based pricing for people that haven't heard this term before and then just how does it work for Sierra to give an example?\n\nBret Taylor (01:04:45):\nYeah, I'll start with the example and then I'll broaden it. So at Sierra, we help companies make customer facing AI agents primarily for customer service, but more broadly, for customer experience. So if you have a problem with your [inaudible 01:04:58], you'll call or chat with Harmony, who's their AI agent. If you have ADT home security and your alarm doesn't work, you can chat with their AI agent. Sonos speakers, a lot of different consumer brands. And if you think about running a call center, there's a cost for every phone call that you take. Most of it is labor costs, but if you have, let's just say a typical phone call is anywhere between 10 and $20 USD. Some of it's software, some of it's telephony, but a lot of it is just like the hourly wage of the person answering the phone.\n\n(01:05:32):\nSo if an AI agent can take that call and solve it, that is in the industry often called a call deflection or a containment. And that essentially means you saved, call it $15 because you didn't have to have someone pick up the phone. So in our industry, basically we say, \"Hey, if the AI agent solves the customer's problem, they're happy with it and you didn't have to pick up the phone,\" there's a pre-negotiated rate for that and we call it resolution based. There are other outcomes as well. We have some sales agents being paid a sales commission, believe it or not. We do. We really think of our agents as truly customer experience like the concierge for your brand and we want to make sure that our business model is aligned with our customer's business model.\n\n(01:06:22):\nAs you said, these agents need to be autonomous and the outcome has to be measurable. That's not always possible, but I think it's broadly possible. And what's really neat about it is if you talk to any CFO or head of procurement with their big vendors, they look at the bill of materials and it's overwhelming and it's impossible to know if you're getting the value that you hoped from that contract. I think consumption based, which was popular particularly in the infrastructure space is closer to it. But I'm not sure a token is actually a good measure of value from AI either. I always use the analogy, like right now, most of the coding agents are priced per token or per utilization, but there's this famous story of an Apple engineer who had a bad manager who's like had you report how many lines of code you wrote every day? Which every engineer in the world knows is an idiotic way to measure productivity.\n\n(01:07:16):\nHe famously went in with a report that had a negative number because I think he did a big refactoring, deleted a bunch and it was his way of saying like, fuck you to the man. I think tokens are similar. Yeah, you used a lot of tokens, like good for you, did it produce a pull request that was good? And I think that's the whole point of all this. I think there's a huge difference between outcomes-based pricing and usage based pricing because especially in AI, they're not necessarily even correlated and you could have a long phone call and not solve the customer's problem and they give you a negative review online and call the call center again, all that effort was for nothing. In fact, you might've added negative value. And so, I am a huge believer in this.\n\n(01:07:58):\nAnd what's fun about it is it really just aligns... I think every technology company aspires to be a partner, not a vendor. And I think at Sierra, we are truly a partner to every single one of our customers because we're all aligned on what we want to achieve. And I think that is really where the software industry should go. It requires a lot of different shape of a company. You have to be able to help your customers achieve those outcomes. You can't just throw software at the wall because you'll never get paid if it doesn't. Your orientation becomes so extremely customer-centric when you do this the right way. I think it's just a better version of the software industry. So I think it's right from first principles, it's right for procurement partners and I think it's right for the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:43):\nWe've been chatting a little bit about productivity gains. There's a lot of skepticism in the headlines these days of just like what is AI actually doing? Is it actually helping people be more productive? There was a recent study actually, I don't know if you saw, where they showed engineers were less productive with AI because it was just putting them in different directions. They had to research all what's going wrong here? So I think CX is a really good example where you clearly are seeing gains. Are you seeing actual gains at your company or any other company you work with outside of CX in terms of productivity that is like clearly yes, this is working and a huge deal?\n\nBret Taylor (01:09:15):\nI'm extremely bullish on the productivity gains from AI, but I do think the tools and products right now are somewhat immature and it's quite counterintuitive. So, for example, almost every software engineering firm I know uses something like Cursor to help their software engineers. Most people use Cursor right now as a coding autocomplete, though they have a lot of agentic solutions and there's a lot of... OpenAI has Codex and Cloud has... I can't remember the Anthropic products. So there's lots of agentic agents coming as well. One of the interesting things because the technology is immature, the code it produces often has problems. There's a lot of people approaching this to actually realize those productivity gains because as any engineer who's written a lot of code will tell you, it's pretty easy to look at and edit and fix code you wrote.\n\n(01:10:10):\nReviewing other people's code or particularly finding a subtle logical error in someone else's code is actually really hard. It's actually much harder than editing code that you wrote yourself. So if the code produced by a coding agent is often incorrect, it actually can take a lot of cognitive load and time to fix it. And in fact, if you end up producing lots of issues with your customers, you could end up producing a lot of features, but actually, is like mucking up the machine a little bit and having something that's not ideal. There's a couple of techniques that I think are interesting. First, I think there's a lot of AI starts now working on things like code reviews. I think this idea of self-reflection in agents is really important. Having AI supervise the AI is actually very effective. Just think about it this way, if you produce an AI agent that's right 90% of the time, that's not that great, but how hard would it be to make another AI agent to find the errors the other 10% of the time? That might be a tractable problem.\n\n(01:11:10):\nAnd if that thing's right 90% of the time, just for argument's sake, you can wire those things together and have something that's right 99% of the time. So it's just a math problem and it turns out that you can make something to generate code, you can make something to review code and you're essentially using compute for cognitive capacity and you can layer on more layers of cognition and thinking and reasoning and produce things increasingly robust. So I'm very excited about that. The other thing though is root cause analysis. So we have an engineer at Sierra who exclusively focuses on the model context protocol server serving our cursor instance. And our whole philosophy is, if cursor generated something incorrect, rather than just fixing it, try to root cause it. Try to get it so the next time Cursor will produce the correct code and essentially, is context engineering.\n\n(01:12:05):\nWhat context did Cursor not have that would've been necessary to produce the right outcome? So I think people who are trying to get productivity gains in departments like software engineering need to stop waiting for the models to magically work if they want to see the gains now. And you really have to create root cause analysis and systems and say, how do we go root cause every bad line of code and actually give the right context and produce the right system so the models can do it today? Over time that'll probably be less necessary and you'll have less context engineering necessary to do it, but you really have to think of this as a system and I think people are waiting for the models to just magically get better. And I'm like, well that will happen eventually, but if you want the gains now you got to put in the work. That's essentially why applied AI companies exist.\n\n(01:12:53):\nAnd the work is non-trivial, but you can do it. And so, for customers using platforms like Sierra, yeah, AI agents aren't perfect, but we're creating a system that lets customers create a virtuous cycle of improvement. If you want to go from a 65% automated resolution rate to 75%, we have a billion tools to let AI help you do that, identify opportunities for improvement, figure out why people are frustrated, what new capabilities can we add to our agent to improve the resolution rate? And you let AI put the needles at the top of the haystack on your behalf and I think that's really the way to optimize these systems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:28):\nI've never heard of this technique of improving Cursor by adding additional context. What's the actual way of doing that? You build an MCP server that everything runs through or is it like you add Cursor rules? What's the actual approach there?\n\nBret Taylor (01:13:41):\nI'm probably out of my depth here, but it's essentially MCP because that's how you provide context to Cursor. And I think that almost always when you have a model making a poor decision, if it's a good model, it's lack of context. And so, you really want to find the intersection of your particular product and code base with the context available to these coding agents and systems and fix it at the root is the principle here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:06):\nGot it. That is very cool. I hadn't heard of people doing that, model context protocol, makes sense. We've talked about productivity gains outside TX. Just to give you a chance to share how amazing what you've built is, what are some of the gains you see from people using Sierra?\n\nBret Taylor (01:14:18):\nYeah, our customers see anywhere between 50 and 90% of their customer service interactions completely automated, which I think is really exciting. And we serve just a really, really broad range of customers. We serve the health insurance industry, the healthcare provider space, banks. You can actually refinance your home using an agent. One of our customers built on our platform to the telecommunications industry, DIRECTV, SiriusXM to a lot of retailers as well, which is really fun. Everyone from Wayfair to clothing retailers like OluKai and Chubbies Shorts. What's really neat about it is it's a pretty diverse range of use cases and it's everything from helping you sign up for... We have an agent that helps with customer support in one of the big dating applications to helping you upgrade or downgrade your SiriusXM plan. Actually, it's really funny, we do technical support from everything from home alarm systems to sonar speakers to more recently, CAT scan machines, which I think is amazing.\n\n(01:15:28):\nSo technicians going in and fixing the CAT scan machine can chat with an AI agent to help them guide them through that process. We're the leader in the space, we're trying to enable every company in the world to create their agent with their brand at the top that I think will become as meaningful of a digital touch point as their website or their mobile app. In the short term, it can really transform the costs of running a customer service team. And what's remarkable is do so with really high customer satisfaction scores. That Weight Watchers agent, I believe has a customer satisfaction score of 4.6 out of five, which is pretty amazing. And what's interesting about service too, it's often people having a problem. And so, when you have a clear, I don't know if you use them in the airport, I think that agent has a CSAT score of 4.7 out of five people are coming in with a problem and [inaudible 01:16:19] delighted. And I think that's really the opportunity here.\n\n(01:16:22):\nAnd our whole vision is that we're going to move towards a world where every single one of the interactions with your customers can be instant. It can be multilingual, it can be over audio, it can be over chat, it can be digital, it can be over the phone and it can be very personalized. And I think that's really, really exciting. And if you think about all the best moments you've had with a brand, it's like that store associate who you know, and it's like for me, it's like the butcher at the grocery store. I love to cook, he knows me. We talk. Can you actually produce that at scale for a company with 100 million customers and can you do it in a really personal way? And I think we're really on the cusp of enabling that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:03):\nLet me ask you one more question before we get to a very exciting lighting round. There's a lot of founders struggling with go-to-market in AI with their AI apps. There's so many apps these days, so many products, so many things coming at buyers, at large B2B companies. Clearly you guys have figured something out. I imagine your name helps, investors help, but what have you learned about just how to successfully do go-to-market with an AI product, say an agent-specific product that you think would be helpful for folks trying to do this better?\n\nBret Taylor (01:17:35):\nI think there's a small handful of go-to-market models that have been proven to work, and I think it's important to choose the right one for the product category you're going after. One category I would say is developer-led. This is somewhere famously Stripe and Twilio where probably two of the original that did this exceptionally. And essentially, the go-to-market motion there is to appeal to an individual engineer often within the department of the CTO who have accountability and a fair amount of latitude to choose a solution. This works if your product is a platform product. It doesn't work, for example, if your product is trying to help a line of business because lines of business typically don't have dedicated engineering teams or let alone, the latitude to just go download a new library or start using a web service like that. It particularly works well if you sell to startups just because startups tend to have engineering teams with quite a bit of latitude to choose services to help them solve the problem given by the founder.\n\n(01:18:44):\nThen there's product-led growth. It's a broad term, obviously every company's product matters, but product-led growth more specifically means users can sign up from the website, often get put on a trial. Often you can buy a couple of seats with a credit card and those work where your user and your buyer are the same person. So it works for small business software almost always because sole proprietors do everything. And so you're selling small business software like Shopify in the early days and there's a lot of other products like that where you're trying to sell to small merchants. That's great. It doesn't work well when your buyer and the user of the software are different. So I'll use the example of something like expense reporting software. The user of that software is an individual employee, but the buyer is often a finance department. And so having sign up and buy with your credit card doesn't make sense because the person using is not the person with the credit card and it just doesn't work.\n\n(01:19:39):\nAnd then there's direct sales. And direct sales had gone, I don't want to say out of fashion, but if I think of the best direct sales companies, probably there's a lot of lineage from Oracle, but you think SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Adobe perhaps, and there's others as well. And these were companies that sold into large lines of business in a relatively traditional sales motion. I think because product-led growth became very popular. I think a lot companies use that, which is great, that motion produces great products, but if PLG means that you aren't actually engaging with the buyer of your software, you're not going to grow. And so, I've actually seen more recently, with a lot of AI companies, direct sales come a little bit more back into fashion because I think so many of the opportunities in AI actually meet that qualification where the buyer and the user are not necessarily the same person and it really requires that go-to-market motion.\n\n(01:20:40):\nWhere I see entrepreneurs stumble is they'll choose a go-to-market motion without thinking through what is the process of purchasing this software? What is the process of evaluating the value of this software? And I think people just need to be much more first principles about it and much more thoughtful about it. And candidly, I think a lot of companies should leverage direct sales more than they do. And even though because of the sometimes justified reputation of the quality of products of some of these direct sales companies, it had gotten a bad name. And I think I'm thankful to see it coming back in a lot of the AI market.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:20):\nI feel like this message is something a lot of founders need to hear, especially founders that aren't from a business background that sales turns them off, they don't think they're going to be great at sales. Just this push of this might be what you have to get really good at and this is how you win and you can't just rely on product like growth.\n\nBret Taylor (01:21:36):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:38):\nBret, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Any last nugget of wisdom? Anything you want to double click on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nBret Taylor (01:21:47):\nNo, go ahead.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:48):\nOkay, let's do it. Here we go. Welcome to our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nBret Taylor (01:21:53):\nYeah, go ahead.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:54):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nBret Taylor (01:21:59):\nI don't read a lot of nonfiction, but probably if I had to pick one in the area of the topics we talked about, Competing Against Luck, which was the book that produced Jobs to be Done, which is a framework I really believe in. My only critique is I think most of these business books should be like an article. So maybe buy the book and punch it into ChatGPT and get the summary. But buy the book it's Clayton Christensen talked about it, but it's a really good framework for thinking about delivering value with your products. And I think it definitely influenced me.\n\n(01:22:37):\nActually one book I do recommend is Endurance, which is the story of Shackleton's trip to go to the South Pole. Half the book is him starving to death and eating seal meat with his crew of people frozen in their boat. I've never seen a better story of grit in my entire life. It's remarkable that it's a true story and if you're an entrepreneur going through a hard time, read that, you'd be like, okay, it could be worse. It's a great book too. It's just remarkable that it's a true story.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:08):\nAnd one thing he did a great job at is setting expectations for folks that joined that famous newspaper-\n\nBret Taylor (01:23:13):\nThat ad. That newspaper ad. I don't know if that's true. It's remarkable if that's true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):\nOh, it might not be true.\n\nBret Taylor (01:23:17):\nI don't know. The internet. Who knows?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:20):\nGoddam. Deep fakes even back then. Okay. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nBret Taylor (01:23:27):\nI haven't gone to any new TV shows recently? We just watched Inception with the kids and they loved it and made me appreciate Christopher Nolan and what a cool movie. It's the type of movie when you watch the film and you can a conversations for two days afterwards about it. So, just a great film.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:46):\nI saw someone using I think VO 3 to create their own Inception videos where the worlds wrapping in on each other. Oh, man. Okay. Do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you love or one you've loved for a long time?\n\nBret Taylor (01:23:59):\nI'm really a big fan of Cursor. I think it's changed. I love creating software and I'm excited though for agents. I've been really excited. I was very excited to see Codex from OpenAI and others. So I think Cursor will be in its current form, is a transition product. And I know they're working on agents as well, but I really enjoyed taking something I love and it's been my life's passion and really diving into this AI tool and seeing how it transforms how I create software. So I've just been spending a lot of time with the product just because it's so core to what I love to do and it's a really well crafted product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:39):\nI think that's the first time someone's actually mentioned Cursor in this answer, so might be the beginning of a trend. Michael Trell was on the podcast and he actually had a very similar message as you had at the beginning of this chat about the future of code, what comes after code and this concept that there's going to be this additional pseudo code layer on top of code. Very aligned with your thinking. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?\n\nBret Taylor (01:25:05):\nThe best way to predict the future is to invent it, which I think I attribute to Alan Kay of Xerox PARC. He invented a lot of the core abstractions that we use in computing today. I'm an entrepreneur, it's why I love to build things and it's definitely a life motto for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:29):\nI feel like many people say this, I feel like you've actually done this so many times. You're really living this motto. Final question. We talked about you inventing the like button at FriendFeed. Were there other thoughts of what they would call it other than like? Was it just obviously like? Or was there other thinking there?\n\nBret Taylor (01:25:48):\nThis was before emoji. So, if you read the comments on FriendFeed posts, at least 70% of them are cool or wow or yeah or neat. And one of the principle uses of FriendFeed was to have discussions about things. So you'd have a post and then a pretty fulsome discussion underneath. And compared to Twitter and others, it was a great place to have those discussions. And so, the product problem we were trying to solve is get all the one word answers out so that the discussion was actually actual comments as opposed to acknowledgements that you read the thing.\n\n(01:26:30):\nSo, the original framing was one click comment. That was how we thought about it. And so, the first version that I made had a heart, and she denies remembering this, but Anna Yang, now Anna Muller who has worked at the company, she hated it. She said, \"If I look at hearts on every post, I'm going to vomit. It's too much.\" And it also was interesting, we were simulating, it was like an article about a tragedy or something. A heart was just not the right thing. Like which actually turned out to be really hard to translate was just a much more neutral sentiment, and that's why it was hard to translate because it was subtle. So that's how we ended up with this.\n\n(01:27:17):\nWe started with a heart, and I don't know if we ever heard the word love, but we definitely started off with the iconography and then like, which just felt like this positive yet as neutral as possible within the realm of positive so that it could work for a more complex story. But it was all because we needed a one-click comment. That's where the concept came from.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):\nWow. I've never heard the story before. It makes me think about LinkedIn now. They're basically trying to solve that same problem. They have all these auto-reply pill tag things. I don't think people like those very much.\n\nBret Taylor (01:27:37):\nYeah. They have a lot of features.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:48):\nSo many AI features. Bret, this was incredible. This was an honor. I so appreciate you coming on this podcast. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe go see if they want to work at Sierra and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBret Taylor (01:28:00):\nIf you want an AI agent to help with customer service, go to sierra.ai. If you want to apply here, sierra.ai/careers where we have offices in San Francisco and New York, Atlanta and London and are hiring pretty aggressively in every department. So please reach out if you're interested.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:19):\nAnd how can listeners be useful to you? Is it tryout Sierra, anything else there?\n\nBret Taylor (01:28:21):\nYeah, tryout Sierra. I'm a single issue voter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:26):\n[inaudible 01:28:26] message. I love it.\n\nBret Taylor (01:28:26):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:27):\nBret, thank you so much for being here.\n\nBret Taylor (01:28:29):\nYeah, thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:30):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:28:32):\nThank you so much for listening.

Word of mouth is so hard. \n\nBrian Balfour (00:00:03):\nAll of the ingredients for new distribution platform are essentially happening. My prediction, the new distribution platform will be ChatGPT. There's a bunch of signals that they're about to launch that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):\nThis is a huge opportunity for companies to get on it. \n\nBrian Balfour (00:00:16):\nIt ends up being a prisoner's dilemma. Don't trick yourself into thinking that you can't play the game. The cycles seem to be getting shorter and shorter, so you actually have a smaller amount of time. If you don't do it, your competitors are going to go to the new platform and your customer expectations change. There is no opting out of the game. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):\nThis is the opportunity to disrupt an incumbent. \n\nBrian Balfour (00:00:33):\nIf you're a late-stage company, you place multiple bets. For startups, it's a totally different ballgame. You have to choose one and go all in. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):\nThink about companies like Zynga that grew on Facebook and then became massive companies.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:00:43):\nBuilding a great product is one of those things that's necessary, but not sufficient. And actually the separation is between those that build really great distribution.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):\nWhat would be the backup if not ChatGPT? \n\nBrian Balfour (00:00:54):\nMy hypothesis of who's best-positioned would actually be...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):\nToday, my guest is Brian Balfour. Brian is the founder and CEO of Reforge, a company that I've been a long-time fan and advocate of. Historically, Reforge has focused primarily on teaching courses on product and growth, but more recently they've transitioned to building their own products, including a product called Reforge Insights and a bunch more really cool stuff coming very soon. \n\n(00:01:18):\nPrior to Reforge, Brian led growth at HubSpot, and over the course of his career, he has seen the rise and fall of every major distribution channel, including Facebook's ad platform, Google Ads and SEO, and the Apple App Store. Based on what he's seeing, he is predicting the emergence of a brand new and powerful distribution channel that will likely arise in the next six months, centered most likely around ChatGPT. It is really rare for a new growth channel to open up. It's been a long time since the last one appeared, and the people who recognize this and hop on it early are the ones that reap the most rewards. So this is a huge deal. \n\n(00:01:54):\nIn this conversation, Brian shares what he's predicting, what he's seeing, why this is a big deal, and what you should be doing about it right now.

Brian, thank you so much for being here and welcome back to the podcast. \n\nBrian Balfour (00:04:09):\nYeah, thanks for having me. Excited for this one. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:12):\nI'm really excited to have you back. We're just going to dive right in. Essentially, you've uncovered a really important trend or insight about how products are going to grow differently in the future, how growth is changing, and this is something that I think a lot of people need to hear, so I asked you to come on to share what you're seeing. I also think this is just very timely. I think you said you're going to say in the next six months things might significantly change, so I'm really excited to do this. We're going to spend this whole conversation on this insight. To set us up, what is just the big idea? What's the high-level idea here? \n\nBrian Balfour (00:04:45):\nJust like you, I've spent my whole career just really passionate about startups, figuring out how to build products that win, that emerge in new markets, and one of the things that I have learned over time or one of the things you hear a lot from a lot of folks is, to win, you have to really build a great product. A lot of advice boils down to that. And one of the things that I feel like I've banged my head against the wall in a lot of ways in my career is actually telling people that building a great product is one of those things that's necessary, but not sufficient, and actually the separation is between those that build really great distribution. \n\n(00:05:26):\nSo this general partner, his name's Alex Rampell, he's at Andreessen Horowitz, actually wrote this blog post 10 years ago back in I think 2015. In the essence of the blog post, he basically says one thing, which is that startups is a game of trying to get distribution before the incumbent can copy. It's this kind of concept of escape philosophy. \n\n(00:05:54):\nOn that note, which I think os a very good summary of what you're trying to do in a startup and distribution, is that we're right now living in this environment where that game of startups getting distribution faster than the incumbent has gotten way harder in a lot of ways, and in some small cases has gotten a little bit easier. But if we think about this, the way that it's gotten harder and some of the things that probably a lot of founders or folks working on the growth side that probably feel is that, one is that incumbents can copy faster these days. That window that you have to get that escape velocity has actually shrunk. It's decreased. \n\n(00:06:34):\nThe second thing is that a lot of the organic distribution that we've had, especially over the past few years, has really shrunk as well. Everybody's talking about the decline of SEO and clicks declining, but you also see it in some other cases. A lot of these social platforms don't really let you send as much traffic to sites. LinkedIn just changed their algorithm, which has really dropped organic distribution. Obviously the Twitter-to-X, transition that happened, right? TikTok's almost always been like that.\n\n(00:07:06):\nAnd then the third way that it's gotten harder is that AI's really good at writing software and code generation, and so everybody's feeling this infinite increase of competition, especially at the startup level. YC is pumping out six of the same thing every single cohort. That's what it literally feels like. \n\n(00:07:23):\nSo it's gotten way harder. This game, this escape velocity game has gotten a lot harder. It's gotten easier in some very exceptional cases like the Cursor or something where AI has been like the spark. I know you wrote the blog post about the race car engine, and I think you said there's the spark plug in the engine. AI really created that, a new type of spark, a new type of interest of early adopters to fuel some new players in a short period of time. So it's amazing to see something like Cursor overtake market share of something like GitHub Copilot in nine months or less. That's how fast it happens. It's kind of crazy. \n\n(00:08:01):\nBut the main thing that people need to understand is, okay, well, if that's the game I'm playing, how to get to escape velocity before the incumbent? What are all the ways to do that and to really figure that out? There's multiple ways that this can happen, but one of the major ways, one of the major, major ways that we always see is that this can happen when new distribution platforms emerge, because when new distribution platforms emerge, startups are usually the fastest to take advantage of them. It's slower for the incumbents to move. It gives startups this opportunity essentially to play this game. \n\n(00:08:39):\nCasey Winters wrote this blog post about two years ago, maybe 18 months ago, about the AI technology shift. His key point was the AI technology shift has been a technology shift that has not come with a distribution shift yet. If you look historically, we've had a bunch of technology shifts from the internet to the cloud to mobile to social, all of these different types of things. Some of them come with new distribution platforms, new ways to distribute products, and some of them don't, but the most powerful ones, the most impactful ones are the ones that do come with these new distribution platforms. His second key point was that these two things don't actually happen at once. Usually you get the technology shift, then you get the distribution shift a little bit later. \n\n(00:09:25):\nNow we're a couple years from that post. We are a couple years into AI technology shift, and one of the things that I am seeing is all of the conditions, all of the ingredients for a new distribution platform to emerge are essentially happening. So I think we're at an inflection point where we're going to see this emerge really fast. \n\n(00:09:45):\nThe key thing for everybody to know is that as new distribution platforms emerge, they follow the same four-step cycle and it's a game that you're playing, that everybody's playing. Just like any game, you need to know the rules of the game. You need to know the steps of the game in order to have any sort of opportunity to win. That's the thing that I've lived through once again, both painfully and also in good ways, and is something that I'm keeping my eye on and something that I've been talking about. Before we go into that four-step cycle, I figured I'll pause there to see if you have any follow-up questions on that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):\nOkay. This is amazing. Essentially what you're saying is we follow these ways to grow, there's SEO, there's paid growth, there's sales. All these channels have been around for a long time. They're extremely saturated. Everyone's always complaining SEO's dead, it can't grow, the SEO, anymore. It can't grow. Word of mouth is so hard, there's so many amazing things now that's hard. Paid is so hard. It's just all this money just-\n\nBrian Balfour (00:10:24):\nTax are rising.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):\nExactly.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:10:49):\nAll these things. Yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:50):\nSo all these saturated channels, and what you're saying is there's an emerging new channel that has not yet been saturated, and this is a huge opportunity for companies to get on it. And you'll talk about timing because it's a little tricky to even know exactly when to go big on this.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:11:05):\nThat's right. Yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:06):\nBut that's a huge deal. This has been a long time since there's a new way to grow that you can actually use as a lever for growth and not just hope for the best. Okay.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:11:15):\nYeah. That's right. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:15):\nBefore you get into the cycles, do you want to tease what the answer is, just to give people a little hint, or do you want to keep it secret?\n\nBrian Balfour (00:11:23):\nWell, to be clear, okay, so my prediction, we don't have a clear winner yet. My prediction of the new distribution platform will be ChatGPT, in some ways that people probably already think it's happening in some ways that it won't, but the thing that is less important or that is more important than whether I have predicted the exact winner correctly, the thing that's more important is to understand the cycle and evaluate how to determine where you want to place your bets and how to place those bets, which I know we'll talk about.\n\n(00:12:02):\nI could be wrong about the ChatGPT prediction and what's going to happen there. I think there's going to be two parts of it. There's going to be what they do with a ChatGPT search experience, but I think the bigger thing will be whatever they do with launching a third-party platform on top of ChatGPT, there's a bunch of signals that they're about to launch that, I'm pretty sure it's going to be ChatGPT. \n\n(00:12:25):\nThe thing I'm way more sure about is that some new distribution platform will emerge and it will follow the same four-step cycle. That's the key. Could be wrong on the first piece, I am very confident on the second piece.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:40):\nOkay. Excellent foreshadowing. I completely agree, if it's anything, it would be ChatGPT at this point. Let's get into it. What are the cycles that platforms generally follow? \n\nBrian Balfour (00:12:49):\nYeah, and I'll give some examples of this, but let me explain the four steps of the cycle first and then we'll go through a bunch of examples of all those individual steps. The four steps are essentially, one is I call a Step Zero. It's the conditions of the market have been met. Step One is about a moat, Step Two is about a platform opening, and Step Three is about the platform closing for control and monetization. Let me briefly explain each one. \n\n(00:13:20):\nStep Zero is about the competitive market being met, the conditions being met, and there's a few part piece of this. One is that typically what happens is that there is consensus that there is going to be this new huge category. Think social, think mobile, like all those types of things. In this case, these AI like chat platforms, like a ChatGPT or a clock. There's consensus about that, but there's no clear winner yet. We typically have somewhere between five to seven major players really battling it out and they're all looking for what is the edge? What is the thing that is going to help me win? Because all of these dynamics, in all the history, they either end up in monopolies or duopolies, and so the stakes are really large and so the competition is fierce. \n\n(00:14:13):\nThat's Step Zero. I think we could all agree that we are in that mode right now. We've got OpenAI battling with Claude, battling with Gemini, and Google with whatever Meta comes out with their new team, so on and so forth. There's huge amounts of capital, there's consensus, all the types. They are in a fierce composition. That's Step Zero.\n\n(00:14:36):\nStep One is then these players, somebody essentially identifies whatever the moat is, the thing that is going to help build them defensibility and help them hit escape velocity and become that monopoly or duopoly in that single category. Once they figure out what that moat is, then they need to press the advantage. They need to figure out how to gather that moat as fast as humanly possible. It tends to be that you can't do that by yourself, so you need the help of an ecosystem in order to gather more of that moat. \n\n(00:15:12):\nThat typically comes down to third-party content creators or app developers and other businesses. So they all establish a third-party platform that has some incentives built in, and usually the value exchange is, hey, you develop on top of my platform, you add more use cases, more engagement, all of these things to my platform, and in exchange, I'm going to give you something in return. Usually that thing that's in exchange is, I'm going to give you some new form of distribution for your application and for your business.\n\n(00:15:48):\nBut what essentially happens over time is that we go into Step Three, which is the closing period, which is at some point, all of these companies end up starting to lock down the platform. This tends to happen for reasons of monetization and growth. They either competitively don't want somebody to use their own platform to disrupt themselves. We saw that in the early Twitter days with things like Vine and Periscope, shutting those things down unceremoniously, or they need to find ways to monetize at a deeper and deeper level because all these companies, they have to grow. \n\n(00:16:32):\nGoogle's the classic example here of just more and more real estate has either been taken up by either ads or their own first-party applications. That's the key is they close it down by doing by one of a few things. They either shut it down entirely, two, they develop their own first-party applications to absorb the highest use cases, or three, they artificially depress the organic distribution that they gave you in the step prior to push you towards paid mechanisms in order to monetize. I think we should go through multiple examples here, but that's the core essence of the four steps. I'll pause there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):\nAwesome. So it's essentially figure out what's going to make, create defensibility long-term with your moat, bring everyone in, \"Hey, everyone, welcome to Facebook,\" everyone joins Facebook and then, okay, and all the developers build on Facebook to bring in more people on Facebook and then they're like, \"Okay, now you got to pay. There's a toll,\" but you love this so much and you're so hooked to all your friends that you're here, you may as well stick around. \n\nBrian Balfour (00:17:35):\nThat's right. That's right. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:35):\nAmazing. Okay, so yeah, a few examples would be great. \n\nBrian Balfour (00:17:38):\nYeah. You just hit on the first one. This is the first one that I always think about because this is where I learned about this cycle very early in my career. One of my first companies was during the Facebook platform boom, social gaming, all of those applications, and I lived the full cycle in a very short period. I lived the glory days and just the absolute horror days, and it was very painful, but this is exactly what happened. \n\n(00:18:06):\nLet's go through the four steps. Step Zero. Facebook was in a brutal battle with MySpace, Friendster and a few others. People forget this. People forget that there was actually a bunch of competitors at that time, and in fact those competitors were bigger than Facebook. They had more users back in 2007 when Facebook launched their third-party platform. But one of the key things is that Facebook was very early to the insight about the direct network effects in that there's going to create real lock-in that the more friends, the more of the global network that was on there, the more that it was just going to feed and hit this escape velocity.\n\n(00:18:44):\nAt the time they launched their platform, I think they were maybe one-fourth, one-fifth the size of something like MySpace or even Friendster, Orkut, these are some of the names at that time, but they opened up their third-party platform. What was the value exchange? They went to third-party developers and they said, \"Okay, we've created this canvas,\" they used to call it the canvas, and they were like, \"You can put anything in the canvas that you want: an app, a game, whatever. You can monetize in any way you want. We just want this sidebar real estate on the ads. That's what we're really interested in.\" There was this mad gold rush on that Facebook. \n\n(00:19:24):\nOh, sorry, the other part of that was, \"Not only will you put it there, we're going to give you access to all of these notification channels and feed to get distribution for your application.\" That was the other piece of it. You had this mad rush of developers coming in and you had this huge social application, social gaming boom. People just grew incredibly virally very fast, but eventually, essentially what happened over time is they kept peeling back that value exchange. \n\n(00:19:52):\nThey first were like, \"Ah, actually those dollars that you're making inside that canvas area, well, we want a percentage of that.\" So they changed that. And then they figured out their ad systems and then they started peeling back. They started suppressing access to all of the organic channels that they had. Eventually, they went all the way towards absorbing the highest use case into their own first-party platform, things like first-party applications, things like events, photos, all those types of things, and basically shut down the platform for dead. \n\n(00:20:30):\nThese companies that have basically built on top of this platform, the other thing is by the time they started closing all those things down, all those competitors that we talked about, they were so far ahead at that point because they had built off the back of all these developers coming, adding use cases, bringing more users onto the platform, identifying that moat. They were so far ahead, it didn't matter. It didn't matter what the other folks did at that point, and that's what really gives you confidence to start closing down. But there's so many other examples of this if we go through it. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):\nJust before you give other examples, just something I'll highlight here. One is the moat they identified in theory was the friend graph, I imagine?\n\nBrian Balfour (00:21:02):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:10):\nJust once we have all your friends, you're not going to want to go anywhere. I imagine it's also important to note, this is a natural thing that would happen if you build the thing and it grows and you're like, \"Oh, maybe we should change strategy.\" I imagine not everyone even knows this is what will happen and they organically evolve their strategy, or do you think everyone's just like, \"This is now going to be our plan, Step 1, 2, 3, 4?\"\n\nBrian Balfour (00:21:32):\nI think a different version of that question is I think some people could sit here and interpret this as all these folks are evil. That's not what I'm saying. That's actually not what I'm saying. I want to be very clear on that, because I think this cycle happens because of competitive and capitalistic dynamics and pressures. It's the same environment that enables creating amazing new companies here in the US. \n\n(00:22:01):\nAnd there's two sides of the coin. You go through this cycle because it's a competitive environment. You're trying to figure out how to beat competitors, and this is one of the strategies to beat competitors. But at some point you just have to continue growing. You have to grow those dollars. The market does not reward flat companies, if anybody's noticed. You have to keep growing, and so they have to keep finding ways to grow as well as prevent their own disruption. TThey can get so big and they can give access, so much access of distribution to new developers, they don't want to enable their own disruption as well as they need to keep growing. \n\n(00:22:38):\nMy guess is anybody who is sitting in their shoes owning their platform is going to follow the exact same playbook and the exact same reasoning. Look, sometimes it happens also because it actually is the best thing for the user. Facebook's channels did get super spammy and all of those things, and that was part of the reason they'd play this, but let's be honest, it wasn't the only reason. A lot of it was for these other reasons. I don't think it's evil. You just need to know how to play the game. That's competition, that's business. They're playing you, so you need to play them. That might be a little sadistic or something, but that is business. You're in a game of competition.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:23):\nEssentially, the incentives are pointing you in this direction. Capitalism, they say capitalism works, and so it'll pull everyone in this direction even if maybe they want to avoid it. Let's do a couple more examples.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:23:33):\nYeah, we'll go through them quick. I think everybody's probably... Google's an interesting one because it played out over a much longer period of time. Facebook happened over the course of about in five-ish years, something like that. Google did it very slowly over years, but same thing, early massive competition against Yahoo, I don't know, AltaVista, Lycos, you name them all. That was even before my time. They were first to really identify these data moats and incentivizing essentially web developers, content folks to optimize for their search algorithms, create this great distribution mechanism. Everybody's building content and everything for them, but over time, slowly but surely they did two things. \n\n(00:24:19):\nOne is more and more that real estate became ads that they were monetizing, so they're suppressing organic distribution in order to push people towards the ads, as well as absorbing a bunch of the highest value first-party use cases, things like travel as an example, or even restaurant search and all those types of things. The former Yelp CEO and founder has been out there saying a lot of things about these practices. So, same exact cycle.\n\n(00:24:48):\nMobile went through the exact same cycle. iOS created a new distribution mechanism. They had a ton of competition among different phones when they first started on. They found the defensibility was more about the apps, the data and all the developers, created the App Store, all of these types of things, but over time, we've seen more and more restrictions there on that front. \n\n(00:25:09):\nAnd then most recently, we've seen this happen in smaller places, too. LinkedIn, as an example, first went through this wave with company pages. They were like, \"Ah, companies, come on, promote your company page. Bring in more users, all that type of stuff, and then get all these followers.\" And then of course you get almost no distribution now through your company page because they're pushing you towards ads. And then they recently just did this with personal profiles, too, which is they really boosted distribution for individuals to create content for that platform. They then introduced the thought leader ad format, a way to monetize those individual posts, and now you've seen them really pull back on that organic distribution. \n\n(00:25:52):\nSo this happens in big forms and it happens even in smaller use cases as well, but once again, the steps of the cycle are exactly the same. The key part about this, too, is that the broad trend is that the cycles seem to be getting shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter, so you actually have a smaller amount of time to play the game.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):\nOkay, and the big a-ha here is, yes, this will end maybe not great for you, but there's this magical period when they're open to customers and users where you can grow like crazy because they want everyone to come and they give you a distribution. What you're saying essentially is ChatGPT, potentially some other platform, maybe is about to enter this moat.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:26:35):\nYeah. Well, before we get to ChatGPT, I think the natural reaction when you first realize this is, \"Screw them, I'm not playing that game.\" That's what I feel like most people, how they react. Because the unfortunate truth is that a lot of companies don't predict that last stage and end up in a really hard position. So many companies got completely killed during the crash of the Facebook social platform. Apple's 30% tax basically destroyed a bunch of types of applications and business models because you feel like it just wasn't margin-effective. So many companies built on SEO loops that are in serious, serious trouble right now if that's their only channel. So all these things. \n\n(00:27:33):\nI think the natural reaction is, why would I play this game if I'm a startup or a company? You can even see this with ChatGPT, as an example. They just launched these deep research connectors. One of them was my former company, HubSpot. If you sat inside HubSpot and you were just thinking in isolation, you would be like, well, why would I want to make all of my data accessible through ChatGPT and have all of the usage you start to accrue there? That doesn't really make sense in isolation. But we don't operate in isolation. Once again, we operate in a competitive environment.\n\n(00:28:11):\nWhat's going to happen is that if you don't do it, your competitors are going to certainly go to the new platform and your customer expectations change, and you have to rise to those customers' expectations. They're going to start expecting you to be in these new experiences and all these things. It ends up being a prisoner's dilemma, which is, there is no opting out of the game. You have to play the game. So it's better to be early than to be super late to this game, especially, especially if you are a startup. That's the key opportunity. \n\n(00:28:51):\nWe will talk a little bit more about how to play the game more, but it's better to be early as well as, then the key, the harder part about it is anticipating that last stage of the cycle and figuring out how to sequence away from something before that last cycle comes. I think that's the key part, but let me pause there and then I'll talk a little bit about ChatGPT and some of my reasoning behind that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:12):\nCool. So what you're saying is not only is there going to be this big opportunity to grow, if you don't take advantage of it, somebody in your space will. It's not only there's an opportunity, but this is something you need to do because you might miss the boat. \n\n(00:29:26):\nI think about companies like Zynga that grew on Facebook and then became massive companies. If they didn't do that, they would've missed the boat, someone else would've eaten that lunch. I don't know, I'm thinking about the Technology Bros podcast on Twitter right now, TBPN, where they basically figured out on Twitter you can create this livestream and you see it all day in your Twitter feed just like, hey, they're broadcasting, and it's a really cool distribution channel.\n\n(00:29:49):\nI think there's a big call to arms here almost of just the opportunities emerging and you basically need to pay attention. You can't opt out.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:29:58):\nThat's right. That's right. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:58):\nAwesome. \n\nBrian Balfour (00:29:58):\nExactly. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:00):\nOkay, so let's talk ChatGPT.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:30:02):\nLook, let's go through this cycle. Right now we're in that competitive environment. Like we said, all those players we talked about, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, all these folks, they are battling it out. We've seen this with the Talent Awards especially over the past month or so. There's no clear winner yet, but there's consensus around the category. \n\n(00:30:25):\nThe second thing is then, okay, what's the moat? Has the moat been identified? And who seems to have identified it the first or as furthest along? My hypothesis, and I think there's a lot more consensus around this now than there might've even been three months ago, is that the moat is about context and memory. These models by themselves, if you compare them side by side, they generate the same result, and so the actual difference-maker is which one has more of your context, because it's the context plus the model that produces the best output, and then that starts to accrue to this loop around memory. The more you use it, the more it's able to store a memory around you, which feeds more personalized context, which produces better outputs. It ends up being another one of those flywheels, another one of those loops. \n\n(00:31:16):\nIf you look at who's farthest on this, it definitely is ChatGPT. They were the first ones to memory. They've been investing a lot in these different types of data connectors, essentially context connectors, gathering all of this context, so you can really start to see it in the usage. \n\n(00:31:37):\nThe second thing is, and one of the pushbacks I've gotten on my prediction has been, well, what about Google and Gemini? They have so much distribution through Chrome and all of this other stuff. Deedy Das, who's a VC at Menlo Ventures, actually published some good data on retention of all of these different ones. \n\n(00:32:00):\nI think the second reason I predict ChatGPT is if you look at history once again, it was never the person who had the biggest distribution at the moment of time. It was the one that had the best retention and engagement. Google had the best retention and engagement over the others. Facebook was smaller, but had way better retention and engagement over the others, so on and so forth. \n\n(00:32:22):\nThe data that Deedy published clearly show that both the retention curves, which I know you and I have both written about at exhaustion, level off at significant portions higher than all the other platforms, as well as those retention curves have been shifting up dramatically over time, you can start to see the effects of memory. They have the very elusive smile curve, the ones that you just like. I've seen all of those dynamics very few times in my career, and they tend to be the folks like Slack and all of the big winners. It's just so elusive\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:04):\nThe smile curve, just to people who don't know what that is, is essentially retention goes up over time, it goes down a little bit, and then you come back to it and you use it more.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:33:12):\nYeah, that's right, and it's usually the result of some type of network of factor or something else, and it's an early indicator that that platform is on a trajectory to hit escape velocity. \n\n(00:33:27):\nThe third piece is that, and they haven't really hidden these, but there's all sorts of signals that they're about to launch a third-party platform. They've been hiring for a bunch of roles. I've seen multiple postings on product manager engineering roles, all that kind of stuff for, quote, unquote, \"agent platform\" and all those pieces. It feels pretty inevitable that one of these players will need to launch a third-party platform in order to serve all the possible use cases on these tools. There's going to be some value exchange, which is like, hey, for your agent to be effective, you probably need access to the context and memory and distribution, so there'll be some value which is, \"Integrate to us and we'll give you those three things which is going to drive more users and more usage,\" and we're going to go through the steps of the cycle. \n\n(00:34:21):\nYou can already see this. They're starting to form preferred partnerships with some of the bigger players, which paves the way for smaller third-party players. It lends credibility to the platform. It's like, well, if HubSpot and XYZ are doing it, then I should probably do it, too. It's like that type of mentality. But that's why I think out of all of these platforms, ChatGPT has the best shot right now. \n\n(00:34:47):\nAnd then, a bunch of folks are always like, \"Well, what about Claude? I really like Claude. I use Claude.\" Well, the problem with that is I think ChatGPT at this point has at least a 10x difference on MAU. If you're a developer and you're comparing those two platforms and you're looking at it and you're like, \"Well, ChatPT has 10x the number of users and better retention engagement,\" it's like, what's the logical choice of which one you're going to prioritize your scarce resources on? \n\n(00:35:20):\nThose are just some of the reasons that my prediction is on ChatGPT. In the blog post that I wrote about this, I actually then played my own devil's advocate and said, \"Okay, here are some reasons why it might not be ChatGPT,\" but I think we're in that part of the cycle. That's my prediction. I might be wrong in the prediction of ChatGPT, but I really think, I feel very confident we're going to see this cycle play out again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:45):\nTwo follow-up questions here. One is, what would be the backup if it's not ChatGPT? It sounds like it might be Gemini or Google?\n\nBrian Balfour (00:35:51):\nMy hypothesis of who's best-positioned but is not executing on it right now would actually be Apple-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:59):\nWhoa.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:35:59):\n... because through the devices, they basically can see everything. They have the ultimate view into your context. They're sitting at that level But I don't know what they're doing. From an execution standpoint, maybe they're going to surprise us with something crazy magical, but we haven't seen any external signals around this. That's probably just based on what real estate and where people live in the stack would own. \n\n(00:36:34):\nAnd then, I think right behind that, I would probably put Google because of owning the context of things like email and the distribution points of search and Chrome and Android and those types of pieces. A lot of people point to them, but my experience with all of their products, going back to the retention engagement thing, is that if we could take a look inside their metrics, I think what we would see is a bunch of fly-by users in their mouse. They're sprinkling the Gemini bucket everywhere. I've literally clicked on it accidentally multiple times. My guess is a huge portion of their mouse is exactly that of what's happening right now. Look, they just acquired a very talented team from Windsurf and from-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:30):\nAnd just the team. Just the team, part of the team.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:37:31):\nYeah. We'll see. Things are changing dramatically on a week-to-week basis, so we'll see if they're able to press those advantages in a very clear way. But I think the window is very small for them if ChatGPT plays their cards right, because they clearly have the escape velocity right now. If they just keep pressing that advantage in the right way, I think it's going to be very hard for Google to counter in the amount of time that's left\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:00):\nOn the Claude piece, I'll just throw this nugget out, I had Mike Krieger on the podcast, Head of Product, CPO, at Anthropic, and asked him just, \"You're losing to ChatGPT. How do you approach the future of Claude?\" He very specifically said, \"Yes, they've caught lightning in a bottle. This is just going to win based on what I've seen at Instagram. So we are specifically focusing on what is Anthropic and Claude incredibly good at, which is developer tools, coding, backend stuff.\" So they're actually leaning more and more into that. If you've seen the revenue recently, they're making, I don't know, approaching 10 billion a year or some crazy amount of money. They're actually doing super well, just in a different use case.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:38:40):\nI'm glad you mentioned this because this brings up something that we skipped, which is, there are smaller platforms that have existed and will also emerge in this environment as well, and that's what you're alluding to. This tends to happen is things end up growing into more niches. Even if you look at social, like LinkedIn emerged as a subset of the social world, but even on these smaller platforms, these new distribution channels, they go through the same cycle. \n\n(00:39:12):\nI'll give something, really a very opposite example of the ones that I gave. Look at the platform Udemy. They are a platform for course creators. I don't know if most people know this, but when they started, their rev share to creators was something like 80% to creators. They started very high. That brought on all the course creators, got their whole marketplace going, so on and so forth. I believe it was about a year ago they announced that they're essentially pushing that rev share down to somewhere between 15 and 20%. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:48):\nWow.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:39:48):\nThey're somewhere at 25 and 30%. Another example of they close down organic distribution in order to monetize, all that kind of stuff. The same thing will happen in this AI world. Cursor, it's very clear Cursor's on the path to also probably create some type of agent platform for developers. That'll be a smaller ecosystem to play in for some products. It feels like everybody has the same strategy at this point is everybody wants to launch an agent platform. I imagine some of these other horizontal productivity tools will do the same thing, maybe like a Notion or an Airtable or a Monday.com or something like that. \n\n(00:40:31):\nThere will be smaller platforms that will emerge, and they will follow the exact same cycle that I'm also discussing, but in terms of the biggest consumer one, that's where I think ChatGPT has probably the most escape velocity and others will focus on different areas. Just to be clear, I love Claude. I actually use both Claude and ChatGPT-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:58):\nSame.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:40:59):\n... for different things. I have lots of love to go around for all these tools. My prediction has no bearing on which product I like the most right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:07):\nAlso love Claude. So the key point here you're making is that there's almost a number of distribution channels emerging. Many of them will be niche. I think of LinkedIn. LinkedIn for me has a very targeted audience, for folks that listen to this podcast. Even though it's not, I don't know, Google or Facebook or whatever, it's still incredibly valuable for this specific thing that I do.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:41:30):\nFor sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:31):\nI think this is even more interesting that there's going to be a number of distribution channels that emerge out of this whole AI wave. \n\n(00:41:37):\nThe other thing I'll note real quick, you mentioned this idea of everyone's building agents. I just had Brett Taylor on the podcast who's building Sierra, and he made me realize why everyone's building agents partly. One is because the outcome-based pricing that you can charge with agents is incredible because, one, you can actually attribute their impact on your business's ROI. You can actually see this is saving an agent $15 because it solved the case. And it's attributable and it's autonomous. It's just doing it on its own. With that, you can charge per outcome. You can say, \"We'll charge you a dollar,\" every time it solves an issue. So the monetization opportunity is huge and the margins go up like crazy.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:42:19):\nCan I just ask a question about that?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:21):\nYeah. \n\nBrian Balfour (00:42:22):\nDo you think that has longevity in the sense that... That makes sense in the current environment that we're sitting in right now because people are comparing these outcomes relative to what it costs them today with pure humans. But once again, competition comes in at some point, and so that feels like that creates a pretty ripe opportunity to undercut and come into... and then you have the disruption theory playing out as well. It obviously depends on the infrastructure costs and compute costs to run these things, but I just wonder how much of that is temporary versus something that'll be long-term.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:07):\nSo you're saying that dollar will come down to 50 cents, 25 cents, or you're saying someone's going to come with a whole new business model and disrupt that whole approach?\n\nBrian Balfour (00:43:15):\nMore the first, yeah. It's just competition erodes that away, essentially, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:19):\nYeah, that's a good point. So margins will be higher for a while, and then they'll come down.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:43:24):\nUnless there's something else that creates a durable pricing power, right? \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:31):\nYeah. \n\nBrian Balfour (00:43:34):\nThat's probably the second piece of this. Yeah, that's probably the second piece of that hypothesis, I feel like. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:38):\nYeah. I guess the opportunity there, the moat would be the data, similar to how Cursor is collecting more feedback on what people want in their code suggestions, maybe in theory CRF and has more and more data over time, and there's this network effect-\n\nBrian Balfour (00:43:53):\nYeah. That's right. Let me revise that. I believe in that as long as it's paired with-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:59):\nSome moat?\n\nBrian Balfour (00:44:00):\n... this second piece. Otherwise, it gets competed away.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:03):\nGood tangent. Okay, one more question. What is your prediction on timeline for when the opportunity appears, and what do you predict, as of the day we're recording, what do you predict will be the next couple things that ChatGPT, and let's just focus on that, releases to start to open up this platform to get everyone in there?\n\nBrian Balfour (00:44:26):\nWell, look, I'll first give the disclaimer that I feel like any thoughts on timing in the AI market have been very hard to predict. It's always shorter. That's where we should buy us. It's always shorter than you think of when something's going to happen. That's what it's felt like from the seat that I've been sitting in. But my guess is this: we're going to see the next major steps of this play out over the next six months. \n\n(00:44:57):\nI think we just saw one of the pieces drop around this, which was, ChatGPT's recently launched Agent mode. It's kind of a general-purpose agent, and I think that starts to introduce all of the users to using agents and they're figuring out and placing it in the different tiers and business models, all of those pieces. But it's likely that no general-purpose agent is going to fulfill all of the infinite use cases successfully. There's two reasons for this.\n\n(00:45:30):\nUsers struggle with horizontal tools. They can do everything, and that's exactly why they struggle to adopt, and so they typically need more specific entry points. But also, the more specific use case you get, sometimes you need specific UI, specific data, other specific ingredients to properly fulfill that use case for a given audience. I think their Agent mode was a step in this direction. \n\n(00:45:56):\nWhat I would expect to see play out next is that they will either launch, they will announce the platform with preferred partners, or what they're going to announce first is basically a set of preferred partners, the guinea pigs, an initial 10 to 20 folks that are bringing agents to their platform. What that does is essentially, once again, it's a credibility card. You do special deals with some brand names to give the platform credibility, and it creates this desire from everybody else to come on to the platform.\n\n(00:46:37):\nAnd then the step after that is starting to opening up the platform. This is where we'll really start to figure out what this game is going to look like because they basically have to define what the value exchange is. What are they giving you access to, and what are they incentivizing you with to come onto the platform? That's one version of it.\n\n(00:46:58):\nThe other version of it is just the replacement to search. You can also see them starting to make more moves here, which is deeper attribution in some of the results, those types of pieces. They're bringing in shopping. That's one of their recent announcements as well, native into the UI. Essentially they will form new monetization mechanisms around that stuff as well. That's actually going to be very important because, going back to the moat around memory and context is that they will want to incentivize as many people to their free tier as possible, but given the cost of AI, they have to cover it somehow, so they're going to need some monetization mechanisms. The more that they can cover that free usage with things that aren't subscriptions, I think that probably also feeds the moat.\n\n(00:47:51):\nI think those are some of the next steps on two different vectors, more of a third-party developer platform and more of the content, whatever you want to call it, AEO, GEO. I don't know what acronym is we've all decided on yet. Let me know if we have. I think those will be the next steps that we'll see. \n\n(00:48:13):\nNow, that's what I think for ChatGPT. I think the thing that we should talk about is, essentially what I would advise folks, especially startups, is you're placing bets. At this part of the cycle, you're placing bets. The winner is 100% guaranteed, as I mentioned, and so you essentially at some point will need to make some decisions about where to place your bets.\n\n(00:48:37):\nIn the Facebook days, all those other social networks, they also came out with their own platforms. iOS had Android and some failed initiatives from Windows. I don't even remember what that platform was called. You can look back and whoever placed through... the iPhone was actually a very, and iOS is a good one, which is, if you had only aligned your bets to Android, you probably lost. If you somehow found a way to play on both ecosystems, you could be a winner. But if you only aligned to iOS, you could also be a winner. You had to have iOS as part of your betting strategy in order to win. \n\n(00:49:21):\nEverybody right now, you're probably at this cycle and you're trying to figure out, well, everybody will need to figure out where are they going to place their chips. How are they going to bet? Depending on how you bet really depends on what your current position is in the marketplace. If you're a late-stage startup, let's start with that, or a late-stage company, you can afford the luxury to place multiple bets and spread your chips and wait it out a little bit to see who the winner is, and then really throw your muscle behind that winner. You have that luxury a little bit. But the risk of that, the risk of that is that sometimes the incumbents wait too long to make that decision, and that's the key question they will need to answer. \n\n(00:50:08):\nThe key question for startups is totally different. You don't have the luxury to spread your chips. You have to go all in. You have to choose one and go all in. You have scarce resources, scarce attention from the market. It's a totally different ballgame. Higher risk, higher reward, for sure. That's part of the betting strategy for startups. That's what you have to do is you have to figure out your betting strategy, and then we can talk a little bit about how you might evaluate and pick the right course for you. That's where we're all at right now is we just entered the casino, we just put some cash in for some chips, and now we've got to figure out what tables and where to place those chips.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:56):\nI love this analogy. Just to be crystal clear about what listeners should do, what founders should do, what product teams should do, the advice here essentially is integrate with ChatGPT, maybe Gemini, maybe if Apple has something, actually integrate with what they launch. It could be a login thing, could be a search thing, could be a connect and suck up your memory in context. The advice here is you need to do this because this is potentially the way that most companies will start to grow and your competitors may overtake you.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:51:30):\nYeah. If we had to really simplify it, it's essentially, play the game. Don't opt out of the game. Don't trick yourself into thinking that you can't play the game. That's number one. Number two, no matter who you bet on, just make it a focused bet. Because if you look back, all the failures are the ones that tried to play multiple games at once with scarce resources, and that just tends to never work if you're an early-stage startup. So those two things: play the game, put a focused bet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:03):\nThis episode is brought to you by Miro. Every day, new headlines are scaring us about all the ways that AI is coming for our jobs, creating a lot of anxiety and fear, but a recent survey from Miro tells a different story. 76% of people believe that AI can benefit the role, but over 50% of people struggle to know when to use it. Enter Miro's Innovation Workspace, an intelligent platform that brings people and AI together in a shared space to get great work done. \n\n(00:52:29):\nMiro has been empowering teams to transform bold ideas into the next big thing for over a decade. Today, they're at the forefront of bringing products to market even faster by unleashing the combined power of AI and human potential. Guests of this podcast often share Miro templates. I use it all the time to brainstorm ideas with my team. Teams especially can work with Miro AI to turn the unstructured data, like sticky notes or screenshots, into usable diagrams, product briefs, data tables, and prototypes in minutes.\n\n(00:52:58):\nYou don't have to be an AI master or to toggle yet another tool. The work you're already doing in Miro's canvas is the prompt. Help your teams get great work done with Miro. Check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O dot com slash Lenny. \n\n(00:53:14):\nSo you were Head of Growth at HubSpot for a long time, and you gave that as an example, HubSpot, why would they integrate, why would they give away all their data so that ChatGPT can suck it up, and you never have to go to HubSpot, you're just working through their agent. Would you at HubSpot be like, \"Yes, we got to do this. This is the game we got to play\"?\n\nBrian Balfour (00:53:31):\nYeah, 100%, and that's exactly what I think you see them doing. Look, to be very clear, I have not talked to anybody at HubSpot about this. I have not talked to Dharmesh about this, but Dharmesh I think has also published about this. The right thing to do is, essentially, even though you understand how the cycle plays out and you don't necessarily understand what your exit strategy is once you get out, it's better to be early, know that you need to figure out an exit strategy and figure out that exit strategy along the way versus waiting and then being super late and then know what the exit strategy is. \n\n(00:54:15):\nI think that's exactly what you see them doing. They're trying to be as early to this stuff as possible. I think it's a pretty smart play, even though we might not necessarily see what the exit strategy is out of this cycle for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:34):\nGoing back to that amazing quote that you shared at the beginning of the conversation by, I think it was Alex Rampell?\n\nBrian Balfour (00:54:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:40):\nOf that startups win by finding a distribution channel before the incumbent copies them. What you're saying here is this is the opportunity for startups to disrupt an incumbent. This is the opportunity for someone to disrupt Salesforce, I don't know, ServiceNow, all these guys that have been around for a long time.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:54:59):\nYeah, it's going to be one of the major ones. Now look, you've already seen players that have been able to hit this escape velocity, the Cursors and stuff of the world. Once again, there's multiple ways to hit that escape velocity, but this is one of the major ways to do it is to basically hitch yourself to a new platform. Look, you did it yourself, actually. You hitched yourself to Substack super early. You took a focused bet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:27):\nI was going to say that. \n\nBrian Balfour (00:55:28):\nYeah, yeah. I don't know why that just hit me, but you took a focused bet and you've benefited from it in a disproportional way than those that came later. I think that's actually a great meta example here as I sit here and think about this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:44):\nYeah, that's actually the way I thought about when I was moving to Substack. I feel like there's this wave rising and I want to ride this wave, even if maybe it's not the best place or they take a cut, all that stuff. But it worked out really well. \n\nBrian Balfour (00:55:55):\nThat's right. I think it worked out very well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:58):\nIt worked out really well. To be honest, it felt like it was too late when I started six years ago.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:55:58):\nIt felt too late?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:05):\nYes.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:56:06):\nOh, say more about that. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:07):\nIt always feels too late, I think, to people that join... Silicon Valley, or sorry, Marc Andreessen has this famous quote. He's like, \"I came to Silicon Valley in the '80s. I thought it was over, I was too late. I missed all the opportunities.\" That's fair. There was just a lot of newsletters. They were doing really well. Millions of subscribers. I'm like...\n\nBrian Balfour (00:56:24):\nAnd what do you say to people now who want to join Substack?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:27):\n\"Learn from this example.\" A lot of times when people think that it's too late, it's definitely not too late, and it's always only just getting started. Especially if you're on Twitter all day listening to podcasts like this where we're surrounded with this bubble of everyone talking about something, when in reality, 1% of people know anything about what you're hearing about every day.\n\nBrian Balfour (00:56:45):\nYeah. Yeah, that's so interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:47):\nOkay, so coming back to the advice, say someone is sitting there and talking to their manager like, \"Brian just shared all this mind-blowing advice. We got to pick our battles, we got to pick our platform,\" what would your advice be for them to decide where to place their bets?\n\nBrian Balfour (00:57:06):\nI think this is a great question because, once again, put my personal prediction aside for a second, and I would encourage everybody to think about it from first principles from who their audience is, what their product is, what stage of company they're at, their current strengths and weaknesses, you got to take all this into account, but if I had to boil it down to a few criteria, the main things I would think about is, when you're looking at new distribution channels and new platforms to choose on, one, going back to what we said before is the better signal is retention and depth of engagement of the users on this platform than it is pure user level like MAU or some other number of signups, one of those vanity metrics. Look at that number one. \n\n(00:57:51):\nNumber two is, there's some element of user quality and ability to monetize the users on this platform. I think the starkest example here would be iOS and Android. Even today it's something like Android has 70-some percent of devices, but only 30% of the market share by dollars, and it's the exact flip for iOS. It goes back to what we were talking about earlier, which was, if you bet on Android only, you probably lost, but if you bet on iOS only, even though smaller user base, you were still able to parlay that into a win later. \n\n(00:58:31):\nThe third thing to look at is, as these platforms emerge, just analyze what the value exchange is. What are they giving you to incentivize you to develop on their platform? All these platforms, it's a bit of a game of whoever understands the rules and how to arbitrage the rules the best tend to be the ones with the edge and figure that out.\n\n(00:58:58):\nAnd then finally, fourth on my criteria would be pure scale. Obviously, even if you have those other three, but there's a 200x difference in scale and momentum, obviously you probably have to choose the bigger platform. \n\n(00:59:20):\nBut last but not least is as you go through these criteria, these are how you think through entering the game. Once you enter the game, then you immediately need to move to starting to think about how do you exit the game. Knowing once again that that last step is going to come at some point in the future, that there's going to be some closure for monetization, then that's where you have to start thinking through your strategy to exit. \n\n(00:59:47):\nThat comes down to things like, okay, well how are you going to own an important part of the user experience or workflow? Or how are you going to accumulate specialized data in context that the major platforms don't have? Or how do you create different types of micro network effects? All of these types of things. So just once again, there is the entrance criteria, but once you figure that out and you feel like you're in the game, you immediately need to move towards, okay, what's my exit plan here, knowing this is all coming.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):\nIt's interesting that another way to think about this model you've described as building, the strategy of building on top of LLMs and becoming a GPT wrapper. Because essentially this tech allows you to, say, create a cursor that is incredible, and then you could argue, oh, you're just going to be this wrapper, and they're getting all the money here, everyone can copy you. What's your defensibility long-term? The answer is, what is the moat you will build over time sitting on top of this thing that will make you more and more valuable on term and not have to rely on this thing? It feels like you could use the same framework for building a GPT wrapper business, to use that euphemism.\n\nBrian Balfour (01:01:02):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:04):\nSay someone is sitting there today. Is there anything they can do to start making a bet? Is it simply creating an MCP that allows LLMs to suck in your data? Is that the one thing you could do today? Is there anything else that's available today to start using these platforms, or is it just a little too early and they haven't released the good stuff yet? \n\nBrian Balfour (01:01:25):\nIt might be just a tad too early. We're right on that edge. Some of the questions I'm asking myself is, I'm going through all of these players and where our customers and target audience live, and I'm asking myself the question, okay, if this player launched some type of platform, how would we evaluate it? So on and so forth. \n\n(01:01:51):\nYou can also try to cozy up to these folks. I would place a large portion of my net worth right now that if we could sit in the OpenAI offices at that front desk, that they are having meetings with potential preferred developers talking about this, we could probably sit there and log it. I do think some people are going to be in a place to develop preferred relationships and make a note. If you're in that spot, then you should definitely play that card. A lot of early-stage startups will be in that place.\n\n(01:02:30):\nOther than that, I would say, once they launch these platforms, you can't do much else, so you really know what the value exchange is and what they're going to expose for you, but also just be prepared to turn your strategy on a dime and go all in. I think that's probably one of the hardest parts of this is that these things emerge and you have to capitalize extremely quickly. A lot of times, it's hard for leaders to do that because they don't want to create a feeling of whiplash into the unknown, and we've got all these projects in play. You know all the things. I think that's probably the last part of what we can be doing right now versus just staying on top of everything as it emerges.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:14):\nAs you were talking, this reminded me, I recently noticed that ChatGPT is driving me to my newsletter more traffic than Twitter, and I feel like that recently shifted. I didn't even know this was a thing until I just started looking through my referrals. I'm like, \"ChatGPT? What the hell is going on there?\" It's like a different version of what you're talking about, but essentially, in theory I could block ChatGPT from... I don't know. I don't even know if I can from... including all my stuff. \n\nBrian Balfour (01:03:39):\nYou can in Substack now, yeah. I just saw that setting in there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:42):\nOkay. Oh, interesting. That's the similar kind of decision is, is it better for me for it to be recommending my stuff and telling people, \"Hey, go check this thing out,\" or is it better to block it off? I think, per your point, and this is the way I felt, take it all. It's good. In that, it's better that it's from Lenny's newsletter than something else. So someone else will come in and eat that market share.\n\nBrian Balfour (01:04:06):\nYeah, that's right. If you don't do it, somebody else is. I think that's also what all the major media publishers are really contending with right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):\nI guess I need a licensing deal with New York check. Anyway. Okay. I want to go on a totally different tangent. We weren't planning to talk about this. I know that I said this, we're going to be fully focused on this one topic, but there's something you mentioned to me before we start recording that I think will be really interesting to a lot of people. \n\n(01:04:34):\nYou guys at Reforge are now building actual SaaS products that people can buy. It's not just courses. I don't know if people know that, but let's make sure people understand this. There's actually products for product teams, so maybe just explain that briefly, but the thing that I think is really interesting here is you work with a lot of companies now selling them AI tools, and you have noticed a very big difference between the companies that are really good at adopting AI tools and seeing gains from them from those that don't. Talk about just what you see there, and because this is in theory going to be really helpful to companies that are struggling with adopting AI tools and seeing gains.\n\nBrian Balfour (01:05:09):\nJust to quickly explain that transition so it makes sense for people, which is, I started Reforge just with the interest that there was all these incredible leaders out there growing on the front lines of some of the fastest growing companies and they have all this amazing knowledge and I wanted to encode it in useful and practical ways for others. That took the form of courses and content and product, all that kind of stuff at the beginning. Along the way, everybody kept asking us to essentially build the tools to implement what we taught. Because with anything, you can learn as much as you want. You can listen to my podcast, your podcast, Lenny, whatever, as much as you want, but if you don't actually put it into action and implement it, then it's not really going to create value. \n\n(01:05:56):\nPeople kept asking us to really close that gap and we said no for the longest time. And then about a couple of years ago when AI really started to inflect, it really created this moment that, oh, wow, now there's this opportunity not just to encode this knowledge into content, but also into the products, the software, the tools that we use ourselves. So we started to take a really big bet on that and started to develop this new platform for AI-native product teams. \n\n(01:06:22):\nThe first product we launched is called Reforge Insights, which acts like your AI product researcher, aggregates all the feedback from all the sources, uses AI to analyze it, helps you explore it, but also will start to identify what are the gaps, the things that you don't have in your feedback today and auto-generate the research to go gather all those new insights, so complete the full cycle. We're going to launch two other major products as part of this platform before the end of the year, but we'll save that for some future episode. \n\n(01:06:53):\nSo that's been our journey. We've seen inside companies that are going through this transformation from two perspectives. One is obviously selling in that tools, but the other perspective is, for 10 years, companies have been coming to us to help them try some sort of transformation with our learning product.\n\n(01:07:15):\nMost companies are not coming to us to just throw a bunch of courses in front of, they're trying to solve some big business problem, some transformation. Now that used to be things like, we've got to figure out this growth thing, or I'm going from sales-led to product-led, or I have more project managers and I need to transition to product managers, something like that. There's some business problem, they're going through some transformation and they saw us as part of that transformation and we got to partake in quite a few of those types of transformation.\n\n(01:07:50):\nNow of course, the transformation that everybody's going through is, okay, how do I become more AI-native? How do I adopt this stuff? We've seen a pretty wide spectrum and from both perspectives of how companies are approaching this. I'm sure everybody's seen that AI, we've been calling them the AI manifesto memos from CEOs out there that proclaim, \"We are now AI-native,\" in some grandiose way, but behind the scenes, there's actually some incredibly stark differences in the actual teeth of what backs up those memos and backs up those executive decrees that we should all be AI.\n\n(01:08:43):\nJust to point out a few of them, which is, one is that I think the most impactful thing that you can do is form really hard constraints. There's other parts that's like, okay, you want to communicate this, you want to establish an owner of who's going to drive this, you want to build an incentives and rewards, and you see this all playing out in things like building it into your career ladders, or some people are starting to introduce this as questions into their performance reviews, all those types of pieces. But the thing that is actually moving the needle are the companies that are defining incredibly hard constraints. \n\n(01:09:30):\nOne company that we worked with developed this constraint that they benchmarked against other companies of their revenue size and the team sizes for those stages, and they set a benchmark that we will be one-fifth, each of our functions will be one-fifth the size. What that did is it created a constraint that you couldn't hire above that level, and it forced people to essentially find ways to adopt AI and do things to replace that. So that was one. \n\n(01:10:01):\nYou've seen these other ones, I can't remember from what company, that might've been Shopify or another, who was like, you are not allowed new headcount until you prove to us that you are not able to accomplish this with AI. That's another hard constraint. But you also see these other constraints on a smaller level, which is executives saying, \"I will not do a product review or review a PRD unless it comes with three prototypes.\" Something like that. That's the hardest one. Those are the biggest constraints.\n\n(01:10:33):\nI think the biggest change that I'm seeing is, and the things that separates out the top few percent making this change and everybody else is essentially making the hardest decisions, and that hardest decision is going to come down to exiting people. In every transformation, what we see is essentially three groups of folks. We call them the catalysts, the people leading the charge, the people who are experimenting, doing this on their own time, all that kind of stuff. \n\n(01:11:07):\nYou then have what we call your converts. These are folks that will make the transformation, they will adapt, but they need structure, they need permission, they need a clear outline, they need a clear plan. I don't say this in a negative way, it's just that that's how some people operate. That's where things like all the things that we were talking about before, which was the decree, the permission, the clear budgets, the rewards, all of those types of things. \n\n(01:11:37):\nBut then, inevitably you have a certain percentage that are anchors. They're dragging their feet, they're silently creating friction in the background and all those pieces. There's a big difference in how I think companies are treating and thinking about their strategy for those folks. One group is like, ah, we're going to work with them very passively. Others have set a hard deadline. They're either going to make the transformation by X date or we're going to exit folks. \n\n(01:12:13):\nA lot of people look at this as being really harsh. I think a lot of people would think that, especially individuals, but let me explain it from more of a CEO perspective. A lot of these companies are seeing this AI transformation, the ones that are taking it more seriously, as this isn't adopting new tools, this isn't a light change. This is a fundamental culture change of how we operate as a company. You can't have 20, 30%, whatever meaningful number of it is of your company trying to operate in a completely different way, in a completely different culture.\n\n(01:12:48):\nCultures thrive on density, and that's why there's sometimes the best ones feel like cults. As a result, from that perspective, it's like, hey, for us to be successful, for this to be the best thing for all employees, we all need to be operating around the same culture of principles and stuff. If that's not you anymore, then we're defining a plan to exit it.\n\n(01:13:16):\nI would say that less than 10% of companies we see are taking this hard stance, but I would say they are probably the ones that are farthest along getting the most adoption and are seeing the most results of the ones that are taking those hard stances. There's a bunch of other stuff I could talk about, but that's the high level of what we've seen across a bunch of different companies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:37):\nThat is incredibly interesting. I'm glad we went there. I have a newsletter post coming out soon, probably before this episode, that touches on a lot of advice along these lines. I am excited for you guys to keep seeing these insights into companies and sharing more of this because this is I think what a lot of people are looking for, just like things aren't quite clicking at our company. We keep hearing everyone just getting so much more productive. All these companies are running more efficiently and it's not working here. I think that's the kind of advice a lot of people are looking for, so thank you for sharing all that. \n\n(01:14:09):\nBrian, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on? Anything else you wanted to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nBrian Balfour (01:14:15):\nWell, actually, just a couple more points on this topic we should go. There's probably two more things I would say about this. One is that, if you're a CEO listening to this, I would say that most CEOs or most executives are incredibly disconnected from the actual AI adoption taking place inside their companies. I think a lot of executives who have done these decrees and all that kind of stuff think it's happening naturally, but we talked to both groups. We talked to tons of end users and we talked to tons of executives. \n\n(01:14:49):\nThe story we hear from the end users, the PMs, the eng, all that kind of stuff that we talk to using all this stuff, one of the main questions we ask them is, if we're talking to somebody who's picked up a prototyping tool, say, \"Well, how many other people on the product and design team are using this?\" Almost 90% of the time it's like, \"Ah, it's me and this one other person,\" and everybody else hasn't taken it up. So there's a huge disconnect. \n\n(01:15:17):\nWe heard one story, and I can't say the name, but it's a company we all know. It's a major tech company, a tech-forward company. CEO's been out there talking about being AI-native. We talked to one of their principal PMs. Person was early to the prototyping tools. This person shared a prototype with the designer, the eng manager. The designer and eng manager escalated it to the VPs. It caused this whole conversation. Month later, it was still stalling out. This PM happened to then attend a happy hour where the CEO was at and approached the CEO and told the CEO about the experiment that they were running with prototyping and stuff, and the CEO was like, \"This is fantastic. Where is it at right now?\" He was like, \"Oh, well, X, Y, Z happened.\" The CEO had no idea. And then the CEO is like, \"Okay, let me take care of it,\" and then the next day, it happened.\n\n(01:16:18):\nSo one is that you have to go to the ground floor on this stuff. Some of the best companies like Shopify and others are measuring actual adoption and usage. They've gone to the extreme on that front to get a bunch of signals and close to the ground. It just goes to show that this is... I don't think we want to talk about going founder mode, but the reality is it's not just about getting into the weeds of your product, but with something this sizable, you got to get into the weeds of the transformation to really understand what's going on and adopt it. That's point number one. \n\n(01:16:58):\nThe second point I would say is Fareed, we do this podcast called Unsolicited Feedback, Fareed Mosavat had this great quote on it. He was like, \"Look, your output is constrained by the slowest part of your system.\" That stuck in my head because it's absolutely true. If you think about AI adoption as a system, there's all parts of the system that could be slowing adoption. It might be that people don't feel permission or they don't have the budget or they don't have the knowledge, all these types of things. In a lot of these cases, it's things like IT, legal, procurement are the slowest part of the friction and are setting the pace of all of this output.\n\n(01:17:43):\nYou can also see this in just product teams. There's been all this talk about product managers are becoming the new bottleneck because engineers are speeding up. Well, that's because people are speeding up one part of the product system and not the other parts, which makes sense. They adopted all of this tooling for engineers because they're the biggest head count and the most expensive and all that type of stuff, but product is an output of design, PMs, and engineering. The system is there not to produce code, it's to ship product, and shipping product is the function of those three things. \n\n(01:18:19):\nIf you just accelerate one part of the system, you're just going to move to the bottleneck to another part and your actual product output, the output of the system doesn't accelerate, either. I think people have to really understand those two things: what is actually happening on the ground floor, and what is the slowest part? What is the thing that is causing the slowest part of the adoption? Just attack them ruthlessly if you're really serious about making this transition.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:47):\nWhat a wild time we're living through. So much changes. \n\nBrian Balfour (01:18:48):\nIt is a wild time, yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:51):\nAll these ways that we're all so used to, okay, this is how we do it.\n\nBrian Balfour (01:18:54):\nYeah. It's exciting and exhausting at the same time, man. That's how I think about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):\nSuch a simple way of describing the road.\n\nBrian Balfour (01:19:02):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:03):\nOh, my God. Okay, Brian, is there anything else before we get through our very exciting lightning round?\n\nBrian Balfour (01:19:08):\nThat's it. Let's do lightning round.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:09):\nHere we go.\n\nBrian Balfour (01:19:09):\nZap, zap, zap. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:11):\nDing, ding, ding. All right, Brian, I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nBrian Balfour (01:19:14):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:14):\nOkay. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nBrian Balfour (01:19:20):\nMy God honest answer is that I have not had the time to finish an entire book since I had my second child. From a complete book standpoint, I have not been able to... Things that I actively read on a regular basis, just other content out there that I'll throw out there is, gosh, Jamin Ball from Altimeter Capital writes this great newsletter called Clouded Judgment, which is mixture of market thoughts as well as market stats. That's really useful to help me keep a pulse on the market. I was just reading through some stuff from NFX that's been pretty good lately on all of this. I know James Currier and I, we lived a lot of the same cycles through social and stuff, so I tend to identify with that. I don't know, those are two things that I love reading.\n\n(01:20:19):\nSorry, I'll give one more shout-out to a different podcast, which is from two guys at Spark Capital, Nabeel Hyatt, which I know from my early Boston days, and Fraser, sorry, I'm blanking on the last name right now, who was Head of Product at OpenAI, and they've got a great format where it's just those two riffing on some ideas and stuff. I highly suggest that one. I like that one a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):\nHere's my reading tip that has changed my reading habits. Bryan Johnson, the longevity guy, he has this advice for better sleep, which includes, before you go to sleep, read for 10 minutes in bed. \n\nBrian Balfour (01:20:58):\nIt does put you to sleep. I don't feel like I retain anything that I read that close to bed, though. Do you feel like you retain it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:05):\nI do, I do. I'm reading fiction. It's nonfiction. Sorry. You want to read something calm, not like I'm learning. I'm reading fiction and it's really nice. Knowing that this is going to help me sleep better makes me motivated. \n\nBrian Balfour (01:21:17):\nThere's an incentive. There's a reward there. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:19):\nThe reward, yeah. \n\nBrian Balfour (01:21:20):\nThey're talking about rewards and creating behavior change, yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:23):\nExactly. The reason to do it is this whole thing is you want to get to low resting heart rate, and that helps lower your resting heart. \n\nBrian Balfour (01:21:29):\nI've got some other sleep tips on that front if you want to go down that path, but we'll save that for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:34):\nPlease, for the third podcast. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really recently enjoyed?\n\nBrian Balfour (01:21:40):\nIt's not new, but I just rewatched Silicon Valley that I hadn't watched in a number of times. It's painful because the first few seasons, I went through almost every one of those moments in my first startup, like hiring the gray-haired CEO, the funding falling through at the last second, all the crazy stuff, but going back and watching that, there's just some extra nuances and stuff that I feel like they wrote really well that I thought was really good. I've really been watching that. \n\n(01:22:16):\nThe other thing that I've watched is just more of a just pure entertainment, calming thing, turn the brain off is Owen Wilson's new show on Apple TV, Stick, which is about him as a former professional golfer and all that. I won't ruin the show and stuff, but it's a very nice calming, little bit fun type of show. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):\nI've been seeing that on my Apple TV. Maybe I should check it out. Good tip. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? It could be a gadget, it could be a app on your phone, it could be something in your computer. It could be nothing at all.\n\nBrian Balfour (01:22:54):\nYou can't see it, but I just changed my whole setup. Now I have a UltraGear super-wide curved screen with a very nice standing desk from, I believe it's called Ergonofis. Er.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:13):\nErgonofis?\n\nBrian Balfour (01:23:15):\nYes. I think it's Ergonofis, E-R-G-O-N-O-F-I-S. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:21):\nAll right. \n\nBrian Balfour (01:23:21):\nIt's a very nice, sleek standing desk. Very stable, very quiet. Very much enjoy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:29):\nExcellent tip. And the curved monitor, very cool. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life, something you share with folks, something that you think about when times are hard or just generally?\n\nBrian Balfour (01:23:42):\nLook, it's a little cliche at this point, but it's somewhere around here, I used to have the quote printed out about the man in the arena. Especially in times like this where so many things are changing and there's so much competition, but so much opportunity for great, I really both respect and enjoy the game and spending time with folks that are in the arena figuring this stuff out, tinkering with things. That's what I keep coming back to, especially been at Reforge for 10 years, that's a good portion of my life, and we've gone through some great periods and some tough periods, so I tend to come back to that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:30):\nAnd that's what always separated Reforge from so much other content and advice is it's people in the arena sharing their wisdom, not just a bunch of influencers. It's sad that Chamath made that quote so cringey.\n\nBrian Balfour (01:24:41):\nI know, I know. That's why I said it's a little cliche cringe right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:47):\nScrewed it up for everyone. \n\nBrian Balfour (01:24:49):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:49):\nFinal question. Brian, you don't know this, but your parenting advice on Adam Fishman's podcast-\n\nBrian Balfour (01:24:54):\nOh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:55):\n... really impacted my parenting philosophy, specifically this line you had about independence.\n\nBrian Balfour (01:25:01):\nOh, yes. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:02):\nI'd love for you to just share that insight about how you think about raising kids,\n\nBrian Balfour (01:25:08):\nI wish I could remember where I grabbed this from so I could attribute it properly, but basically, the philosophy is, if you think about going from when they're born until they're essentially 18 and leave the home, your job as a parent is to essentially make them more and more independent. What that involves is continuously looking for opportunities for them to make even bigger and riskier decisions for themselves as they grow up and you're there as a support to those decisions, but letting them make those decisions on their own so that by the time they're 18, they are a fully independent person able to think through those decisions themselves. \n\n(01:26:03):\nNow, look, my sons are young. They're five and three, so it's not like I'm having them make life and death decisions or where we might buy our next house or stuff like that, but it's even small things at this age of... My oldest, five and a half, is really starting to learn and get curious about money and how you spend money and where new things come from and how you earn money. Rather than just buying things for him, he's got money from his grandparents and stuff saved up, and we can be like, \"Okay, you can buy that thing, but you're going to spend this,\" and try to teach him the consequences and all that kind of stuff, and then when he breaks something...\n\n(01:26:50):\nIt's just small things like that, but thinking about the time from zero to 18 as this spectrum of independence and being a supporting role in what you're essentially doing is you're trying to move as many decisions, the percentage of decisions you make for them down to zero by the time that they're 18. That's something that I've kept in the back of my head since really seeing that. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:19):\nThank you for sharing that. I know I didn't tell you that I was going to ask you about this, so that was a beautiful way of summarizing it. \n\nBrian Balfour (01:27:25):\nYeah, I couldn't remember that whole podcast. I had no idea what I said, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:25):\nI would say you nailed it.\n\nBrian Balfour (01:27:28):\n... that's a good one, yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:31):\nBrian, two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and where can they find the products you guys offer? Whatever you want to plug. Also, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBrian Balfour (01:27:41):\nCheck out reforge.com. Check out our new products like Reforge Insights. They're on the website. You can find me personally, my writing, including a bunch of the stuff that we talked about today now on Substack. Just recently moved. You can either go to my website, brianbalfour.com, where I have some info or just the blog.brianbalfour.com where all of my new writing is taking place. Those are the two major pieces. \n\n(01:28:08):\nLast but not least is that, as I mentioned, Fareed Mosavat, who I used to work with at Slack, we have this fun podcast. The two of us get on there and riff like we were having dinner every couple of weeks about different product and strategy types of things. It's a fun format for us, so if that's something you enjoy, it's called Unsolicited Feedback, where we give feedback and advice to nobody that ever asked for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:36):\nThat's amazing. Perfect title. Brian, thank you so much for being here.\n\nBrian Balfour (01:28:41):\nYeah, thanks for having me again. This is great. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:43):\nBye, everyone.

  "transcript": "# Brian Chesky’s new playbook\n\n## Transcript\n\nBrian Chesky (00:00:00):\nWay too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. That's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity. And what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And so I basically got involved in every single detail and I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement. I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.\n\nLenny (00:01:01):\nToday my guest is Brian Chesky. Brian is the CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, which he started in his apartment with his co-founders, Joe and Nate, and has turned into an $80 billion global business with travelers and homes in 220 countries. I was very lucky to get to work with Brian for many years, and my sense is if you ask people who they consider the most inspiring tech or business leaders today, Brian would be right near the top of that list.\n\n(00:01:27):\nIn our conversation, Brian shares an in-depth explanation of what's happening with product management at Airbnb, which caused quite a stir in the product world when he talked about this previously. We also get deep into Brian's new approach of how he runs Airbnb, including shifting away from traditional growth channels like paid growth, and instead betting that if they just build the best possible product and tell people about it, growth will happen. Also, how the product team now operates including having just one single roadmap across the entire company and Brian staying very close to every design and every feature. We also get a bit into his personal life, including how he finds balance and avoids burnout, how he continues to learn himself so that he can stay ahead of the business and its growth. This is a very special episode for me and I'm thrilled to bring you Brian Chesky after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:17):\nThis episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors. A trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact.\n\n(00:03:06):\nGuided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today. Jump the growing wait list of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more. That's sidebar.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:38):\nYou fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates and you're spending your days basically putting out fires. A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and roadmapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian.\n\n(00:04:04):\nWith Jira Product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently finally, replacing those endless spreadsheets.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nBrian Chesky (00:05:04):\nWell, thank you for having me.\n\nLenny (00:05:06):\nDid you ever think when I left Airbnb, one, that I would have a podcast and two, that you would be on my podcast?\n\nBrian Chesky (00:05:12):\nI had no idea you would become a podcast host and that you would have such a successful podcast. But yeah, congrats on everything. This is awesome.\n\nLenny (00:05:18):\nI appreciate it. Congrats to you too, Brian. Things seem to be going great. I'm excited that you're here. I want to start with the elephant in the room for a lot of listeners of this podcast. What is going on with product management at Airbnb? You made some comments at Figma Config and a lot of people got this impression that you eliminated product management at Airbnb, and I've heard from a lot of product execs having boardroom conversations as a result of that. And they were trying to decide should we remove product management from the company? Should we significantly cut product management? So I'm just curious to hear from you, what is the latest on your thinking on product management and what's happening with product management at Airbnb?\n\nBrian Chesky (00:05:56):\nI spoke at Figma four or five months ago. I spoke to a room of designers. I then got off-stage. I saw somebody tweet that said something to the nature of that I said I got rid of the product management function and all the designers in the room started cheering. So I want to talk about two things. What I actually meant, because I didn't actually get rid of the people. And also why did the people in the room cheer? Because that's also a thing we should ask ourselves. And I hope everyone listening to this podcast should understand where did that place come from, that 5,000 designers in a room cheered because they thought I eliminated the existence of a function? Because if I said I eliminated the engineering function, no one would've cheered. It was specifically that function. So I want to talk about what that might mean. It wasn't the people, it's the way they're working together.\n\n(00:06:46):\nSo we don't have any longer the traditional product management function as it existed when you was here. But we didn't get rid of people helping drive the product. What we did is we combined what one might call the inbound product development responsibilities of product manager with the outbound or marketing responsibilities of product marketing. That's the first thing we did. The second thing we did is we off boarded much of the program management functions that product managers may do to actual program managers. A lot of people with the product management title are actually program managers. So we actually started off boarding some responsibilities to program management. The last thing we did is we made the group smaller and more senior. So we don't really have a lot of junior product marketers. So the most senior people are called product marketers, but everyone has to understand how to talk about the product.\n\n(00:07:42):\nSo the basic idea is this. You can't build a product unless you know how to talk about the product. You can't be an expert in making the product unless you're also an expert in the market of it. And a lot of companies, what they do is they ship a product, it doesn't work, and they say, \"We tried that. It didn't work.\" And if you say you tried and it didn't work, my question is, was it a bad product, a bad strategy or bad execution? Maybe it was a really well-made product, but you had no distribution plan. You had no way to talk about the product. If you build a great product and no one knows about it, did you even build a product? So that is essentially what we do. We have a much smaller function. The people are much more senior. They have much more responsibility. The other thing though is that they do not control or drive designing or engineering. We are a fairly purely functional model. They manage by influence. They do not have control.\n\n(00:08:31):\nNow you might ask, how does that work in a company where people can only manage by influence? Here's the amazing thing. We built and designed a company where you can manage by influence and no one has to like you. You don't actually have to win people over. Oh, and the last thing I want to say is, why did 5,000 designers cheer when the people thought I removed the product management function? Because I want to say ... I don't know if I can speak on behalf of all the designers, but having talked to a lot of designers, I think designers in the valley are very, very frustrated with the product development process. Not to say the product managers, but they're extremely frustrated.\n\n(00:09:09):\nI think a lot of designers feel like they're compromising. Many designers I know ... Heads of design. Well-known heads of design. I told them they're not designers, they're design administrators. They're running a design service organization. Because Silicon Valley often treats design as a service organization. Like design is catching things before it goes out the door. It's not actually typically part of the development process. And I think this is not just bad for design, it's bad for product managers and engineers because we all want to build the best products. And one day you wake up and a variety of phenomenon might have happened. And if people are watching this from a large company, here might be some of the characteristics.\n\n(00:09:43):\nThe first thing you notice is that these different groups might be running on slightly different technical stacks. That's the first problem. And they may actually be accumulating technical debt. The next problem you'll see is that there's a lot of dependencies. So five teams are going different directions, but they all need a payment platform. And so what happens is that the teams that everyone's dependent on get this backup like a deli and people are going around the block. And then at some point they just give up. So then the teams that are dependent on other people say, \"Give me the resources and I'll build this group myself.\" So instead of five teams going to marketing to get a campaign or to leverage some service, they start building their own marketing departments, their own groups. So now they're really becoming separate divisions. And this is where a division comes from.\n\n(00:10:34):\nNow, once you have a division, your division is as successful as you are a priority. So now you have to advocate for your division. So there's a lot of advocacy. If you have dependencies, you've got to persuade people by building relationships. And so the people that are liked that build the best relationships are the ones that get the most resources and that creates what we call politics. And so now politics that brood in the company. And suddenly people gets more subdivided, more subdivided, subdivided. And that creates another problem, which we call bureaucracy. And that bureaucracy means it's hard to know who's doing what. People are going in different directions and that creates a lack of accountability. When there's lack of accountability, then there's a sense that what I do doesn't matter and that creates complacency. And then suddenly a fast-growing company becomes a big slow moving bureaucracy. This is a general arc that winds up happening.\n\n(00:11:30):\nAnd then you end up having this situation where a company's done 10 marketing efforts, but no customer's heard anything. They have thousands of engineers, they shipped all these products, but a customer can't tell you a single thing you did. Marketing and engineering don't talk to each other. It's not even they hate each other, they're in different universes. I've always said that the health of an organization, one simple heuristic is how close is engineering and marketing? And marketing is at lot of companies are like the waiters, engineers are like the chefs and the chefs yell at the waiters and they go in the kitchen. In fact, the waiters are the ones talking to the customers all day and they also know how to sell things so you really want them being enjoined at the hip and you want engineers to be thinking about maybe how to talk about the products that they're building.\n\n(00:12:17):\nSo this is the problem that we had. And also the other thing we were doing is, as you know Lenny, we were spending a lot of money in performance marketing. I don't think performance marketing is a bad thing. I think of performance marketing as a laser. Actually my co-founder who obviously you know well, Joe, used to have this metaphor of lasers, flash bulbs and chandeliers. If you want to light up a room, performance marking is a laser. It can light up a corner of a room. You don't want to use a bunch of lasers to light up an entire room. You should use a chandelier and that's what brand marketing is. But if you do need to laser in and balance supply and demand, then performance marketing is really good. It literally lasers in. Performance marketing though doesn't create very good accumulating advantages because it's not an investment. Now if you want to build it permanently, like booking.com, if you have a really high ROI, now you can have a performance marketing arbitrage business. But assuming you don't want an arbitrage business, you actually need to be investing. And so we think of marketing as education. That we're educating people on the unique benefits.\n\n(00:13:23):\nSo a lot of companies don't do product marketing. They do brand marketing, which are ads about the app or they do performance marketing, but they're never really educating people about new things they're making and shipping. And because no one's marketing new things they're shipping, there's no purpose to ship new things. Because you ship new things and people don't know about them or use them or they're not educated. And so you try these big new things, people don't adopt them immediately, so then you get more and more incremental. Now what we do is we have a rolling two year roadmap. We don't even really do an annual plan. As you remember, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we would have three month planning cycles. Now planning cycle is just a budgeting cycle and most people only spend a week or two on it. Some don't spend any time on it. And we have a rolling two year product plan. Strategy. Product strategy roadmap that gets updated every six months with releases. We release products every May and every November or October. Obviously we did one today we can talk about.\n\n(00:14:26):\nThe entire company works together. They row in the same direction. And the product management also does the product marketing. So they're figuring out how people are going to learn about it, they're doing the demos, they're understanding the story, the videos, they're figuring out all the customer touchpoints, making sure everyone understands it. Our product marketing works with communications. We work months ahead of time on all the different assets. And when we're working on a launch, one of the first things we'll do is start figuring out what the story is. And the story will often dictate the product. Because ultimately you have to tell the story to people. But a story also is a really helpful way to develop a cohesive product. We wanted a company where a thousand people could work, but it'll look like 10 people did it. Sorry, that was a bit of a brain dump, but that is a little bit of a universal theory for how we develop products now. And I could go into a lot more detail, but I probably will stop there.\n\nLenny (00:15:24):\nThat was amazing. You touched on all of the things I want to talk about. So I'm going to-\n\nBrian Chesky (00:15:27):\nOh, gee. So we can go deeper and deeper because the rabbit hole goes deep.\n\nLenny (00:15:31):\nYeah, exactly. Exactly. So I'm going to pull on a couple threads. The first is this idea of a single roadmap you talked about. And what this reminds me of is I was talking to another very prominent CEO of a public company and he pointed out that there's this cycle that he sees a lot of founders go through where they initially run the show, they're in charge, they tell people what to build, and then over time they're encouraged to delegate and to empower and it leads to a bunch of optimization work and small thinking maybe. And you talked about bureaucracy and politics. And then eventually you realize I need to take the reins again and drive the ship and take back control of what's happening. And it feels like you went on that journey.\n\nBrian Chesky (00:16:08):\nThat's exactly how it went, and that's how it goes almost at every company I've heard of. By the way, I think that many years ago, I remember I think reading a blog post by Ben Horowitz saying that a lot of people tell product led founders or engineering led founders to step away and delegate their product to other people, but suddenly they've delegated away the thing they're best at. The thing that is hardest for them to replace. So we don't have a chief product officer title, but if we had one, it would be me. I wouldn't have a chief product officer. I think the CEO should be basically the chief product officer of a product or tech company. If the CEO is not the chief product officer then I don't know if they're a product or tech led company. Maybe that's okay if they're an ops company or if they're a marketing company or if they're not a tech company at all. But ultimately I think the founder or CEO should be that person.\n\n(00:16:59):\nSo when we were starting Airbnb, it was probably the three of us. As you know, I think Airbnb was a unique situation where it was three of us. I don't think any of us was that dominant. I probably played the closest thing to the role of the people listening, the closest thing to the role of the product manager. But again, I did marketing, I did design, I did ops, I did a little bit of everything. So I was basically everything but engineering. And then as we grew, I started getting more and more hands off in the product.\n\n(00:17:27):\nAnd I always remember Lenny there was this paradox where the less involved I was in a project ... Let me be clear. There were times I inserted myself and dysfunction occurred. That is absolutely true. And that was just a learning experience for me. But there was this other scenario where the less involved I was in the project, the more spin there was, the less clear the goals, the less advocacy the team had, the less resources, the fewer resources they had. And then therefore the slower they moved. And the slower they moved, the more they assumed it was because I was too involved. Because people assume that our natural equilibrium's to move fast so if we're moving slow, it's because of an over involvement in leadership and therefore I would get less involved. I would give teams more control. I would give them teams more empowerment. And the more I kept giving people what they asked for initially, they may have been happy, but the outcome of it was always, it seemed weirdly like they got less of what they wanted. They wanted to move faster so I'd empower them and move slower.\n\n(00:18:26):\nAnd again, how that happened is what I described. That you end up in a situation where you're delegating down. So I think that things were getting worse and slower and slower and slower. 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. And by 2019 we were spending a billion dollars on AdWords. We weren't really investing in the brand. We were doing a huge amount of AB testing. I think AB testing is important in times. Actually, let me clarify AB testing. We don't test blue versus green. We have a control and a treatment like I think we did when you were here. So we have a design. We might do a holdback occasionally to see how the thing is working. But if we do an AB test, there has to be a hypothesis. If we don't have a hypothesis and A is better than B, then we're stuck with B. And that's a really, really big problem, but we can never change it.\n\n(00:19:27):\nAnd then imagine 10 teams doing AB testing. Imagine if you designed software the way you designed a house or design a house the way design software. And we AB test a sofa. And we said, well, how does this sofa work? And it seems like with this sofa that we've AB tested people spend more time in the living room, so therefore people are going to like this room better. But actually the sofa has a relationship to the end stands which have a relationship to the lamps which have a relationship to the carpet or the rug which have a relationship to the television which have a relationship to the house and everything else. So you have to think about the whole cohesive system. And I started realizing that. I asked one person on your team, somebody you know well, and I asked him, I said, \"I feel like I open our app and the product hasn't changed and four years.\" I remember saying this, 2018, 2019. And this person described that you know well as just the way we were doing things. The initial way we were doing things to move fast had made us move slow.\n\n(00:20:29):\nSo what we ended up doing is ... It was now late 2019. I don't know what to do. I'm like, the product is slow, the app seems to not change, costs are rising. I keep adding more people. There seems to be more politics. By politics I mean advocating for individual interests rather than the whole company. More bureaucracy meaning meetings about meetings about meetings and a lot of dependencies. People were describing working 80 hours and getting 20 hours of productive work done, which is just a crazy ratio a week. And I didn't really quite know what to do.\n\n(00:21:03):\nAnd then right before the pandemic, I meet two people that really affected how I thought about things. The first was Hiroki Asai. Hiroki now works at Airbnb. He's one of my executives and actually product design, product marketing design and marketing report into him. And he was a creative director for Apple. So he worked for Steve Jobs, was basically dotted line to Steve for many, many years. Came from graphic design. Eventually ran all of marketing communications. In Apple Marketing Communications, they actually designed the app. They made the app. They designed all the marketing touchpoints for the store. So it wasn't just ads, it was every brand touchpoint they were responsible. So everything flowed through marketing. And so marketing became the governing factor that made everything really organized.\n\n(00:21:52):\nI met another person or got reacquainted a person named Jony Ive. And Jony Ive was the head of industrial design and Chief Design Officer at Apple. And they described this way of running a company that was totally different than the way that I was running it. It was basically the way that Steve Jobs ran Apple from about 1998 until he died in 2011. Apple somewhat runs it this way today, but the services is turning into a division and they are just so big that I think it's not a one-to-one anymore, but they are still technically run this way. And I had this image of not being divisional because we were running ... We had 10 divisions. We had a flights division and we had a homes division which was divided to pro hosts and core hosts and lux and we had business travel and we had a magazine and we had experiences and we had .org and we had China. So we had these 10 different divisions all going in 10 different directions. And I created this culture where everyone would be a business manager or business leader, general manager, which made them want to create many general managers. And so the company kept getting subdivided, subdivided, subdivided and that made it very, very difficult to turn.\n\n(00:22:57):\nAnd this was all about me delegating responsibility. The problem is if you're running a divisional company, you're a product-led founder ... What are you doing? Strategy, capital allocation. My job went from proactive to very reactive. I was reacting to a lot of things. I was in a lot of meetings. Trying to adjudicate different issues between groups. So then the pandemic occurs and I had this image on mind. It's like I have this dream that I could run a company much more like a startup. I remember going on a walk with Joe and Nate in Bolinas. It was October 2019. And I told them I had this dream that I left the company 10 years ago and they just asked me to come back. And I said, \"I was horrified at what I found.\" And they said, \"Well, what'd you find?\" I said, \"I found a company that on the one hand had amazing culture and people with a great mission, with a brand people really loved, but we lost our design roots. We weren't investing in the longterm. We were obsessing over hitting metrics. We didn't actually have any cohesive understanding of what we were doing. It was really hard to get work done. A lot of the great people were leaving and cost was rising and growth was slowing.\" And that was exactly what was happening.\n\n(00:24:20):\nAnd then the pandemic occurred and we lost 80% of our business in eight weeks. And then suddenly we're like, oh my God. I remember basically staring into the abyss. And luckily I've never had a near-death experience, but the way it's been described to me is it's like your life flashes before your eyes and you have clarity. And that's what happened to our business. We had a near-death business experience and our business flashed before our eyes. And so suddenly I basically got into action and I said, I'm going to run it this other way where I'm going to get back involved in the details. And by the way, Lenny, here's the funny thing. Before the crisis, a lot of people felt like I was too involved in different areas. Once the crisis happened, guess what happened? People were like, what do we do? We need you more involved. And so I got more involved.\n\n(00:25:05):\nAnd when I got involved, I made the following changes. The first thing I did is I said, everything we're doing has to be written down and put into a Google sheet. It turns out people couldn't even write down everything they were doing. I remember one person told me, \"We're doing too many things for me to ever be able to document.\" I'm like, \"What?\" But anyways, we eventually got everyone to write everything down. And I said, okay, we can do about 20% of these things. And so if everyone says, \"Oh, Airbnb is simple. I'm only doing three things.\" Yes, but you're one of a thousand people. So actually we're doing 3000 things. So instead of one team doing three things, three teams should do one thing. So we totally cut down the number of projects. We removed layers of management. I wanted to be as few layers as possible from leaders of the team. We went to a functional model. We went back to a startup.\n\n(00:25:54):\nSo we said, we're not going to have divisional leaders. We're going to have design, engineering, product which turned to product marketing and marketing and communications and sales and operations, all the functions of a startup. I said, we're going to have fewer employees. We're going to have fewer more senior people. There's a great saying that the best way to slow a project down is add more people to it. And so we felt like very few employees. We have fewer than 7,000 employees today. As a relative comparison, I think Uber has 30,000. And it's not to say they're big, it's just say that's how small we are and we've really benefited from having not a lot of employees.\n\n(00:26:28):\nSo we made sure that every executive was an expert in their functional domain. So you know how there's a lot of engineering managers that aren't that technical or maybe not a lot, but they exist. Or there's designers, but there's design leaders who lead the people. A design leader's job should be managing the design first, the people second. That's what Jony did. They're interchangeable. I could never imagine Jony out at Apple just being a manager of people. He was looking and designing the work with the team. How do you manage the people without managing their work? How do you give them development if you're not in the details with them on the work? So the same thing is true. So people had to be experts. Everyone had to be an expert.\n\n(00:27:11):\nI stopped pushing decision-making down. I pulled it in. I created one shared consciousness and I said, the top 30, 40 people in the company are going to have one continuous conversation. Metrics are going to be subordinate to the calendar. So we're going to have a roadmap. It's going to be a two-year roadmap. We'll update the roadmap literally every month. People may wonder, well, what if the world changes? Yeah, it changes every day. So the roadmap's something where the next month doesn't change, but two years out it changes. It's a rolling roadmap. And by the way, if Ukraine gets invaded and you want to provide housing for refugees, you can still pivot people and adapt very quickly. We house 120,000 refugees. So you still keep a reserve of resources to be able to pivot and do things because there's always unexpected events.\n\n(00:27:54):\nI created this new function called product marketing. We basically described what that is. I made the group much smaller. I took a lot of product managers, I reassigned them as program managers. I had many of them trained in actual program management because their roles got much bigger. Program management at Airbnb is a high status job. A lot of companies, it's like a coordination job. At Airbnb we said because we're going to do launches, it's high status. We said we're going to do two launches a year and you can't ship something unless it's on the roadmap. So every single thing in the company, with the exception of some infrastructure projects have to be on the roadmap. And then I'm going to review all the work. And so we create the CEO review schedule where I said I'm getting back involved in the project and I'm going to review all the product and all the marketing. So every project I would review every week, every two weeks, every four weeks, every eight weeks or every 12 weeks. There'd be a cadence.\n\n(00:28:46):\nAnd then I had a head program manager that would score all the projects. Either they're green, yellow, or red. Meaning they're on track or not on track to ship. Whether we thought they were work, we don't know until after we ship it. But I use the reviews of the work every single week. And the reason there's not a lot of bureaucracy and the reason you don't need any influence at Airbnb is I'd review the work and if something wasn't happening, then I would stop the meeting and say, \"Why isn't this happening?\" And we would all get together. And so you couldn't have a situation where a team wouldn't collaborate. It would be like I could then feel the work of an individual engineer.\n\n(00:29:25):\nBecause imagine if we're a car company and I see the car prototype every week and I notice there's something about the tires off. Now I can identify the individual person who was blocked. So every week I would try to see the equivalent of at least a semi assembly of the entire new product we were working on, which allowed me to identify with teams the different bottlenecks happening in the company. The reviews were the thing that allowed us to dictate the pace. And so because we had all these reviews, I didn't need to mandate people going back to an office. I didn't really care where they worked because I could track how well they were working because of the review cycle. So these were some of the changes that we made. We also started really building out much more of a marketing communications and creative function. We built our own in-house creative agency. So we use production partners, but we don't use Wieden+Kennedy or ChiatDay or any of those anymore. We actually built our own in-house agency, so to speak, which is a creative group.\n\n(00:30:32):\nThe creative group does not just the ads but the creative on the product. So we got really, really functional. We got rid of a function called UX writing, and we combined it with marketing writing. We said, wait, why don't we just have the best writers do everything? Why is UX writing a separate function? Because actually the emails, the app, the ads should all be one voice. Now, there may be people that come from a different background, like there are people that come from UX, but they all roll up to one function of writing. And writing should not go to design. Writing should go to a function called writing. Unless you want your head of writing to report to design, then that doesn't make sense. So we really made a lot of those changes.\n\n(00:31:16):\nJust to round up the question that you asked, I think that way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. I don't know why they do, but I think they apologize for how they run the company. They basically find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. If you're a founder, what I would tell you is the problem with finding a negotiation between how you want to run a company, the people you want, is that's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity and what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And also if you try to appease employees, they may not even be there the whole time. So we have entire projects at the company where somebody advocated to do it, it was a big commitment and then they left and now we're still doing the project they advocated for. So it really has to be something that everyone wants to sign up for, not just the person who's there because they might not always be there.\n\n(00:32:17):\nI basically got involved in every single detail. And I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement, and I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is telling people exactly what to do and being in the details. Being the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.\n\nLenny (00:32:57):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.\n\n(00:33:27):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytics cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization and email marketing. Check out Eppo at get eppo.com/lenny and 10x your experiment velocity. That's get E-P-P-O .com/lenny.\n\n(00:34:15):\nYou guys found such a unique way of working. I've never heard of a company working in these ways, in so many contrarian ways. I think it's going to be a really interesting case study as things progress. Essentially what you've done is shut down traditional growth channels or at least limited them. Paid growth and maybe SEO, maybe referrals at least for a while. And you've shifted to let's just make an awesome product and tell people about it. And our bet is that's going to grow. Do you feel like this can work for most other products or is there a consumer specific opportunity? What advice would you give to founders that are thinking about, man, we should try something like this?\n\nBrian Chesky (00:34:53):\nI think that this methodology can work for everyone, but I don't think you have to be as ideological or have to go all the way to 100. I still think growth channels matter. To be clear, we still spend money on performance marketing. We still do measure conversion and we will do some experiments. Think of conversion and growth optimization as like running a football down a field and think of these big leaps as passes. You should probably be doing 80% passes, 20% running the ball down the field, and a lot of companies that do 80% running down the ball down the field and 20% passes. So I think that this methodology will work for everyone.\n\n(00:35:33):\nHere are the things I believe. I'll give you a checklist. Number one, I think that the CEO, unless they're not a product person, should think of themselves as this chief product officer and they should be involved in the product. Number two, if you're not functional, I would at least think about everyone being really close together. So here's another way of saying it, Lenny. Every product manager should be interconnected and know what everyone else is doing. They shouldn't be independently siloed unless they really are running separate companies or separate orgs and they have no dependencies. I think that every leader should be an expert in what they're leading. There should be no people managers in the entire company. And when I say people managers, meaning your only responsibility is people, not the work or not the domain. Because you can't manage people devoid of their work.\n\n(00:36:18):\nImagine a fire chief and they don't know anything about putting out fires. That's crazy. You have to know the subject matter. People should aim to have as few people as possible on their team. I'm not saying eliminate people. I mean grow slowly and do not be reckless. Five teams should do one thing rather than one team do five things. So that's just a metaphor. But people should work together. I think that people should consider doing launches. You can by the way, ship every hour of every day, but then package it and tell a story if you want hold the product back. I think that teams should use data, but they should also use research and intuition. There's a designer called Charles Eames that said you can't delegate understanding. If you're going to do AB experiments or measure data, you have to understand what it means. I think that you have to have an intuition. Intuition comes not from arbitrariness, it comes from understanding. I would make sure that you have engineering and design ideally report to the founder, product led person. I would not have design under product unless you have an extremely good reason or the product person is a designer.\n\n(00:37:25):\nI would try to think about product management, expanding the responsibility and including distribution. Understanding the customer and teaching people how to tell a story. I would try to make sure that the product managers are a combination of art and science. I do not think you want purely technical product managers doing things if they're going to work with non-technical functions. If they're only work technical functions, that's fine, but they're going to work with non-technical functions, I think that's a problem. I should make sure that marketing and engineering are interconnected. I would make sure that you have as few layers between a CEO and other people. If you're a CEO, every direct to your direct should be a implicit dotted line to you. So I treat every direct to my direct as if they're a direct report. A dotted line. I don't try to conflict with the direction of my team, but I always want to know what another layer below me is doing.\n\n(00:38:18):\nI think you should think of each release as a chapter of a story or like an episode of a TV series. And you should think of your company in a five or 10 years story. You may not know where you are in 10 years, but you're telling this ongoing story. And most of all, I would say that everyone should row in the same direction. If there's only one thing I said in this interview today, actually I'm not sure what it would be, but I think a good candidate is try to get everyone to row together in the same direction. Otherwise, why the hell are you all in the same company?\n\nLenny (00:38:48):\nSpeaking of rowing in the same direction, you had a huge launch today. I know you wanted to talk about it. Your winter release. And it is the culmination of a lot of the things you're talking about. I'd love to hear just some of the stuff you're launching.\n\nBrian Chesky (00:39:00):\nLet me just back up Lenny. You know this problem really well. One of the best things of Airbnb is that we're this marketplace where guests and hosts come together and we have all this unique inventory and people list it on Airbnb. And every home is one of a kind and we have seven million homes and there's all this surprise and all this delight. The problem is that every home is one of a kind and you often don't know what you're going to get. And so a lot of guests have described checking into Airbnb as a moment of truth. Where when you open the door you find out if the home is exactly the home that you booked. And this turns out to be a big problem for people wanting to book an Airbnb. And when we survey guests or people who don't use Airbnb, the number one ... Hotels are not as special, they're not as unique, but the advantage they have is you know what you're going to get. You know exactly what you're going to get.\n\n(00:39:56):\nAnd so what we found is that reliability is Airbnb's achilles heel, or at least it has been. That with hotels you know what you're going to get an Airbnb you don't always know what you're going to get. And so we asked ourselves, what if we could combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with the reliability that you've come to expect in a hotel? And that's what we've done with Guest Favorites. Guest Favorites are homes that guests in our community love the most. We took 370 million reviews on Airbnb plus millions of customer service tickets, plus all the host cancellation data and we use all the signal to create the top two million homes. This collection of two million homes that we call Guest Favorites because the guests rate the highest. We think combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with a reliability you've come to expect in a hotel and I can't imagine there's a lot of use cases where you wouldn't want to book a Guest Favorite.\n\n(00:40:50):\nWe think that's also part of this broader system of ratings and reviews. You see, as you know, Airbnb is built on a system of trust and we invented this new way for people to trust one another, at least at scale through living together certainly. And we felt like the rating and review system could use a little bit of an upgrade. So we obviously made some upgrades to ratings and reviews. The final thing, and this brings up another point I might bring up, is we've completely overhauled the host tab. One of the most important things when you get to an Airbnb is the listing is accurate. But the problem is that a lot of host listings don't have all the details up to date. So they might not describe perfectly their listing, they might not have filled up their amenities, they might not have a photo tour. And the reason why as we're doing research is because they found it was hard to manage their listing. And it was hard to manage their listing because it was designed as this hodgepodge thing by different teams over many years.\n\n(00:41:47):\nOh, here's the other thing, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we had a guest team and a host team. We don't have a guest team and host team. We have a design team. We have a marketing team. We have an engineering team. The reason we don't break the app into guests and hosts anymore is because reviews affect guests and hosts. It turns out that almost everything involves connecting the guest and host. When you have separate teams, they tend to have separate roadmaps that go in separate directions that become incompatible. So we have product marketers that are responsible for guests and host things, but the designers and the engineers are fairly fungible and they can move from project to project.\n\n(00:42:25):\nAnd then we keep some people, especially the product marketing people on a domain area, but we really want to make sure that we have designers and engineers covering a much larger surface. And so that's what we did. We have this incredible new tab called the listing tab that we designed. It's quite possibly one of the nicest things we ever designed. If you go to my Twitter account, you'll see a little sizzle reel from some of the design we've done. By the way, the design is a whole new aesthetic. I'd like to make the announcement that I think flat design is over or ending. I think if you remember the 2000s was dominated by skeuomorphism. The 2010s have been dominated with the launch of iOS seven by flat design. And I think we're going to move back into a world with color, texture, dimensionality, more haptic feedback, but I don't think it's going to be skeuomorphism where it pretends to be a wood grain to reference a dashboard or leather, but I think it's going to have a sense of dimension.\n\n(00:43:24):\nI think the reason why is we're spending more and more time on screens and we want the screens to replicate some of what we see in the natural environment. Light, texture. I think it's more intuitive, it's more playful. I think AI allows the development of more sophisticated interfaces. People in AI are gravitating to image generating art that has got more dimension to it. And so I think that we've really started to push this more three-dimensional, colorful aesthetic that I think it's going to be where a lot of interface design is going. And we built this AI powered photo tour where we created our own AI computer visioning language that we trained on 100 million photos and it can basically scan all your photos and organize them by room. So that's what we did today. Maybe just to round it up, what I would say is that none of this would've been possible in the old way of working. We could have theoretically launched a lot of these features, but really getting them to work together has been key. And Guest Favorites has required the guests, people ... You have to work with guests, you have to work with hosts, you have to essentially ... You have to figure out how to communicate to the market. So it's a much more integrated approach.\n\nLenny (00:44:41):\nThe designs you talked about, they are incredibly cute. You tweeted a little video of a lot of them, like the couch with little textures on it. It is really cool. Also, the listing tab. I think people that aren't hosts don't understand how important the listing experience is to a host. How many hosts are there? Seven million? Something like that?\n\nBrian Chesky (00:45:00):\nThere's seven million listings. Over seven million listings.\n\nLenny (00:45:04):\nYeah. And so that's the home base. That's like the small business platform for millions of people. And so I worked on the host sites. I have a special place in my heart for host features, and I feel like travelers don't really appreciate the value of that part of the product.\n\nBrian Chesky (00:45:18):\nWell, yeah, you did some amazing work there. Yeah. The big lesson, Lenny, the other thing we learned is to create a great guest experience, you need great hosts, and to have great hosts, they need great tools. And so if you want to create a great experience for guests, it often starts with building great tools for hosts to enable them to provide a great experience for guests. And so that was one of the theories behind the listing tab is we're going to build great tools for hosts. They're going to love it. And we also felt like if we put care in the design of our app, that hosts are going to see that and that they're going to actually put care into hosting. Even more than they already do. And they do put a lot of care in now.\n\nLenny (00:45:55):\nSpeaking of great products, a defining characteristic of Brian Chesky in my mind is how big you make people think. How you push people to think bigger. Memories I have of you is in meetings, we present our goal and you're always saying, \"How do we 10X this? What would it take to 10X this idea?\" And somehow we often hit these crazy goals after you 10X'd them or sometimes just double them. What have you learned about just the power of setting really ambitious goals, but also finding the balance with not demoralizing people if they don't hit these really ambitious goals?\n\nBrian Chesky (00:46:32):\nAs you know, there was a saying inside of Airbnb, it was add a zero. Add a zero at the end, which is to imagine something you order, imagine it bigger. The exercise isn't necessarily to say if people say they want to hit a goal, I say, okay, I added a zero, you have to hit that goal. It's more the exercise of what would it take to be 10X bigger or do something 10 times better? Because what you find is when you push people, they will sometimes think about the problem differently. And one of the best ways to get unstuck from a problem is to imagine a 10X scale or 10X better or 10X faster where you can't do the current process to do it. You have to think differently about the problem. And to think differently about the problem means you have to deeply understand the problem. And to deeply understand the problem, you have to break it into its components.\n\n(00:47:22):\nAnd we might call this first principle thinking. What are the foundational elements that comprise this problem and how can we reconstruct them? So the first thing is I think by adding a zero, at least conceptually for teams, that helps them understand a problem. The second is, I think one of the most important things for a founder or leader to do is set the pace of the team. I think the pace of the team is one of the most important things you can do. And that pace is sometimes governed not by how hard people work, but how decisive they are. If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions. And fast decisions come from a bias of action. If we're in a meeting, we don't just say, \"Okay, let's circle back on this next week.\" No, we'll have it done by next week. Let's stay in this meeting until it's done. What are you doing? Have a bias for action. Who's responsible? Okay, what are you doing? Okay, let's check in an hour. I'll call you in the morning. Okay, how do we do this? And so you end up getting three months of work done over that period of time.\n\n(00:48:18):\nBut the last thing I'll say about adding a zero, Lenny, is I remember there was a story about a great basketball coach named John Wooden. He was one of the winningest basketball coaches, I think, in college basketball history, perhaps the greatest. And someone asked him once ... I'm going to paraphrase what he said. What is your secret to success? And he said, \"That I just asked my players to do their very best.\" And I remember thinking to myself, that doesn't sound like the secret to success, asking people to do their best. But there was an implicit thing that he didn't say, which is that he saw potential in people that they never saw in themselves. And so the role of a leader is to see potential in people that they may not even see themselves.\n\n(00:49:04):\nWhen I tell somebody it's not good enough, either I'm saying, you're not good enough, or I believe that you have more potential than you're showing me. So in other words, you can push a team and they could feel demoralized because they can feel like what they're doing is not good enough if they have a fixed mindset or you create a growth mindset organization where the more I'm involved, the more I say you can do better, it's because the more I believe in you, and I know that you have more in you. And the way to know if a team could do better is if they're life dependent on it, could they do it? And Andy Grove used to say that there's competency and motivation. And motivation is if they're life ... Not literally dependent on it, but if it was a crisis or if it was a defining moment in their lives. I think the job of a leader is not to make it life and death, that's too far, but to be able to motivate a team to see potential in them that they don't see in themselves, and to really push them. To set a tempo, to break something down to first principle thinking. And if you do that, then I think that's going to be the opposite of these slow moving, soul crushing bureaucracies.\n\nLenny (00:50:06):\nI've definitely been through that where you set a crazy goal and then we ended up hitting it. And so I've seen that myself. With some of the things you've talked about of say, do it now, we're not going to wait another week to circle back and this stuff you talked about of taking on the CPO role, not having a CPO, and also all these launches, it sounds like a lot of work and a lot of hours. What have you learned about avoiding burnout and creating balance and also just helping people on your team avoid burnout and creating balance?\n\nBrian Chesky (00:50:34):\nFirst of all, I want to give you a very surprising learning. I weirdly now, the more I get involved ... This is so weird. The more in the details I am, the more time I have on my hands. That's a paradox. And I want to explain that paradox. It doesn't make any sense. But when I explain this process to people that I would be in the details, we'd have one shared consciousness, I would review everything, we would do endless edits of even the press release, it would seem like I would be working 80, 100 hours a week and that people will be disempowered and that no one would want to do anything. And I got just the opposite. Here's what I found. If you decide to be in the details and get very, very hands-on like I did, it might be a lot more work for about one to two years.\n\n(00:51:20):\nAnd so for one to two years it was way more work than the old way. But once we turned the corner, suddenly everyone started rowing the same direction. Suddenly I didn't have to be in meetings anymore and people would do what I wanted them to do if I wasn't there. And by the way, that's what the culture is. They say the culture is what happens when you're not in the room and the brand is what people say when you're not in the room. And so that became our culture. Suddenly there was fewer conflicts in the company. There was less turnover. People were rowing in the same direction. That I wasn't reacting. Before, I would get 10 surprises and nine were bad. Now I get 10 surprises and nine are good. And you don't really have to do anything about good surprises, only bad surprises. That I used to have to intervene in projects that I wasn't involved in because they were going off in the wrong direction and by the time I got involved, I was associated with dysfunction, but I only got involved because it was dysfunctional. It wasn't actually going well. And then it was three times as work to fix something because we weren't involved in the very early stages. So I was much more involved. I had a lot less time on my hands initially, and now I actually weirdly have a lot more time on my hands.\n\n(00:52:33):\nBut to answer your question on burnout, I think is another very good question. I do not think I am the poster child, at least historically, of work-life balance. I'm 42 years old. I live with a golden retriever. I don't yet have a family. And if you asked me when I was in college how I thought my life would be right now, I probably would've thought the inverse. That I'd have a family and I'd one day run a company. And I did things in a slightly different order. But one of the things I've learned is that there's this temptation to work more and more and more hours. And sometimes you need ... Let's say an artist, you have to step away from the painting. And you actually start getting more derivatives, slower and slower.\n\n(00:53:13):\nAnd so I basically have tried to make it a practice to step away from the work. And so here's some of the things I do. Every other weekend I don't really work at all. And then every other weekend I work pretty intensely. If I had a family, it would probably be more like a day of the weekend I'd work more intensely. You wouldn't be a parent every other weekend, but I'm not so it's a little different. I usually make sure I exercise and I never miss a workout. So I usually wake up, I'll do 20 minutes of morning cardio on a Peloton. I'll go to the gym three or four times a week and do weights. I'll basically do cardio just about every day. I make sure that I eat really healthy. I have a classic bodybuilding diet of five to six meals a day. So I try to make sure I do that. I try to make sure I get a fairly good amount of sleep.\n\n(00:54:01):\nThe other two things I try to do is have really healthy relationships. I think one of the most important things that will govern how happy you are in your life is your relationships. I think the three things are your health, your relationships, and your work. Those are probably the three most important things. So as long as you're healthy and you have meaningful work, the last is relationships. And there was this Harvard study. It's the longest study on human happiness. I think it's 85 years old. And the question was, what's the secret of happiness? And of course they weren't expecting to have a single answer, but they got one. And the answer was, the secret to happiness, if there is one, is healthy relationships. And I had found, Lenny, that over the time of being an entrepreneur, I had gotten totally isolated. It was almost as if I didn't have friends. I had friends, but I didn't keep in touch with them. And every time I reached out to a friend, I had to get them up to speed on my life. And if you have to get people up to speed, you're not really keeping as much in touch with them. And so I started making a practice a couple of years ago to make sure that I have a group of friends that I'm constantly in touch with, including old friends.\n\n(00:55:03):\nSo I have a group of high school friends, we have a group chat and we take one to two trips together a year. I have a group of college friends, we have a group chat. We take probably a couple trips together a year. By the way, doing Airbnbs are great. We all get in a house together and it's like your opportunity to have a shared experience. And if you don't travel with your old friends, you'll have only old stories to talk about and then you say the same old stories over and over. So you want to be able to have new shared experiences. When I stay here in New York City ... I'm in New York right now. That's why you don't see my typical background. I stay in my sister's apartment. So she's got a two bedroom and I stay in her house because I like to see her. And I just make sure I spend a lot of time with friends. And of course we travel. Traveling is what I do with a lot of my friends. And then I like to draw and read. So I try to make sure it's health, work and relationships. And I try to make sure I have a balance of each. And you might call family relationships. I'm single, but that would be another version of it.\n\nLenny (00:56:02):\nI heard you say along the same lines on a different podcast about how when you're really busy, you didn't have time to reach out to anyone and they never thought they could reach out to you because they thought you were so busy.\n\nBrian Chesky (00:56:12):\nIn the old world, I was reacting, so everyone thought I was busy. So the people I really cared about, a lot of them said, \"Well, he's busy so he'll reach out to me when he's not busy.\" But here's a problem. I was so busy that all I was doing all day was responding to people. And so if people I cared about didn't reach out to me, I was dealing with incoming. I could barely deal with the incoming. Now that was a mistake. But I was reacting. By the way, here's another lesson for founders. A lot of founders spend their time based on reacting. So people will email them and they'll wake up and they'll respond to emails, and suddenly their email sets the agenda. People ask for meetings, and suddenly the meetings they take are based on the people who email them. Versus here's my strategy and then over the next year, what are the relationships I need to have and the meetings I need to take to be able to execute this strategy?\n\n(00:57:05):\nIf my life were to end in a year or in 10 years or some time horizon that's shorter than I expected, who are the people I would've wanted to make sure I spent time with? And if you imagine that your life is finite, because it is, and you imagine you're not going to be here as long as you thought you would be, because it's possible, it would completely change how you prioritize your time. I think suddenly you would start to say no to things and you'd say yes to other things. I now try to say no to what I call fake work, which is things that feel like work, but they don't actually move the ball down the field. And I really try to say yes to the work that's very meaningful and people that are very meaningful to me. So yeah, it's a really, really good insight. And by the way, that metaphor, Lenny, but it's true of companies too. You can sometimes be ... You don't want to only spend your time reacting or spending your time with the employees reaching out to you. You do want to do some of it, but then you're rewarding only one type of behavior and the introverts or the people that aren't reaching out to you aren't going to get any attention.\n\nLenny (00:58:14):\nJust one more question and then I have a quick fun question at the end. I know you have to run. If I were to ask people who are the most inspiring leaders in tech and in business in general, I think you'd be right near the top of that list. You've been through a lot of ups and downs, you've learned a lot of lessons along the way. What have you found has been most helpful to helping you continue to grow and keep up with the business, the way the business has grown, the scale and just to take on this leadership role? Is it coaching? Is it reading? Is it other mentors? Something along those lines.\n\nBrian Chesky (00:58:46):\nYou ask really good questions. And by the way, thank you. I'll share a few thoughts. I was with Sam Altman probably a few weeks ago at dinner, and I told him, \"I still feel like I have a lot to prove. I haven't made it yet.\" And he was really surprised. He's like, \"What are you talking about?\" And I didn't even realize that he thought that was an absurd notion, but I said, no, I haven't made it yet. It's not to say I'm not grateful or I feel like I need to get somewhere so that therefore I'll feel worthy. But I have this beginner's mindset that the bigger I get, the more a beginner I tend to feel. It's a weird feeling. I think when I first took off, I think I thought I knew everything or I knew more than I certainly did. But then you get past some peak or you go into this trough where you realize, oh my God, the moment you get to some frontier of knowledge, you start to become a beginner again and everything is new.\n\n(00:59:49):\nAnd so I think the first thing I try to do is to be a beginner. Pablo Picasso had a saying. He said, \"It took me four years to learn to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to learn to paint like a child.\" And so I've tried to always see the world through the eyes of a child. And I think one of the key characteristics of a child is curiosity. To see everything with fresh eyes. To not have too many judgments. When I was trying to figure how to run the company, I studied the history of divisional organizations and I studied Steve Jobs, but also studied what Bill Gates did. And I studied Alfred Sloan at General Motors that MIT Sloan is named after. And actually the founding of divisional companies, which I believe was DuPont. They were making powder for gunpowder. The war ends. What do we do with powder? Turns out powder can be used for paint, but the way you sell gunpowder and paint are different sales channels so they created what we now know as the divisional structure.\n\n(01:00:46):\nSo I try to understand the sources of things. I try to learn. I try to be shameless about reaching out to help. I think that a lot of people are afraid to reach out to help because they think other people are busy. The biggest honor most people get in their lives, or one of the biggest honor is when other people ask them for help. Because we all just want to feel useful. So don't feel ashamed to reach out to something for help. It gives a lot of them great honor. And I think you don't need to reach out to people 10 years ahead of you. They can just be people a year ahead of you. In fact, an entrepreneur getting started, I might be less youthful than somebody two years ahead of them that knows the latest distribution channels that I have forgotten. So I think that that is the key. It's learning, it's growing, it's curiosity. It's constantly having that hunger and that fire to always want to be better. To feel like I haven't made it yet. Because the reason I say I haven't made it yet is because if I've made it, then I'm done. And I want to feel like an artist. Bob Dylan used to say, \"An artist has to be in a constant place of becoming and so long as they don't become something, then they're going to be okay.\"\n\n(01:02:05):\nAnd so you have to always be evolving, learning, growing, and the canvas keeps getting bigger. The mountaintop keeps getting higher. And I feel like I'm just getting started and I hope that ... I don't know how long you intend to do the podcast, but I intend to do this for a long time and if you do or whatever, we'll definitely want to have talks. And I hope years from now, Lenny, I hope 70% of what I said I still believe, but if 100% of what I say, I still believe then I probably haven't learned very much. And so if 90% I say I don't believe anymore than I'm delusional and wrong. But I sincerely hope that I retract it or change or modify a few things I said today in a few years, because that will mean that I've gained more wisdom. And so how do I do that? By being curious.\n\nLenny (01:02:59):\nThat is beautiful. It reminds me, you mentioned Sam Altman. There's a tweet that he put out a couple of weeks ago that I'll read real quick. \"Many people have reached out to offer help and advice over the past year. No one has gotten close to Brian Chesky in terms of delivering. He will take a midnight call at any time, put in hours of work on any topic, answer difficult questions correctly with clarity, make any intro, et cetera.\" How does that feel to have seen that?\n\nBrian Chesky (01:03:23):\nI had no idea he was going to do that. And I just want to say I think Sam is obviously a once in a generation founder. I think what he's done with OpenAI is extraordinary. And when he launched ChatGPT I had known him for a real long period of time, and I knew a sense of the journey he was about to go on. And I think that he was very deep into the technical part and then research part of OpenAI. But it turned out there was a product, a design, a marketing, a leadership, a sales. So there were all these other functional responsibilities. And so being able to just play a small part in giving some advice when necessary ... And he would take what he wanted and discard others. But I think, Lenny, maybe this goes to another thing, which is all I tried to do with Sam was what other people did for me.\n\n(01:04:13):\nBefore Y Combinator, there was a person named Michael Seibel. He's in Y Combinator. And he used to meet with me and give me advice. And he wasn't an official advisor, he wasn't an investor. I didn't hire him or anything like that. He wasn't on my board. And I asked him, I said, \"How do I repay you?\" And he said, \"Well, I want you to pass this on to other founders.\" And I would meet with a lot of people in the valley, and there was just this incredible culture of generosity that we all were going to win if the ecosystem was healthy. And the ecosystem would be healthy if we all helped one another. And you pay it forward. I think that it's just one continuation of the valley of people helping one another, learning from one another. And I also feel like I learned by teaching as well.\n\nLenny (01:05:03):\nFinal question. When someone joins Airbnb, there's a very longstanding tradition of sharing a fun fact about yourself. It might be the longest standing tradition. It's always tough on the spot, but I'm curious, Brian, if there's a fun fact that you want to share about yourself that maybe people don't already know.\n\nBrian Chesky (01:05:18):\nYeah. A fun fact about me is that I actually spent most of my life as an artist. When I was five years old I remember my parents take me to the Norman Rockwell museum and I would sit in front of his beautiful illustrations. They're really paintings I should say. I shouldn't even call them illustrations. And I would try to reproduce them. And I got obsessive with art. I remember when I was maybe in elementary school, I asked Santa for poorly designed Christmas toys so I could redesign them. When I got older, one of my friends, I went to his house ... I'm going to say I was eight or nine years old. And his dad was basically redoing his deck, but his dad decided to design it himself. I think maybe he was an architect. So he had this giant dining room table, and he had this vellum paper and he had a T-square and a drawing triangle and a protractor. They were really cool looking tools, and they were basically floor plans and architectural drawings.\n\n(01:06:15):\nSo I got into architectural and landscape design when I was like eight or nine, and that led to my interest in architecture. I went to RPI when I was in freshman year of high school to do a pre-college program. Then I got into more and more drawing and figure drawing. Then I got into a film and animation. Then I got involved in environmental design. I realized that if you buy stock in a company, you could get these cool glossy annual reports. This is when the internet was nascent and people still mailed the annual reports. As so I got my dad to buy a few shares at some Disney stock. And I got these renderings and he had a report of theme parks. And I started drawing and designing theme parks in communities.\n\n(01:07:00):\nAnd I was at this private school actually for hockey. Because I had this life where I was playing ice hockey and I thought I was going to play college hockey. My dad was really into it. I was really into it. And I had an art teacher in high school at this military school. That's another fun fact. I basically went to a military high school.\n\nLenny (01:07:21):\nWow. I did not know that.\n\nBrian Chesky (01:07:22):\nAnd at this military sports academy oriented high school, I had the same art teacher from eighth grade to 11th grade. And that's not a good thing, by the way. I don't say it as a good thing because I was not diversifying my skills. And so I leave this high school because I wanted to pursue different interests than hockey. And I transferred to my public high school late my junior year. And imagine transferring to a new public high school late junior year. And I meet my art teacher who changes my life. Her name is Ms. Williams, and she sees my artwork. And by the way, my mom was nervous about me becoming an artist. She used to tell me, \"I chose a job for the love, and I got paid no money. So you should choose a job that pays you a lot of money.\" And I said to my mom, \"One day, I'm going to be an artist.\" She said, \"Oh my God, you chose the only job where you're going to paid less than a social worker.\" So I think my parents, they were supportive of me going to art, but they were very nervous. And then Ms. Williams told my mom, she said, \"Don't worry. He's going to be a famous artist one day.\" I wasn't going to become a famous artist. But what that did is I think it gave everyone the confidence for me to pursue art.\n\n(01:08:31):\nI ended up being a winner, there were multiple winners, of a national art competition, and I had my artwork displayed in the Rotunda Gallery. That then led to me getting a scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design where I ended up going to RISD. It's like MIT for design or whatever. It's a prestigious art and design school. But I got to RISD and I realized I was born 100 years too late for what I wanted to do, which is draw and paint. And I felt like at that point, photography and now AI generated art, but certainly even back then, photography was replacing a lot of the skills that I had. And that's when I was in my freshman year of college and I learned about a field called industrial design. They said industrial design is the design of everything from a toothbrush to a spaceship and everything in between.\n\n(01:09:26):\nAnd really, Lenny, maybe just to round out the story, because that was a fun fact, but I'm just ... And this is the pre founding story that I never tell. I don't think I could have ever done what I did if I wasn't an industrial designer. I think industrial designer is different than a graphic designer. Because an industrial designer, you have to work with engineering in your training. I worked with mechanical engineers, electric engineers. You have to understand manufacturing. Industrial design's very accountable to sales. If you design a building, an architect, and you design an office building and the office building doesn't get leased, the architect's usually not on the hook for it. But if you're an industrial designer and you design a product, it doesn't sell, you're on the hook for it. At least people assume you didn't design a good product. So you had to understand marketing and strategy.\n\n(01:10:11):\nAnd so that became this gateway. But I didn't really want to make items and objects my whole life. At RISD, the biggest value I got in addition to learning industrial design was I met my co-founder, Joe Gebbia. And the day of graduation Joe looks to me, he says, \"Brian, I think we're going to start a company together one day.\" And I had no idea what he was referring to. So I moved to Los Angeles where I work as an industrial designer for two years when one day I got a package in the mail that changed my life. I opened this package and it's a seat cushion with a handle on it. And it's a letter from Joe, my friend from RISD. He said, \"I started a company and everyone in San Francisco ... I live in San Francisco and all these people are starting companies. You should come here.\" And this is in 2007. YouTube had just come out. I had seen all these Steve Jobs keynotes finally on YouTube. I didn't know who he was. I'd never heard his voice before YouTube. And Apple had this renaissance and Google was on fire and Facebook was taking off. And it felt like the gears of the world that were turning were in San Francisco.\n\n(01:11:18):\nAnd so one day I go into work and I quit my job. My boss is dumbfounded. And I pack everything in the backseat of old Honda Civic. I get to San Francisco and Joe tells me the rent is $1,150. I don't have enough money to pay our rent. This design conference is coming to San Francisco. All the hotels are sold out. We said, what if we turned our house into a bed and breakfast for the design conference? I didn't have any beds, but Joe had beds and we called it Air Bed and Breakfast.\n\n(01:11:45):\nSo my fun fact was I was an artist and designer before Airbnb. Really an artist, at least how I thought about it. And I think that's maybe one of the things that makes Airbnb different. Because there's not a lot of designers or artists running Fortune 500 or S&P 500 companies. And I think that intuition, imagination, design, curiosity, I think we need more of that. By the way, I think the people listening, I think everyone on this, listen, you have these qualities. But I think that a lot of companies, it's like we're a body and the companies are cut off at the head and they're disembodied from their heart, and they're often really biased towards one side of their head. And I think that some of the greatest scientists played musical instruments like Einstein. I think that being a whole, well-rounded way of thinking about the world is good. So anyways, that's my final thought.\n\nLenny (01:12:37):\nI love that fun fact because it almost explains everything you've been talking about, which is rethinking the way companies can run, doing things super differently. So I really appreciate you sharing that. I also love that it transitioned into the creation story of Airbnb, which happens a lot at Airbnb. People hear that story over and over because it's so interesting and so important. Brian, I know you have to run. Thank you so much for being here and being generous with your time.\n\nBrian Chesky (01:12:58):\nThank you, Lenny, and congratulations on everything you're doing.\n\nLenny (01:13:01):\nThanks Brian. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:13:04):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Lessons from scaling Uber and Opendoor | Brian Tolkin (Head of Product at Opendoor, ex-Uber)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nYou've worked at two businesses that have done incredibly well combining product in ops.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:00:03):\nUber always has this mentality and Opendoor does two of the product operations, twin turbine jet plane where you can fly the plane on one engine for a little bit if you need to, but it's operating most efficiently and effectively if both are working together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:17):\nWhat has having been in ops done to make you a better product leader?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:00:21):\nGave a really deep understanding of how the business actually works. It's a pretty good foundation for them going on to say, okay, what do we actually want to build in a more scalable technology way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):\nSomething else I've heard that you're very good at is staying very calm under pressure.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:00:34):\nI've slept on the floor in China before launching uberPOOL, and when you reflect the stress onto your teams, everybody tenses out. It counterintuitively doesn't produce better outcomes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):\nToday my guest is Brian Tolkin. Brian is currently head of product and design at Opendoor. Before that, he spent nearly five years at Uber where he joined as employee 100. Before Uber had UberX or uberPOOL or any shared rides, he actually started on the ops team at Uber, moved into product, ended up leading product and launch of uberPOOL, and then taking it global. He also started the product operations function at Uber. Before that function was really even a thing, which I didn't know until the chat that we had. In our conversation, Brian shares a ton of lessons about building products with a heavy operational component. Also, how to run great product reviews, how he implements the jobs to be done, framework and Opendoor's successfully.\n\n(00:01:32):\nThe story behind Zillow trying to compete with Opendoor failing and then partnering instead. Plus a ton of great stories from the early days of Uber and Opendoor, and so much more. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Brian Tolkin. Brian, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:02:00):\nThank you, appreciate it. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:02):\nFirst of all, just a huge thank you to Kayvon Beykpour for connecting us, introducing us. He said all kinds of amazingly nice things about you. He also gave me some very hard questions to ask you. I hope you've come prepared.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:02:12):\nTerrific. Put me in my hot seat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:14):\nOkay, I want to spend a bunch of time talking about product and ops. You started your career in operations. At Uber you actually started on the ops team and you moved into product. You've also worked at both Uber and at Opendoor, which have both huge operational components. I think it's really rare that people, one, see a company scale to the heights of Uber and Opendoor with such a heavy operational component that are still tech companies and also it's really where someone starts an ops and then moves into product and ends up where you are, where your chief product officer, really successful company. So I have a bunch of questions here. Maybe the first is just what has having been in ops done to make you a better product leader? How does that change the way that you operate as a product leader?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:02:58):\nStarting on the operations side gave a really deep understanding of how the business actually works. You are truly operating it day in and day out and the success of the city is in large part driven by the inputs that you are putting into it every single day on the ground and whether or not there was rain that weekend, which was a nice driver of metrics, but talking to customers every single day like one-on-one onboarding drivers responding to support tickets, there's no centralized support team, there was no closer to the customer, right? And so I think that foundation actually for really understanding what moves the business and being super close to the customer actually is a pretty good foundation for them going on to say, okay, what do we actually want to build in a more scalable technology way?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:52):\nThis episode is brought to you by Pendo, the only all-in-one product experience platform for any type of application.

I've seen that a lot of companies, and this was definitely true to Airbnb, where the product team looks down a little bit on the ops team where they're like, \"oh, we're doing things that are going to scale to millions of users. We're doing these things that are going to apply to everyone.\" There's this ops team over there doing a few things that are going to not scale. They keep asking us for things to build for their one-off ideas. What do you think that product teams often maybe miss or don't understand about the ops teams that would help them see them in a different light?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:06:56):\nYeah, it's a great question and I think Uber always had this mentality and OpenDoor does too of like a twin turbine jet plane where you can fly the plane on one engine for a little bit if you need to, but it's operating most efficiently and effectively if both are working together, and I think that's really true, right? The reality is operations teams, local teams, can iterate faster, can scale talking to customers really much more efficiently, have great qualitative insights, and so if it's seen more as a harmony instead of a competition, I think that's really, really helpful where it's like, okay, how do we get the insights that are happening day in and day out in the field, on the ground, whatever that may be, and help us build better products because of that, right?\n\n(00:07:50):\nLike a PM sitting in San Francisco can't be in Opendoor's case 50 markets, walking houses every single day in Uber's case, whatever, a thousand cities understanding the nuances of safety in South America and it's just not possible, but what you can do is foster a really good relationship and a really good feedback loop of how people who do deeply understand those things can help give insights. Now is actually the birth of product operations was that insight as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:22):\nCan you say more on that?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:08:23):\nYeah, sure. So, sorry, I should probably define what product operations was. At Uber it was basically this notion that we had centralized, this was later in my career at Uber, but we had a centralized product team building stuff mostly in San Francisco, not strictly through the Ross, but at this point around the world, but mostly in San Francisco and then we had a very globally distributed operations team, and there was a bidirectional feedback loop that wasn't super strong and that feedback loop was basically when the EPD teams in San Francisco built new features, how do we effectively put it in global markets and then how do we effectively get input from global markets to better build features. And so one solution to that problem, our solution at the time was to start up a new function called product operations who had accountability and reported into operations but physically sat with and operated much like a member of the product team to help solve that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:23):\nIs that maybe the first time there's a... Did you invent product operations as a function?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:09:28):\nI don't think so because at the time, I believe Google had a function, I can't remember what Google called it was something slightly different, but I met with a few folks who had been in similar type roles at Google and a couple other places, so I don't take credit for certainly for inventing IT and other people have actually dabbled in this model at Uber before me there was just a formalization of it and our actual building out of the organization, et cetera.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:54):\nDid none of that. Sounds like you basically helped make it a thing. I know you're being very modest, I think. Coming back to your point about decentralized operations teams, something I've read is that search pricing came out of one GM and a market just testing, emailing all the drivers, hey, we're going to give you extra if you drive on Saturday night. Is that true?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:10:15):\nThat would've been probably a little bit before my time, but that being said, one thing that is true is that surge pricing for actually quite sometimes all of 2012, certainly 2013 probably, I don't know when we necessarily switched, was very much a human in the loop system or a very manual system where GMs in every city would control basically the parameters in which surge would operate and so much of the time that would need, for example, Monday through Friday, there would be no search, it couldn't flip on, and then Friday nights and Saturday nights it would flip on from whatever you set, 7:00 PM to 3:00 AM and the cap was X, whatever the cap was. And then within those parameters the algorithm would optimize for what the price was. But yeah, GMs controlled whether it was on or off and what geographies were surging.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:16):\nWow, I didn't know that. Was that out of we believe we are better than the algorithms or we just don't have time to make them amazing yet, so we're just going to help them along?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:11:25):\nYeah, I think it was probably a function of a bunch of stuff, one of which is like, hey, this is a fairly new concept and it's powerful and dangerous and so let's make sure we understand what's happening. The second is this belief that local city teams know their cities best and so you might know that an event is happening, a baseball game gets out and it's like, oh, I know that this baseball game's going to get out at 10:00 PM so I'm going to set surge at 9:45 and the algorithm may not be able to pick that up. And then the third is the technical constraint of nowadays clearly it's all automated, but it's really hard to build a fully dynamic, always on geospatially aware pricing system and not just a little bit of time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:17):\nThat makes sense. I feel like you're full of wild stories from your time at Uber. Is there one that comes to mind of just, I think you helped scale in China, uberPOOL?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:12:17):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:29):\nMaybe that's the one. I don't know. Can you share wild story from early Uber days?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:12:31):\nYeah, so in the early days of Uber, one fun story is obviously UberX is a random mainstream product but has a funny, silly name, UberX. This product in the early days was going to be all hybrid and had a bunch of different potential names. I was not personally driving this, this was someone else on the operations team, but they built the model for what this product could be and there's no name for it yet, so it was going to be a placeholder. So what do you put in some placeholder? X. So UberX and then the company was moving quickly enough, the product got the green light, it launched, and here we are, I don't know, 12 years later, 11 years later, whatever it is and UberX is the name that stuck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:21):\nThat is hilarious. I love it. So it was a placeholder. It's like many products start that way where they're like, this is just the temporary name, and they're like, okay, I guess everyone just knows it this way now we're going to stick with it.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:13:31):\nExactly. It's too expensive to change and rebrand at this point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:34):\nThat's an awesome story.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:13:36):\nOne that is good about scaling Uber uberPOOL in China is we were launching Uber pool in China and this was going to be, China at the time was pretty big for Uber, but uberPOOL was not there yet, and so we were going to launch. And myself and a few other folks were in Chengdu China, which is the first Chinese market that we were launching uberPOOL in and we were going to be on the ground took to launch. We wanted to go live at, I believe it was 6:00 AM for rush hour on, I don't remember the day, but whatever, Monday morning, and so we're there over the weekend getting ready to set up and at the same time we were doing some data center testing. And so we flipped on all the testing infrastructure and thought it was going to work and nothing works, and the matching algorithm just isn't working and we're like, oh my god, now it's whatever, 5:00 PM the day before we're supposed to go live, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM okay, let's get on the phone with the US, try and figure out what's going on.\n\n(00:14:43):\nI remember I slept about 30 minutes that night between 2:00 and 3:00 AM being like, okay, well, we have to go live at 6:00 AM I think there was some press around it. We were planning on going live and I think we got everything finally working at probably about five 30 or six in the morning and launched just in the nick of time. And I'll never forget, we launched, it was great, we monitored, everything was good, and then we walked out for breakfast at 7:30 in the morning. Everyone sleep depressed, no one slept all night and we got these pancakes street food things and I have to imagine they were not that good, but in my mind it was the best meal I've ever had in my life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:25):\nIt's like a meal after a marathon or a big hike.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:15:31):\nExactly. Yeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:32):\nEverything's so delicious. This comes up a lot of just these moments that are so incredibly stressful and hard and leap deprived end up being the best memories and the best stories to tell and things you look back at fondly. It's so weird how human nature is like that.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:15:46):\nYeah, I mean another one more recent for Opendoor was when COVID hit, physically we buy and sell homes, and so we were physically going into people's homes and suddenly March 2020 going into people's homes was not something people were comfortable with. And you look at the real estate data coming out of China at the time and it looked like coming to a standstill, and so we actually turned off the core business and we stopped buying homes for a few months. hey, we can't go in and we don't know if anyone's going to be buying any homes, and so what do we do? And we took those few months and then came out the other side and had virtualized the whole process. Then it was pretty stressful, right, because looking at a business that relies on going into people's homes and suddenly you can't do that anymore, what do you do? So, again, a fond memory to look back on a very stressful time in the moment where it feels very, very difficult.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:51):\nJust since you mentioned Opendoor, I think many people have heard of Opendoor. Maybe just give a quick explanation of what Opendoor does for people that aren't exactly sure.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:16:58):\nSo we're a digital platform to buy and sell real estate. The core product today is a seller focused product where people can go online, enter some information about their home, and we'll make an all cash offer to be able to sell simplicity and certainty. So the product really works for people who want something that is certain and simple and easy. I don't know if you've ever sold a home, but it can be a very, very, very successful difficult process with showings and open houses and how to price it and will it sell and all of that stuff. And so we offer basically a way to skip the whole process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:41):\nSo you basically sell your house to Opendoor and it's just like, cool, done, move on.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:17:45):\nYou picked your closing date, you move out when you want. Yeah, there's no hassle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):\nSounds amazing. I want that. Coming back to ops and product, just to close this thread again, you've worked at two businesses that have done incredibly well combining product and ops. Are there any just broad lessons you've taken away from how to make these two teams and functions work well together and to build a business that's very ops heavy but also offer driven?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:18:15):\nThe first one we touched on, which is a, there's just got to be mutual respect. Both functions have their time and their place and their skillsets, and you just don't build big businesses of this type without respecting the fact that that both need to exist. The second, particularly on the product and engineering side, is really understanding where and how the technology leverage comes from the business and then being really focused on making sure generally, especially in the earlier days, you are more limited on the technical resourcing side than you might be on the operational resourcing side. And so how do you be really focused on where to invest your time, effort, and energy technically, which is why most of the engineering effort for Uber was on the dispatching system and the pricing system. That's just where the leverage was at the time, given the scarcity of resources.\n\n(00:19:11):\nAnd so I think the second one is being really intentional about where those techs are and then being really forthcoming and saying, hey, that means all these other places where yes, it can make things easier, more efficient, et cetera, et cetera. We are okay not investing in right now, and that needs to be an explicit decision and very transparent. But then the last bit I would say is a deep understanding that the real world has entropy and it's hard and it's messy for us at Opendoor, we go into homes, someone may not be home, scheduling may be off, at Uber the driver may cancel the radio GPS. All these things happen, right? Computers are deterministic, but humans aren't, right? And so building products that have a little bit more flex or a little bit more fail safes in case those things happen becomes a little bit more of a paramount.\n\n(00:20:08):\nOne other thing, the last thing I would say is I think that the companies evolve as well. So what I talked about at the beginning of Uber being very focused from an engineering and product side on the dispatching system and the pricing system, obviously over time not to evolve now it centralized all of these functions as the company got bigger and more mature and scale and optimization started to be more important and expansion and that Petri dish of trying new stuff and the tools got better and the tech got easier and there was more internal infrastructure. And so over time things can start one way and shift over time as the business needs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:52):\nLet's actually spend more time there. You keep saying things that make me want to dig deeper. So at Airbnb we went through the same thing where there was all these local ops teams driving supply, finding homes, bringing out the platform, and then there's this tipping point where the product in organic growth or word of mouth ended up driving more and then orders of magnitude more. So there was no need for these folks to spend time doing these things. Can you just maybe share an example, either we Opendoor, when you talk about there's a time and a place and a skillset for ops, how that evolved? What was the team doing initially and then what did they end up doing as things grew?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:21:25):\nYeah, I mean, maybe a very easy good example to pick just one part of the Uber process in the early days is at small scale, actually back when it was Uber black drivers, every driver was individually onboarded in a 90 minute to a two-hour in-person in the office onboarding with deep setting of expectations. The next version of that... So that's obviously very ops driven. The next version of that is a small classroom type setting of three or five or six drivers at a given time. Also, very ops driven. And then as we got into more mass market products like Uber Taxi or UberX, it was like, okay, maybe 20 or 30 at a time. So now it's a little bit bigger classroom setting. And we said, okay, let's make a video. Instead of giving verbally the same presentation, let's just make an onboarding video and that was the next set of scale, but now suddenly we have a different problem, which is okay, you have to validate all of these credentials.\n\n(00:22:32):\nSo most driver's license who they are, all that stuff at one person, easy at three to four at a time, easy, 10 at a time, a little more challenging but fine. At 20 at a time, okay, you're starting to run up onto it now you fast-forward six months and you're doing a thousand a week or whatever, suddenly your system breaks and it's like, okay, we have reached the point where operational system improvements is no longer viable. So, you say, okay, we have gone from the iteration stage to the scale stage and technology is uniquely good at scaling. So now we say, okay, instead of having a bunch of folks around the world taking pictures of driver's licenses and validating and doing all that stuff, how do we integrate with some type of OCR technology or auto recognition of driver's licenses that feeds to a system that knows what a driver's license is or can do automatic validation and suddenly you've done two things.\n\n(00:23:27):\nOne, you've scaled your system, and two, you've just created a ton of time for what at the time was probably dozens if not hundreds of people running these onboarding sessions all over the country, the world at the time to do other stuff. And so now you can level that up and say, okay, do we do more analytics? Do we do more figure out the next process that needs optimization or whatever the case may be in that virtuous cycle just continues.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:53):\nThe way I like to think about this is do things that don't scale and then scale the things that you're doing. That's the phrase I always come back to.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:23:58):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):\nThis reminds me of a hot take that previous podcast guest shared in a newsletter post Casey Winters. He talked about that operations is usually, and it's a hot take, that operations is a sign of inefficiency and over time your job is to squeeze that away and make it product software as much as possible. Doesn't mean you always get there. Thoughts?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:24:23):\nYeah, I actually don't. Fundamentally, it depends on what the operations is, but I don't fundamentally disagree, but I think that the right lens to think about it is... And then those folks can move on to the next challenge. And so there's always another hill to climb. And so I think that was one of the things at Uber and Opendoor where there's this culture of on the ground experimentation that's really helpful where we were just talking about driver onboarding may now be solved with technology so you have a few extra hours a day. How do we get better at optimizing the UberX system? How do you start tinkering with food delivery? How do you start thinking about higher capacity vehicles? How do you think about better feedback loop for those manual surge pricing toggles that we talked about? So I generally agree it just generally free across and solve more problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:21):\nIt feels like a big part of this is making sure the operations teams understand there's more opportunity, even if this ends up being automated, your job is not going to go away. We're going to find something new to try and experiment and do things that don't skip.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:25:34):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:34):\nAwesome. Okay. Going a completely different direction.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:25:37):\nGreat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:38):\nI hear you're very good at product reviews.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:25:40):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):\nA few people told me this. I'm curious how you set up a product review and any things you've learned, any tips for how to run an effective product review?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:25:48):\nThat's very whoever mentioned that. But yes, big fan of doing them actually in particular to maybe bridge the conversations in companies that have ops driven cadences or start out very ops driven because the cadences can sometimes be different. And so the operational cadences that you might have something like a WVRA weekly business review may not be conducive to always picking your head up and saying like, Hey, where's the product going on a slightly longer timeframe. And so I think product reviews in general for all companies are probably really helpful, but actually in particular for some of the product and operations led companies. In terms of things I've learned, I think being really intentional about what the goals are, I think it's okay to say that there are two goals, a goal of accountability and inform to an audience.\n\n(00:26:43):\nBut also most importantly, I think this is the primary goal is to help make the product better, to help the teams think through a problem and to have that, again, back to our earliest conversation, be a very intellectual conversation about the work and how to make the product better and not super scary. Product reviews hopefully are not feeling like firing squads. That's a scary environment to be in and not necessarily one that's conducive to how do we make the product better. Obviously sometimes the conversations have to get a little intense, but in general that's what we're shooting for is something that helps the team go back and think through how to make the product better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:24):\nSo the two goals you try to communicate for your product reviews, accountability slash informing people what's happening, but also just like we are here to make the product better and setting that context. Yep. Is there anything you'd do specifically to make it not feel like a firing squad? Like you're coming in here to be attacked and criticized? Do you set context at the beginning of the meeting? Is this just a part of the culture?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:27:43):\nYeah, I think definitely part of the culture, but also I am a firm believer in general that the people closest to the problems also have the best context to solve that problem. And so as a more senior voice in the room, often the job is probing, asking questions, throwing out ideas in a way that says like, hey, this is an idea. This is not a mandate, this is a thought. And if there's context missing that would inform the product direction, then providing that context in not a question asking sense, but hey, this is context that you might not be aware of. And so I think it's all in how you show up as a leader and what that looks like in terms of probing and pushing the team on dimensions that they may not be thinking about. And then understanding that the team is bringing a perspective that you don't have, which is they think about this problem 40, 50, 60 hours a week, and you might think about this problem three hours a week. So you bring them a breath, the team brings a depth in haven't been there yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):\nI don't know if you heard Dharmesh Shah's episode or his thing on flash tags. Have you seen this?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:28:54):\nI have not, no.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:55):\nOkay. He has a whole system. So you talked about how as a leader you want people to not take everything you tell them as feedback as I need to do this. So he has a whole set of hashtags that communicate how important this is to him from hashtag FYI to suggestion, to a plea.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:29:13):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):\nA plea to you.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:29:17):\nThis was actually explained to me. I don't think I've seen the original source, so I'll go back and watch it, but this was explained to me as I'm actually a big fan. I think that's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):\nYeah, just get everyone on the same page. Okay. Maybe one last question here. Who do you try to invite to product reviews? Do you have any frameworks and ways of thinking of who to invite, who not to invite?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:29:36):\nYeah, good question. We, I would say have oscillated over time, but in general, big subscribers of the best conversations happen when they're relatively small, so try and keep it under 10. Could be wide distribution of the document. The artifacts created are actually really powerful and they're powerful for the whole team to understand. And secret power is they're very powerful for new people who are onboarding to be like, here are the last 20 product reviews, you'll get a pretty good idea of what's going on. But generally the conversation itself try and be relatively tight. We try to keep it under 10.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:15):\nAnd these artifacts, you mean the recordings of the meeting that people can watch or?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:30:20):\nYeah. Or just the document depends on what the company culture is, whether you want to record it or just have the document either way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:26):\nAnd then is there some specific cadence you operate on? Is it like a weekly product review that people can sign up for? Does every team, how do you like to set this up the cadence?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:30:35):\nYeah, obviously it scales are with the size of the company. For us right now, what's working well is signup cadence. We have two slots a week that anyone can sign up for as their product area needs it. And then if there's something that we would love to see that we haven't seen in a bit, we do a little bit of all in telling to make sure that the work is generally cycling through on a quarterly basis.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:59):\nThis episode is brought to you by Attio.

I hear you're a big fan of drops to be done, which is okay, so it's a fun recurring topic on this podcast. We've had many people that love it, many people that hate it. I love seeing both sides of it. I love that you find it helpful and you implement it at Opendoor. I'd love to hear just how you actually apply it at Opendoor, what you've learned about how to apply jobs to be done effectively.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:32:17):\nYeah. I think like all frameworks, the right answer is to pick your set of frameworks, have more tools in your toolbox, and then actually understand when and how to apply them. So we try to avoid being a hammer and everything's a nail. We try to for course the framework if it's not working. But I think what I really like about it is it forces you to put yourself in the customer's shoes. I think in a slightly deeper way and be a little bit more empathetic when I think about building at Opendoor versus say building at Uber or when you are building at Airbnb is we are not... Most people at Opendoor, we don't have homes to sell every week or every month, nor do we buy homes every week or every month. On average in the US is something people do once every seven years.\n\n(00:33:10):\nI'm sure the average at Opendoor is something similar, and so it's a little bit harder to be a customer. I took Uber every day. You probably use Airbnb a number of times a year. And so in some sense for some of those companies, you can bill for yourself, you would intuit the job to be done because you're just doing it for yourself. We don't necessarily have that context. And so a framework that forces us to be really thoughtful and intentional about how a customer might perceive our product is really helpful. The other thing that I like about it is the canonical version of it encourages you to think about the context in which the user's operating or the other things outside of your product that they might be going through.\n\n(00:33:59):\nAnd in our case, the home buying or selling journey often is a certainly multi-week, if not multi-month or multi quarter journey with a lot of complexity and a lot of conversations outside of our product. You may be talking to an agent, you may be talking to a friend, you may be driving around the city trying to find a house, and the framework is very flexible and encouraging of saying what is actually the job to be done of this user when they're thinking about our product and what is the context in which they're operating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):\nI'd love to go one level deeper to talk about how you actually implement it. Do you have templates of, you have a startup project as a blank, I blank, blank, blank? How do you...\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:34:40):\nI would say we're medium rigorous on template standardization or adherence. So we do have a template, the standard product review template talks about jobs to be done and has a section for what is the problem statement and what are the jobs to be done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:58):\nAnd this is a doc that when you're coming to a product review, the person running it and coming is filling out this document?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:35:04):\nCorrect, pre-filling it up, sorry, pre-filling it out. And again, I think we are not sticklers about always using that template, but I think the beauty of a template is yes, it sets expectations of what you expect, but it's also just easier often for people to be able to work off something. And so yeah, it's part of our product review template and then part of our planning process as well. Because we've used it for a while. I think there's been an internalization of the culture where people will also just start commenting about it or writing about it and saying, hey, what is the job to be done here? Or what is the user trying to do? Which is maybe another colloquial phrase in it. And so, yeah, I think there's a cultural seeping that has happened.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:49):\nFrom memory, just what is in this template. So what's the phrasing that you try to use for setting up a problem?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:35:55):\nYeah, yeah. I mean, the specific framing, I would have to go remind myself on the template itself, but generally it looks like context, problem, potential solution, risks, risks/premortal and measurement of success. And then we also try to bucket our product reviews by stage. So you could be in the ideation stage, which might look very different than at the very end of the process. Like, Hey, we're getting ready to ship speak now forever hold your piece. Those two artifacts will also be very different.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:35):\nOkay. So it's not as a blank the standard jobs to be done language, it's not exactly how you implement it's more just make sure we're thinking of it what is the problem for the customer? What is the context of their problem?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:36:47):\nCorrect. Yeah. Yeah, we're not math living our template.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):\nOkay, awesome. Any other tips or lessons about just working well with this concept of jobs to be done? Maybe when you come into Opendoor and like, hey everyone, we're going to be thinking this way. Is there anything there that would be useful to people if they're trying to operate this way?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:37:06):\nRecognizing that correctly implementing a framework, any framework, but if you don't in particular, we can talk about takes a little bit of time and getting used to and understanding. And so I don't think you can just like, okay, we're going to make the template and then that makes the content better. That just takes people's content and they wedge it into the template. It's actually the cultural internalization of like, hey, this might be phrased as the job to be done, but is this actually the job to be done? Let's talk about why the customer might be in that situation or not be in that situation. Or I think the job to be done might actually be something else.\n\n(00:37:43):\nOr you might say, hey, the job to be done is maybe an early day version would be the job to be done is to get an offer from Opendoor. And it's like, well kind of, but the broader job to be done might be price discovery for the customer. And so you can have a rich conversation where it's like, well, one might be a little bit influenced by our business goals. I don't think you just run around and people are like, yeah, I'm going to sell my house, but my goal is to get an offer from Opendoor. And so that's like, okay, the template might be the same, but it's actually the content that takes a little bit of cultural instantiation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:21):\nGot it. And it sounds like people talk from what is the job to be done that feels like a core part of the way you think about it. What is the job to be done? Just that language alone feels really powerful. Is there a resource or a book that you point people to help your team learn about the jobs to be done work? Is there one thing you find useful?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:38:38):\nNot about jobs to be done. I do a lot more pointing people towards internal examples of where I saw other PMs maybe do as well or blogs and stuff. But your blog is a column when we pass around, not about jobs to done, but just about many topics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:56):\nI'm flattered. Thank you.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:38:58):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):\nI really appreciate that. I was also thinking as you were talking, you're friends with Kayvon and jobs to be done on Twitter was quite the journey for them, traumatic for a lot of people. I think it went very far to the extreme of the-\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:39:11):\nYeah. I think they're more dogmatic about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:13):\nVery dramatic. And so I guess it's a lesson here, maybe don't take it that far.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:39:19):\nYeah. And I think it probably, and I don't know if Kayvon would agree with this, I imagine he would, the generalized version of you pick the right framework for the right job and if you say there's one framework to rule them all and this is the only framework that works and then of course every problem into it, then we chop.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:38):\nThe way I think about jobs to be done is exactly the way you're describing it where it's just think from the lens of the job to be done for our customers. So for my newsletter, what is the job to be done of my newsletter to help you become better at your job as a product person building product. And that actually ends up being really helpful. And it feels like that's the way you guys think about it at opening.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:39:57):\nYeah, absolutely. And you're crushing it by the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:00):\nThank you. So are you. You talked about, I'm going to go into another question to deflect your compliment. You mentioned that Uber, there's a million transactions happening every second, it's massive scale. Opendoor is completely different. You have very few very large transactions. Yeah. I'm curious how you do experiments, if you do experiments, do you do A/B tests? What have you learned about just how to think through low sample sizes plus A/B testing?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:40:29):\nYeah, very hot topic of conversation. We do A/B test. It is obviously the gold standard. And so we do as much as we can. Of A/B testing there are parts of our funnel and flow that have more volume than others. So top of quality testing easier than down funnels, A/B testing purely product or tech features easier than A/B testing processes, operational processes. But you're totally right. We are not doing hundreds of millions of transactions a year. And so experimentation can be more challenging. And so I think one way to think about it is A, acknowledge the problem, which just to say don't, and we've made this mistake many, many times, but don't just force yourself into A/B testing without running the power analysis and say like, hey, are we going to get results? What is the size that will detect and what is the runtime of that experiment?\n\n(00:41:39):\nAnd be honest, is that acceptable? A second lesson here, is there certain experiments that are important enough and it's hard to triangulate signal in any other way that you may say a six-month runtime is an acceptable outcome and we are going to start it in June and we will be smarter for it for 2025 planning and we're going to set it and forget it and we're grateful we did, and that's okay. But the only mistake here is thinking you'll get an answer in a month when you won't, and then pretending you do and then waking up a month later and being like, \"Well, it was insignificant and this and that.\" We could have known that. And then the third thing is, and experimentation is all about increasing your conviction in the problem or the solution. So the generalized version of the statement is, if there are parts of your funnel or flow that are low end and you can't run a canonical A/B test, how might you otherwise increase your conviction in the solution that you're building?\n\n(00:42:47):\nAnd there turns out there are a decent number of other ways to do that. The first best, most obvious is talk to more customers. But there are other statistical techniques that again, aren't as rigorous or good, but may be possible. You may be able to use observational data, you review with diff and diff, you may be able to look at sister cities or twin cities. You may be able to segment by geo, you may be able to reduce your power and say, hey, we're going to run at 80% confidence for all of our experiments instead of this traditional 95% because that's a worthy trade-off. And if we're wrong one more time out of 10, that's okay.\n\n(00:43:28):\nYou can do a long-term holdout to match your intuition. And so there's a lot of other techniques to hone your intuition. There's a lot of other techniques to build conviction and confidence. And so we try to be very creative on doing that. And then the last bit I would say is if you're not going to get significance, if there's no other techniques at your disposal, then sometimes you just got to trust your intuition and ship it. And if that's what you believe, then that's what you believed and you shouldn't spend time trying to get false precision.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:01):\nI want to spend more time on that last point, but real quick, the power analysis you talked about, there's people, don't know, there's calculators out there that you could just plug in, here's how much traffic I'm getting, here's how much of an impact difference I want to see, here's how long it'll take to find out.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:44:17):\nYep, exactly. Totally. And some of the calculators are great where you can also plug in the traffic and your acceptable runtime and it will tell you the minimum detectable impact and then you can gut check your own intuition. So you can play around with that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:31):\nAwesome. We'll try to link to one of those in the show notes. So, on the intuition piece, is there anything more there? Just like how you think about when you run the product team, just how you recommend people leverage intuition versus not. Because some companies are like, we're just going to trust the data. I don't really trust your opinion. You don't know this customer exactly. You talked about Opendoor, I'm not buying houses myself, so I don't know how much I can trust my intuition. Just what's your general advice to your product team of how to think about their intuition and when to rely on it versus not?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:45:06):\nSo, at Opendoor, for example, I'd say on the relative spectrum, we're quite data-driven. And then it's when we come into this challenge where we say, okay, that is another technique or tool in the toolbox. I think the generalized version of that is customers, products, people can surprise you. And so this happens all the time for people who build products. I'm sure you've got great stories from Airbnb where you saw something, put it out there just was very-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:35):\nAll the time.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:45:36):\nAll the time. And so I think there's definitely a humility to say if you can, if it's relatively easy to test your assumptions or test your hypotheses. That is always better to gut check yourself. And that takes a little bit of humility to say that, but we've all been wrong plenty of times. But if that's just not on the table, I think the reality is you can't pretend it is. And sometimes you got to use taste and judgment and then you say, okay, what is my conviction level and do I have just medium, low or high conviction? And if I have anything low or medium conviction and it's a decision of consequence, I should talk to more customers, check it with another person and see if their intuition matches. Something that gets me personally to the high bucket category.\n\n(00:46:27):\nAnd then I think the last part, which is some part of experimentation is if you just ship something because it's your intuition or it's where you want to see the product go, do you have a reasonable feedback loop to understand whether or not you are correct? So that could be customer support or ticket volume or feature adoption, whatever the case is, it may not be an output metric in the traditional A/B test, but some more rigorous system that says, hey, I had this hypothesis, we just shipped it for x, y, z constraint reason for red.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:04):\nI think that's awesome advice. I agree with everything you're saying. You mentioned this word humility, and it is a good segue to something I want to talk about, which is Zillow. One of the most interesting things that's happened in your space is Zillow basically decided, hey, we're just going to do what Opendoor is doing, they launched it, you're basically frenemies for a while, and then they're like, no, it's not working. Now you partner and now you work with Zillow on this stuff. So are you able to share what went down there with the story of what happened, how it went, and where things are at now?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:47:36):\nYeah, I mean we do partner with Zillow. Zillow's been a fantastic partner for us and we've really enjoyed a working relationship with them. I think when you think about it, they have tremendous amount of reach and audience and all these online platforms have tremendous reach and audience. And we happen to have a fairly unique selling solution. And so there's a nice, not to use a business school word, but there's a nice synergy so to speak, between a high intended audience who's doing a lot of browsing and searching and discovery and starting their process on one of these online platforms and what we offer, which is transaction services that allow people to actually move particularly on the seller side. And so there's just a pretty nice symbiotic relationship there with the Zillow's and the regimens of the world. And so both of those have been great partners for us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:43):\nWhat do you think Zillow maybe underestimated or didn't get about the space that made it harder than they anticipated? That seems obvious. Of course, let's go down funnel, let's just do it all. And they're like, \"Oh, shit, not working.\" What do you think they didn't get or what do you think they missed?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:48:58):\nI guess continuing on the humility point, I won't necessarily pretend to be in their shoes, but I will say the business is challenging and it's complex from a number of different dimensions. It's not a traditional software only product, but you have to be really good at pricing. You have to be really good at product, you have to be really good at the operations. You have to be really disciplined at risk. You have to be really good in the capital markets. And so you have to put all of these functions together to build a vertically integrated product. And that's the reality. And so that is something that's been in Opendoor's DNA from day one because we started with a vertically integrated product. And so we can't deliver unless we have all of those things. Right? And so I think that's something that continues to help us to this day, is that vertical integration requires all of those pieces coming together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:53):\nThat makes a lot of sense, and I think it's a good reminder of there are adjacent markets and businesses that always feel like, \"Oh, we could expand to that someday.\" Such a big opportunity, this business could be so much bigger. And then you realize your business is completely not set up to operate this way. Zillow is very software driven, just I am not going to simplify what they do, but it's a website, very software. And obviously as we talked about Opendoor, a huge operational component. And then as you said, the pricing piece and the debt stuff.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:50:24):\nYeah. Yeah, totally. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:26):\nYeah. So I think it's a really good reminder that just when you're taking on something completely different, it may not fit into the way your company operates and partnering makes sense. Anything else there that's interesting to share around the Zillow thing? I guess one is maybe it was just like, I imagine it was very stressful. Zillow's getting into it. \"Oh, shit what are we going to do? They got all the traffic.\" Yeah, anything there?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:50:46):\nYeah. I mean, it's certainly stressful. I think in general we try to live by whether Zillow or anybody else being competition aware, but not necessarily competition focused. And the reality is vast, vast in our space. A vast majority of people still move the traditional way. And so this isn't something where it's like the size of the prize isn't particularly large enough short or anything like that. The reality is it's the largest asset classroom in the United States, and if we just stay super focused on, hey, who are the customers that we serve really well that we talk to every day, there's a little bit of confidence that comes from being able to stay focused on that regardless of the competitive environment, again, because it's not like the market is fully saturated.\n\n(00:51:40):\nThis is the same thing back in the Uber days as well. It's like transportation is almost infinitely large. And so, yes, it feels like there's heated competition between Uber and Lester or whatever back in the day, but the reality is there's plenty of trips that happens and people need to get around sitting in plenty of different ways. That's neither Uber and more Lyft. And staying focused on how you can develop for your customer, I think is the best way to focus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:11):\nThere's a podcast that will come out before this episode with Jeff Weinstein from Stripe who's building Stripe Atlas. They had a similar experience with AngelList launched a direct competitor to Atlas, and then they realized Atlas is so much better. Forget it. We're just going to send everyone to Atlas.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:52:29):\nReally?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:30):\nYes. And I think it's the same exact lesson that if you just stay focused on jobs to be done, let's say, of what is the job to be done and do the best possible job, and knowing that the market is much bigger, that you're not really competing with someone else, another company, it's the default behavior in your case. It's like people are just buying their house the old-fashioned way. That's the actual competition.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:52:51):\nExactly. Yep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:53):\nYeah. Okay. So, along these lines, something else I've heard that you're very good at is staying very calm under pressure and staying very levelheaded when things are really crazy. This is something that a lot of people are not good at, especially leaders. They stress everyone out things. You go crazy, they don't create a good vibe. And then two, something people want to get better. Leaders and non-leader are like any lessons, anything you've learned about just how to develop this skill?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:53:18):\nI think part of this may have been sharpened in the early days of Uber. Everything felt like a fire drill all the time. So the only way to operate, but I think you almost hit the nail on the head in the question, which is a little bit of an intellectual answer of when you reflect the stress onto your teams, everybody tenses up and tightens up. And so it counterintuitively doesn't produce better outcomes. And so I think the other reality to remind ourselves, and these are a bunch of mantras that just are helpful in these moments, is you're never as good as you think you are. You're never as bad as you think you are. And so that more even keeled demeanor, I think allows you to have a clearer head when you're operating under the pressure and to think more clearly.\n\n(00:54:14):\nI think one of the maybe least helpful answers, but unfortunately, the reality is you got to be in some stressful situations to also have the perspective that cycles past the things past. And that remaining calm is what matters. And so maybe the advice there is reflecting on one of these situations happen, exposing yourself to them, not running from them and then learning from them so that the next time it comes around you can say, Hey, I've been here before. I've slept on the floor in China before launching uberPOOL and thinking we're going to miss a launch deadline. And what were the tools in my toolbox and my toolkit that showed me that in terms of getting it done or not, and what were the lessons?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:06):\nI love that. So part of it is just go through this experience many times and you'll start to realize, okay, it's not actually going to be as bad as people may think. You mentioned this toolkit instead of tools. Is there anything else there that you come back to that ends up being helpful? You mentioned this mantra of it's never as bad as people think it is, it is never great as people think it is.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:55:23):\nYeah, I mean, I think exposing yourself to other people's stories or however you may learn is really, really helpful. So again, whether it's your podcast or books or biographies or one of the podcasts that I love is Founders Podcast, which talks about historical famous entrepreneurs. And obviously these are elevating very famous people already, but there's a lot to learn from a lot of these stories as well and understanding that the journey in pack is nonlinear, it never is for anybody. And so I think being able to expose yourself to other stories that even may if you don't have those personal experiences and then understanding how others navigate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:11):\nGot it. So just hearing of other people's crazy experiences and building on this muscle of like, okay, they've gone through crazy stuff, things work out.\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:56:18):\nYeah, totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:20):\nWe'll make it through. Okay. I have this note here that I think either someone mentioned about you or you may have mentioned that product is finding the kernel of truth in a sea of ambiguity and signals. Does that mean anything to you?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:56:33):\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, I think in most organizations and to do the job effectively, you're going to get signals from everywhere and good ideas come from everywhere. It may be your CS team or CX team. It may be a customer directly. It may be a conversation you had. It may be a YouTube video you watched that sparked an idea. It may be feedback from an executive, it may be whatever. You went out and did a field visit. You are going to get a lot of inputs around what people think about your product, what people think you should do next. And I think that the core job is to understand what really matters, right? What is noise? What is a good idea, what is a suggestion and what is back to the jobs to be done for what is really going to move the customer forward?\n\n(00:57:24):\nAnd unfortunately that means saying no to maybe what sounds like some good ideas along the way, but if you can really figure out this is really what matters, that's the core part of the job. It dovetails even back to our earlier conversation. In the early days of building tech and ops companies is where's the tech leverage? Same question, where's the kernel of what really matters that tech can uniquely solve? And let's go do that and be comfortable with other fires maybe burning. That's what really, really, really matters. It's a hard discipline.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):\nI love that. If there's not an example, that's totally fine, but when you talk about this finding this kernel where tech could be highly leveraged, is there any example that comes to mind of that working out really well?\n\nBrian Tolkin (00:58:13):\nI mean, I think back in the Uber days, I think it was like, hey, we're not going to build sophisticated tooling infrastructure. We're not going to build a centralized growth team. We're not going to build any of that. Because if you think about the early Uber network from the simplest form, you've got a rider and a driver and you need to connect them, price the transaction and issue some receipts probably and collect payment. So it's like, okay, do we do that really well? And until we do that really well, all the other stuff is noise. It's immaterial how efficiently we answer support tickets. That's not critical. And so now it's super critical, but in the early days it's not that critical. And even the customer acquisition costs may not be super critical, in this case it's growing rapidly on the things. And so pouring fuel on the fire may not be super efficient there.\n\n(00:59:13):\nSo I think that's a very good generalized example. One other tip that maybe is helpful that I frankly constantly work on and try to get better at is all these ideas and feedback that comes from everywhere, make sure it's written down for a number of reasons. One, you can then go reference it, but two, part of the job is making sure the people who present those ideas are heard and respected and know that it's at least somewhere where it was considered. And then you can look at it all and say, okay, but what actually really, really, really, really matters here? And yeah, that's another tip.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:55):\nWhen you say written down, is there tools you find really helpful here? Is it just put it in a big doc that we're keeping? Is there anything you find to actually operationalize that?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:00:03):\nI've seen different companies do it differently, but wherever you tend to try and keep a backlog, whether that's a Google sheet or your actual backlog in Jira, whatever you use, but at least it feels like, okay, the context was captured, and the idea is there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:19):\nAwesome. Okay. I'm going to take us to a recurring segment on this podcast called Failure Corner.\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:00:25):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:26):\nIs there a story you can share of a time you failed in your career had a big failure, and how that experience made you better?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:00:35):\nWe can talk about the very early days of uberPOOL, and the first launch, if you will in San Francisco. So, carpooling product, multiple riders in a Mercedes car. And we had this idea that it would be effective for commuters, this was very, very early days. And so part of the launch was, okay, we're going to beta it with just some popular commuting corridors with specific companies or maybe the marina to Google or whatever and try and match people according to what their companies and that's how we'll drive liquidity. And we very quickly realized that back to what the kernel of truth is here is liquidity is the only thing that matters. And there just wasn't enough. There was never going to be enough to do this company based thing. That wasn't the strategy that was going towards from us. And so the reason I don't know if it's a full failure is maybe this is true all failures, you learn from it, you pivot and you go on to the next thing.\n\n(01:01:52):\nAnd obviously we did that and then spent a lot of our time and effort trying to say, okay, what are the bounds of liquidity and driving liquidity that we can do to understand what the most important or what the limits of the product are. So as an example, we launched and maybe people in San Francisco. Remember this $5 anywhere in San Francisco, we work for promotion, which is obviously a great deal, obviously costs a lot of money, but the whole idea here is like, oh, okay, if liquidity is what really matters, if we were to juice that and really drive liquidity, how high can our metrics get? And then we can go chase more sustainable ways to do that. But it was a interesting fail case from launching and learning to say, hey, this initial strategy just isn't going to work, we got to go. And any part of it was a hedging strategy where with a small audience and there'll be a beta population, it's like, well, this one you just got to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:51):\nI think a lesson there is also don't overthink it, don't try to get too cute. Just like we're trying to make a perfect beta test versus realizing, okay, we just need a lot more people in it. Also, your $5 promotion made me think of the early promotions of the ice cream and the bunnies delivery and all that stuff.\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:03:13):\nYeah. That was by the way, a example of fully distributed, the benefit of having those early Petri dishes. Someone a local marketing manager like, Hey, this would be fun. Yeah, that would be really fun. The platform can support it. And those promotions were fantastic. And it started out, I can't remember if the first one was ice cream or puppies, I think it was ice cream. But yeah, branched into all sorts of stuff. Boats, ice cream, puppies, kittens, I think, and all credit goes to local ideas of inspiration just being focused on trying to grow within.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:56):\nI love that we've circled back to the beginning of our conversation, product and ops working together, the benefits of both. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Any last nuggets of wisdom that you think might be useful to people when they're trying to build product companies teams?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:04:13):\nThis was great. We covered quite a bit of ground. I think the only, I don't know if this is a generalized wisdom, but something I've been thinking about as my career has progressed a little bit, especially building out proper organizations, especially as more tools come online, it's very clear that there's different types of PMs and we spent a lot of time talking about once we can operate in the physical and the digital or the product and operations worlds. But even within that, there's more technical PMs who grew up in minute engineering discipline. There are people who came from ops and there are people who came from design and grew up in a more user experience background.\n\n(01:05:01):\nAnd one thing that I've been moved on as is build out the team is thinking similar to a product roadmap is it's not really about is this person good or bad or whatever, it's is this person's skillset and context to the problem that is really needed. And so back to that conversation on, hey, where do we get tech leverage? It's like, Hey, is this person who has this unique skillset as a PM for this problem type? I don't know if that's helpful, but it's something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about, especially this view job posting niche view product manager. Or it's actually like, well, how can we be a little bit more thoughtful about what the actual skillset needs off this type of team?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:47):\nAwesome. It's like a person product fit.\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:05:50):\nThere you go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:50):\nAnd I think it's because a lot of companies hire generalists and they're just like, we'll hire someone smart, ambitious, and with experience and general experience and then we'll put them on different things. So I think these are two different philosophies and it probably makes a lot of sense for an Opendoor with very unique type of business, with very specific skills that are necessary to be really good there. Okay, amazing. Brian, with this, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:06:16):\nLet's do it. Can't wait.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:17):\nLet's do it. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:06:23):\nShoe dog, Black Swan, Design of Everyday Things, and for a fun one, Shawn Theron.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:36):\nAmazing. Four books for the price of two to three. I love it.\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:06:40):\nApologies. I'll stick to the rules.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:42):\nNo, no, there's no rules. There are no rules.\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:06:45):\nThere you go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:46):\nNext question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:06:50):\nI like the sports docu ones on Netflix, so Full Swing, Drive to Survive, Break Points, tennis, golf, F1, all of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:02):\nAnd wasn't there that Nike documentary recently with Ben Affleck?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:07:05):\nThere is, which I have not seen. So if it's good, I don't know if that's a recommendation or just an acknowledgement.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):\nIt's worth watching. If you like Shoe Dog, I feel like you'd enjoy it. It was entertaining Michael Jordan, things like that. Next question, do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really love?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:07:24):\nSo we just got a puppy and we are about to have our first child. And so all of my purchases recently are puppies and children focused. My buddy gifted us the Phi collar for our dog, and so we've been really enjoying that. Another one as I'm getting busier for news and stuff is Particle, which is a great news aggravation tool, AI news tool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:54):\nCavan's wife's business. I am a huge fan, actually I think it just came out of beta and now it's like a full app that anyone can download. I just actually installed it yesterday again and I love it. I get these pushes every few... I don't know, it's like a couple of times a day of just like, here's what's happening. Also, congratulations I should have said on your pending child.\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:08:16):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:17):\nLucky for you. I have a newsletter post with all the products you should buy, it's called New Parent Gift Guide for Product Managers.\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:08:24):\nLove it. I will definitely probably buy all of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:30):\nIf you don't already have them all. And now everyone's probably sending you their spreadsheets of all their favorite stuff there.\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:08:30):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:35):\nOkay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with people either in work or life?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:08:41):\nWell, mostly just stay curious.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:44):\nStay curious. I love it. Two more questions. Who has most influenced you in the course of your career?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:08:54):\nOne of the people who inspired me very early on in my product journey. I've been fortunate to have a number of very good mentors and obviously we talked about earlier while I was founders of books or me a lot from other people's journey. But one person who was personally important to me early in my product journey and very supportive of this guy named Jeff Holden, who was the chief product officer at Uber back in the day, and is like a young PM transferring into product really took me under his wing. And I think I'm forever grateful for that, for Jeff, for helping grow my career, but also try to pay it forward a little bit in terms of people who are going in the career. That was really meaningful for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:42):\nLast question. I hear that your interview at Uber was pretty wild. Can you tell that story?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:09:48):\nYeah, I can. So, long story short, I was starting a company my senior spring before graduation and we had to go our separate ways. So I hadn't done traditional recruiting ever. And my buddy called me up and was like, \"Hey, we're looking for smart, hardworking people at this Uber thing. Are you interested?\" And quick side note, I had actually done some very early diligence work on these taxi apps back in 2011, looking at the time was Uber Cab and Cabilis and Taxi Manage can probably names nothing these days. And so I knew what Uber was and so I said, \"Yeah, sure, I would love to.\" And so I had the first round of interview went well, and they said, great. And at that stage is come on onsite, the full enchilada one works, and this was post-graduation and was helping out some companies but didn't have a full-time job.\n\n(01:10:51):\nSo I said, hey, I'm pretty flexible. How about next Tuesday? I said, great. So we scheduled it and then on Friday or Saturday or over the weekend I looked, I'm like, oh, Tuesday's, July 4th. I scheduled my interview for July 4th. And so I called my buddy and I'm like, hey, I am so sorry. I don't want to make people in on July 4th. Should I cancel? Should I reach out? Everyone's accepted. Whatever you do, do not cancel your interview. Like, okay, I'll be there on July 4th. And so I went in to the office on July 4th and there was a very small handful of people there. It was actually launching that day, was launching Uber's second ever product type, which was Uber SUV. And I had this, I think it was probably five hour gauntlet interview on July 4th from noon to five and missed my July 4th barbecue. And it was quite the experience, but I think maybe set the stage for some of the early days chaos. I'm very glad I didn't cancel the interview.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:58):\nAnd was Travis involved in that interview or is it just-\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:11:59):\nTravis was involved in the interview. She was one of the... I think there were four or five people, and the two who were generally guiding my interview process and Travis and one other person starting that day. And part of the gauntlet interview was a simulation of the job, if you will. And so some of that was building some novels on the computers and some of it was writing potential emails to drivers and if she had the driver come in and you did chat, so I was in this room by myself typing away on the first part, which was building the model. And I hear him knock on the door and Travis comes in and he just sits down and says, \"Hi, I'm Travis.\" I don't know who you are, but I'm Brian, and we have a 45-minute chat, or maybe it's been about half hour, 45 minutes. And clearly I'm not producing the work that I'm supposed to of the interview.\n\n(01:12:59):\nI'm supposed to be building this model. I'm supposed to email it back to the person who sent it to me. Clearly I've done nothing chatting with the CEO. And I hear a knock on the door and the door opens and the person sees that I'm talking to Travis, \"Oh, continue, continue\" and it was very good. Also, pretty intense conversation with Travis that definitely set the expectations working there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:24):\nAnd clearly worked out. And Travis was happy. Is what-\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:13:28):\nI hope so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:28):\n... I imagine.\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:13:29):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):\nAmazing. Brian, thank you so much for being here. We went through everything that I was hoping to get through. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, and is there anything you want them to check out that you might be up to? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:13:44):\nSuper kind. They can find me online on Twitter, LinkedIn, both just Brian Tolkin, my name. In terms of being useful, if you have a home to sell, feel free to go on to Opendoor. More importantly, if you have feedback on the product, but would love to hear it. Otherwise, any feedback on what people liked or would love to learn more about from what we chatted about would be super great. So I'd love to hear from you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:09):\nBrian, thank you so much for being here.\n\nBrian Tolkin (01:14:12):\nLenny, I really appreciate it. This was great. Bye everyone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:16):\nThank you so much for listening.
