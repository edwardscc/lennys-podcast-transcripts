You're head of growth at Instagram, you're VP of product at Instacart. You're now director of product management at YouTube and I've heard that you've had a lot of impact on a lot of different cultures.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:00:10):\nI found this framework travels with me. It's got these five components to it, vision, skills, incentives, resources, action plan, and you need all of those to have change. And then within those buckets you've got to figure out what are the right levers that you need to pull? What are the things that are missing?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):\nYou're really big on something you call understand work?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:00:29):\nWhat I call the anti-paren of what we want to do. Someone says, \"Hey, you know what? This would be great to build.\" And you go pull data to go justify why that would be great to build. Call that identify, justify, execute. First you have to really understand from first principles what is actually going on. So understand, identify, execute.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):\nYou wrote this legendary blog post called How to Choose Where to Work and What to work on.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:00:50):\nThere's impact that you're really trying to drop and the impact is only achievable by looking at set of variables related to the environment, the set of variables related to your skills.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):\nToday's guest is Bengaly Kaba. Bengaly was an early growth PM at Facebook where he was responsible for how people make friends on Facebook. He was Head of Growth at Instagram where he helped scale a platform to over 1 billion users. He was also VP of product at Instacart. He's also worked with tons of amazing startups as a Growth Advisor, including Twitter. He's now Director of Product Management at YouTube where from what I hear, he's already made a huge dent. This conversation went long because there was so much gold to be extracted from Bengaly's head and I could not stop myself from learning everything I could in our time together. This episode is for anyone looking to level up their product and growth chops or also just do better in your career.\n\n(00:01:42):\nWe dig into his framework for how to choose where to work and what to work on. The importance of spending time on something he calls understand work, his adjacent user theory and how it can help you drive growth. A bunch of advice for coaching product managers and managers of managers, tons of lessons and stories from his time at Instagram, Facebook and YouTube and so much more.\n\n(00:02:03):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Bengaly Kaba.\n\n(00:02:18):\nBengaly, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:02:22):\nThanks for having me. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:24):\nSo many previous guests have recommended that I get you on this podcast, which I already knew. Funny story, when I first launched this podcast, I asked you to be on it. You're like, \"Sure.\" And I included you on my launch poster of all the guests that are going to be on the podcast, and then you decided to take on a very hard work and jobs that kept you from having time, and so I'm really excited that we're finally doing this.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:02:47):\nI'm glad we're finally making a reality. Sorry about that, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:50):\nNo sweat. You actually mentioned to me that somebody came up to you in Zurich and was like, \"I'm excited for you on Lenny's podcast.\"\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:02:57):\nYeah, it was crazy. I was visiting a team that I managed there about to get back on a plane to go back to SFO and just standing there doing some work, minding my business and I get on the plane, I'm talking to a colleague and someone comes up to me, I don't think I've ever seen them before, and said, \"Hey, sorry to interrupt you. I'm so excited for your podcast with Lenny. I can't wait for it.\" And then just walks away and I was like, \"What is going on right now? Lenny is a big deal. I don't even know how this person knows me.\" And that's how I knew Lenny, that I had to reschedule with you because I was like, if people are coming up to me and telling me that they're excited, I was like, there is a lot of anticipation. And Lenny, the power of your reach now is legit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:37):\nThat is hilarious. That's a new strategy for me to get people on the podcast just say they're going to be on the podcast and then the pressure will start.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:03:46):\nOh yeah, I mean, totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:46):\nOkay, so there's two broad topics that I want to spend our time on today. I want to talk about career advice and growth advice and they're both essentially growth oriented, one's career growth, one is product growth. How does that sound?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:03:57):\nSounds perfect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:58):\nThis episode is brought to you by Wizard, empowering product leaders to ideate and iterate faster than ever before.

Members FDIC. So let's maybe start with the career. You wrote this legendary blog post called How to Choose Where to Work and What to Work On that a few people have mentioned to me was really impactful in their career. And just to remind people of your career path, which they'll hear in the intro, but just to give people a reason to listen to your advice on career, you are early growth PM at Facebook, you're Head of Growth at Instagram, you're VP of Product at Instacart. You worked with a ton of amazing startups as an advisor, including Twitter, you're now Director of Product Management at YouTube. This is a career that many people would dream of having. So let's just spend a little time on this topic of how to choose where to work and what to work on. And I know you kind of have this framework in this post, so maybe that's a good way to start out just how you broadly think about where to work and what to work on?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:07:18):\nYeah, that blog post that you're referring to actually came out of a personal struggle that I had when I was at Facebook and trying to decide what my next move should be. I felt like I was kind of stuck. I felt like I was working harder but not seeing incremental benefit to the work that I was doing. And I knew that I needed a change, but emotionally I understood that, but I couldn't really have an objective way of thinking about it. And so I really pushed myself to figure out what is actually going on with my situation and how do I create a way that I can rely on objectively to understand what's actually going on? And so I looked at that situation and I wrote that post and the framework is really that there's impact that you're really trying to drive and that is the thing that is the most important. And the impact is only achievable by looking at two sets of variables, a set of variables related to the environment, a set of variables related to your skills, and really breaking down each and understanding what's happening in the environment bit by bit and what's happening with your skills and where are you hindered structurally within the environment? Where are your skills kind of lacking and what do you have control over? And using that whole kind of output, that framework to decide what makes the most sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:40):\nWhy is impact the key output of this equation? I think for a lot of people that isn't necessarily the intuitive variable that they think is important to focus on. Why is that so important in your experience?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:08:51):\nYeah, I mean I didn't really know how to think about what the right thing to optimize for was initially, and I realized that it's not compensation. Compensation is a reflection of the input, the impact that you're having, and you're leveling how [inaudible 00:09:12] you are, how much scope you have is a derivative of how much impact you're driving. The more impact you're driving at your company, the more people feel like you can operate independently, you can drive real results the more that scope they'll give you. So really impact became the thing to optimize for. It is the import and compensation becomes an output based on that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:32):\nI think this is a really important point that is easy to miss and this is what I always tell people when they're looking for ways to get promoted and do well in companies, just find ways to have more impact. Can you maybe make it even more concrete? What does impact mean to you when you talk about impact?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:09:46):\nYeah, I mean, so impact can be a lot of things, but I think for a product manager for example, it's really one, helping to drive extreme clarity about where the problems with the product, where there's opportunities and what is the right focus and prioritization? That is actually a form of impact. Just creating the clarity that people need to understand and believe in the investment. The reason why I name this and it feels a little counterintuitive is that the more senior you get, the more there are questions of are we even investing in the right place, right? Is this area, is this team, is this org the right investment? And so being able to even create the clarity that there is opportunity, it is the right thing to do, it is strategically and structurally important, is a form of impact. And then actually delivering on that impact, showing that you can make progress quickly, that you can deliver fast lane wins as Casey Winters would say, or medium and slow wins and then actually showing that you can do this again and again is how you actually validate the impact that you can see where the opportunity is and what's going on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:53):\nAwesome. Okay. So this equation is impact equals environment type skills. Can you talk a bit about how to work on these two elements?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:11:01):\nSo the environment was the one to me, that I think is most people overlook and I overlooked when I was first thinking about this. Environment in this case, I think I kind of discreetly named a few things. One is your manager, then there's the resources. So what kind of team do you have? Is your team staffed appropriately? Do you have the right P&L, whatever budget to get the things done that you need? Then there's a scope, what is in your remit versus not in your remit? Because if you don't have enough scope, then you can't actually focus on the things that are most important. The team itself, the skills, relative skills of the team, your compensation in some ways is part of the environment because if you're not compensated fairly, you don't believe you are, then it's hard to feel like the work that you're doing is meaningful.\n\n(00:11:47):\nAnd then there is the last part is the company culture. So to what extent is the culture a place where you feel supported, included, you feel like you can do your best work? And so you are really looking at each one of these variables, and I look at this every year and I say, \"How is my manager doing?\" How do I think about my manager? How do I think about the resources I have, the scope, the team, the conversation, the company culture and to what extent? And I score them, I score them as a 1 means it's kind of neutral. A 2 means that I'm greatly benefiting from this situation and something even closer to zero is I'm not in a good place. So I assign a score in quarter point increments, 0.25, 0.5, 0.751 up to 2 every year. And I really ask myself, what is the state of each one of these and to what extent do I believe that they can and will change?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:40):\nWow, I love this. So there's this formula, impact equals environment times skills. Within environment there's these five variables and they add up to 10?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:12:49):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:50):\nIf they each give you two points. That's so cool. Okay, so the five, just to be clear, your manager, the resources you have, is teams number three?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:12:58):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:59):\nCompensation and then the culture of the team?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:13:02):\nAnd then your scope as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):\nAnd then scope. Okay, got it.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:13:04):\nIt's actually six, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:05):\nOh, there's six. Okay, got it. So it's up to 12. So the idea here is you score each of these of how you're feeling, how the environment is contributing to the impact that you're delivering. And if one of these is not a great score, that's an opportunity to improve your impact, which will improve your career?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:13:26):\nThat's right, and you have to really be honest. I think part of what makes this framework so powerful for me at least, is that it helps you to be honest around what are the things that are limiting your ability to have impact and for your skills to really land? And to what extent do you believe that you can help to change or try to influence the change in the environment? Because no one wants to be in a place where there's a bad culture and the culture is a bad fit for you, but if you're not really thinking about it objectively and naming that, or maybe it's the culture of the team that is not the right place for you, so it really forces you to evaluate what's going on around you that's limiting your impact.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:05):\nIs there an example from your career you could share where one of these was not where it needed to be and either helped change it or realize you had to get out of there?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:14:14):\nWhen I was actually at Facebook, I was running the team that does all the people recommendations and it was a great team. I actually had a massive, massive team. I had 30 engineers I was working with, 15 machine learning engineers and 15 front end and back end engineers. And so great team, incredible team, lot of resources, ton of scope. In some ways it was too much scope and to me that was problematic because I really needed to build out, I felt like multiple teams to support the work that we were doing or to break it up; because it was, I mean the pace, the velocity you can imagine at Facebook was incredible. And I felt like between all of the work that we needed to do, the amount of engineering capacity that we had and the amount that was on the table, I felt like I wasn't resourced in a way where I felt like I could actually deliver on all of the things that were necessary without burning myself out. And I felt like I was burning myself out and I couldn't really see the forest through the trees because there was so much to do.\n\n(00:15:20):\nAnd so that was a situation that I didn't really understand how to navigate at that point in my career. And there were two or three manager changes concurrently, and so I didn't have a manager to lean on that I felt like I had a relationship with to help me to navigate that space. And I felt like the scope was actually too much for what needed to be done, and so I needed to find a better kind of fit for me. There was nothing wrong with the team, it was a great learning environment, but it was the confluence of scope and manager and all happening at once just wasn't a good fit for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:53):\nA lot of people are in these situations where they'd say they go through this score, they identify I have way too little scope, way too much scope like you described, and there's always this question of can I actually make a change or is this just not, am I not in a position? Especially, I see product managers, there's just always a lot of, I can't actually change anything. What do you often tell people around this that just feel like there's nothing I can do here and my manager sucks, what am I going to do?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:16:17):\nWell, I do think one of the things that I recognize is your manager. Not all of these variables is created equal and the manager is the most important variable in the environment, because a great manager who is empathetic, who is aware of what's going on, who is a great communicator, has the ability to move the chess pieces around and to fix some of these for you either immediately or in time. There's no one other than your manager who can really help to increase your scope or to help make sure that the team has the right pieces in place, or dial in some of the issues that you might see in culture.\n\n(00:16:56):\nAnd so that is why people say they don't leave a job, they leave a manager because the manager is the one that has a lot of the power to fix a lot of these variables. And so really the question becomes like to what extent have you been able to clearly articulate what are the... And dispassionately articulate, what are the challenges that you're having, you're seeing across some of these variables with your manager? Help them to tie it back to how it's impacting your work and see if they can help you to create a plan to alleviate some of these things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:28):\nThat's super interesting. Then your experience with the manager is kind of the core of a lot of these variables. Is there anything you recommend to people if their managers is not someone they like, is it just try to find a new manager or potentially leave?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:17:39):\nYou're never going to always like your manager, right? That's not the... The goal isn't to like your manager. Ideally, you respect them and they respect you, you feel like there's things that you can learn from them. Finding a new manager is always an option, but I guess sometimes the real question is, is actually spending time to try to understand what is your manager optimizing? A lot of times I think there is a big disconnect between an IC focusing on their discrete area and try to optimize for local maxima, versus understanding, okay, my manager's thinking about these things and this is how I fit in, and understanding maybe they have a gap to understanding why your area is important. Or maybe there's stuff that's on your manager's plate that is actually adjacent to your remit that if you understood that they were optimizing for, you can take that on and you would find more synergies with what they're trying to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:28):\nI love that advice. Let's talk about the other side of this equation. We've talked about environment, let's talk about skills. What do you advise there for folks that want to improve their skills?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:18:37):\nThe skills part is really, really big and it's something that requires I think, consistent evolution of your own abilities. And so I broke it out in that blog post kind of communication, your ability to influence your leadership, strategic thinking and then execution, actually getting things done. The communication above these, again, not all of these are created equal. I think communication is the one that tends to be the most impactful. And you see this in a lot of ways. You see this for people who are poor executors but incredible communicators and they seem to continue to rise and rise because they can tell a great story, but when you look under the covers, there's nothing there. There's no substance there.\n\n(00:19:17):\nSo communication for better or worse is one of the most important things. But building out your skills I think is really just kind of a, it is an interesting time to be in product and to be in tech right now because you have so many more ways to build out your skills than what previously existed. Just so many incredible blog posts like your podcasts and blogs, there's so many incredible people who've come on here who tell you things like how to go to market, how to think about B2B SaaS and metrics. And so listening to you, reading Ben Thompson, understanding his mental models, if you go to look at Elena Verner or whoever, there's so many thought leaders who are out there.\n\n(00:19:56):\nSo I think being a voracious reader is really, really critical because it helps to build your toolkit and you need arrows in your quiver to really understand how to think about the right framework and the right mentor at the right time.\n\n(00:20:09):\nOne thing I also tell people is people think about mentorship as like, I have a mentor, Lenny is my mentor, or John is my mentor. I tell them, it's actually better to have a stable of mentors. You want to have three or four. And ideally, what you do is you meet with each one of them once a month on a different Friday of the month. And so you might have three or four people on every Friday you're meeting with someone different. And the reason why this is so important is because if you, Lenny, are a mentor to me and you're busy one Friday and we only meet once a month now I don't have anyone to talk to for two months. And you're going through a lot of things and you're not really able to bounce ideas, or build skills or learn how influence others, but if you have three or four mentors, you have someone different to talk to every week. And if one or two of them cancel, you still have two people to talk to that month and you still can continue to grow and to build your thinking.\n\n(00:21:01):\nSo that's something I always recommend. And then the last thing I actually talk about is, when it comes to execution, I think people don't, especially product managers, don't do enough of watching and learning from others. There's an art and a science to product management. And in a lot of ways I come from a background of education and in a lot of ways in product management, it's very similar. You want to watch how well the people hone their craft, how they deliver, how they lead teams and kind of steal things from them. Figure out, well, wow, Lenny did this really, really well when he was at Airbnb. It was really incredible. I'm going to take that. I'm going to take how he runs that team, or how he landed that framework, or how he communicated this message and note it and use it in my own toolkit later on. And so if you're really a student of product, you can't just be a student of theory, you've got to be a student of practice too, meaning you're going and you're looking, it's like, \"Hey, I'd love to sit in your team meetings. Can I come watch? Or your PM meetings or your leadership meetings.\" And you are really like doing that for the sake of learning is really, really incredible. And that's some of the ways I talk about building skills.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:05):\nIs there an example of that latter lesson that you learned from someone that comes to mind of watching someone and like, oh, I'm going to do that.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:22:13):\nEarlier in my career, when I first got to Instagram, I wasn't the first Growth PM, but I was one of the first and a guy who was there before me, his name was Georgia Lee, he actually stood up the growth team and ended up leaving six months right after I joined. But I watched, George was a really good listener. He had just a really incredible ability to be in a room and hear what was going on, to recast it back and make sure that everyone felt good about where we were and what was being said and the path forward, and really crystallizing the action items and also how people felt about what the next steps were. And walking out of that meeting, it felt like he always had buy-in and clarity and was helpful to build trust. You can see him almost winning trust in every moment of that meeting. And that was something that I really admired, and learned, and kind sought to emulate later on in my career.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:15):\nThat's an awesome example. It comes back to the skill of communication that you talked about, just the power becoming really good at that. And this is such a simple skill you just described, is just recapping, here's what we talked about. Here's what we're going to do. Here's the decisions we made. Here's action items. It's not actually difficult, it's just-\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:23:30):\nIt's not, actually. But what was magical about the way he did it. It's like he would name people and their contributions and show how all of this came together into what is the path forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:41):\nThat is amazing.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:23:41):\nAnd it's the communication, but it's also the other side. It's the other coin, the side of communication, which is eliciting to figure out how you communicate back to others.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:49):\nSo good. Following up on something else you talked about, which is mentors. Anytime someone talks about finding mentors, everyone's always, how do I find a mentor? What advice do you share with folks of how to find a mentor to help? You say once a week or once a month?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:24:03):\nWhere I see people find the most success is they ask. They tell people what they're working on or what challenges they have and they say, \"Do you know someone who I might be able to learn from who has done this or has good thinking about this recently?\" So instead of just going to someone saying, \"Hey, can you be a mentor?\" Coming to me and say, \"Hey, Bengaly, I'm actually trying to figure out how do I change the way this team operates because we need to go from this model to that model, but here's some of the challenges. So do you know someone who's actually really good at changing the way teams work or really good at communicating a new vision that I can talk to?\"\n\n(00:24:40):\nAnd so that I think is really important because what you do is you're creating a seed, and the seed is there's a triad and you have the person who's looking for the mentor. You have the recommender, the recommender, and then you have the potential mentor. And the recommender is basically saying, \"Here, there's common purpose between the two of you and I can see it, and I think this is important, so I want you all to come together.\" And that triad in that moment creates a higher affinity, highly likelihood that the person who needs the help and the person who you're connecting them with are going to see mutual benefit from one another. And I think I find that just doing that and seeding that and being really focused on what the opportunity or the challenge is, tends to lead to better connections as opposed to just reaching out and saying, \"Hey, I like your style. Will you be my mentor?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:30):\nSo essentially share with folks you trust, here's what I'm working on. See if they recommend someone that could help you with that specific skill versus assuming that there's this person that can help you with this skill?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:25:40):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):\nI love it. Going back to your advice on career, something that you wrote about in your post plus folks have told me you're really big on, is this something you call understand work? Does that ring a bell?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:25:53):\nYes, it does.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:53):\nOkay. Talk about that and why that's important?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:25:56):\nI certainly cannot take credit for understand work. This is part of an old Facebook framework of understand, identify, execute. What I-\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:26:00):\nFacebook framework of understand, identify, execute. What I probably will say is I guess I've been the shepherd for understand work in other companies. I've taken it from my time at Facebook and Relink Institute or rigorously at Instagram, then at Instacart and when I helped with Twitter, now at YouTube. The way I like to talk about it with my teams is that first I tell a story actually, and the story is we've all had a moment where we have worked on something with a team, super excited, finally it launches and we go out to dinner and we celebrate. And we're celebrating, everyone's juiced. It's great night. You go back to the office the next day and you look at the metrics and the metrics are flat and everyone's a little bummed. Why did this happen? Right. Why are the metrics flat? What happened? We worked so hard.\n\n(00:26:49):\nAnd ultimately when you unpack it, you realize that you built something that you thought was going to be a good idea, but you really didn't understand a lot of key components of what people really needed, what pain points really existed, or what were the alternatives and what the real value of those alternatives were in the market, or exactly how the product needed to work, what the flywheel or what the experience needed to be. And so that is what I call the anti-pattern of what we want to do and I call that identify, justify, execute. Right. Where you identify something, someone says, \"Hey, you know what? This would be great to build.\" And you identify that, then you go pull data to go justify why that would be great to build and then you sink an ungodly amount of time working on it in order to make it work, but it ultimately doesn't succeed.\n\n(00:27:36):\nAnd that is the anti-pattern to what is kind of like the Facebook kind of way of thinking, which is understand, identify, execute, right? So first you have to really understand from first principles what is actually going on. So when we talk about understand work, there's a few ways to think about it. One is, it is an intentional affordance in your execution to do the work that helps you to de-risk a project and to learn what's going on. When I say an intentional affordance, meaning you put it down like Lenny is going to work on this thing. Right. Lenny as a product manager is going to write a strategy. Janice as a designer is going to design a prototype, whatever the thing is, and you put it down as actual an item as opposed to assuming it's going to happen in the background. We don't make an affordance for understand work, then the work doesn't get done and everyone's just sprinting on execution.\n\n(00:28:27):\nAnd so it's a planned intentional time to the team's bandwidth to figure out what is it that we need to do to understand what's happening. And so for example at Instagram we did a lot of understand work of what makes for a good connection? Right. How do we want to think about that? How do we want to make sure that we're actually growing a graph, a social graph that makes sense? And so I might work with data science to do understand work, to pull a funnel and look at the different types of connections for different types of users and make it make sense. Right. And engineering might do understand work to instrument logging to make sure that we have the data that we need in order to tell the story. And so you're doing this understand work to basically better understand the gaps in knowledge. What's also really interesting is that understand work helps you to clarify what is a root cause, or what is a job to be done, or what is the right use case?\n\n(00:29:25):\nAnd because the team adopts this mentality, it becomes this forcing function for execution. So when someone says, \"You know what we should build? We should build this.\" You have a team that's enabled and empowered to say, \"That's a good idea, but we don't actually understand these three things before we start working on that. So maybe we should do understand work to make sure that that is actually the right idea.\" Right. And so what you end up getting by embracing this concept is two things. You get parallel paths of work. So every sprint, let's say you do a three-week sprint or a three-month roadmap, you're executing on the things that you have a lot of conviction around and you're also doing understand work in parallel. And so at the end of the sprint you have learnings from what you executed. Wow, that test or that launch worked really well. We should double down. Or Wow, that test or launch didn't work. Here's how we should pivot. And you have insights from the understand work and you use both of those to plan the next sprints or roadmap. Right.\n\n(00:30:29):\nAnd so because you have this parallel path, you end up getting this velocity multiplier over time. Right. So the next sprint, and the third sprint, and the fourth sprint, every subsequent sprint you de-risk new ideas, you've gotten more clarity. And so you do more execution, you do better execution and you move faster and the things you ship, you have a higher win rate on the things you ship, right? And your shipping, I remember when I left Instagram, this is many years ago, but we had 15 teams and we might've been running 12 to 20 experiments a quarter a team, and I would say probably 60 to 70% of them were positive and shippable, which is incredible. I mean, you think about and multiple and the magnitude of that and it was because we were so effective at de-risking and understanding what was going on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:18):\nThis is really interesting. I imagine many people listening here are like, we put time into understanding, we run experiments, we write strategy docs, we use research. What is it that you think people are, where do you think they're missing? Is it that you dedicate people's actual time, like you're just doing understand work instead of building a new thing. For this next sprint, you're just going to be telling us what the problem here or opportunity is. How do you actually operationalize this versus just what people probably already do, which is user research, data dives?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:31:47):\nWhat I found is a couple things. One is when your team does not fully understand a problem space, the balance of work tends to be higher. I think when I started at YouTube we were doing 60% execution, 40% understand work. Right. And over time, as we understand more and more, the mix shifts. Now my teams are probably doing 80% execution, 20 to or 85% and 20 to 15% understand work.\n\n(00:32:18):\nAnd so it's not just about writing a strategy, it's about saying, okay, if we have these themes of stuff that we want to work on, what do we know with confidence because the data tells us and what do we need to understand because we don't have the data, we don't have the research, we don't have the insights? And really being honest with yourselves around what are the things that are low to medium effort but high likelihood of being impactful because you have the data and what are the things that you are interested in perhaps doing, but because you're missing something, you're missing research or feedback from users or data or some insights or strategy. You should actually say, I'm going to go do this before I do something else. Right.\n\n(00:33:03):\nAn example of this is one of my teams ships paid virtual goods in the live experience on YouTube. And that's a really, really important and hard problem space. And when I joined, we didn't really fully understand the whole live ecosystem, like how we lived in that live ecosystem, how our products worked, where the biggest opportunity was. So the first and most important piece of understand work was instead of shipping iterations to the current product, we needed to actually get the funnel of what was happening. Right. Like what's happening with how many people are watching live every day, how many people are clicking through, how many people are seeing our experience, how many people actually buying it? We didn't really fully have the experience mapped out and to understand where were the gaps and where are the problem space is in, where should we be focusing?\n\n(00:33:52):\nAnd so we had to do that. And that was understand work for multiple people, for multiple teams. We had to do on the engineering side, we needed data science as analysis. We needed the PM to go and dog through the experience to figure out what was broken. All of that was intentional and an affordance on our roadmaps.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:08):\nWhat's interesting about this is that this is very counterintuitive to how people would probably approach, hey, we need to speed up execution, we need to speed up growth, we need to ship more, execute, go faster, do more. And what you're saying is you find the impact comes from actually slow down how much we're doing and spend more time understanding to execute more intelligently.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:34:32):\nThat's right. Slow down and speed up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:33):\nFascinating. Because it's interesting, I have a bunch of questions that emerged out of folks that you've worked with and many of them are around how you turn a culture around, speed things up, and drive growth in a really meaningful way. And it sounds like this is one of your key strategies, is get people to spend more time understanding before diving into a bunch of stuff.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:34:54):\nIt does sound counterintuitive, but if you actually think about it, what is a better outcome? Is it a better outcome to just ship more faster now, but most of the things aren't unimpactful? Right. Or is it a better outcome to ship fewer things but really work on making sure that you're shipping them in the best way and de-risking a lot of other things so that a year later your win rate's higher and your velocity is higher?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:19):\nYeah, I think counterintuitive is the wrong word. I think it makes sense. I think it's just no one does this. Usually everyone's like, move faster, we need more and ship more experiments.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:35:28):\nWell, I mean this is the irony of growth, is people think growth is overnight success and it's not. Right. It is a lot of short wins and short-term execution for a longer-term gain and really understanding you have a lot of short terms towards the longer-term outcomes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:48):\nSo that people can take away this lesson, can you help people understand just when you say understand work, like what does that look like generally? Is it just a dedicated time to dive into data and answer a bunch of questions you've sent them? Is it running experiments to test hypotheses? What does that usually look like when you're, here let's do 40% understand work?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:36:10):\nThe understand work sometimes comes from me, but most often comes from the teams themselves. And every function can do and should be doing understand work at some point. Right. And so it really depends on what the function is. So for an engineer, it could be looking at the code and saying, okay, we want to improve this. I need to do understand work to understand do we need to refactor this code and how scalable is it and what do we need to do to make sure that we can execute fast and make sure that we're not going to have a lot of start and stop? That could be understand work. It could be actually instrumenting the data and making sure that we actually have full visibility into what's going on. Data science, like we work a lot with data science doing activation metrics and understanding proxy metrics. Right. That's understand work because it helps us to figure out what we need to build and where to focus.\n\n(00:37:05):\nFor product management, sometimes understand work is figuring out the partnership strategy ahead of actually launching the product because you need to go figure out how the pieces are going to come together. Right. And so it really just depends on what the function is. But when I say it should be coming from the bottoms up, what I mean is I encourage the team when we plan a sprint or plan a roadmap, to ask a question to identify the key themes that they need to work on. And when they ask a question on a key theme, also ask what else do we need to understand to make this happen? And in that planning session, to make sure that you are including cross-functional partners. So it's not just product design and data science and Inge, you also include go to market, you also include marketing because if you're not inclusive, then you don't really understand what the issues are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:55):\nMy PM brain is afraid of creating too much understand work and nothing getting done. How do you find that balance of we're going to be understanding for hours and days and weeks and months and not shipping much? How do you do some,-\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:38:11):\nI tell them, you have to ship. I mean, you always have to ship, right? Sometimes I give them, sometimes it's helpful, especially early on because it takes a while for people to get their head around why this is so critical. I say, we should choose, sometimes I'll give them guidance. We should choose three to four understand projects that are going to really help this roadmap and figure out what they are. Right. So choose your top three or four and then let's talk about it. And I'll give them guidance. Or I would say figure out... There should always be some execution. So initially you're looking for low effort, high impact things to execute against. Right.\n\n(00:38:53):\nAnd so build a portfolio of work to do every sprint or every roadmap, some of which should be low effort, high impact, some of which should be medium effort, high impact. And sometimes understand work actually looks like doing a cheap test, doing a test that's going to help us to learn as fast as possible that we think is a good enough experience that can inform us. Right. And so identifying ways to do that. And so it's really about just managing expectations and helping people to be clear that the goal is to ship the product, but you want to ship the things that you have more confidence and understanding versus not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:29):\nSo I think a big takeaway here is if you want to have more impact, move faster, try to spend a little more time understanding the problems you're going after in the opportunity space.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:39:40):\nThat's right. Right. I'll give you a very tactical example is when I joined Instagram in January 2016, believe it or not, the onboarding, the sign-up flow at Instagram had literally no logging to it. It had logging of how many people started and how many people ended. Right. And I joined in January and it was like we had to write a roadmap. And so the roadmap looked like this. Okay, we know this amount at the top of the funnel and this amount at the bottom end of the funnel. And there was eight steps in the funnel and we don't know what is going on. Right. So the first bit of understand work was we needed to do the instrumentation of that funnel as fast as possible to get the data to figure out where the drops were happening and what to fix. But because we knew of what was happening at the top of the funnel and the bottom of the funnel, we can go and play around with the experience and see what was broken.\n\n(00:40:32):\nSo we ran a bunch of tests of stuff that was obviously broken to see what would improve. Right. And so it was like a mix. And so what we did was we set up time where we did, the beginning of like the first couple of weeks, add the logging, ship it to code, re-evaluate in the middle of the quarter, look at the full funnel and then add more things that we can do later on once we got that. But in order to get that done, that involved understand work with growth marketing to figure out what was the schemas for the instrumentation, right, the engineering to actually do that logging. Right. Data science to like pull together funnels and dashboard it, all of that had to come together all at one time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:08):\nI really like just this concept of calling it understand work. I think that alone is a powerful tool because we're going to spend more time on understand work.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:41:15):\nIt feels like it gives meaning to stuff that otherwise people would brush aside.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:18):\nRight. Where it's just like, no, no, let's just ship stuff. Let's just try stuff. Let's just test the step. We'll see what happens.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:41:25):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:26):\nIs there anything else you have seen and often do to help a team you join move faster and grow bigger? And I've heard that you've had a lot of impact on a lot of different cultures, so I'm curious if there's anything else that is really effective.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:41:42):\nI've found myself in a bunch of interesting situations where I had to come in and help improve cultures or change cultures around teams. I found this framework, I don't even actually remember where I got it from, but it travels from computer to computer with me and team to team, and it's called managing complex change. I actually think I got it from business school or something. And it's really interesting. It's got these five components to it. There's vision, skills, incentives, resources, action plan, and you need all of those to have change. Right. Team needs to have vision, they need to have the skills, they need to have the right incentives. Sometimes some teams are incentivized to do some things versus others. You need to have the right resources in the right places and you need to have a clear action plan. And what I love about this framework is if you can visualize it and maybe you can share it with your podcast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):\nYeah. We'll put it up on the screen on YouTube so folks can see what you're talking about.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:42:38):\nBasically what it does is it shows where if you're missing any one component, you get different outcomes. Right. So if you're missing the vision component, you end up in a state of confusion or if you're missing the incentives, you end up in a state of resistance because people aren't incentivized to do the right work. Or if you're missing an action plan, you end up in a state of false starts. So I use this, and I think about this a lot actually, because when you come in as a leader, as someone who's supposed to influence change, you have to really observe what's happening and figure out what are the challenges anecdotally and what are you observing? And then I figure out where I can plug in and what I can do to make the teams better. And what I tend to find is moving from the right side to the left side of this, like action plans are easier to institute. Right.\n\n(00:43:27):\nSo if I see a team that's struggling to execute, I wonder do they have the right type of PRD framework or are they communicating well? Do they have the right type of team meeting structures? Those are kind of lower hanging fruit. It's a lot harder to change vision and skills. It will come in time. But what I also have done over the course of my career is I've built this deck that comes with me of different skills that matter. Right. What are different skills, what are different frameworks, how do we think about it, to help level teams fast? Right. Because I find that sometimes you walk in and not everyone is grounded in the same mental models or concepts.\n\n(00:44:07):\nOne example of this I talk about a lot is Instagram. Instagram had just this fantastic culture of thinking about how do we ship high, high quality product, right, and what does product craft mean? And so that is something that I came to YouTube and my teams particularly, they didn't have a mental model for product craft. So I found myself talking into an echo chamber in some way. So I had to build a deck that showed, okay, here's how I think about product craft. Here's a framework for it. Here's how I think about all of these different things. And so now we have a shared language, shared communication for, and a repository of skills that we're going to build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:47):\nSo I'm looking at this image that we'll have up. So in this case, their skills weren't necessarily there, which in this framework leads to anxiety. And so what I'm hearing, essentially you come into a team, you're like, what am I feeling? Is it confusion, frustration, the wrong thing? And that kind of tells you which of these buckets to spend time on.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:45:06):\nThat's right. And then within those buckets, you've got to figure out what are the right levers that you need to pull? What are the things that are missing? How do you really focus and where do you kind of spend your time?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:16):\nSo interesting. I love that this image is just like this very grainy,-\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:45:20):\nSo old.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:21):\nScreenshot from some old McKinsey deck or something.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:45:24):\nYeah. It's from like 2006 PC or something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:26):\nI love it. So you have this thing, you have this deck. You just come in with all these tools in your tool belt. Is there anything else in that list of things that you bring with you to help change culture and help teams,-\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:45:37):\nYeah. I think one thing I think about a bunch is I come from, my background's a little bit different than a traditional tech executive. There was actually three phases to my career. I was in education for six years, taught in inner city DC and then was a dean of a boarding school in Switzerland, which is a little bit of a plot twist.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:38):\nOh, wow.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:45:58):\nI went to business school and I worked on Wall Street for a bit, and then I left my job on Wall Street, quit and started a startup. Startup was a glorious failure as many startups are, but it was like a very non-traditional path towards tech. And I think a lot of my time in these other industries actually shapes the way I think about products and product management and actually changing teams and building teams. And what I mean by that is I think there's a lot of similarities between education and product management believe it or not.\n\n(00:46:31):\nWhen I was interviewing for my first set of jobs in tech, recruiters would say to me, \"How does your background relate? I don't really see it.\" And I would tell them, \"When I was in education, I would walk into a classroom of 24, seven-year olds, and these kids owed me nothing. And the only way I could be successful or impactful is I needed to be able to be a strong communicator. I needed to be able to have a clear vision of what was going on. I needed to be able to influence them in a believable way such that they would get on board with what needed to be done for 270 days of the year.\" It's like when you walk into a room as a product manager, engineers, designers, researchers go to market. Nobody owes you anything. And the only thing that you're going to do in order to be successful is you need to be a strong communicator. You have a clear vision of what's going on and you need to be able to influence them to do the things together of what matters, right? It's very similar skillset, just different domain expertise.\n\n(00:47:29):\nAnd so because of that, right, I've really adopted a mindset of how do I coach my teams? How do I enable them? Because it's really about the sum of the parts versus me being a top down leader saying, you have to do this and you have to do that. And so I think a lot about that in both approach and the processes that we create. And to give you a couple of classic typical examples of this, there's two things I want to call out. One is there's this, actually this education framework, it's called Bloom's Taxonomy. I think it's changed over time, but when I learned it, it was basically a pyramid and the pyramid was, Bloom Taxonomy describes what's the different levels or order of critical thinking you need in order to be a master of something? And at the bottom of the pyramid was knowledge, and then it's comprehension, and then application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Right.\n\n(00:48:26):\nAnd so going up the pyramid, it means it's higher order thinking. And I think about that a lot and trying to understand where are my teams struggling? Do they have the core knowledge that they need? Do they understand it but they can't apply it or they apply it, but they're not able to analyze it across different business segments? Right. And you can use this framework not only with the ICPMs and the teams themselves, but also for your managers, like what is breaking down? And in using that and attaching that to the skills that we want to build to figure out how do you fill in those gaps? Right. And it really is a grounding for me, a grounding mental model for how do you build teams that are actually affect them? How do you meet people where they are as opposed to just saying, hey, you need to figure this out? Right. I find that too often in tech and also in product, people are ask to figure things out but not given the support to get there, and there's no way to really connect the dots for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:21):\nAmazing. I'm pulling up the Bloom's Taxonomy. So essentially if you see a PM struggling, which you try to do is figure out which of these things do they not have? How are you not supporting them? How can you support them better? So it could be they don't have the skills, they don't have the understanding. What are some of the other things that often you find that maybe hinder a product manager's success?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:49:42):\nA lot of times they might have the understanding, but they haven't had a chance to apply it to a variety of different scenarios or haven't seen it applied to multiple scenarios. Right. So oftentimes you might understand a concept like machine learning, but you haven't actually worked on it in against multiple scenarios. So you maybe have one way of doing it that doesn't make sense and you need to have two or three, and you don't even know that two or three ways of doing it exists. Right. That is often a common failure point. Right. Or it's maybe you know how to apply it, but you can't synthesize why this thing that you're doing actually matters for the business context. Right. Oftentimes that becomes a challenge with managers. It's like they know what to do, but they don't understand how to tie it back to the business context and the overall strategy needs and so where to prioritize. Right.\n\n(00:50:31):\nAnd so what I find is that when you're trying to manage managers, you're really trying to live at the top of the pyramid. You are responsible, managers responsible for basically owning that pyramid for all of the areas that they operate, but they need to be able to live at the top of the pyramid across all of them. They need to be able to synthesize and evaluate what's happening for each product team that they own in order to kind of make the bigger picture connections.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:56):\nBy the way, I loved your metaphor of product manager, like this group of seven-year-olds where you have to learn how to manage, influence, communicate.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:50:56):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:56):\nIt's great.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:51:05):\nYeah. I mean, they're not like a group of seven-year-olds,-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:07):\nIt's the skills.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:51:07):\nBut I think it's actually, it's,-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:08):\nYeah, the same skills.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:51:08):\nHuh?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:09):\nThe same skills you,-\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:51:10):\nSame skills.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:11):\nYeah.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:51:12):\nI mean, I think it's true. I found it actually significantly harder for me to get 24 seven-year-olds to believe in what I was doing then to walk into a room with Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger and explain to them what's the strategy for growing the next 100 million users on Instagram? These are very logical adults who can reason with you, and you got a classroom of kids. It's not quite the same. So those skills are really critical.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):\nI love that. I definitely want to ask about your Instagram days. Is there anything else in this bucket of wisdom of, you kind of talked about things you've learned about how to manage product managers and managers of managers. Is there anything else there that might be helpful to folks that you've learned?\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:51:50):\nOne thing that I also think about a lot, and I don't know if this is just a me thing, but I think about PM as a team sport. Right. Leading product teams is really about...\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:52:01):\nLeading product teams is really about being the coach and helping other people to see what their role is on the team and to maximize them. People talk a lot about product as you're the CEO, and I don't actually fully believe that analogy. If you think about it as a team sport, there's a few things that shake out. One is not everyone's going to be a star player. But not everyone needs to be a LeBron James or Kobe Bryant. You need role players. You need really strong role players. You need people who feel valued in their role, and you need to understand how to groom those role players and how to make sure that they have the right seat at the table and the right place. So I think it's, yes, you're the conductor of the orchestra, but you're really more than that. You're really the coach of the team.\n\n(00:52:46):\nAnother thing I think about a lot is I have a good friend who's a college basketball coach, and he taught me about this idea of your coaching tree. This is a really important concept, especially in college basketball. You, as a head coach, you take a lot of pride in who are your assistants. Who is your first assistant, second assistant, and third assistant? And where do they go on to be head coaches? And what legacy do they have because you were able to instill a bit in them? The coaching tree of a Mike Mike Krzyzewski, the coaching tree of a John Calipari, these esteemed coaches, not only because of what they've done, but because of the tree that they've built.\n\n(00:53:26):\nAnd I like to think about this as well, because I think it's really important for product leaders, think about what is their leadership tree. Who have you helped to build up and help to grow and help to get to their next wall? And so I think about this a lot. I have people who I've worked with who are running growth at Stripe or the CPO at Chief or now running stories at Instagram that were on my team in the earlier days. And their success is my success, and I'm proud for them, and I'm happy for them. And I think it kind of reinforces this mentality that it's your responsibility to coach people up to greatness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:04):\nSo what I'm hearing is you put a lot of value in your team on them coaching folks, whether they're managers or even ICs is helping them understand that it's important to coach folks on their team and help them develop, that it's part of your job, essentially.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:54:21):\nThat's part of your job. You are trying to build a repository of skills and repository of knowledge and of team velocity. And the only way you can do that is everyone is... So rising tide has to lift all boats.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:33):\nAmazing. And interestingly, that probably teaches you how to do your job better because you're in teaching, you actually learn things a lot better.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:54:40):\nThat's right. That's right. And it forces you to figure out how can you get things off of your plate so that you can go work on bigger things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:46):\nYeah, and how good does it feel when folks that you used to manage go on to do bigger and better things.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:54:51):\nThat's right. That's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:52):\nI want to talk a little bit about growth within YouTube. I heard that you haven't been there for that long, and apparently you've already... Two extra, three extra more, something important within YouTube. I don't know exactly the details, and people are very impressed with the impact you've already had. And apparently a lot of the success there and other places is how you think about growth through flywheels. You always look for the flywheel that helps drive growth. Can you just talk about either at YouTube, ideally YouTube, whatever you can share, because that's pretty impressive, especially for a company that scale that you're making so much impact, or other places, just how you think about flywheels and growth.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:55:29):\nWell, it's very generous of you. I wouldn't say, look, we've done some really good work, some good work so far at YouTube, and it's been a journey. I do think a lot about flywheels. I think it's actually a lot of growth is really understanding what is the value profit, all of the different points of the experience, especially if you have a multi-sided marketplace. A multi-sided marketplace for YouTube is like the creator and what the creator is trying to achieve both from an engagement perspective, but also for me for a monetization perspective. And then for the viewer or the purchaser, where is their hat? What are they trying to do, and where are they missing the opportunity?\n\n(00:56:13):\nI can't really go into specifics a bunch with YouTube, but what I would say is this is that one thing that I always do when I come in is I try to push my teams to really dog food products in their adjacent user state, if you will. And what I mean by that is often, a product that you and I use that we've been using for years isn't actually the product that we're building for other people. Like a power user who's using a product has... There's so much history and there's so much informed knowledge on how that product... for that product to actually create a great experience for you that if you were to go and create a new Gmail account and look at YouTube today, I guarantee you it's a completely different and significantly worse experience.\n\n(00:57:03):\nAnd there's a lot of obvious opportunities missed, especially with what is the flywheel and why things are working or not working if you don't actually go and use things in a new state. And an example of this when we talk about YouTube is a lot of the YouTube graph for searching stuff is based on what have you watched in the past? So if you go and search and you search history, it's going to be about like, well, what have you watched in the past or what have you searched for, and what can we show you that's going to be what we can better predict?\n\n(00:57:33):\nBut if you don't have a line of search history, then they're not going to do as good of a job. And so that's not a direct translation for what we were doing. But for me, I work on freedom monetization, and there are really important flywheels around what does it take for a creator to make content that can help them to monetize? How do we get that content to people and where to what extent are we getting that content to people, and how do we make sure that people feel good about what they're receiving, the people who are paying. And all of those flywheels have to work.\n\n(00:58:02):\nAnd so part of what I've been able to do is really think about how do we connect the dots in a story that the teams can uniquely understand, can help them to lean in even more and have clarity and purpose of work. Sometimes, what's super important about the flywheels actually is enabling for your teams to know what to work on and what not to work on. And then it also helps us to understand what do we know and what do we not know about creators and viewers and monetization operations so that we can do the understand work to improve the velocity and to prove the impact.\n\n(00:58:35):\nAnd that's really where we've been focused. And so I did a lot of this in YouTube, but I also did this in Instacart, really thinking about when I joined Instacart, one of the big questions I had was like, how will people in their daily lives... How's their daily life actually reflecting in the purchase experience? Are we making it easy for them? Because when you buy groceries, you're not going to going grocery shopping because you want beautiful ingredients in your fridge. You're going grocery shopping because you actually have a meal to put together. So are we actually reflecting the real job to be done, which is I want to buy tacos, I want to make Taco Tuesday. Can we make it easier for people to find the ingredients for tacos, as opposed to having them sort for tortillas and tomatoes and avocado? And so it's really thinking about what is the job and then what is the flywheel to make that happen, and how do we make this come to life?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:25):\nThere's so many things that I want to follow up on here. First of all, I realize that all of the things you worked on, I am a daily active user of or weekly active user. Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Instacart about weekly active user, I think that might be. Yeah. Wow, nice job. You got me. You got me in the flywheels of all your flywheels.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:59:45):\nI was not intentional, but I'm glad my efforts had improved joy, just a little bit,\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:48):\nNice work.\n\nBangaly Kaba (00:59:49):\n... ideally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:51):\nOkay, so a couple takeaways here. One is you think about the value prop at every interaction of both sides, if it's a multi-sided marketplace or if it's just like, \"Why would I be doing this?\" So it's like, \"Why would I send an invite to my friend? Why would I share this photo? Why would I open up Instacart?\" And then you think about the jobs to be done during the day of a potential user and how can we flow into that versus not connect to their actual day-to-day experience?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:00:17):\nAnd is the product actually working? As I'm doing this, I'm looking and saying, \"Is the product actually set up to deliver these things? Do we actually see it work or not?\" I think there's a lot of assumptions that the product works, but a lot of times teams will surprisingly build the pieces of a flow but not actually build the experience, the output. They don't design it in a way where you're getting the real output that you need.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:39):\nThat's such a easy to miss point you're making here, which is you just think about, \"Hey, I have Taco Tuesday. I'm actually as a product manager on Instacart. I'm going to open up the app, and use it in this use case and see how it goes.\"\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:00:51):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:52):\nAnd most people don't do that is what you realized.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:00:55):\nMost people don't do that. Another example of this, this was years ago, but at Instacart, Instacart made it really hard to reorder stuff, super hard to reorder. And it was shocking to me, because when I thought about it, when I go to the grocery store, 90% of the time I'm getting the same stuff. It's like maybe not every trip, but over the course of a month or two, you've got a list of things that are part of your staple, and then occasionally holiday time I went some peppermint bark chocolate or something. There's random snacks you're going to throw in, but there's... And so when we looked at the data, it turns out, after five times when you go to Instacart, 90% of your order was the same. But when you wanted to reorder, at least back then, you couldn't go and reorder easily. You had to dig and find it like seven or eight clicks.\n\n(01:01:46):\nAnd when you did reorder, you had to reorder the whole thing. You couldn't take pieces, you couldn't take, I want to take the milk and the blueberries. And so you think about growth, you think about what does it mean to grow an Instacart? What does it mean to actually drive better retention? Well, it's actually really important to make it easy for people to make the next order. And so the product wasn't really built for that, though people have the best intentions in mind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):\nThe adjacent order.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:02:12):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:13):\nI imagine that was maybe one of the biggest growth wins in Instacart history is just the reorder the same thing, because I do that all the time.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:02:20):\nYeah, you would be surprised.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:22):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

It's like this term you popularized and you explained it somewhat, but maybe explain a little bit more. I think it's really powerful for people and how do you think about growth.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:03:29):\nThis was something that came out of actually my time at Instagram. It was a framework that we came up with because Instagram really was, at that time, we grew so fast that the people who were using Instagram in February were completely different than people who were using it the following October and then the next January. I think when I joined, we were at like 440 million monthly actives. January 2016, at the end of that year we were at 636 million, grew like 47% that year. And so when we talk to users, first half of 2016, when we talk to women in the US in their 30, they're like, \"Why would I have an Instagram? I have a Facebook account.\" Literally people said that, it was that long ago. And then a year later it's like, \"Of course I use Instagram. Instagram is my everything.\" The world changed so fast.\n\n(01:04:21):\nAnd so when you're in a hypergrowth product, it's really, really important to understand who your users are today and the persona of the user, what motivates them, why they're using it, but then also to understand who is the next user? Who is the user who could be using this product, but for some reason it doesn't work for them, and understanding who that adjacent user is and when you are actually starting to see that adjacent user adopt the product. And one of the ways you start to see the adjacent users starting to adopt the product, especially with the data, is you start seeing cohort curves decline. You start seeing the people who sign up today, three or six months from now, they're signing up and they're doing a worse job. Nothing's changing the product, but just the understanding of how the product should work is different.\n\n(01:05:12):\nThey might be less tech savvy. On a scale of an early adopter versus late majority, they might be closer to the late majority. And so we saw this at Instagram. We always knew working on our registration flow, and at one point we were converting at some insanely high percent, and then three months later it would go down by 15%, not because anything was broken, but just because we'd broken into new markets. You bring on people in India or you bring on people in the Philippines, and their understanding of how it works, the phones they use, et cetera are all different. So really, the core of their adjacent news was a few things. One is like you have to understand who's using your product today and why. And when you're growing at some really strong pace, 30, 40, 50% or more per year, you've got to be on top of who you believe the next user is and why.\n\n(01:06:02):\nAnd then you also have to be the adjacent exactly, use the product like them and see how it's working, what's broken with it. And so at an Instacart, the adjacent user, the original user might've been like an office admin who is going to buy this thing every week because of during happy hours and team staff. But then the next adjacent user might've been the mom of three or four or the dad of three or four who's home with the kids and they need to depend on Instacart, versus later on it might be they're a single person in New York who does this out of convenience. But what they're optimizing for, how they use the product all changes, and the functionality and the abilities are fundamentally different. So you have to be them, you have to watch how they use the product, you have to talk to them, and then have to visit them and literally see what they're doing in real time in order to make sure that you're enabling the right jobs for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:57):\nI love just the visualization of the adjacent user. Basically your growth is going to come from non-existing users. It's the users right outside that circle of...\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:07:05):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:05):\n... pre-users are today, and you need to think about what do they need that existing users maybe don't need. You said that this is most powerful for hypergrowth companies. Is this something you think people like all companies should be thinking about or is it a lot less important if you're not a hypergrowth business?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:07:21):\nSo it's a great question. I think it's essential. It's mandatory for hypergrowth. I think it's very helpful if you have a product or a company that is not growing what you want it to be. And so you are focused on capturing more share of wallet instead of expanding your audience. And so sometimes you can imagine a cosmetics company, for example, that's like digitally enabled. You can imagine that they've hit a ceiling in terms of the growth of their users, and they're really just trying to get people to buy more product, but maybe the people who want to use their product are missing something from your current product. Maybe you're missing different skin tone shades, or maybe you're missing certain types of tools. So really talking to who is just outside of your current user base, who's coming to your product and looking around and not buying and understanding what are their needs and figuring out how do you enable for them, how do you build the right experience for them in order to become adopters of your product?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:21):\nSo what I'm hearing is spend some understand work to figure out who your potential users are,\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:08:25):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:26):\n... and then use the product as them and see what is missing. I imagine user research goes into this. You're not actually going to understand necessarily all the things they need. So it's probably fine folks in that cohort and see how they use the product. Awesome.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:08:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:42):\nThe question I had on my mind as you're talking, you've come into so many companies and helped them with growth. Where do you find most of the opportunities often lie? Is it like onboarding, activation? Is there a trend like that you're like, \"Here's probably there's going to be opportunity here,\" or is it super mixed bag?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:08:58):\nUsually it's somewhere in the onboarding to habit-building experience. What does it take for someone to actually understand the value, that first moment, that first aha moment in the product? And a lot of teams, it's shocking how many teams don't really understand what that moment is for them. And then also how do you get them to build habit around the product. Oftentimes, a lot of people equate growth to top of funnel, and that is also critical. I think having the right top of funnel motion is really critical and building on that. So I think there's one part of, it's like once you have the right top of funnel motion to get people to come in, how do you help to make sure of the defining value and the building habit and their routine? Because that's the thing that helps you to compound over time. If you're bringing a lot of people but they're not staying around, then you just have a leaky bucket and it doesn't matter how big your top funnel is. So making sure that that first-month and two-month, three-month experience is great.\n\n(01:10:04):\nAnd then the other part is really figuring out how do you build compounding growth loops where it's not just one way of acquiring people, but you're building two and three and four ways that layer onto each other that help you to really supercharge your engine of acquiring people. So at Instagram, if you kind of look at where Instagram is and how I [inaudible 01:10:28] and grew, there's a lot that goes into it, but if you actually unpack the top of funnel for what worked at Instagram, there's certainly a component of it, which was our core component, which was invitations, where people inviting you and making sure that those invitations work and they work well and that people, their friends are coming on, you get notified.\n\n(01:10:48):\nBut another part that goes unspoken, still critical to this day was the celebrity partnerships was critical, because basically they had this wonderful partnerships team that basically took Instagram and taught celebrities how to use it, how to make it work for them, how to tell their own story and be their own brand, and that was a critical growth funnel because with that, you had the ability for them to create these celebrities and celebrity creators to set the norm for how the platform gets used, but they also were getting picked up by the news and the media for all the stuff that's happening in the celebrity world, which then added onto this other growth level, which was SEO.\n\n(01:11:36):\nAnd so every time a news article came out, they would link to the creators or the celebrities Instagram account or that particular post. And so you have this whole SEO engine that worked. And the SEO engine was because you have both web, which we launched at Instagram, which created the canonical SEO tables, and then you had all of these inbound links from these celebrity sites and news media, but then what you also had is you had embeds for Instagram and all of these different sites, like a news article, whatever, the posts, Lenny's podcast, Instagram account, and those embeds help with SEO juice.\n\n(01:12:15):\nAnd so you have not just the invites, but now you have the celebrities, now you have the SEO component. And then we would do a bunch of paid media on top of that using a lot of those signals. And then we have our own content. And so you would have all of these different growth engines compounding each other. So every time the invitations got better, every time we've got more celebrities, every time SEO gets better, it's like magnifying the top of funnel, and at the bottom of the funnel or mid-funnel, making sure that people are retaining and getting value and staying around over the long term.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:47):\nThat is so interesting. I had no idea this was such a core part of the early growth strategy. Everyone's always talking about reality and word of mouth, all these things. And you're saying partnerships was a key part of the early growth strategy.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:12:59):\nHuge. It's huge.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:59):\nThat's so funny. Never something people talk about in growth, this partnership. It's always is like, \"Oh, there's a couple of companies that really had success from partnerships in BD.\" How early was this a big part of the strategy? How early in the history of,\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:13:13):\nI mean the partnerships team was there before I joined. It was a very savvy and astute thing that Kevin and Mikey set up. The partnerships team drove a lot of the word of mouth around Instagram, but it was the partnership's work in combination with the product work that actually helped to allow a lot of that to land. It was our ability to think outside the box and understand that we needed to have a web presence because it was critical for international growth and it also helped with SEO. And so the idea of launching web really drove and actually increased Instagram's growth by 10% the minute we launched it. And it was something that George Wang, who was there before me, had the idea around. It wasn't really something that Kevin and Mikey believed in initially, but we had to prove to them that it was really impactful and one should launch.\n\n(01:14:03):\nThen they understood why it was impactful and all of the effect of it. But web was really critical for driving so much SEO, which helped support a lot of the celebrity work and the partnerships work, because now every time creator or celebrity did something on Instagram, every news media article picked it up and it just helped to drive searches in Google searches, which helped to make Instagram part of the cultural zeitgeist.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:29):\nThis is so interesting, because everyone imagines Instagram, virality, word of mouth, like SEO and partnerships sounds like a core part of Instagram's early growth, which I don't think anyone ever talks about.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:14:39):\nNo, that's huge.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:39):\nWow.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:14:40):\nI mean it was part of Facebook's growth too, but I think a little bit differently. It's not as much partnership, but when you Google someone now, you Google someone's name, oftentimes, Instagram is one of the first five things that comes up for the average person,\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):\nYeah, right.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:14:40):\n... now, by design.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:53):\nLinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:14:54):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:55):\nDo you ever see the video of Alex Jiu talking about TikTok's growth strategy of this whole... He had this metaphor, and he was trying to grow off of Instagram, so his metaphor was Instagram is like you're in Europe and you're killing it. If you're in Europe and you're king, you don't ever want to go to America. There's no reason for you to give it up. And America is TikTok in this case. He's like, \"How do we convince people to come to America and try moving everything there?\" He's like, \"We need to go after the people that are not doing well in Europe, who want to be the king, and we're going to help you become that king in America, or the President.\"\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:15:28):\nSo he used the adjacent... Used that theory on us, basically, is what you're saying.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:33):\nThat's right. He did. Drink up your shake.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:15:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:40):\nYeah. And I think the reason that strategy worked differently is there was already a place, so they couldn't execute what you did because there's already celebrities already there, and it's not like, \"Come here.\" There's no point. I already have a huge following.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:15:51):\nSo you make your own celebrities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:53):\nMake your own celebrities. Exactly. And they went after the B-list, C-list people. So it's interesting that people look at Instagram, like, cool, we're going to do partnerships, SEO. But I think it's important to realize things change when the market is a different dynamic. You can't just do the same thing.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:15:53):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:07):\nIt won't work as well. Is there anything else from the Instagram early days that maybe people wouldn't know or would be interesting to share? Because you were there quite early, and now it's maybe the most thriving social network in the world.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:16:17):\nOne thing that's actually, I think, interesting, as an interesting story that doesn't get talked about a lot is I think the early Instagram was built where... it was built in a way where every follow was created equal. And what I mean by that is if I followed you, Lenny, or if I followed Kim Kardashian, I followed Selena Gomez, all follows were treated like they were equally important. And this is actually a really important fact. It was a really important factor for a couple of reasons. One, early celebrities who were adopting Instagram obviously benefited from that, because a celebrity is going to get a follow before an average person does. It doesn't mean that their followers weren't meaningful. It's just that when you have a machine learning that's just optimized for a click through a follow, then that matters.\n\n(01:17:15):\nBut what ended up happening is we ended up looking at the data, and I can't take credit for this. My colleague at the time, Rob Andrews, had identified this. He was the head of growth marketing. He was a peer of mine that basically, this is 2016-ish days, the average person would come on Instagram and retain, but then leave after 7, 8, 9 months. We'd see a flattening in a retention curve, but then we would see it dip again, which was very weird. And we're like, why is this happening? And it turned out that what was happening anecdotally is that people were revving up Instagram, following a bunch of people, following a lot of celebrities, actually, because the celebrities were being shown, and then when they actually went to make their first post, a few months later-\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:18:00):\n... being shown. And then when they actually went to make their first post a few months later, none of their friends were following them. And so there was posting into an echo chamber and anecdotally people would stop using the product because they felt bad. We hypothesized that no one was liking or following or commenting on their posts. And so we had to do this thing. We called it the connections pivot, right in like 2016 ... Actually, 2017, where we had to convince Kevin and Mikey that it was actually not the right thing to do to prioritize celebrities to everybody because we were basically biting bite your nose to spank your face, whatever that is, because the regular person wasn't having a great experience.\n\n(01:18:44):\nAnd so it doesn't mean that we shouldn't recommend celebrities, but Jeff recommended celebrities to people who are already on there. They already have their graph. And the most important thing to do is actually get regular human-to-human connections in the first whatever, when people first sign up so that when you let me actually go make your first post, your friends would see it and you would be validated and you would feel like, okay, this is a police for me. I have a community here.\n\n(01:19:11):\nAnd so that connection pivot was critical. It changed ... Literally, angle-changed the retention on Instagram. And so if you about Instagram's growth, there was a TechCrunch article about Instagram's growth at I think 2017, 2018 when we were going 40, 50% year over year. And obviously, there was a lot that went into that skyrocket. People think that stories was the sole reason why we grew and story brought us a lot of people, but we literally, our attention doubled over the course of a year and a half. If you could imagine, imagine if your bank account, the interest rate doubles every month, you know what I mean? It was incredible. This shift in making sure that people got connected with their friends early on changed the way that people perceive the value. And so a lot of the top-of-funnel work that we did, a lot of the activation work that we did really paid off in spades ultimately.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:05):\nWow. I'm curious, what's the most impactful thing you've shipped/led to in terms of impact and experiment launch?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:20:14):\nAt Instagram, we saw this big problem where people were logging out and not being able to get back into their account. It was crazy. Hundreds of thousands of people a day could not get back into their account. It was because ... And when I say could not get back into the account, I mean they literally would try and 28 days later, we would never see them again. And we thought it was a problem because they didn't remember where their email was, which email they signed up with or what their actual handle was or what their password was. We were losing 10, 12 million people a year from what we called account access churn. So we worked on this problem and we had spent a lot of time in South Asia and Southeast Asia trying to understand how to grow the product. And from that time we realized that it's important actually for people to be able to log out.\n\n(01:21:14):\nWe don't want to restrict people's ability to log out because there are many people in the world who don't want to use background data because they're on prepaid phone plans or they don't have a lot of money and they want to share their phone with a sibling and so they log out. And so it's really important. And so we don't want to take away that behavior, but we did have to do a better job of helping them get back in.\n\n(01:21:40):\nSo we did two things. One was there used to be a time, and you can probably find it on Google if you did an archive search where if you wanted to log into your Instagram account, there would be a tab for your email and then there would be a tab for your handle. And we didn't really make it easy for you to log in with your phone number either. You had to get to the right tab and the right place to get the right thing. And so we did this omnibox experience where it was just like email, phone handle, put it all in one place and we made it super simple for you. And the second time, if you tried it twice and it didn't work, if we knew that you were on a trusted device, we would just send you a text message and say, Hey, are you trying to log in? That solved half the problem.\n\n(01:22:23):\nAnd then the other half, what we did, and this still exists today on Instagram. When you log out we say, Hey Lenny, it looks like you're going to log out, do you want us to save your credentials on your advice so you don't have to worry about your password? And then we later added an ability to have a password. And that's all basically the other half.\n\n(01:22:40):\nAnd so just being really thoughtful around what is actually the core job that people are trying to do because a bad experience would've been like, Hey, let's make it really hard for people to walk out. And then how do we ... One or two experiments really help people to get back into the experience. And so what was interesting was that we were able to solve this ... And this actually helped drive public 15, 20 million extra month active users a year, but what was also super interesting was that it helped us to realize that getting people back into their account more drove more account content creation on incident in ways that we didn't expect. And so because we were getting people back into the account, people getting into the second account and getting into the third account and they were going into their finsta account and creating content more. And so that actually led to the creation of a multiple accounts team, which is what has made it easy for you to navigate between accounts on Instagram today.\n\n(01:23:42):\nAnd so that was understandable actually coming to life. It was, Hey, we're going to do the understand work to figure out how to solve account access issues and we're going to solve it. And solving it, when we looked at the data, we're like, Hey, why is all this account, why is all this content creation happening? That was not what we were expecting and where is it happening? And it was happening from second and third accounts. And so that made us realize that oh, people were not only getting locked out of their first accounts, but they were actually creating a lot on the second and third accounts. How can we make it easy for them to get and navigate between their first account, whether it's your account and a business account or your account and [inaudible 01:24:19] account or a bakery account, you know what I mean? And so that created a multiple accounts team, which I ended up owning and that ended up even becoming a bigger effort after I left.\n\n(01:24:26):\nSo that's an example of understand work, solve a real problem, real-solve and solving massive solution, massive impact, creating new data that you didn't expect that drives new understand work, which creates a whole new team to allow you to move around your Instagram account more seamlessly. And you can see this now when you go to post, you can decide, okay, I want to post as Lenny, I want to post as this other thing, or when I want to write a story, you can change anywhere. And that was all an effort that originally came out of this realization.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:55):\nI love how many of these huge impact stories are just such straightforward, simple things like just let people log in more easily, help them log out more effectively, fine, show them their friends versus celebrities. So many of these stories are often just really simple ideas that lead to such profound change. The log-out example is interesting. At Airbnb, we found the log-out was actually causing a lot of churn also, but they went ... Initially, they went with a simple solution of just extend the session, log-out link instead of a week, make it two weeks or three weeks or four weeks. You pointed out with Instagram, people actually wanted to log out. They're like, let's leave that alone. Start with making it easier to log back in.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:25:35):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:36):\nAmazing. Man, you're so full of amazing stories. I'm curious with Facebook, maybe just as I wrap up here, is there anything there? Because you were an early growth PM at Facebook. You worked a lot on friends and helping people discover their friends. Is there anything in there that would be interesting to share?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:25:51):\nIn my time, so I joined Instagram or Facebook in 2014 and I was responsible for people recommendations globally. And at the time, Facebook was at scale and big and dominated North America. And so really the focus area at the time was South Asia and Southeast Asia. And we noticed a lot of really interesting things, especially in India. Facebook seemed to be broken from a people graph perspective. The data was telling us people didn't have as many friends in common. In the US, it might've been on just making up a number. On average, we saw 22 friends in common when you make a friendship connection. But in India, it was like seven, right? And then there was a lot of friending and messaging or friending and unfriending. We're like, what's going on here? So we had some hypotheses from the data, we ran a bunch of tests. Nothing seemed to work and be a breakthrough.\n\n(01:26:44):\nSo actually, at that time, I had to propose and they agreed to do this. We needed to do understand work. So we were literally on the ground in India every three months took a team of engineers with me. I'm talking like we're in Delhi in people's homes and Mumbai, and we went to go investigate what was going on, watch people make friends, watch them use people you may know and really understand what was happening and see what was going on because we felt like there was context that we were missing.\n\n(01:27:14):\nThere was a lot of things that we learned. It was mind-blowing. But one of the most interesting things, Lenny, was that we watched people try to make friends and we said, \"Hey wait, that's their profile page. Why aren't you looking at it?\" And they would say, \"Well, that doesn't have any relevant information for me, so I need to go look in the pictures.\" They're like, \"Well, why doesn't the profile page have relevant information for you? That's where the information's supposed to be.\" And they're like, \"Listen, this guy's named Amit Kumar. I have 10 friends named Amit Kumar. What is this page going to tell me?\" And they would scroll down, they'd be like, \"All of these fields are not relevant to me.\" And so you look at it, Facebook at the time, it was very Western-centric. It's probably still is, it was like name, it was like school you went to, job title, affiliations, that kind of stuff. That's all Western paradigms. Some of these people are like, my friends sell jeans at a market. None of this is relevant. You don't even know the name of the school. Sometimes it might be a number or something. And so all of the descriptors that we take for granted were not relevant and the names were very common.\n\n(01:28:24):\nThis was really illuminating. So what they would do is go look at pictures and say, is this my friend's car or is this my friend's ... Can I see my friend's animal and what's available? And it was interesting because the understand work, at least the more realization. So we went back to Menlo Park with the data, turned out ... We said, okay, let's look at the data in a different way. What are the most common names on Facebook? And we looked at, and the top 10 common names are Indian names. And the most common name was Amit Kumar. And there was like 250,000 people a month who used Amit Kumar who were real people. So imagine you're in Bangalore and you're trying to find your buddy named Amit Kumar. It's probably 5,000 that we could possibly recommend. So super interesting was like the cultural context was so different. So we had to get creative, find creative ways to figure out how to solve it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:12):\nThe power of understand work shines again. We have a recurring segment on this podcast called Fail Corner where ask guests to share a time they failed in their career and what they learned from that experience because a lot of people look at your career and your story and just like, holy shit, what a journey. I will never be able to achieve this. Is there a time when things didn't go well and something that you took away from that experience?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:29:36):\nProbably for me, I think my time at Instacart was probably not my best time. I think I went to Instacart with a vision of what I felt the product could be or should be. And it was I think a big story that I deeply believed, but I was not, I think aware or in tune with what the DNA of the company was at the time, which was it was like a company that was really great at operations because that was the core of what they did. And they were really building out a lot of their product experience and a lot of what the new function. And so I think what they needed at the time was a much more tactical in the weeds, get your hands dirty, do, do, do because they hadn't really seen that before. And what I wanted to deliver in that experience was more building the right systems, the right people, the right processes so that we can figure out how to institutionalize the work.\n\n(01:30:46):\nAnd I think for me that was probably my biggest oversight is that I think they needed more tactical and I was more ... I don't want to say in the clouds, but more thinking about where do we want to go with the experience that we need to build versus let me get deep in the funnel data. It felt like it became loggerheads where I didn't feel like I was probably either delivering what they wanted or being supported in the way that I wanted to be supported.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:13):\nIs the lesson there to spend more time and understand work before you take a job to make sure you're aligned with what they're looking for?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:31:20):\nThat is actually the lesson. And I think it's part of that is it's doing that. One of my takeaways is do that not only with the people there but with the people who've left it to, but the people who've left the company will give you a perspective that is raw and different and much more I think aligned with what you want to hear. And it may or may not be the same, but I think the people ... This isn't specific to Instacart. Whenever you talk to people who are at the company, they're always try to tell you the best version of the company. The people who left will tell you what the worst version or their version and it's on you to triangulate that information, but you need both sides.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:57):\nLove that lesson. Bangaly, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:32:06):\nNo, I think we've got a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:07):\nWe have. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:32:14):\nI am ready to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:15):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:32:20):\nFew I've recommended most of them are Over My Shoulder, actually Range by David Epstein. I think are really critical PM work really being able to be a master of a lot of different things or somewhat deep in a lot of different things. Deep Work, Cal Newport, kind of clearing space to be focused and do the things thinking about the most important work in a deep and undisturbed way. And then Start At The End by Matt Waller, who's a behavioral scientist buddy of mine. Really thoughtful book, helps you really think about what you're building, but in a way that's more holistic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:49):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:32:55):\nI've got a relatively new one that I love. This works exceptionally well I believe for more senior hires, whether they're like group product managers, directors, or even kind of senior ICs. I go through and I think about what are the four, usually five skills that are really critical for someone to have in this job. And I think about them myself and I think about the archetypes of what is the ratio I want of these? But then I ask them, I say, Hey, take out a piece of paper or take out your laptop. I'm going to give you five skills and I want you to stack-rank them for me. One to five. So one being the one you're strongest at and five being the one you're relatively weakest at.\n\n(01:33:41):\nSo it's way better than saying give me your strengths and weaknesses. It also forces them to contextualize it against the skills that you're looking for, but it also helps you have a meaningful conversation around how they think about themselves and their self-awareness and to what extent they're ranking these skills based on the context they're in versus their own ability.\n\n(01:34:02):\nSometimes you rank something a five because something you would just weak at because you haven't had to do because there's a strong function at that company. And so when they stack-rank it and then people are like ... I've asked this probably four or five times on a recent role. I hire people like, Ooh, this is really hard. But really good question. I usually will dig into what is number two and what's number four and number five, and why? And it really helps me to one, calibrate am I looking for the right person? And two, are their skills actually a match for what we need at this time?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:33):\nI love when I hear a question I've never heard before. That is genius. Next question, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:34:41):\nI think one that I enjoy quite a lot ... Actually, it's really kind of ... It's really simple, but amazing is this app called Flighty. You heard of it? F-L-I-G-H-T-Y.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:52):\nNo.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:34:52):\nIt is a travel app and it manages all of your flight itineraries and your friends' itineraries. But the reason why I love it is it goes two or three clicks deeper than the average travel app or your airline app and it tells you when your inbound plane is running late, it helps you to understand where the gates on. My wife was just in Madrid last week. And she texted me saying, \"Hey, I'm at the airport but no gate is announced.\" I looked at Flighty, I'm like, \"Your gate is E67. It's actually been assigned but it hasn't been announced.\" And this happens a lot in Europe. You'll be there and they won't tell you the gate until an hour beforehand.\n\n(01:35:28):\nSo it gives you so much information right before. It's actually publicly announced, which is really helpful, especially if you really need to be somewhere because oftentimes I know if my plane's going to be late and if I need to rebook before anyone else does, which helps you, gives you a better chance of getting somewhere. Or I will be able to get to a gate, I get to SFO and it might not be on the board at SFO, but I know exactly where it gave you this. So really a great app. Can't say enough about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:53):\nI'm downloading it right now. It's got a bazillion reviews, five stars. Thank you for the recommendation. Incredibly useful.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:36:00):\nOf course.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:01):\nI'm trying out a new question. You've joined a bunch of different companies. What's one thing that you've done in the first 90 days at the job that has made a big impact?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:36:11):\nI go and I sit in team meetings and see how they operate. I just listen. I talk to not only the PMs but the content designer and everyone, and I try to get to know them by both name and story. And what I mean by that, it's like oftentimes people, execs come in and they're like, what are we doing? What are we prioritizing? Why does it matter? And they don't really take the time to actually learn who the people are, what the story is, what they care about, what they're passionate about, both professionally and personally and really try to understand how the team is working from that person's perspective.\n\n(01:36:52):\nAnd what I find is actually when I do that, people are way more willing to hear ... When it is time for me to share my thoughts, they're way more invested because they believe I'm invested in that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:05):\nI love that. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you really like and find useful and often share with friends or family in work or in life?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:37:17):\nI'm not big on mottos. There's one that I've actually been repeating. I don't remember. I got it done ... It might have been like Adam Grant or someone on Instagram, but it was ... It's one, I said it to a colleague of mine, he's like, \"Wow, that really hit differently.\" I think it goes something like this. People and teams don't really reach ... They don't actually reach their goals. They fall to the level of their systems.\n\n(01:37:43):\nAnd that to me was really powerful because I struggle a lot with just being balanced in life, working out the way I want to and getting the right rest and making sure that I'm spending time in all the right places. And that's really like ... It's a goal of mine. But the problem is that I don't ... My system for that specifically, I tend to ... I'm not rigorous with it is when I need to be.\n\n(01:38:06):\nBut on the other hand, at work, I'm very rigorous in the systems and processes. So really that saying to me really hits because it is both applicable to your life and how you want to live your life but also how you want to run your teams.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:19):\nFinal question. You mentioned that you were a dean at a school, a boarding school. Is there something that you take away from that experience that's going to sticks with you? I know you mentioned one thing about treat PM's skills are similar to teacher skills. There anything else there?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:38:34):\nActually, so I was a dean of a boarding school in Switzerland, which was actually one of the most fun and interesting times of my life. It was an American school in Switzerland just outside of Lugano, Switzerland, the Italian-speaking section. I learned a lot about myself during the time. I learned a lot about just relationships and people. I actually had a call with one of my old students this morning. She's like in her thirties now. This was like 20 years ago. So I still keep in touch with them. And I think that's the comment I made about knowing people by name and story matters a lot. It says a lot that 20 years later I'm still talking to some of these students who are their own adults running their own businesses. But also I think the human challenges and human connection, human problems, very universal.\n\n(01:39:24):\nThis was a really interesting place when you had kids coming from a variety of different walks of life, some who lived in Azerbaijan or Kosovo and felt like ... The families felt like they couldn't be safe there, so they wanted to send the kids somewhere else. So some kids whose parents worked at the US Embassy and just were kind of there for a little bit of time. And what I found to be true is that just spending time with people and understanding their own story and family life really led to a lot of shared interests and passions. And it helped really me to see that the world can be very similar in so many ways and it is very much reflected to me in my day-to-day life in tech because as you know in the Bay Area, there's so many people who come from so many walks of life who end up in this journey building these products and companies and just help me to value so many different voices.\n\n(01:40:15):\nIf you want to build world-class products, if you want to build product that can scale around the world, if you want to build product that's be hypergrowth, you have to be inclusive of so many voices. And so you have to build that skill to be able to acknowledge and learn from and to live in tension with different voices.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:32):\nThat is beautiful. I love that we're ending there. Bangaly, I feel like we've done a lot of understand work and I think we've helped a lot of people with a lot of things we talked about so much. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow what you're up to, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:40:47):\nFor as much as I've worked at social companies, I actually don't use my social products that much. I'm on Instagram. If you look @iambangaly, I-A-M-B-A-N-G-A-L-Y, Google that. All of my socials handles all have the same kind of link including LinkedIn. So hit me up whenever. And then what can people do useful for me? I don't know. I don't have a short list. I would say I love to hear people's stories. I love to give advice. Obviously, my time is a little bit limited occasionally, but I think if people can share with me things that they're learning or things that they see in the market, or if they have questions, I always love to hear it. And so I think for me, just hearing other people's stories and learning what other people are doing is probably the most rewarding for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:35):\nBangaly, thank you so much for being here.\n\nBangaly Kaba (01:41:38):\nThank you. This is amazing. I really appreciate you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:40):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Category creation and brand building | Barbra Gago (Pando, Miro, Greenhouse, Culture Amp)\n\n## Transcript\n\nBarbra Gago (00:00):\nWhen you're building a category, you need to make sure that there is a category that's validated by analysts and directory sites and things like that. But also, you want to have a lot of traction in terms of thought leadership like why is this the category? What are the unique value propositions of this particular thing? What are the pain points it solves? And then of course, getting a lot of content around because when you're generating a new category, you're also needing to educate buyers that there is a category that they can now budget for and why they should allocate budget for that.\n\nLenny (00:40):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard learned experiences, building and scaling today's most successful companies.\n\nLenny (00:54):\nToday, my guest is Barbra Gago. Barbra was chief marketing officer and global head of Marketing at Miro where she helped build their global brand and create a whole new software category for the space. Before that, she was VP of marketing at Greenhouse where she brought the product to market and led their go-to market strategy. And she was also head of marketing at CultureAmp where she helped build their go-to market plan and close their first 50 customers.\n\nLenny (01:18):\nIn our conversation, we focus on three topics: creating your own category, when it makes sense to explore that, when to avoid it and how to go about it; building your brand and rebranding when it makes sense to, and building opinionated software. I've never seen a post or a podcast get as deep into category creation or rebranding, and I'm confident that you will learn something valuable from this podcast. With that, I bring you Barbra Gago.\n\nLenny (01:46):\nThis episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build powerful AI-powered features in your audio or video products, then you need to know about AssemblyAI.

Excited to be here.\n\nLenny (04:10):\nJust to start off and set a little context for our listeners, can you give us a 55-second background on some of the wonderful things you've done in your career and what you're up to now?\n\nBarbra Gago (04:21):\nDefinitely. So I've spent pretty much my entire career in B2B SaaS tech, building and scaling through hyper growth, oftentimes with disruptive technologies at the center of people, tech, future of work. I would say I helped bring products like CultureAmp and Greenhouse to market in the people space. Before that, I did some work in enterprise social networking in the Yammer days. And most recently, I was the CMO at Miro where I also led the rebrand and introduced that product to the world, which was very exciting.\n\nLenny (05:01):\nAnd you've got a startup now, so maybe you just mention that briefly and then we'll talk about it at the end again. Yeah. What are you working on now?\n\nBarbra Gago (05:08):\nYeah. And now, I'm building a product which we'll see about the category what it ends up being, but it's what we call an employee progression platform. So basically, from the work that I've done as a leader, building and scaling teams and also the exposure I've had in the people tech space, I just have found that there's been a lot of tools lacking for leaders to really coach and develop their team in the right way, creating enough structure and transparency into the process that creates accountability on both sides. So yeah, we're taking on the big goal of killing performance reviews.\n\nLenny (05:49):\nHoly moly. Cool.\n\nBarbra Gago (05:50):\nVery exciting\n\nLenny (05:51):\nPerformance reviews. Very exciting. It's true. We'll talk about that a bit at the end more. And there's a bunch of stuff I want to dig into. You have such a cool background on so many interesting experiences. The first is something that you mentioned just now, which is category and category creation, which I know is near and dear to your heart. I was reading a bit about your background, and I learned that at Miro, you invented this category that's now called visual collaboration. And at CultureAmp, I think you helped lead the creation of this category, employee experience. I imagine at Greenhouse, you did something similar. And I know startups are often trying to decide, should I create my own category? Should I try to win in an existing category? And so I want to spend some time talking through your experience there.\n\nLenny (06:32):\nAnd so the first question is just say at Miro or Greenhouse, can you just talk through your thought process of trying to decide, should we invent a whole new category that we're going to win or should we just try to win an existing category and how did that go?\n\nBarbra Gago (06:45):\nThey're both great examples because in one, we did create a new category and in the other, we tried and abandoned ship. With Miro, I think when I joined the company, there was this concept of an online whiteboard, which also is a category, but it's a much smaller category and it wasn't something that a lot of people searched for. And I think the biggest motivating factor of thinking about category creation at Miro was how do we become something really big and needed by every company and not just this little thing that maybe product teams would use or maybe engineering teams or schools or something like that.\n\nBarbra Gago (07:26):\nWhen you're thinking about category creation, it's really, for us, it was really about the scope of what we're trying to do and not wanting to be in something too small. And I think with Miro, the platform that it is, there is so much possibility. I used to joke that it was, even as a company, we were the ever expanding universe. There's just so much to do there, but online whiteboard was really small.\n\nBarbra Gago (07:52):\nGreenhouse is in the ATS category, which is applicant tracking system. And at the time, applicant tracking systems had a really bad name. I don't know if folks that listen to this know of Jobvite or remember Jobvite, and there were a lot of systems before that. Jobvite had come in the mid-2000s as the new and improved ATS and it was all about social recruiting, but it was very transactional and it wasn't very strategic. And so we wanted to steer clear of the ATS space even though we were an ATS. We can talk more about what we tried and what we ended up doing, but I think the main factors when you're thinking about category creation is really what budget companies have, if they have a budget, if they don't have a budget. Companies did have a budget for ATS, for example. Until now, I don't think companies had a budget for visual collaboration. For example, what's the language and the words that people use to describe their pain points and their situation, the things that they need? And then is their competition?\n\nBarbra Gago (08:59):\nAnd sometimes, competition, you would think like, \"Oh, we want to not have competition, so let's build a new category.\" But ultimately, you're not building a category until there is competition. It's not officially actually a category until there's more companies that do that. And that was a big learning for me in this whole process of category creation, is that it's actually okay when new companies come in that say they're that category because it's just validating the fact that there is a new category. So I think it's really ... If and when is really about what the overall objective is and also what the current situation is with competitors and the space. The ATS market is still the ATS market, for example, and Miro has created visual collaboration as a category but also ticks off boxes for other categories as well.\n\nLenny (09:53):\nI have a thousand questions I want to ask to dig deeper. Before we get in there, can you just define, well, what is a category? Folks that are just like, what the hell have you been talking about? What is a product category? What's the high level way to think about this?\n\nBarbra Gago (10:04):\nWhen we talk about category, I think it's really what would be a good way to explore your space and your relevant categories would be to go to G2 Crowd or Software Advice or any of those type of review sites or directory sites and learn about how they've categorized products based on feature sets. And so within each industry, there's going to be a bunch of different types of categories. Those categories are typically products that solve, at least in B2B products, that solve a certain pain point or a set of pain points, and they can be very wide like all in one and big solutions or they can be narrow. There's this all in one versus best in class, for example. And I think that's where the granularity of category comes into play and then how big the market is. Obviously, maps to granularity versus more broad and when are you granular versus when do you go broad? But I think ultimately, it's just a set of features or products that are solving a specific pain point that customers most likely have a budget allocated for.\n\nLenny (11:17):\nAnd then the category ends up, the way you use it is it's the way you pitch your product often. It's like the big part of the headline, part of the way you sell it. It's like you come back to this we're the leader in visual collaboration, for example, or that's how it practically ends up being used.\n\nBarbra Gago (11:31):\nExactly. It's interesting because I would say that if you're building a category as well, you can sometimes be selling into a category while you're still building the appetite for a different category, which is a nuance, which is all about where's the budget and how do customers describe their pain points?\n\nLenny (11:53):\nThis reminds me, I was just trying to pitch my podcast in this little dock I'm writing. And initially, I was like, \"Oh, it's like a top hundred business podcast.\" And I'm like, \"No, it's the number one product and growth podcast in the world,\" which is true, but I created my own category. How about that?\n\nBarbra Gago (12:09):\nThere you go.\n\nLenny (12:10):\nWas that a good idea?\n\nBarbra Gago (12:11):\nI think so. The thing is it's like when you talk about ICP for how you're going to sell your product and really build a repeatable sales process to scale that piece of your business. And the more specific the thing is that you're selling initially, obviously you're going to have more relevant users. They're going to spread word of mouth, etc. You could always expand that scope later. The category can also evolve. You mentioned CultureAmp earlier. The category now is people experience. Actually, when I was there, it was more about people analytics platform or people intelligence platform because we were providing a deep set of data that companies didn't have before, but that category has since evolved as their go-to market has changed, as they've added new products to their platform and new features and things like that.\n\nLenny (13:06):\nTo make it even more concrete for people, what are other examples of categories that come to mind that are either invented recently or just generally?\n\nBarbra Gago (13:14):\nIn the early days, I was working on market automation, for example, so Marketo, now HubSpot, fits into that, even though back then, they were more of this inbound marketing platform/category performance management, which is the area of Pando. We've talked a lot about people, products. I think Gainsight did a great job with the customer success platform, so this is a different problem that they were solving within the organization for a group. The customer success team, basically how are they going to make their customers successful?\n\nLenny (13:49):\nAwesome.\n\nBarbra Gago (13:50):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (13:51):\nYeah, customer success. It's a well name.\n\nBarbra Gago (13:53):\nYes.\n\nLenny (13:55):\nOkay. There's many benefits to try to create your own category, right? We're number one. That's one main category. Two is you can lead the charge on understanding or just defining what's important. I imagine there's other benefits maybe you could share, but there's also probably a lot of downsides. You mentioned oftentimes, it doesn't work and it just ends up being a lot of wasted money. Maybe just talk about what are the reasons to pursue trying to create your own category and then some of the reasons you maybe shouldn't.\n\nBarbra Gago (14:20):\nGreenhouse is a great example to talk about a failed approach at creating a category. So I mentioned before the ATS or the applicant tracking system category at the time was just, it carried so much disdain. People had such bad experiences with that whole category of products. No matter what, they weren't strategic. They didn't help people be good at recruiting. It was just a pretty terrible, very transactional experience. And I came in and it was like, \"Okay, let's reposition ourselves. We're going to create a new category.\" We tried several things.\n\nBarbra Gago (14:57):\nOne of the main things that we zeroed in on was recruiting optimization platform, and it was really like we are doing that. We're helping companies really structure the process, identify where they have gaps, where people are falling through the cracks, where they're flying through the process and really tweak and iterate it and improve it. And we spent time getting content out there, talking to press about it, positioning it in this way. And ultimately, at the end of the day, the budget that customers had and the way that customers talked about what we did, no matter what we called it, was applicant tracking.\n\nBarbra Gago (15:33):\nSo it didn't really make sense to continue to go against the grain of, no, we're going to be this new thing or we're going to call it this if everybody, even seeing the value and seeing the differentiation of our platform to others, still called it an ATS. We abandoned that process. But I think the main thing that we understood then was instead of spending the time and money to build a new category, we were going to spend the time and money to elevate the value of this category. So rather than changing the category to something else which we could value at whatever it was, we were just going to spend all of our resources to make this whole category much more valuable to the users, to companies. And that really was, along with what CultureAmp was doing at the time in the same space, what set off this whole trajectory of really good, strong people practices and people organizations that were really doing cool stuff on the recruiting side as well as employee engagement.\n\nLenny (16:35):\nYou mentioned a few components of when it makes sense to come up with a category. One is there's budget already against it. Two is people use the words associated with that category. I imagine with Miro and this idea of, what was it, visual collaboration, there wasn't budget for that yet. So how does that work?\n\nBarbra Gago (16:53):\nNo. That is more of the vision piece, I would say. Sometimes you can have a vision that customers, they don't have it yet or they don't share it, but they can grow to share it and they did in that case. And I think that with Miro, we still worked to optimize where we could in terms of the categories that we did fit into or how people talked about us, but it was also such a new format and it was really a disruptive product that didn't exist before in the enterprise so that it was called a lot of different things. So it was much more fluid and people talked about it in different ways, and this was our way of hearing the feedback about how people talked about it as online whiteboard or lots of jobs to be done were framed, mind mapping platform or diagramming or whatever, all of these little things.\n\nBarbra Gago (17:52):\nAnd so visual collaboration was our way of putting a nice bow around this thing that could then be an enterprise product that solves a lot of different problems for a lot of different use cases and different types of users. We started out selling and having a lot of users that were in product and in engineering and teams that were used to using whiteboards anyway and then needed to do it in a distributed way, but very quickly packaged different types of jobs for HR teams or marketing teams or design teams and pretty much anybody in the organization. But it needed to all come together cohesively; otherwise, it was like everybody in the org just calls it a different thing because they use it in a different way.\n\nLenny (18:37):\nPart of what I'm hearing is that you don't stop working on the other categories that it already sits within and just keep optimizing those but in parallel, start to try to pull together, hey, there's this bigger vision of where this could be. Does that sound right?\n\nBarbra Gago (18:50):\nI think so. And it's really where you get the inputs from your customers and your users. We heard all these things. Miro, we did a lot of content marketing. That's a big piece of doing category creation generally I would say. But there's a lot of different ways that people talked about it, and so that's an opportunity to actually come and say, okay, here's what it is because no one knows, and it's all of these things and all of these things together equals this now. And then that created momentum where other companies started thinking like that and then they started tagging themselves as that category as well, and then you had a category of multiple companies now that were doing similar stuff.\n\nLenny (19:35):\nYeah, absolutely. How do you know when it's probably a bad idea to try to create your own category?\n\nBarbra Gago (19:41):\nThe sooner, the better if you're going to try and fail and iterate. I think if you already are well established, I don't think category creation is really a meaningful effort if you already have ... It's not going to be necessarily a way to just all of a sudden generate new business by creating Q&A new category once you've already gone far enough down the path. I think that if you're not getting ... With the Greenhouse situation, as much as we used this other language and it did get picked up a bit in terms of context that people would use to talk about Greenhouse, it really just wasn't sticking. And so I think it's good to try things and also abandon them and that's okay. You can always sit back into the category. If you really don't fit into any other category, then you probably do need to figure out what the category is and package that. And that's going to be done mostly by continuing to talk to customers and listening to how they talk about things. It all comes from what you hear from them ultimately and what will resonate.\n\nBarbra Gago (20:49):\nSo I think, yeah, if you're already established, if you really aren't differentiated from other categories in your space, then you probably are in that category. And doing category creation is a lot of work that is not going to be fruitful if you're pretty squarely in something already. And then if you really aren't but you need to figure it out, you're just going to have to keep iterating until you figure out what makes sense to your customers.\n\nLenny (21:15):\nFor founders who are listening to this and they're just like, \"Oh, this sounds interesting. I want to try to think about a new category maybe for my product.\" Can you just talk about the mechanics of going through this process of trying to decide what category it should be called, how to roll it out, anything you could share by just the tactics of creating a category?\n\nBarbra Gago (21:36):\nThe main thing which we've talked a little bit about already is really understanding your customers and their pain points and how they talk about things. All of my best marketing and positioning literally comes from having a million conversations with customers and listening to how they solve problems and how our system helps them solve problems and what they're doing and how they talk about stuff. I think that's step one, is really understanding who those buyers are, how they talk about the product, what's the unique differentiator and selling points?\n\nBarbra Gago (22:10):\nOne thing that's really important in category creation as well is actually PR. You need to get this category and positioning out there at a high level in order to test it out and see if it makes sense and if it's resonating. And then the other piece is really those directory sites, which the analysts like Gartner and Forrester and all these guys, at least in B2B and enterprise, they really shape for customers what the categories are. And you need to build relationships with them. You need to work with them to create your category as well. So with the visual collaboration, for example, we weren't ranking, we weren't categorized in visual collaboration on G2 Crowd, and we had to meet with them and explain what it was and talk to them about the differentiation of this category versus other categories in terms of features and all of that stuff so that they could understand how they would differentiate this category from another category.\n\nBarbra Gago (23:15):\nSo I think those are really good channels to look at. And then tactically, it's a lot of content marketing and a lot of thought leadership. When you're building a category, you need to make sure that there is a category that's validated by analysts and directory sites and things like that. But also, you want to have a lot of traction in terms of thought leadership like why is this the category? What are the unique value propositions of this particular thing? What are the pain points it solves? And then of course, getting a lot of content around because when you're generating a new category, you're also needing to educate buyers that there is a category that they can now budget for and why they should allocate budget for that.\n\nLenny (24:02):\nSounds like a hell of a lot of work.\n\nBarbra Gago (24:03):\nIt's a lot.\n\nLenny (24:05):\nI'm curious. What percentage of say B2B companies do you think should pursue creating a category? Is it almost none or is it a meaningful percentage?\n\nBarbra Gago (24:13):\nIt goes in waves with the tech innovations. So for example, when there was the whole first web wave and then there was this whole social enterprise and consumerization of IT was a big change in how technology occurred in the workplace and a lot of new categories came at that point. So I feel like it's less about the raw percentage and more about general inflection points that are happening that are causing the need for this.\n\nBarbra Gago (24:44):\nAnd I take COVID for example and this very quick shift to distributed work was one of those type of inflection points that has changed a lot. A new category that has grown extremely fast is, and I don't even know exactly what they call it, but it's these employment platforms like Deel and Oyster that have cropped up and grown significantly fast and also have created a new category where there was already the ability to hire people in all of these distributed places, but you had to find a company in that place that would then hire the people. And then of course, they created these platforms where, hey, here's a system, you can manage it all here, we'll go and build all those relationships on the ground. And Nayya is a new set of a new category with four or five companies just in the last three years that have cropped up. So I think it's more about what the market demands and what's happening in the market rather than whether or not one company it makes sense for, if that makes sense.\n\nLenny (25:48):\nYeah, makes sense. It depends on where the tide is pulling everyone. I think that makes a lot of sense.\n\nBarbra Gago (25:52):\nExactly. Yeah.\n\nLenny (25:53):\nMaybe one last question about category creation. So on the surface, there's this binary choice. Either try to become the best ATS platform or we're not ATS, we're employee recruiting automation. Is there a middle ground? Do you have to go one or the other or is there some in between route, maybe positioning a little bit differently or how do you think about that?\n\nBarbra Gago (26:13):\nThere could be some middle ground. I would say for Pando, for example, performance management is a very established category that we technically fit into, and also there's a line item on the budget and people have money to pay for performance management. But we're introducing this concept of employee progression, which is more of a long tail strategy. So while we want to educate the market and build this new category of employee progression because it's related to the differences between what we're doing and traditional performance management, we're still going to rate ourselves in directory sites, for example, or categorize ourselves as performance management and talk about performance management and sell to companies that are looking for performance management. But ultimately, we want to shift everybody's mindset and change the category.\n\nBarbra Gago (27:09):\nSo it's not necessarily one or the other, but I do think the investment is high if you want to build a new category, and we're committed to an investment of time and thought leadership and content and all of that stuff, but it's also not our strategy right now to go and create employee progression and own and dominate this. We're going to work our way up to that over time.\n\nLenny (27:34):\nGot it. That connects to what you talked about with Miro. It wasn't like we're switching, we're now visual collaboration. It's like we're still whiteboards, we're the best white boarding tool, but let's also start building this brand of visual collaboration so that people start to learn.\n\nBarbra Gago (27:48):\nExactly. And I think it's a bottoms up mentality much like our business model was there because with marketing automation, it wasn't a progressive buildup. It was marketing automation. That's what the category was. I was working for a company that was doing marketing automation. There was Eloqua and Marketo and several others and we all were just telling everybody, educating the market on what that was, and that was very top down.\n\nLenny (28:19):\nAwesome. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company is taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.\n\nLenny (29:00):\nBeginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Get started today.\n\nLenny (29:38):\nI know another area that you spend a lot of time thinking about and you've done a lot of work around is branding, rebranding even and just go to market in general. I know at Miro, you led the charge on rebranding Miro. It used to be called I think RealtimeBoard, the little two capital letters and no space.\n\nBarbra Gago (29:52):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (29:53):\nAnd with Greenhouse, you basically led the go-to market plan. And so I want to spend a little time here I guess just around rebranding. At Miro, it's a rebrand. How do you know it's time to rebrand your product and it's worth investing there?\n\nBarbra Gago (30:06):\nRealtimeBoard was interesting. I almost didn't join because it was called RealtimeBoard. Honestly, I was like, \"Oh my, god. This is so literal.\" While I was walking the dogs with my husband, I'm like, \"Am I really going to join a company called RealtimeBoard\" Can this be a big company with that name?\" I was really concerned about it and ultimately, I spent more time with the leaders there and I was like, \"Okay, I think they'll be open to changing the name.\" So I think there's a maturity piece. A lot of companies are started and you just come up with a name and you don't put a lot of thought into it and then you grow to a certain level. At that time, I think we were a million users, maybe a couple of million in revenue so it was very early days. You had a name, you came up with it, you got the website and then the business grew, and at some point, can it be as big as we want it to be, as we think it can be with that name? And I think that was my biggest thing.\n\nBarbra Gago (31:08):\nWith RealtimeBoard specifically, it was so literal and matter of fact and the product itself had so much more potential than the name was doing justice for. So I think at some point, it's common for companies to do a rebrand once they go into scale mode before you have too many people and before you invest too much obviously in building that brand. So I think the sooner, the better like rebrand before I even joined. Will they let me change the name was my criteria for joining. And I would say in general, the sooner, the better, but obviously after you know that you have product market fit and you have something to scale, so you don't want to invest too much in a brand that isn't going to get you as far as you want to get if you're going to obviously scale.\n\nLenny (31:58):\nI was going to ask you what it took to convince the founders to rebrand because that's often a big challenge, but it sounds like that's part of your employee agreement. I will join if you give me the right to explore this.\n\nBarbra Gago (32:08):\nThey were pretty receptive to it. The company was not US-based. I had spent my whole career in Silicon Valley a lot of time with brand and inbound and community-focused brands. So they were pretty receptive. It was not that hard to convince them, which was great. I think the scary part for them and many people was just there was some equity. They did have advocates like how would this impact the people who really loved the product right now? And so one of the things that was really important as we transitioned was that we kept as much of the essence of the initial brand. Before, the logo was like a Post-it and then RealtimeBoard. And so that Post-it, for example, that yellow became the new M that we used, and we actually proposed a hot pink M initially and the yellow M was the, okay, we don't want to go too far from the RealtimeBoard with the yellow Post-it and this was a way to nob to the early base of customers and keep something that was pretty standard and pretty core to the initial brand and name.\n\nLenny (33:25):\nLooking back, do you think that was worth the effort and time to worry about those folks?\n\nBarbra Gago (33:29):\nOh yeah.\n\nLenny (33:30):\nYeah. Okay.\n\nBarbra Gago (33:31):\nOh, the early folk, we definitely got feedback from along the way. We did case studies throughout the process. We got feedback on logos. We got feedback on brand and designs, and there were plenty of people who were like, \"Oh, I like RealtimeBoard. It's straightforward.\" They loved their product, but ultimately, we kept many of them informed and we really involved them in the process to the degree of not slowing us down but still getting feedback, because we did all of this in a very short period of time on top of it. And I think it was worth it because they felt really good about the outcome as well.\n\nBarbra Gago (34:09):\nAnd a big part of rebranding also means that you have to bring the whole company along too and make sure they feel really good about the outcome. And that was probably one of my big takeaways, is just at that time, we were already about a hundred people, so it wasn't a super small company, and everybody had thoughts and feelings and the company had been around for quite a long time before that. So it was a big change for many people.\n\nLenny (34:38):\nAny other learnings from that experience about just going through a branding or rebranding? Maybe just focusing on rebranding. Any other learnings for future rebranding efforts?\n\nBarbra Gago (34:46):\nSo rebranding is just the visual aesthetic, and I think that's important to make sure you can transition in a way that you're still nodding to the original things but you've reinvented it or transformed it in a way that makes more sense for where you're at and where you're going. If you're changing the name, it's way more complicated because everybody has to be involved, legal, all the contracts, the website, the product, all the links. We changed our URL. Everything changed. And so I think it's really important that you have to mobilize and align and have a very clear vision about the process and the steps and be very transparent about it. I think a lot of times, marketing teams just go and do their thing and come back and it's like, \"Here we go.\"\n\nBarbra Gago (35:34):\nWith the rebrand at Miro, it was very much rebrand as a product approach. It was very much a product development process with sprint teams and agile, coming back, and you had owners for different parts of things and all reporting back and it really required everybody in some way to be involved. As I mentioned, we did it in a very condensed period of time. I think we kicked off the naming process in end of October and we launched publicly at South by Southwest with a fully three dimensional booth in March. So it was very short to get a name, and then once we had the name, to do all the actual brand and then not only that but produce an entire booth and event collateral and all of that stuff. So I think mobilizing, having a really strong clear process and delegating and letting go in the marketing role, not trying to own everything. It has to be owned by everybody else because you need sales decks and it's just everything.\n\nBarbra Gago (36:39):\nI think there's also luck involved with any success and also in rebrands because a million things could go wrong. We got our domain name changed to miro.com, I think it was 48 hours before the event.\n\nLenny (36:54):\nOh damn.\n\nBarbra Gago (36:54):\nAll the material had been printed with the new URL. We had to just make a leap of faith, super stressful, but thankfully, we had luck on our side. But ultimately, team process, clear structure, transparent for everybody, getting feedback from customers and making sure stakeholders feel like they're involved. I think ultimately, it's a really powerful way to create defensibility for a product and a brand in the market, but it's also a lot of work related to category creation.\n\nLenny (37:29):\nI was just going to say that. It sounds like everything you do is just a hell of a lot of work. The rest [inaudible 00:37:34].\n\nBarbra Gago (37:35):\nIt's fun. I love work.\n\nLenny (37:36):\nMe too. I always joke that I work for a workaholic, which is myself.\n\nBarbra Gago (37:40):\nYeah, I do. I know. I just love it. So I get into this stuff and I think rebranding and category creation and brand in general, I think what our goal with Miro was to create ... There's this concept of a love mark rather than a straight mark. It's like how do you build a brand? I think Airbnb has done a great job with that as well, but how do you build a brand that people really love and so committed to and invested in? And that you have to put a lot of thought into it, and it needs to be authentic for it to really work, but if it does, it's super, super powerful.\n\nLenny (38:22):\nYeah. I was there during the Airbnb rebrand. It took I think a year and a half for them from start to finish to get to something they were really excited about ready to launch. And there's also actually a similar story to the domain story shared with the font. I don't know how much I could share, but they didn't have the right to use the font until the last day or something. It was a close call.\n\nBarbra Gago (38:43):\nYeah, but you have to just like, \"It's going to happen.\" There's some blind faith.\n\nLenny (38:47):\nRight. It helps close it. We're launching. I wanted to talk about just branding in general. You've worked on such great, big, successful brands and you've helped craft these brands, and I'm just curious what advice you have around just building a brand, a lasting brand, a global brand. What's important when you think about creating a brand for your startup?\n\nBarbra Gago (39:06):\nI think it's something that companies should think about as early as possible and have it not be an afterthought. The product and the brand are the main things that will get customers and keep them and also keep them loyal and engaged. So I think you have to have both. You can't have one or the other. You could have a great brand and if the product sucks, there's only so far a brand can go. And you also can have a great product and maybe not that thoughtful of a brand, but what I've found is that the more the brand is interchangeable with the people at the company and the company itself, the stronger it is, the more authentic it is. When you talk about Google, you also talk about its people. They're one and the same Googlers. And a lot of companies have that same approach.\n\nBarbra Gago (39:55):\nAnd I think with Miro, we definitely incorporate our values into the brand. Our whole mission was to help companies build the next big thing. This is what we want to do. We want to be the platform that helps companies build the next big thing. We also had to be a big thing. We need to show what big things are. And so your company values, for example, can shape how big and how deep you go with your brand, how authentic it is to the experiences that people have because ultimately, values play a big part because values are foundational to how people behave at the organization, how they work together, how they work with one another, how they work with customers, how they talk to customers.\n\nBarbra Gago (40:40):\nThe best way to incorporate your brand and how people are interacting with people that you are selling to, customers or whoever, partners, is to have those values incorporated because then it's every touchpoint isn't something that you have to train people, okay, these are all the touch points and this is how the brand needs to manifest. It already will because it's part of the DNA of the company. So I think really integrating the values can help with that and also, of course, make the brand itself human and authentic and something that people really feel emotional connection to.\n\nLenny (41:18):\nWhat's an example of value informing the brand or change or helping you make a different decision maybe at Miro or CultureAmp or Greenhouse to make that a little more concrete?\n\nBarbra Gago (41:27):\nAuthenticity as a value. Candor as a value. Thoughtfulness as a value. If you have a value around a bias for action or something like that, these things can translate to how the brand manifests in terms of the language that's used, the colors, the objects. With Miro, for example, we had each character of the word Miro in a different shape, and each shape had different characteristics and those were tied back to different values so they each represented something different.\n\nLenny (42:02):\nWhat's an example of that? What were Miro's values while we're diving into there?\n\nBarbra Gago (42:06):\nOne of them was around agility. And so, one, I don't remember which letter it was. Maybe the I. It was shaped wiggly, and then we also had a visual manifestation of it so they all behaved differently. They all had their own behavior. And one of the things that was really important to us is that we were creating a visual system or a visual language so that people that were from different parts of the world, working together could understand each other without necessarily speaking the same language. And so this was a way to invoke this connection of different perspectives and different languages in a way that got all pulled together.\n\nLenny (42:47):\nGot it. Cool. There's a lot there. The way you all visualized the values were using the name Miro. I imagine there's four values then.\n\nBarbra Gago (42:53):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (42:54):\nAnd then Agility as a value informed the product. It needs to be agile and make sure people can be flexible in how they use it.\n\nBarbra Gago (43:01):\nDefinitely. How we build the product, how people around the product act, and then that shape itself was agile and moved and agiley.\n\nLenny (43:10):\nThat's awesome. I love that. Were you there for coming up with the values? People are always wondering, just how do we come up with our company values? Do you have any insights into just developing company values?\n\nBarbra Gago (43:20):\nWe did iterations of it while I was there. They already had a stake in the ground. What I have done in the past with values is we just did an exercise with my leadership team, for example, where we did a workshop format. We actually used Miro where everybody just brain dumped their ideas around values, and then it was, okay, from there, let's group them into themes. And then from there, let's vote on the most important things. And then from there, how do we start to articulate and define these things? Ultimately, coming up with the definitions is not really something you can do as a group because it's just not very productive. It's better if somebody who knows how to write well can come up with the first stab of the sentences, if it's operating principles, if it's values, and then get feedback on it. But you can get everybody's input and make the process pretty structured by doing something like that where it's like brain dump, group, vote, and then you have your short list of things that you can then work to define.\n\nLenny (44:23):\nAwesome. Maybe one last question around brand. People that aren't in, say, marketing hear brand and it's, okay, it's this fuzzy thing that I feel about our company. When you think about creating a brand, what are the bullet point things that you come up with? There's a logo. There's color palette. Can you just talk through, what is a brand when you're creating a brand and building a brand, what are the elements of it?\n\nBarbra Gago (44:47):\nSo all of those things that you mentioned. I would say the logo, the colors, the fonts, all the general aesthetic. Do you have photography? Do you use illustrations? Is it all illustrations, all graphics, whatever? You decide those things. You need to understand what the voice is of the brand, how the brand sounds when you write things, when you market it, how people talk. All of that stuff is part of the brand. If you want to build a brand that's really scalable, you think about it more as a system like a brand system. So this is creating things that ... With Miro, for example, we had the letters and we had the colors and we had these concepts of agility. I don't remember all of them off the top of my head, but all of these different concepts that then were represented by different shapes or different colors that could be used in various forms. So it's really like how does it become an extension of all of the different things that you're going to be doing visually or when you talk to customers or how you present the product, etc.?\n\nLenny (45:50):\nAnd all of that combines to this feeling you get eventually from the brand. All these things create that fuzzy feeling.\n\nBarbra Gago (45:56):\nYes.\n\nLenny (45:57):\nYeah. It's interesting you don't remember all the values at Miro. With Airbnb, I'm just like, I will never forget the Airbnb values. They've been so drilled into our heads.\n\nBarbra Gago (46:05):\nYeah, it's because they were too long. It was something that we were constantly working on because they were too long and there were too many things in them to remember. That was the problem.\n\nLenny (46:17):\nThat's a great learning there. Make them simple, but also don't make them generic.\n\nBarbra Gago (46:21):\nYeah, it can't be generic, but it also can't be too much that nobody knows what they are. They need to be simple and straightforward and easy to remember.\n\nLenny (46:32):\nAnd potentially, illustrated with your company name. That's a really cool idea.\n\nBarbra Gago (46:36):\nExactly. Yeah.\n\nLenny (46:37):\nLast topic I want to spend a little time on is something that I know you're really passionate about, which is this idea of creating opinionated software that has clear opinions about how you should be using it and how you should be doing your work. And so maybe as a first question, just what is opinionated software? What's important about it?\n\nBarbra Gago (46:54):\nOpinionated software is basically software platforms that essentially have either best practices or maybe some rules integrated into the system. You have systems that you can customize any which way and however you want and then you have other systems that enforce a certain way of behaving or doing work, as you said. And so I think probably a pretty well known example for your audience especially is Atlassian really building tools for agile workflows and agile teams.\n\nBarbra Gago (47:27):\nAnd Greenhouse is another example from a recruiting perspective in terms of what we called structured recruiting. There was a very specific way to create a pipeline, build an interview kit, and all of that was important because it made recruiting better and more transparent and obviously less bias and all of those things. So it's principled, I would say. It's anchored in some values. And because of those values, there will be certain rules that are built in that you can't really work around.\n\nLenny (47:58):\nDo you have any advice for when it makes sense to be very opinionated about how you make people use your product and do the thing they're trying to do versus just optimize for flexibility?\n\nBarbra Gago (48:11):\nI think Atlassian built around a process that was already happening and growing momentum and it was like, okay, let's build a solution to enable companies to do this with technology. So there was already a process that didn't have a technology integrated, and then with Greenhouse it was like, there's a better way to do it and this is how it should be done. So I think there's two different approaches. Either find a process that just doesn't have technology that is a best practice or growing best practice. I think the same thing happened in DevOps with many different tools. And then Greenhouse, which is more like, what are companies missing? How can they do it better? How can we train them and teach them a better way? And then by the way, our software helps you do that.\n\nLenny (48:56):\nWith the product and company you're building now, are you looking to make it very opinionated and here's how you should be doing performance reviews or how are you thinking about it?\n\nBarbra Gago (49:03):\nYes, we are. It is opinionated, and it's opinionated because the current way that performance reviews happen are full of bias and there's a lot of problems with it. It's like the best thing that companies can do and therefore, they continue to do it, but that just perpetuates a lot of issues. The reason that companies have to go and look at compensation data and fix pay gaps is because they have systemic problems with how people are promoted and progressed in the organization. So if they're recruited in a certain way, they may or may not be developed and then they're evaluated on their performance, which ultimately results in compensation and what people are paid, and that as we know, there's plenty of problems.\n\nBarbra Gago (49:47):\nSo companies are fixing this compensation issue by updating the comp every year, but that doesn't fix the systemic problem. And so yes, we have opinions about how to fix the problem and therefore, our building a system that when it comes to performance evaluation, employee progression, we require companies to be more transparent about the levels at the company, the expectations for different levels and competencies, and we create accountability both on the employee and the manager side, but it's also the right thing to do. Employees should feel that they're evaluated fairly, and without a system enforcing some of these things, there's too much subjectivity in the process to make it good, unless you really do a lot of work, which most companies don't do to create the right system. You don't have to use a platform to do it, but if you don't do the work anyway, you won't have the outcome that you want, which is people feeling good about their career and paid fairly.\n\nLenny (50:59):\nYeah. I found performance reviews to be one of maybe the most powerful tool as a manager to change the way people operate, help them improve, make them fulfilled and happy with where things are going. It feels like that's the core of management, is the performance review cycle and giving people feedback on how they're doing it and then continuing to come back to here's where you're underperforming, here's what it'll take to get to the next level. So I'm excited about what you're working on.\n\nBarbra Gago (51:22):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (51:23):\nWe've reached our very exciting lightning round where I'm going to ask you five rapid fire questions and you just tell me what comes to mind. We'll go through it pretty fast. Does that sound good?\n\nBarbra Gago (51:34):\nYes.\n\nLenny (51:34):\nOkay. Awesome. First question, what are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nBarbra Gago (51:41):\nDefinitely Radical Candor. We give this out to customers. It's really good for management and best practices around giving feedback. I love the Art of War just as strategic thinking. And then not work related, a book called Kafka on the Shore. It's one of my favorite Murakami books that I highly recommend.\n\nLenny (52:00):\nWhat is that one again?\n\nBarbra Gago (52:01):\nKafka on the Shore.\n\nLenny (52:03):\nKafka on the Shore. Wow, cool. I haven't heard of that.\n\nBarbra Gago (52:05):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (52:06):\nAwesome. Going to use these in the show notes. What's a favorite other podcast than the one you're currently on?\n\nBarbra Gago (52:13):\nI love Cautionary Tales. I don't know if you know this one, but it's a great podcast that basically identifies and tells stories about the mental mindsets that we're in and the biases that we have and then historic events that have happened and just crazy things that have resulted from things that we do as humans because we're biased.\n\nLenny (52:36):\nIrrational humans.\n\nBarbra Gago (52:37):\nIt's really good. Yeah.\n\nLenny (52:38):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or a TV show that you watched?\n\nBarbra Gago (52:42):\nI watched Sandman. I don't know if you've heard of this.\n\nLenny (52:46):\nI've heard of it. I haven't seen it.\n\nBarbra Gago (52:49):\nIt's based off of an eight-part graphic novel series by Neil Gaiman. It's really good. The TV version of it isn't exactly about the books, but it's about the characters, and I feel like the way that they portrayed the characters was really interesting and super diverse. It's a great show.\n\nLenny (53:09):\nAwesome. That's more plus one for that show. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people?\n\nBarbra Gago (53:17):\nEverybody hates it, but I like asking what someone's top 10 accomplishments are. They hate it because it's like, \"Oh, God. Ugh.\" But it's really interesting to understand the level of quantitative versus qualitative in their accomplishments, what they value. And also if it's a, \"Oh, I ran a hundred miles or I have a great family,\" whatever it is, it's really interesting to get to know somebody and also what they value.\n\nLenny (53:46):\nWho else in the industry do you respect most as a thought leader or just influence on your career life?\n\nBarbra Gago (53:52):\nEarly days, I really appreciated Nancy Duarte. She is based in the Bay Area. She has an agency called Duarte Agency. She does a lot around storytelling and visual communication. She's been really great for me just in my career as a mentor. I've worked with her a couple of times, but also just following all the work that she does. She's amazing.\n\nLenny (54:13):\nAwesome. I remember learning about her when Al Gore gave his TED Talk and her whole agency was a-\n\nBarbra Gago (54:17):\nYes. She's done an incredible thing with her agency because they started as making presentations more visually appealing, and then it migrated to storytelling, and then it's evolved to change management and how to use story for driving change. And she's also evolved the agency so much over the years as well. She's done a lot of impressive work.\n\nLenny (54:42):\nBarbra, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBarbra Gago (54:52):\nLinkedIn is probably the easiest place to find me /BarbraGago. And for me, we're building a product in employee progression, so anybody who wants to share their stories or feedback, our insights around their experiences there or if they're interested in getting product feedback, we're really interested in actual user feedback, even though we're selling to HR teams.\n\nLenny (55:16):\nAnd what's the URL?\n\nBarbra Gago (55:18):\nPando.com.\n\nLenny (55:19):\nAwesome. Barbra, thank you for being here.\n\nBarbra Gago (55:20):\nThank you so much, Lenny.\n\nLenny (55:24):\nThank you so much for listening.

The thing that causes you to hesitate is both decisions are horrible. Probably one of my bigger ones on that was we went public with $2 million in trailing 12 months revenue at 18 months old. That's obviously a bad idea. But the truth of it was the alternative was going bankrupt, and that's a worse idea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):\nIt's a very difficult and painful to be a CEO, to be a founder. In spite of that. So many people want to start companies.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:00:29):\nThe psychological muscle you have to build to be a great leader is to be able to click in the abyss and go, \"Okay, that way's slightly better. We're going to go that way. If everybody agrees with the decision, then you didn't add any value because they would've done that without you.\" So the only value you ever add is when you make a decision that most people don't like.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):\nYou are famous for writing one of the most popular pieces of literature for product managers.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:00:52):\nWhat I was trying to get out in Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager, was the job is fundamentally a leadership job. And it's a tricky leadership job because nobody is actually reporting to you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:06):\nThere's always this kind of sense that the PM is not the mini CEO. How dare you call yourself that? I actually think that's exactly what the PM is.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:01:12):\nIt doesn't matter if you write a good, spec or you have a good interview or you do this or do that. What matters is that the product works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:21):\nToday my guest is Ben Horowitz. Ben is the Z in A16Z, the world's largest venture capital firm with over 46 billion in committed capital. They're investors in OpenAI, Cursor, Andrel, Databricks, Figma, basically every generational tech company. He's also the author of two New York Times bestselling books, the Hard Thing About Hard Things and What You Do is Who you are.\n\n(00:01:43):\nBen is endlessly fascinating. He started a rap group when he was younger. He started his career as a product manager and wrote the now famous Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager piece. In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover a ton of ground and Ben shares stories and insights that he's never shared anywhere else.

Excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:19):\nI'm even more excited to have you here.\n\n(00:04:21):\nI want to start with a question that a close friend of yours suggested I ask you, Shaka Senghor. So Shaka, he's, we could do an hour just on how interesting this guy and the things he's done.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:04:32):\nThree hours on Joe Rogan that day. He is very-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):\nSo we're not going to do that. Just to give a glimpse, he was in prison for 19 years. He was in solitary for seven years. He led a huge prison gang. You wrote about him in your book as a great exemplar of great culture in the prison gang that he ran. So interesting. But something that he learned from you that he told me I need to ask you about is about success and how to be successful and how it's not what people think. And he said that you learned this lesson from a pilot. What is that story? What is that lesson?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:05:08):\nI mean, I would say it's a long life lesson. But the pilot story is I actually, I ask people silly questions sometimes when they meet them. And so I met this gentleman who was a pilot and it was right around the time JFK Jr. crashed his airplane and ultimately died. And I asked him, I was like, \"What happened?\" Because there's always the story in the press, and I know this from them writing about me or anything, is it's always what's the best narrative not what's true. So you can never actually find out what happened, you just find the best story version of what happened.\n\n(00:05:53):\nAnd the story in the press was all about, \"Oh, he wasn't trained on instrumentation was flying at night.\" And I wanted to know is that right? And the pilot said, \"Well,\" he said, \"really, it's like all plane crashes are a series of bad decisions. And none of the decisions by themselves is that bad, but when you add them up, it's bad.\"\n\n(00:06:14):\nSo the first decision was he needed to get wherever he was going and that was the priority. And in flying, that can't ever be the priority because there are conditions, there are things that happen. And then the second one was, \"Well, his timing of when the sun would go down was wrong.\" So he thought he'd be flying in sunlight and he wasn't. And then once he got up there, it was when the plane was going down making it go up was a bad decision because he was upside down. And so it was like, I can't remember all the things, but this guy had 17 bad decisions in a row. And the big thing for me that I felt was really true is it's one decision leads to another. And so if you can break psychologically, you can take the sunk cost, then that gets you out of a lot of bad paths. And then a little good decision may be difficult, but you have to believe it's going to lead to the next one. And a lot of success is about that. It's a small thing, a small thing that's hard to do that doesn't seem to have a high impact, but it leads to the next small hard to do thing and then eventually you get an outcome, so that was kind of the concept.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:46):\nSo the lesson there is just success is just a bunch of little things. It's not this, \"Cool, I got here in a big thing.\"\n\nBen Horowitz (00:07:52):\nIf somebody were to write a story about me, they would be like, \"Then Ben this really smart thing and blah, blah, blah, happy ending.\" But it really wasn't like that and I don't think it's like that for you or anybody. And I spent a lot of time with Shaka on how, because it's always your own psychology that gets you. And one of the most insightful things he said to me is, because most people who are in solitary for seven years, that's it. You're insane. You're never coming back from that. It's just an impossible thing. But if you study his story, he actually really was massively self-improved coming out of solitary, and he wouldn't recommend that for anybody, just to be clear. It wasn't solitary. But what it was was he changed, in solitary he was able to change a big set of beliefs that he had about himself that got him out of that.\n\n(00:08:50):\nAnd the thing that his conclusion from it, which I thought was really interesting, he's like, \"Look, was in prison for 19 years. I was in solitary for seven. I come out, I can't rent an apartment, I can't vote, I can't get a gun, I can't do, no rights. None of that was anything compared to what I did to myself.\"\n\n(00:09:08):\nAnd I think that's very true for CEOs in general and people in general is all the things that you perceive that are happening to you that are bad, be it the systems against you or somebody undercuts you or racism or sexism or this or that or the other is very small compared to ... It means a lot if you believe it. If you believe what people say about you, if you believe what they did to you, then that destroys you. But if you go, \"That's not me,\" you can overcome almost anything. And he's got a new book out on that anyway that I think is very good because that's the, I'd say more than anything, that's the key to success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:52):\nIf you look at all the writing you've done, it's essentially about the struggle and pain and suffering of being a CEO, your first [inaudible 00:09:59] to Hard Thing About Hard Things. There's a lot of talk these days about just how important struggle is and how valuable it is to go through struggle. Jensen's big on this. He talks a lot about just you have to go through pain and suffering to be a great leader.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:10:12):\nYou don't really have a choice. That's true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:15):\nThere's something that I saw you share that I love, which is running towards fear versus running away from fear. Something that you tell all your leaders to work on. Easy to hear, hard to do. We don't like doing things that are scary, running towards things that are scary. Why is this so important? Why is this something people need to learn to do?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:10:33):\nWell, so the biggest mistake that you make, the worst thing that you do as a leader, there's things in your control and there's things out of your control and hesitation, that's generally the most destructive. And I go through all the ways that it's destructive, but it's extremely bad. And the thing that causes you to hesitate is both decisions are horrible. It's that business school where you're going through a case study, \"And if you had done that, then the company would have gone this way. But if you had done that, it's a great success.\" That's not actually what happens to you as CEO.\n\n(00:11:16):\nWhat happens to as CEO, it's like, \"Okay, if we rearchitect, this product, the architecture is not actually get us to where we need to go. I kind of know that. But if we rearchitect it, we're going to probably miss all the features, miss the quarter, have trouble raising money, shudder, et cetera. So that's really bad. And then not rearchitecting is really bad, and so I'm just going to try to and avoid this subject because I don't even want to deal with either of those.\" And that's the worst thing, because if action is the better choice and that's good. And then if you don't make an explicit decision, then the whole company's going to get nervous because they know that the architecture is whack and you got to fix it.\n\n(00:12:07):\nAnd probably one of my bigger ones on that was we went public with $2 million in trailing 12 months revenue at 18 months old. That's obviously a bad idea. I mean, there's no question that wasn't a bad idea. But the truth of it was the alternative because of where the private markets were was going bankrupt. And that's a worse idea.\n\n(00:12:34):\nAnd if you look at that time, March of 2001 when we went public, you just look at the number of CEOs that hesitated on that and didn't do it and went bankrupt. It's a lot. And so that getting good at making a decision that everybody's going to go, \"Wow, that was insane, Ben.\" The Wall Street Journal wrote a whole long story about how stupid I was. And then Businessweek wrote a story called the IPO From Hell. That was the name of our idea, the IPO from hell, which was accurate in a sense.\n\n(00:13:13):\nSo that's really bad, but it wasn't as bad, and this is why it's so scary you make that decision that's going to happen. I knew those stories would get written, there was no question. And yeah, that's the kind of muscle. So if you think about the psychological muscle you have to build to be a great leader is to be able to look in the abyss and go, \"Okay, that way slightly better. We're going to go that way. And it's very hard to do.\" I would say it's a thing people struggle with. And it began something, should I fire the head of sales? So I don't want to have that conversation. And then I'll have to replace them. And then there's going to be a bad PR story. And you can kind of quickly calculate all the bad stuff that's going to happen if you do it. But if you don't do it, that's probably going to be much worse and that's why you have to run towards the pain in darkness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:13):\nWhat is the advice you share with founders? Because as you said, it's very hard to do this, just what helps them actually get better at this? Is it just Ben being by their side telling them this is how it is? Is there anything else you can share?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:14:23):\nNo, no. I would say this is one where I can't really coach you to be good at this. I can point it out so that you recognize that you were slow or whatever. But it's kind of like I always liken when I talk to them, it's like football. You can have a really fast great athlete, but if they don't trust their eyes, if they don't run to the ball when they see it, if they think, \"Oh, maybe that was a fake,\" then they're that step slower and then they'll never be as good. And CEOs are like that. If you don't trust what you see and you don't run at it, then you're just not going to be good. And it's hard to get CEOs not to hesitate. But look, the thing that does help is they look at it and I look at it and I confirm, \"No, that is as it appears.\"\n\n(00:15:23):\nAnd sometimes they're afraid of the conversation. So that one I can help with. So A CEO might be afraid, like they want to do something but they don't know how to say it. They don't know how to have the conversation with the employee so I can walk them through that. I had an instance where the CEO said, \"Hey, I need your help, Ben. My CTO, he's an asshole.\" And I was like, \"Okay, great.\" I said, \"But you're not going to fire him because I know he's a good CTO, or are you asking me should you fire him?\" He said, \"No, no, I don't want to fire him.\" And I was like, \"So you're asking me what to do? You don't know how have that conversation with him about being an without him quitting. That's what you're saying?\" And he goes, \"Yeah, that's the problem.\"\n\n(00:16:09):\nAnd so I go, \"Well, why is he an asshole?\" And he says, \"Well, he's an asshole because the other day he made a very junior young woman in our finance organization cry.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, I got you.\" I said, \"Look, this is what I would say to him. I'd say I just sit them down and I would say, 'Look, you're a really good director of engineering because you do a great job at managing the team, get the products out, all that. But you're not really a CTO because to be a CTO, you have to be effective with other parts of the organization. You can't just be effective only with engineering. And making somebody cry, she's never going to do anything you want. You lost all effectiveness with all of finance by doing that. And so if you want to get good at that, I'll help you. I'll work with you on it, but if you don't, I'm going to have to hire a CTO at some point because obviously I need that.'\" And then he was like, \"Oh, okay, I can have that conversation. I can't have the conversation that, 'Hey, you're an asshole,' because I don't want them to quit, but I can have the conversation that's more specific.\" And a lot of getting people not to hesitate is just getting them over that.\n\n(00:17:20):\nAnd so often, and I would say early in a CEO's career, a lot of it is just not knowing how to have the conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:29):\nThere's also I imagine an element of I just want to be liked. I don't want people to hate me. You have this great line that you want to be liked and respected in the long run, not the short run.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:17:37):\nYeah, that's tricky. By the way, I have to deal with this in the firm too, and people want to be entrepreneur friendly. I'm like, \"No, it's not friendly. Respectful. But you've got to be able to tell them the truth in a way that you probably don't tell most of your friends the truth.\" Because your friend, look anthropologically, we want people to like us. It's just so they don't throw us to the lion or whatever. That's just kind of a thing. So you say tell people what they want to hear, but in dealing at a company level in a context of you're on the board of somebody's company, you've got to be able to tell them what they don't want to hear. That's the most important thing you're going to say.\n\n(00:18:22):\nAnd yes, they're not going to like it when you say it, there's no question. But over time it could save the company. And all the most important things I've said are things that I've said to CEOs that they did not want to hear. And that's what the leadership is about. If everybody agrees with the decision, then you didn't add any value because they would've done that without you. So the only value you ever add is when you make a decision that most people don't like and that's where leadership comes in because you know that's where it's got to get to. And that's the thing that takes practice.\n\n(00:19:05):\nI think when Jensen talks about luck, you've got to get to near death to get yourself to do that. That's true. It's hard to build that if everything's going great. And I would say the CEOs who had an easy run of it for their, let's say, they just launched a product that's an instant hit, it's very hard for them to develop that muscle compared to the ones that built a company like Jensen where he gutted it out for multiple decades before they had big success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:36):\nClearly, it's very difficult and painful to be a CEO, to be a founder. In spite of that so many people want to start companies. So many people dream of having their own company. Who is not right to start a company? What advice do you share with folks that are thinking about starting a company that may not understand just what they're about to get into?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:19:57):\nYeah, so it's funny. So there's a couple of things. John Reed, who was the CEO of Citigroup when I started as CEO, said to me something I never forget. He said, \"Ben, the only reason to start a company is because you have an irrational desire to do so, because it's not worth the money.\" And I was like, \"Wow, he doesn't even quantify how much money and this guy's running Citigroup.\" So he is a very numbers, banking guy and he didn't quantify it. And I remember when we sold LoudCloud for $1.6 billion, I remember thinking, \"Wow, that wasn't worth the money whatsoever.\"\n\n(00:20:37):\nSo I think if you're doing it for the money, that's a very bad reason and it will be extremely difficult to get you an outcome. You really have to have an irrational desire to do something larger than yourself to improve the world in some way that somehow that is your purpose. And if you don't feel that, then you'll never get through it. It's just too many bad things happen along the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:08):\nSo then how do you think of founders that are looking around for ideas that brainstorm, that look for market opportunities versus come from, \"I have this a mission, I've got to do this thing in the world.\"\n\nBen Horowitz (00:21:19):\nMy business partner Mark always talks about that. So if you have a product that forces you to build a company, that is a great case of it, right? Okay, you built something and the world wants it and you need a company to deliver it, you know, already have the right product. And so that's very helpful.\n\n(00:21:37):\nI think there are cases of people, I think Hewlett-Packard was built that way, that they're like, \"Okay, we've got to build technology,\" it was that abstract, \"We've got built in technology for the world.\" And then they started with, \"Well, what do you need?\" They called it the next bench thing. What does the engineer sitting next to me need? The next engineer on the bench? So how they define the first set of products.\n\n(00:22:03):\nSo it can work the other way, but I think the thing that is in common is it's just a very abstract idea that you have to build something that's going to be important that people are going to like working there, people are going to benefit from the products. You have to have some weird concept other than, \"Oh, this is going to be successful and I'm going to make a lot of money.\" I think way better off taking Zuck's offer at Meta and just doing that. That's a way better deal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:37):\nAlong these lines, something else Shaka suggested I ask you about, apparently there's a story where the CEO of Databricks asked you for $200,000 in the early days and you said no. And it's not because you didn't want to invest and it was more about helping them think bigger. What happened there?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:22:55):\nSo there were six of them, they were six HD student, well, and Jan Stoicka (phonetic) who was their professor. And Jan was this super genius, but when I met with them, they were like, \"We need to raise $200,000.\" And I knew at the time that what they had was this thing called Spark and the competitor was something called Hadoop. And Hadoop had very well-funded companies already running towards it and Spark was open source, so the clock was ticking.\n\n(00:23:39):\nAnd I think they didn't quite know what they had. And then there's also a thing always, although I wouldn't say Jan has this mentality, but professors in general it's a pretty big win if you start a company and you make $50 million. You're a hero on campus. That's a pretty cool thing to have done. And so I'm always a little nervous about a company that comes out of academia thinking too small anyway.\n\n(00:24:09):\nAnd so I said, \"Look, I'm not going to write you a check for $200,000. I'll write you a check for $10 million because this company, you need to build a company. You need to really go for it if you're going to do this, otherwise you guys should stay in school.\" And they were all graduating right then, so that was kind of that. And Ali actually was VP of engineering at the time, and it was a while before I made him CEO and that was very good luck on my part because I had no idea that they had a guide that good inside the company who could become CEO when I invested. That was just, God smiled on me and gave me that one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):\nSo speaking of Ali, I actually asked him what to ask you about, and he immediately shared this story. I don't know if you remember this. In your first one-on-one with him, after you-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):\nI don't know if you remember this. In your first one-on-one with him, after you made him CEO, he was struggling with a bunch of low performers because he was coming in to lead the company and he was trying to turn things around, trying to coach them, trying to level them up. And your advice to him was quote, \"You don't make people great. You find people that make you great, that make the company great, that you learned from, not the other way around.\" And there's something that he called managerial leverage. What is that all about? What's the lesson there?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:25:27):\nOh yeah, yeah. So understand, he had just become CEO. So I was teaching him, he had been VP of Engineering and CEO is different. And I'll get into why and what I mean by leverage.\n\n(00:25:40):\nSo I actually wrote a post about this with a little Wang quote where I think the quote was, \"The truth is hard to swallow and hard to say too but I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school.\" And that was always my feeling about this particular idea was, look, if you're VP of engineering, you can develop people. You can teach them to be better engineers. You can teach them, be better engineering managers. That's very doable.\n\n(00:26:08):\nBut if you're a CEO, what do you know about being CFO? Like what do you know about being VP, HR? What do you know about any of these jobs except maybe VP of engineering?\n\n(00:26:22):\nAnd so the idea that you're going to take somebody who isn't world-class at marketing and make and you them world class and you don't know anything about marketing, is a dumb idea. It just doesn't work.\n\n(00:26:34):\nAnd then the company can't afford for you to be spending time on that because they need you to make very high quality, fast decisions. They need you to set the direction for the company and they need you to have a world-class team. And so it's a very hard lesson if you've been VP of engineering because if you're a good VP of engineering, you do develop your people.\n\n(00:26:55):\nBut as a CEO, it's not like you don't do any of it, but it is very, very small compared to it. So I like to make things just very stark. So you get what I'm saying? I don't like to hedge it.\n\n(00:27:08):\nAnd then managerial leverage means it is very simple. It's okay. If I have the ideas about what your department should do next. If I am kind of pushing you to kind of move your organization forward, then that's no leverage. What's leverage is if you're telling me what you should do and how you can push the company forward, that's leverage, then I'm getting more than I'd have if you weren't there otherwise I could just manage a team.\n\n(00:27:39):\nAnd that's the point when you feel like you're not getting leverage. When you got to go say, \"Hey, why aren't we doing this? Why aren't we doing that?\" That's when you got to make a change. And by the way, he's unbelievable at that, as good as anybody I've seen as a guy who's not callous as a CEO. He really cares about the people who work for him. He really wants him to have great careers and all that, but he does not hesitate. If he's losing leverage, he'll make a move.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:06):\nKind of going back to the origin story of A-Sixteen-Z something you guys were really big on was helping founders stay COs become great COs, not replace them with professional COs.\n\n(00:28:16):\nI want to flip this question on you. When does it actually make sense to replace CO? When are people not going to make great COs?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:28:26):\nThere's a very consistent thing that happens, which is when somebody doesn't make it and it kind of starts with confidence is the way I would put it.\n\n(00:28:35):\nSo if you invent a product, you kind of recruit a team so forth, all of a sudden you're CEO, but you don't run a big organization, you don't know how to do that. Most founders are like that. And so, if you don't know what you're doing, you're going to make mistakes and they all make a lot of mistakes. And then when you make those mistakes, they're very expensive. They could cost you to do a down round or they could cost you to lose a company or they could cost you a customer or you scrub the product. They're very high impact and not just on you, but everybody who you talked into joining you. And so that kind of motion can really cause you to lose confidence.\n\n(00:29:20):\nAnd then if you lose confidence, what happens is you hesitate on the next decision. And as we talked about, hesitation is very dangerous because one, it locks up the company, but even worse what happens is if you have senior people working for you, they get very nervous and they feel like they need to jump into that void and make the decision for you. And that's when it gets political, very political, because people are vying for power inside your little screwed up company.\n\n(00:29:57):\nAnd so now you've got a political dysfunctional organization and that's generally where, okay, the founder probably can't run this thing anymore. That's how it happens.\n\n(00:30:11):\nSo most of what we do as a firm is to try to help people with that confidence problem and there's a whole series of ideas that we have around that, but you kind of have to somehow climb the confidence and the competency curve together. It's very hard to do and particularly if you're an engineer and you're used to getting things right or if you've been a straight A student or something like that, it's very disconcerting. Sometimes it's better to have CEOs who are like C minus students.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):\nWhy is that?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:30:45):\nYeah, a little facetious. Well, it's just good to be used to failing. So I think I wrote this, but the median on the CEO kind of test is like 18. It's not like 90. And so you got to be comfortable getting a lot of D minuses because the D minus is fine, as long as you don't get the F, as long as you don't run out of cash, as long as you don't lose all thing. Okay, you got through it, keep going. And match, that's a lot of the thing that we try to do CEOs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:20):\nYeah, it comes back to your core, I don't know, message through your first book is just how much you'll fail and how much you'll struggle and how much paid you'll go through as CO.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:31:29):\nYeah, yeah, and I mean a lot of why I wrote that book was just to nanalyze it. I think what happens is, particularly when I wrote it, and I think it's come back and been true now, is the way the narrative gets written on all these successes is like, \"Ph, they came up with a genius idea and then they built this company and they hired all these smart people and it was all great.\" But that's not at all how it happens and I've spent enough time with everybody from Mark Zuckerberg to Sam Altman and so forth, that they all go through that same thing that who has your struggling company go through? You screw a lot of things up and they have massive consequences, but you have to maintain your confidence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):\nActually, I was at a storytelling event last night and I was chatting with someone that I ran into there and told her I was chatting with you today, and she said how meaningful your first book was to her as a founder. Exactly as you said, normalizing that it's very hard and painful and this is just the way it is.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:32:36):\nAnd the feeling, look, if you think about organizational design or goals and objectives or OKRs or whatever management technique, you need a basic eighth grade education to do any of that stuff. It is not that complicated. The difficult part is the feeling that you have when you have to do it is very, the hard thing of matter a reorg is you're redistributing power, so you're going to have people really fricking mad at you because somebody's losing power if you do it correctly. And that person may be a really good employee. Dealing with that is the hard thing. Knowing how the organization should work to make communication better, it's not that complex.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:18):\nYeah, I think about I was at Airbnb for a long time and just thinking of Brian, who I don't know even know if he had a job before Airbnb now.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:33:25):\nOh yeah. I spent a lot of time with Brian and after COVID, it all kind of clicked for him and then he did that he and that good talk on founder mode and so forth. But the reason that was so articulate is he had screwed every one of those things up and he hired LT and all this stuff, and these are very senior people and he wanted to defer to them, but you can't defer as the CEO because you know what Airbnb should be doing. He may know what finance should do, but you know what Airbnb should do and this kind of thing. And then it gets really wild when you can't defer decisions as the CEO. You got to understand what people are saying and go, \"Now we're going to do this.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:13):\nAnd this again comes back to the point of you have to go through the struggle and pain and failure to learn those lessons.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:34:18):\nYeah, no. They're really hard to learn without doing and often without paying the consequence. Even I, like I make mistakes. I was having conversation with Ali the other day and I was like, he's like, \"How's it going Ben?\" And I was like, \"Well, I'm finally dealing with something that I had put off for a very long time.\" And he said, \"Why'd you put it off?\" I said, \"Because things were going too good. I didn't have to deal with it. \"And he was like, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"I know that.\" I'd say Ali is one of the, if not the kind of best private company CEO out there, and he's making a mistake and I'm making a mistakes. So, it is just tough.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:01):\nYou said that one of maybe the main reason founders fail the CEOs is they lose confidence, and you had some ideas that you guys have to help founders work through that. Are there a couple you can share how you help?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:35:12):\nYeah. So we do a lot of things on that. So the kind of design of the firm is about confidence. So the first thing is, well, what would give you? Well if you can get stuff done. So what if I could give you a network that's as good as Bob Iger's network, day one, the day you stepped into the job.\n\n(00:35:31):\nAnd so we have 600 people at the firm and why is that? Well, most of them are building that network for you, so you can call any CEO or anybody in Washington or any executive or that kind of thing and get them on the phone and they'll talk to you and you can kind of deal with that thing. And then that just makes you feel like a CEO.\n\n(00:35:55):\nAnd then we have a lot of people in the firm like myself, who you can talk to on a CEO to CEO basis, as opposed to an investor to CEO, and just kind of feel that. Early in the firm days, we used to do this thing. I think I'm going to bring back in some form this thing called the CEO barbecue. And it was like a lot of people have these events where they bring in speakers and this and that and the other. And I always felt like those were one, they were too many days. And then sometimes what they said wasn't really applicable and that kind of thing.\n\n(00:36:32):\nSo I said, \"Why don't we just have a barbecue?\" I would barbecue. We get everybody in my backyard because was 500 people at the peak, which is why at the stuff I couldn't cook that much, that kind of stuff. And then we'd have Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg and Kanye West, and so you're a CEO in there with portfolio. You're like, \"Wow, I must be important. I'm here with all these guys\" and we're just hanging out having a drink, eating barbecue.\n\n(00:37:04):\nAnd so then when I go back to my company, I feel like I am somebody. And okay, I might not be perfect at all this, but I am really a CEO. I was at the CEO barbecue, for crying out loud and that kind of thing. But the whole idea was always like, \"Okay, do you feel like you can do it?\" Because that's half the battle?\n\n(00:37:29):\nAnd look, having been in and every CEO has been in a position where they feel like, \"Well, maybe I shouldn't be the one running this thing. Maybe it's just too big for me.\" And that's a bad, you don't want to go there. And because as we've said, founders can get to the next product and that's something that almost no professional CEO is able to do. There've been rare cases, but very rare.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:57):\nSo clearly you've worked with a lot of companies, a lot of founders. Let me kind of zoom out a little bit and ask you this question.\n\n(00:38:03):\nWhat's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building companies that goes against common startup wisdom?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:38:09):\nWell, the common startup wisdom keeps changing. One of the early ones that was wrong, and Brian articulated it, and then now I think a little bit of what people have gone to is also wrong.\n\n(00:38:25):\nSo the first idea that was wrong was like, okay, build a team of senior executives as soon as you get product market fit as fast as possible and they can scale the thing. And I think that you got to build that team slowly and deliberately, kind of pace to your ability to integrate and then manage them. Because if you bring in a bunch of senior people and you don't know really how they match to your company or how that function works or so forth, then you're going to start deferring. And once you start deferring, it's going to get out of control very fast because they're going to build empires, they're going to get political, they're going to do all that kind of thing.\n\n(00:39:08):\nSo that was bad advice. You kind of have to do it in a measured way. I think that founder mode, I think a lot of people have taken to never hire anybody with experience. And that's also bad advice in that, look, somebody who knows how to do something can really accelerate your thing. So very early on, one of the founders, great founder Arsalan at Databricks was running sales. And I'm like, \"Oli, you're going to have to hire somebody who knows sales because Arsalan's, PhD in computer science. I like that, but that's probably not where you're going to have to start if you're going to catch these guys before they take Spark and use it against you.\"\n\n(00:39:53):\nAnd I sat down with Arsalan and I explained why. I said, \"Look, a lot of what sales, there's a lot of knowledge in how to build a worldwide sales organization; maybe knowledge of customers, territories, territory splitting, rep profiles. There's just a litany of stuff that you really can only learn by doing trial and error and you don't know anything. And so you're phenomenal. Let's get you. And still, he's a very senior executive in the company now, but we need somebody who knows that. And the idea that there are companies that go, \" Okay, we're just not going to hire that in founder mode.\" That's also a mistake. So there's a lot of, it's more subtle than you think, and it's more complex than you think. And so you kind of have to get all the way to the truth. And these little snippets of advice that he sees good, because they watch some fucking podcasts, are all fucking stupid.\n\n(00:40:51):\nThere's a lot of depth to these things. You have to know the answer to the next question, the next question and the next question, and it does drive me crazy. One of the funnier things that happened along these lines, just to show you how little. You know as an investor, about what it means to be CEO.\n\n(00:41:11):\nWe were at a board dinner. One of the CEOs says to me, he goes, or one of our CEO says, \"Hey Ben, that thing you told me a while ago about don't be CEO at home.\" He said, \"I was doing that and I stopped and it really helped me.\"\n\n(00:41:28):\nAnd then the other kind of VC said, \" Yeah. You got to unplug some time.\" And I said, I was like, \"What the fuck are you talking about? He's CEO. He's not unplugging. He's getting shit all the fucking time. He's got to deal with that. That was not what I meant. I was like, you can't go home and boss your family around. That's what I meant.\"\n\n(00:41:48):\nYou hear something from somebody who, but if you haven't done it, you don't even know what that means. And so then you then trying to transfer the advice to the next guy, that's not going to work. So anyway, but he was very innocent. I just don't want to kind of speak bad of him, but that's how it sounds, right? But that's not what it is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):\nThat's an amazing story. So the advice partly here, is just don't believe everything you see on Twitter and little sound bites of advice.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:42:18):\nI think actual CEOs know it. And that's kind of how people in my profession going to get a bad wrap. Because giving advice, that's not something that you know but something that you heard, is very dangerous, I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:31):\nSo speaking of advice that you've shared that might be out of date now, you are famous for writing one of the most popular pieces of literature for product managers. There's a lot of PMs that listen to this podcast called Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager. And if you actually go to that post today at the top you say, \"This document was written 15 years ago and it's probably not relevant today for PMs. I present this nearly as an example of a useful training document.\"\n\n(00:42:56):\nStill people link to it. I actually just link to it as just like this is something every PM needs to read. What is it that you think people should maybe not take away from it, and what do you think people still should take away from that piece?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:43:07):\nYeah, so the reason I wrote it when I wrote it was that I had a lot of product managers. And one thing about product management is it's a job that's completely different at every company and there is no training for it. So everybody kind of figures it out as they go. And depending on what's being emphasized, they'll get wrapped around the axle on if it's an enterprise company, well pitching to customers or I need to be really good with the press, or I need to be really good at writing the product requirements document or that kind of thing.\n\n(00:43:49):\nAnd those are all these tasks, but none of those were the job and what I was trying to get out in Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager was, the job is fundamentally a leadership job and it's a tricky leadership job because nobody is actually reporting to you.\n\n(00:44:14):\nSo it's like this influence, how do I get people to do what I want even though I'm not paying them. I can't fire them. I can't promote them, and so forth, which is kind of the essence of real leadership because if you start to rely on promotion and firing and so forth for authority, then you're never going to be good at being CEO or anything.\n\n(00:44:38):\nSo I wanted them to get into the mindset of, \"Okay, your actual job is to get a product into market that customers love that's better than anything that anybody else in the world puts in market. That's your job.\" And so to accomplish that job, you need engineering to understand you with clarity. You need to understand engineering with clarity. You need to have a really good view of the market and the competitors and the technology and so forth and you need to put that all together and deliver the thing.\n\n(00:45:17):\nAnd all the other things are tasks that you may or may not need to do. I don't know if you need to do them, but the thing is, you have to be the leader. You've got to get the thing done. And so what I think it's still good on is that the mindset, be the leader, I think the details of any kind of thing that was kind of task specific was really for my group a Netscape in 1996, whenever the hell I wrote it.\n\n(00:45:56):\nSo as a kind of document I wrote out of frustration. But I am glad that the people still like it, and I think leadership in general is undervalued, underestimated. It's the most powerful thing. And most of the great companies, Jensen is a great example. What a phenomenal leader he is not just of Nvidia, but of the whole industry. And he doesn't have authority over the industry, but he drives it forth and that's why the Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager is so important because that thing, if you learn how to do it, that's the thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:39):\nI didn't realize you wrote that initially as just an internal document and then you made a-\n\nBen Horowitz (00:46:44):\nIt was kind of before blogging took off, so it is just an internal thing and I published it later. I was just getting so mad. And by the way, my product management team at the time was very good, very talented people. They just were not getting that concept. So like David Wyden said, Coastal Ventures, Raghu Raghuram, who wanted on to be CEO of VMware, the team was like that team, but they were driving me crazy. And so I was like, \"I can't yell at people anymore. I have to explain to myself.\" And so it's a good thing if you find yourself yelling at people, you probably haven't explained what you want, was the other big takeaway from that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:30):\nDid you ever think that piece would be so long-lasting? And so, I don't know, popular?\n\nBen Horowitz (00:47:34):\nI didn't even know. I thought it was kind of like aggressive when I wrote it. You could tell I was mad. I called a Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager. It's like bad dog, bad, bad, bad product manager. That was kind of the emotion I had. So, it is kind shocking some of the things that you write.\n\n(00:47:54):\nI would say that that's and kind of creative, and you probably know this. The idea is that you have the things that you write in five minutes end up being much better than things you write in five weeks. And I find in talking to musicians or writers or everybody has that same experience. The thing that you've already synthesized so much that you just have to write it out, that's the best stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:21):\nThere's something that you mentioned there in your answer about the PM being the leader. There's always this kind of sense that the PM is not the mini CEO. How dare you call yourself that. I actually think that's exactly what the PM is. They're basically the closest to the CO. Their kind job is to think like the CEO within the team.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:48:39):\nPeople get mad because everybody, this is the whole challenge of management in general. People get jealous over stewardship. But from the perspective of the PM, it doesn't matter if you write a good spec or you have a good interview or you do this or do that. What matters is that the product wrench. And you have to get all the way to there and work backwards from that and you can't do that without leadership because it is about, okay, we want to build that. And you're not necessarily the person who comes up with every idea or this or that, or that. You're just the keeper of the vision.\n\n(00:49:22):\nAnd that's true for CEOs too. You don't want every idea in a company coming from the CEO. I think it's a misunderstanding of what a CEO is, is why people don't like that. They don't know what a CEO is. But a CEO isn't the one who has every idea it gives, every order does every. That's not the way it works.\n\n(00:49:40):\nThe way it works is there's somebody who's got to consolidate, get all the good ideas, prioritize them, decide which good ideas we're going to do, and then get everybody on the same page, so that they have very high fidelity understanding of what that is. And so that it is a CEO, kind of function. Now, it doesn't mean I'm better than you, it just means that...\n\nBen Horowitz (00:50:00):\n... kind of function. Now, it doesn't mean like I'm better than you. It just means that that's what I'm doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:05):\nThis episode is brought to you by Miro. Every day, new headlines are scaring us about all the ways that AI is coming for our jobs, creating a lot of anxiety and fear. But a recent survey for Miro tells a different story. 76% of people believe that AI can benefit their role, but over 50% of people struggle to know when to use it. Enter Miro's Innovation Workspace, an intelligent platform that brings people and AI together in a shared space to get great work done. Miro has been empowering teams to transform bold ideas into the next big thing for over a decade. Today, they're at the forefront of bringing products to market even faster by unleashing the combined power of AI and human potential.\n\n(00:50:44):\nGuests of this podcast often share Miro templates. I use it all the time to brainstorm ideas with my team. Teams especially can work with Miro AI to turn to unstructured data, like sticky notes or screenshots into usable diagrams, product briefs, data tables, and prototypes in minutes. You don't have to be an AI master or to toggle yet another tool. The work you're already doing in Miro's Canvas is the prompt. Help your teams get great work done with Miro. Check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.\n\n(00:51:16):\nLet's talk about AI. I'm very proud of us. It's been almost an hour. We haven't even mentioned AI. I think that's a record. Okay, so I asked Adam Neumann, WeWork founder, now Flow founder, someone you work closely with now what to ask you about. And he said he has some really interesting insights about how AI is impacting hiring.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:51:35):\nAdam is probably the single most controversial investment that we ever made. We got called everything from stupid to sexist to racist to this and that for literally just funding that. And I think it's going to end up being one of the best investments we ever made. He's doing a phenomenal job there. There's an important principle in that which we do as a firm, which I think is not widely done, but I would love it if people copied it, which is, and it's something I learned somewhat from Shaka, which is you don't judge a person by the worst thing that ever happened to them. We've all had bad things happen to us. We've all made bad decisions. Most of them, they don't make a miniseries about.\n\n(00:52:35):\nAnd so to judge them on that, you want to judge people on what they do well, not what they screwed up, because that's where you see the talent. If you look at what Adam did well, it's truly spectacular. Everybody knows WeWork. Name a more important commercial real estate brand than WeWork. You can't. And so what an accomplishment. And there were so many things that went into that and so many things he did right.\n\n(00:53:10):\nAnd then if you kind of look at really unravel the things that went wrong, most of it was like a combination of inexperience and nobody around him that would tell him the truth. And, yeah, maybe he wasn't good at listening to the truth either at the time, but to throw away a guy on that, which is by the way, the world was so mad at us for not throwing him away, for believing in him, is just that it's a big mistake. And I credit Mark because Mark is the one who called him up originally, and just said, \"Hey, Adam, what are you doing?\" Because we watched what you did at WeWork and we thought it was pretty impressive.\n\n(00:53:54):\nAnd so I think that that's probably the biggest secret there. Judge Al Davis once said, \"Coach players on what they can do.\" And I think that's very true. Judge people on what they can do, coach people on what they can do, help them take their strengths and use them as opposed to over focus on their weaknesses and just hand wringing about the one fucking thing they don't know how to do. Because look, everybody's uneven.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:31):\nWhat you're describing, essentially, this is the job of an investor, is to find an underappreciated asset and invest or before something people don't see.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:54:42):\nVenture capital is really about investing in people. You have ideas as an investor, but what you really are ultimately betting on is the entrepreneur and the entrepreneur's idea because the initial idea isn't where they end up usually. It changes a lot with everybody we invest in. So you kind of have to make the judgment on the person. And how you do that is really, really important. And one of the things we emphasize inside the firm is, look, we're investing in strength, not lack of weakness. I want to know how good, are they world-class? Do they have a world-class strength? And can that beat anybody? And look, everybody's flawed. And so let's help them deal with the flaws and surround them with people who can handle that and put the right person on the board who can talk to them.\n\n(00:55:43):\nYou know Mark's on the board, I go to all his board meetings because I'm the one who's good at killing a guy who's that confident when he's like, \"Okay, that's not your best idea.\" That's good role for me. But that's how you deal with that. You don't throw them away and go, \"Oh, okay, we don't want to be called names. So we're not going to invest in Adam Neumann after we built WeWork. That's crazy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:08):\nThat's also why you guys invested in Cluely, I imagine similar.\n\nBen Horowitz (00:56:10):\nYeah, yeah, no, that's right. I mean, look, if you look at what those guys did, that was some high level marketing genius too, and that's really something. Plus the product is awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:23):\nI'm going to bring us back to AI. Something that a lot of people are talking about right now while we're recording this is this potential huge bubble we're in with AI. Sam Altman said, \"We're in a big bubble,\" which is, that's saying a lot. I'm curious just how you that it-\n\nBen Horowitz (00:56:36):\nWhat is it saying? First of all, I should qualify this by saying I am an investor and Sam's a CEO. So CEOs have to have much more purpose when they talk. Investors just have to be entertained. So you got to give Sam credit for what is it in his interest to say it? Well, if it's a bubble, then the one thing you should invest in is him and not all these guys chasing after him.\n\n(00:57:09):\nI would say that's very smart. And then the other thing that's smart about it is there's nothing that you can say to the press that will make them love you more than saying, \"All investors and entrepreneurs chasing this are idiots.\" They love them. The press are generally haters, and so it's just red meat for the haters, which was also super clever. So I think whether even he believes that or not, that was a super smart thing to say. So I'll just put it there. Whereas what I'm going to say won't be as smart, but it will...\n\n(00:57:45):\nI don't really have an ax to grind here. I mean, I could have an ax to grind and say, \"Okay, let's get all the other investors out.\" I'll say, \"It's a massive bubble.\" But what I would say about that is, so the first thing, the one thing about bubbles is anytime everybody thinks it's a bubble, it's not a bubble because in order for it to bubble, you need capitulation. In that you need everybody to believe it's not a bubble, because then the prices really go out of control. But as long as there's people who think it's a bubble, then it's hard for that to happen. And it's funny, I had this debate in The Economist, I think with Steve Blank in like 2011 or '12 when everybody thought it was a tech bubble, if you can imagine that, which it absolutely was not. But because there were 1,400 articles saying that we were in a tech bubble, and I mean where prices were then compared to where they are now.\n\n(00:58:52):\nBut I knew because everybody was saying it was a bubble, it wasn't a bubble. I knew that. The prices were higher, but the reason the prices were higher was we're getting to a global market. AI prices are higher than prior prices, but if you look at the revenue growth and numbers, we had not seen anything like it. Sam's product worked so amazingly, we'd never seen that before. Not even Google, not anybody. And so that's real.\n\n(00:59:23):\nAnd we have companies that went from zero to 800 million in a year and that kind of thing. I would say there's a basis for the prices going up, first of all. I think the thing that's right about what Sam is saying is the landscape is early, really early. The technology is very immature. As amazingly as it works, there's a long way to go to improve it. So it's very possible when you have that much technological change, that the positions that these companies have achieved with their high revenue isn't sustainable, and that there'll be a competitive change that either lowers prices or a new number one emerges or that kind of thing.\n\n(01:00:18):\nYeah, that's possible. But I wouldn't characterize that as being a financial bubble in that if you go back to the great dot-com bubble that everybody is always waiting for it to happen again, which I was CEO during. The thing that happened there was very different, which is it was the internet and every smart investor knew that the internet was a big deal. How could you not fucking know that the internet was, of course it's a big deal. But if you go back to 1996, at Netscape, we had 90% browser share and we had 50 million users. So there were 55 million people on the internet in total, and half of those were on dial-up.\n\n(01:01:03):\nAnd then to build a product like Evite, the greeting card company, had 300 engineers. That's how hard it was to build this stuff. And so the math didn't work, and the math didn't work on any of those ideas, but the investors kept pouring money in. And then eventually everybody went bankrupt because there was no revenue coming in. And when they figured that out, then nobody would invest in anything. And of course then everybody realized, well, the internet was actually real and Paul Krugman didn't know what he's talking about, and like it was going to be a big thing. And then Facebook and Google and all these things emerged.\n\n(01:01:44):\nBut the thing that made it a bubble was the unit economics didn't work, the businesses didn't work. These businesses are all working, and they're being priced appropriately for how they're growing. So that's not in effect. The thing that you could say is, \"They're not going to keep growing like that,\" and so forth. And I'm not sure about that. The products, like I said, are working so much better than any technology product that we've ever built has worked. It's just mind-blowing how good this stuff is. And so, I don't know, if I had to bet, I would bet not a bubble. I think there'll be some dislocation. I think always in venture capital, if you've got a run like this, then the great company and the crap company both get funded. But that's just venture capital. That's not a bubble.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:44):\nFour founders starting companies these days. When you look into the future of the AI industry, say in five, 10 years, how do you think things will play out slash where do you think the biggest opportunities remain? Where are you guys looking to invest most?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:02:57):\nIn infrastructure. I think that there is obviously a real estate power cooling play. I think that's a little outside of hardcore technology investing that we do. But there's another layer which is take a given open source model, who can run it the cheapest with the lowest latency? And that's going to be extremely valuable, whoever has that. And Google has been historically very good at that and so forth, and Sam is really trying to build that now with Stargate. And so I think that's going to be a very important layer of value. I think that on the foundation model side, you have to be very selective as an investor. So in order to compete in foundational model world, our basic rule of thumb is you have to be able to, without much product progress, raise at least $ 2 billion because that's basically what it's going to cost you to train something that gets you competitive enough to make money.\n\n(01:04:08):\nAnd there are just very few founders like that. So Ilya is one of those. Mary's one of those, Fei-Fei is one of those, but that's the kind of class of person you need. And there's whatever. There's certainly less than 10 of those in the world. And so that's kind of an important area, but a small area. And then I think the application layer is going to be very, very interesting. And I think that if you look at Sam, he's making most of his money off ChatGPT, almost all his money off ChatGPT now. And Chat GPT, like it or not, it's got a real moat. It's very hard to knock it off. It's perched.\n\n(01:04:57):\nEverybody's taking a shot at it, people, great distribution like Google and Elon and Zuckerberg and everybody. And that thing just keeps going like it is. So I think the applications are both more complex and kind of stickier than people thought they were originally. The thing that people got very wrong is this whole thin wrapper around GPT, that's really wrong. In fact, here's how wrong it is. Back in the '80s, that same phrase was used, but it was thin wrapper around an RDBMS-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:38):\nDatabase.\n\nBen Horowitz (01:05:39):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. So it meant companies like Salesforce were basically just a thin wrapper. And I think that that's kind of the mistake people made. So we're at this company Cursor, and if you look under the covers in Cursor, they've built 14 different models to really understand how a developer works, a high-end, a real developer. Those models have tons and tons of interactions with how people talk to their friend Cursor about how they should design their programming so forth. And that's real, that's not just a thin layer on a foundation model. And I think there are many, many applications like that. And so I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity at the application layer. There's going to be some opportunity at the foundation model, and of course you can invest in Sam, you can invest in Anthropic and so forth as well.\n\n(01:06:43):\nBut there will probably be a very small number of companies at that set, and then a almost unlimited number of companies at the application layer. And then as the technology advances, we'll of course see more things we can body to AI. I mean already autonomous cars are working really well now after a long, long, long, long time. Since I think Sebastian won the challenge in 2006 when he drove the self-driving car across the country. And here we are 20 years later and now they're deployed. So that was a long time. Robots I think is a harder problem than self-driving cars. So we'll see how that goes. But, yeah, there's certainly a lot in that world as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:34):\nWow, okay. There's a lot to this answer. No, that was exactly what I was looking for. The Cursor example, it's something that comes up a lot on this podcast, in the application layer specifically. The thought that the way to win in this space and to build a moat is, as you said, \"Build your own model slash have proprietary data that you build through people using your product.\" Thoughts on that?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:07:58):\nYeah, I mean, I think that ends up just being what's required. So it turns out that the universe is long-tailed, is fat-tailed, and humans are very fat-tailed in terms of human behavior, human conversation and so forth. So to get to the real meaning of it and to get to the kind of essence of the problem, in any domain turns out to be, I think, more complex than we thought. And so the early things and people were running around saying, \"Okay, there's going to be one big brain to rule them all on these kinds of things.\" That's kind of not played out yet.\n\n(01:08:41):\nAnd in fact, if you look underneath the covers, you have LLMs, which have generalized pretty in fascinating ways, but they've kind of also asymptoted in that we have run out of data for the most part. And so if you look at the GPT-5 LLM compared to the GPT-4.1 and how much more it costs to train and so forth, it's definitely not going linear anymore.\n\n(01:09:12):\nOn the other hand, the reinforcement learning side has been linear, but it doesn't generalize. So if you build a great programming model, it may be an idiot at math. And so that I think is just very different than what people would've said three years ago. And I think that there's not something that's both scaling and generalizing yet, and maybe we'll get there, but that certainly opens the door to something that's more user-friendly, that's more effective in any number of domains than just the basic foundation model infrastructure. Now those models are incredibly important, and I think OpenAI is probably 80% of the revenue in AI are something like that now. It's massive, and so that foundation model is really, really important. And then the basic consumer app is really, really important.\n\n(01:10:12):\nThat just answers whatever the hell you want to know. Those things are very, very real. But I do think particularly, and then if you get into enterprise stuff and then it's no longer internet data, it's their data that becomes very different. Databricks is having a lot of success there because, okay, well, once you're inside a company, guess what? You care about access control. That's hard with an AI world. It gets trained on some stuff. How does it know who has access to that information and who doesn't, and so forth. You have semantic issues. So if you look at an enterprise, find 10 enterprises, they all have a different definition of what a customer means. You would think customer is a basic thing. Well, is it a department at AT&T? Is it AT&T? Is it a person at AT&T? What the hell is the customer? And it turns out to be very, very meaningful, particularly if you're trying to figure out important things like churn and this and that and third.\n\n(01:11:19):\nSo that kind of stuff matters. So I would just say the problem space is a lot bigger than you can just attack with a basic foundation model currently. Maybe that will change, and if that changes, then certain prices will have, in retrospect, look way inflated and others will look too low. But that is TBD.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:48):\nSo a big takeaway from this is that there's still tons of opportunity for founders to start companies building AI products.\n\nBen Horowitz (01:11:55):\nI think so. Everything that we couldn't solve with software we can solve now, almost. So it's a really big world. And it's funny because we're investors in Waymo, and one of the things when you get into what took so long to make Waymo so safe like they are now, it wasn't the things that everybody reported on the podcast. There wasn't sleet and heavy rain, it was people. It was like the human who was driving 75 in the 25 zone. It was very hard for the AI to anticipate because it was rare but important. And the number of rare, important crazy shit that humans do is very high. And I think that that goes for all of AI. So to make things work really well, you have to understand this very kind of fat tail of human behavior.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:52):\nAlong this AI thread, something that is really important to you, clearly something you talk a lot about is the US being successful in AI, in leading the world in AI. Why is this so important? Why is something you spend a lot of time on?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:13:06):\nIt starts with, I think, my view of the US and its role in the world. My personal view is it's very, very, very important. Not for society to be completely fair because it's not going to be completely fair or completely equal because we've never had one that's been completely equal. But it's important that everybody have a chance at life, and particularly both culturally, but also just you can't advance the world if you can't tap into all of your resources. And so if you kind of take away motivation and these kinds of things, you get into trouble. And if you look at the kind of every country today, and this is by the way, so you want the right amount of decentralized power. You don't want it to be completely concentrated, concentrated power makes it very, very difficult for everybody to have a chance. This is the big lesson of communism over the last hundred years is it turned out right. And we still have politicians selling it this way today, it's like, \"Oh, it's power to the people.\"\n\n(01:14:23):\nNo, no, no. It's power to you because you're removing all power from the private sector and installing it into the government, and then you're putting yourself in charge of the government. And so I become extremely powerful. And this is why it didn't matter if it was Mao or Pol Pot or Ceausescu or Stalin, everybody died because when you give anybody that much power, nobody has a chance. There is no incentive, there's no carrot, there's only stick. And so you use that stick, and that's just the nature. It's a system's problem. It's not a person problem. It's not Stalin was evil, Ceausescu is evil. It was that system is evil. And-\n\nBen Horowitz (01:15:00):\nIt was evil. It was like that system is evil. And that's the saying with fascism. Be it Hitler or Mussolini, it doesn't matter. That level of power is evil.\n\n(01:15:11):\nAnd the US does the best job. Systematically, it's the best system. It's got all kinds of issues, it's got problems. People always try to defeat it. But one of the things that if you look at the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution, the language is very important. It's, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident.\"\n\n(01:15:39):\nWhat does that mean? It means it's not my rule, it's not the president's rule, it's God's rule. And so those rules are above the President, and then you work in that context and that distributes the power, because you're under the law, not under the person. We see that now even with Europe, where the leaders are going, \"Well, I have a rule. It's you can't say certain things or I'll throw you in jail.\" And the kind of shield they hide behind as well, we have to keep the kids safe. But if you say something that I don't agree with and the kids hear it, they're not safe. So the kind of transited property of bullshit is going to override.\n\n(01:16:29):\nAnd so it's really important that we have at least one society. And as flawed as we are, as flawed as the US is, it's still the best. And you can see it by the number of new company creations, the number of new ideas that come out of here and so forth. It's really, really important that the US stays important and powerful in the world.\n\n(01:16:51):\nWe know from the last century, if you look at the last century, who were the countries that had economic power, military power, cultural power? They were the ones that industrialized, and the ones that industrialized first and best. And the ones that did became Communists, like Russia, China. They were slow on industrialization and they fell into this very fucking dangerous system.\n\n(01:17:19):\nLooking forward, that's going to happen again, but it's going to be AI. And so it is fundamentally important, not just to America, but to humanity, that America succeed at that. We don't have to be the one winner or this or that, but we do have to be in that tier.\n\n(01:17:41):\nAnd as I go around the world and travel, I can't tell you, everybody ... and then everybody was getting, by the way, very, very worried about us earlier. And they say, \"Look, we need you to succeed. Don't destroy the dollar. Don't fall behind in AI. Don't over-regulate it too early. Don't do these things, please, because we need you to win, because we're all counting on that.\"\n\n(01:18:08):\nAnd I think it's the most important work that we do. It's why we're so involved in policy and so forth. I think this is also going to be very, very true with crypto, which ends up being an incredibly important networking technology that complements AI. That work is, I would say, beyond for the money. Although we will end up making a lot of money with the right policies, so I don't want to seem totally philanthropic on this, but it's more important than that. It's certainly more important than us succeeding or anything like that, that the country succeed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:53):\nSpeaking of philanthropic and other passions of yours, something that I don't think most people know about you, and I think will give them another insight into how interesting you are, you run an organization called Paid in Full, which is incredibly cool. Talk about what that's about, why this is so important to you.\n\nBen Horowitz (01:19:14):\nOur ethos as a firm is kind of what I'd say is something from nothing. This is the greatness of entrepreneurship. You start with nothing and then you make something really important. That is also how Hip-hop started, where you have a bunch of kids who didn't even have instruments, and they created something out of nothing. And the people in that world always talk about that.\n\n(01:19:43):\nAnd one of the really unfortunate things that happens is, the people who invent the art form, and certainly in the case of Hip-hop, don't get anywhere near the kind of proportional benefit of their invention. And a lot of the guys, people have forgotten about, or are struggling to make ends meet, and so forth.\n\n(01:20:06):\nSo what we created was this thing called the Paid in Full Foundation, named after the Rakim, Eric B. song, which I did call Rakim and ask him for permission to use the name, so we didn't just take it. What we do is, we give essentially pensions to the old rappers, that enable them to kind of continue their work.\n\n(01:20:28):\nAnd then we have a big event go to paidinfullfoundation.org for tickets, which is amazing, where they get the award and they're celebrated by all their peers and so forth. And it's really phenomenal. Some of the awardees have been Rakim, Scarface from the Geto Boys, Roxanne Shante, Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee.\n\n(01:20:56):\nThis year we're honoring George Clinton for being sampled, Kool G Rap and Grand Puba, and also Jalil from Whodini. I can't even describe how high impact it is on these guys. I think Rakim was touring close to 200 nights a year, and he got his award, and came out with his first album in 15 years and is doing amazingly well. All of a sudden everybody's going, \"Oh yeah, that's the greatest rapper of all time.\" They're finally going back and remembering all the things he did. Roxanne Shante, nobody had mentioned her in years and years and years. I think six months after we gave her the award, the Grammys gave her a lifetime achievement award, which is amazing. It's super high impact. It's a great thing. As a Hip-hop fan, I say dream come true. It's my only guilt.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:51):\nWhat's the origin story of you and Hip-hop? I imagine many people look at you and wouldn't imagine these records behind you, Nas gifted you. You are so deep into the community, just how did this all begin?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:22:03):\nWell, I actually wrote a blog post on it called The Legend of the Blind MC, which I think would be, if you're really interested, it's worth reading. But it is kind of a story of me becoming a rapper, and how that occurred, and how it went, and so forth.\n\n(01:22:23):\nI always say the very short story is, I was in New York at the birth of Hip-hop and when it really became big, '84 through '88. It's just the most exciting thing to see a new art form pop out and the creativity and everything.\n\n(01:22:43):\nOnce music becomes mainstream, I would say it's very shaped by business. And in the early days, everybody's just coming out with whatever idea they have and so forth. The early days of rock and roll were like that. The early days of jazz were like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:02):\nI see now even more why you guys brought on Erik Torenberg. Beyond his many talents, he's also really big into rap himself.\n\nBen Horowitz (01:23:10):\nYeah, that's a good reminder. I need to make sure he gets to Paid in Full.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):\nBen, this was incredible. Is there anything else that you want to leave listeners with or share before we get to our very exciting, quick lightning round?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:23:28):\nYeah, I would just say, if you're a CEO listening to this, then know that how you feel about yourself is going to end up meaning as much as anything, and take your time on that. Self-evaluation is ... one of my favorite quotes is that when my old manager saw me, as select players know, \"From this day on, no credit will be given for predicting rain, only credit for building an ark.\"\n\n(01:24:05):\nAnd I think that's more true for CEOs than anybody. You have to build the ark. It doesn't matter if you predict you're going to fail, you've still failed. It gets you nothing. So what you have to do is figure your way out of it and spend all your time on that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:23):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:24:27):\nYes, sir.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:29):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people, not including your own books?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:24:35):\nSo two that I learned a lot from, one is The Weirdest People in the World, which it's a kind of big history book, but through an anthropological kind of cultural lens. It's really fascinating. It explains an awful lot about how society works and how little changes in the rules completely change the culture.\n\n(01:25:02):\nOne of the things that he basically endeavors to explain, why did the West get ahead on the rest of the world? It kind of comes down to a weird anomaly with the Catholic Church, where they enforced monogamous marriage. And it turns out that the natural state of humans is polygamy, but the problem with polygamy is, there's no cooperation among men, which is a problem. And as a result, and then everything is secret, so there's no sharing of knowledge, because it's all kept in the family, in what he calls kin-based culture.\n\n(01:25:44):\nIt leads to something called kin-based culture. And even recipes won't be shared if you're in a kin-based culture, because it's a secret. So you can't build science, you can't build cities, you can't build big companies. So because the West kind of enforced broad monogamous marriage early, it was able to evolve into all these things.\n\n(01:26:07):\nAnd he kind of shows why and how. He does these psychological tests today with people from monogamous marriage culture, Western culture, and kin-based culture. And the psychology is completely different. He gives examples like if a person murders another person, is that still murder if that person who did the murder is your brother? And in Western society, yeah, that's a murder. In kin-based culture, it's not a murder. It's just not.\n\n(01:26:39):\nAnd so that's really different. And so morality is different, everything comes off of that. So it's just a fascinating, fascinating book. So that's one.\n\n(01:26:55):\nAnother book that I recommend a lot is Shaka's book, his first book, Writing My Wrongs. He has a new book that I think is better, which is called How to Be Free. It's not quite out, or maybe it's releasing. It's releasing next month, so I recommend it.\n\n(01:27:11):\nWhat it does is, it goes through how did he work his way out of prison and solitary confinement to his current psychology, and what are the techniques he used? They're very powerful, very powerful ideas. CEOs always asks me, \"How do you deal with it? How do you deal with it?\" They'll ask in a work-life balance. It's like, \"What are you talking about? No work-life balance for CEOs,\" or particularly entrepreneur CEOs, come on.\n\n(01:27:43):\nBut what do you do? Do you meditate? Do you do this or that? But he kind of goes through the things that you really ought to do. That's what I would recommend, if somebody's wondering, how do you deal with all this pressure?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:57):\nI love this. Just the whole idea of Shaka being this help for CEOs, someone that killed someone, went to prison, led a prison gang. I just love that, how valuable his lessons-\n\nBen Horowitz (01:28:08):\nPrison gangs turn out to be really complicated things to manage. Sorry for getting into this, but the problem with running a prison gang is, you're just dealing with people who all come from broken culture.\n\n(01:28:23):\nSo in any organization, like the fundamental thing is trust. And so you're bringing in a bunch of no trust people. And so again, it's kind of like a military organization. It's a gang. If you think about a military operation, if you don't have trust, people don't trust the order, then you're completely dysfunctional.\n\n(01:28:46):\nSo how do you build trust from zero is a very interesting problem. And he's a genius at that, by the way. And I learned a lot from talking to him about it. So from a management standpoint, I would just say it's an important kind of boundary case of how you build culture. He is very, very smart at that. Like I said, you have to look at people about their greatness, not the worst thing they ever did.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:23):\nI know it's the lightning round, but can you just share one example of something he did that was like, wow, that's a really good lesson, someone trying to create a good culture that worked for him?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:29:32):\nYeah. So one of the things that he did that I thought was really smart is ... Well, he did a couple of things. One is just a simple thing. He just made everybody eat lunch together in the gang, just to build rapport, relationship, trust, like it's all one thing. We're all together on that.\n\n(01:29:56):\nAnd I think particularly in the remote work world and so forth, people really underestimate how powerful just that idea can be. And then another thing he did is, he made morality ... he had very specific things about, you had to be good to your word internally and externally.\n\n(01:30:26):\nSo normally a gang, like I said, it's kind of a kin-based culture thing. But it made it much more powerful when he said, \"Look, you can't do devious shit outside the gang either.\" And he had a bunch of examples of that, that I went through in the book.\n\n(01:30:50):\nLike I said, because you're building it from zero, you really have to take a hard line on things that I think people in companies don't even take a hard line on. Is it okay to lie internally? Probably not. Is it okay to lie to a customer? Well, in some organizations it is, but in Shaka's organization, that's as big a penalty as lying internally. These things, I think, end up being really important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:15):\nWe're going to link to this book. This is, What You Do is Who You Are. This is your second book that fewer people know about. And this is one of the stories you tell and just what the lessons are for building-\n\nBen Horowitz (01:31:23):\nYeah. It's kind of the more advanced book. You kind of have to survive to want to care about dealing with the cultural issues. And so the survival book has a bigger audience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:36):\nAmazing. We're going to keep going with Lightning Round. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you have really enjoyed?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:31:42):\nWell on TV, I really like Slow Horses, which is the show about the MI6 cast-off guys. And then I haven't seen a lot of movies lately, but I watched Sinners. I went to theater for Sinners. Just the cinematography is unbelievable, and the story is really original, and the acting is incredible, and the costumes are amazing. It's just a great, comprehensive piece of work. The craftsmanship on that thing is just a lot beyond what most people making movies are doing these days, so I really enjoyed that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:24):\nI hate scary movies, but I watched it and loved it.\n\nBen Horowitz (01:32:27):\nIt wasn't that scary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:29):\nIt wasn't that scary, but still, it was zombies popping out of corners. That's not my jam usually.\n\n(01:32:35):\nIs there a product you recently discovered that you really love? It could be a gadget, it could be clothes, could be something else.\n\nBen Horowitz (01:32:40):\nI bought a coffee machine called the Technivorm Moccamaster, which is freaking incredible. In fact, a friend of mine saw it and was like, \"What is that?\" And I just bought it for him too, because it's so awesome. This thing makes coffee that it's just perfect. There's no bitterness. It's completely clean. It's amazing. The only problem with it is, I can't drink coffee that it doesn't make anymore. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing, but ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:13):\nThat might come out someday in the AI future.\n\nBen Horowitz (01:33:16):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:17):\nTwo more questions. One, is there a life motto that you often come back to, find really useful in work or in life?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:33:24):\nThe thing that I would say has had the biggest effect on me is something my father said to me years ago, which is, \"Life isn't fair.\" That seems really, really simple, but I think that the thing that defeats people more than any other thing that I've seen, just in life, is the expectation of some fairness. It's just not fair.\n\n(01:33:54):\nThere are all kinds of stuff that are going to happen to you, and happen to everybody, that don't happen to other people, that are completely unfair. But it doesn't matter, because that's the way it is. As soon as you get that idea out of your mind, then you can just deal with it, like, oh yeah, of course it's not fair, but what should I do now, which is the real question, not how do I go back and get people to be fair? Nobody's going to be fair. It's not fair.\n\n(01:34:25):\nIt's the nature of it. If you think about it for more than five seconds, you'll realize that. It's as an individual, if you want to make the world a better place, whatever, but as an individual, do not expect anything to be fair, it'll only defeat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:43):\nFinal question. This comes from Shaka, actually. He gave me so many great suggestions. I hate to save this one for last. So the question is, if you had to build a business curriculum from two Hip-hop albums and one Funk album, what would they be and why?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:34:58):\nI think probably Follow the Leader by Rakim. And the reason is what we had kind of gotten into earlier, which is leadership. When he came out with that song, which was maybe the greatest Hip-hop song ever written, he's telling people to follow him, follow the leader. And just to have the idea that he was the leader of the entire art form, not just his band, it is amazing idea. And then the way he expressed it was incredible. And then he's got other great concepts in there that would give you ... It's hard to listen to that record and not have confidence.\n\n(01:36:02):\nI think from a competitive, purely competitive standpoint, Stillmatic from Nas, that's the one with Get Ur Self a Gun, that's the one with You're da Man. It's like all of the idea of competition is encapsulated in that album, so that would be the other one.\n\n(01:36:26):\nAnd then Funk, One Nation Under a Groove, for sure. Because it's like, how do you initiate people into a concept or an idea, and how do you infuse them? One Nation Under a Groove is all about joining the nation, and it's so musically interesting and getting people to be part of that. [inaudible 01:36:58] If you asked me tomorrow, I'd probably have three other ones.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:03):\nIncredible. I'm going to go listen to these. Ben, final question, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBen Horowitz (01:37:07):\nIf you get something that makes you better, please take it. If you need more advice on it, let me know. Look, my job is to help everybody build something great, so if you're an entrepreneur, thank you for that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:22):\nAlso, check out Paid in Full, paidinfullfoundation.org, if you want to learn more about that nonprofit.\n\nBen Horowitz (01:37:26):\nYes, definitely, we would love to have you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:29):\nAmazing. Ben, thank you so much for being here.\n\nBen Horowitz (01:37:31):\nAll right, awesome. Thank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:33):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How Snyk built a product-led growth juggernaut | Ben Williams (VP of Product at Snyk)\n\n## Transcript\n\nBen Williams (00:00:00):\nBeing able to identify the various micro and macro loops, how they're all connected, being able to document them in a qualitative model to communicate a shared understanding of how you grow, it's really powerful. Augmenting that then with the quantitative side of things that helps guide quarter to quarter focus and ensure you can be intentional about where you're investing, that becomes a big enabler. You're never going to have a shortage of ideas in a high performing growth team. So, knowing where to focus amidst that kind of sea of ideas is a really important role of the strategy.\nLenny (00:00:40):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Ben Williams. Ben is a VP of product at Snyk which is likely one of the biggest and most interesting companies that you've never heard of. Snyk makes it easy for developers to catch security issues in their code, and there's a lot to learn from how Snyk got started. It started through product-led growth, evolved into product-led sales, was very community driven, and it was also laser-focused on developers which has become one of the most lucrative markets to go after.\n(00:01:19):\nIn our conversation, we cover how the founders have Snyk out their first a hundred users, what they got wrong when they tried to monetize early on, when they hired their first marketing and sales people, how they structured and grew their growth and product teams, what they figured out about what should go into freemium and what shouldn't, and so much more. As you'll soon hear, Ben is British, and so, the episode is automatically going to sound more sophisticated and I can't wait for you to hear it. With that, I bring you Ben Williams.\n(00:01:48):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda's an all-in-one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place. I actually use Coda every single day. It's my home base for organizing my newsletter writing. It's where I plan my content calendar, capture my research, and write the first drafts of each and every post. It's also where I curate my private knowledge repository for paid newsletter subscribers, and it's also how I manage the workflow for this very podcast. Over the years, I've seen Coda evolve from being a tool that makes teams more productive to one that also helps bring the best practices across the tech industry to life with an incredibly rich collection of templates and guides in the Coda Doc Gallery, including resources for many guests on this podcast, including Shreyas, Gokul, and Shishir, the CEO of Coda. Some of the best teams out there, like Pinterest, Spotify, Square and Uber use Coda to run effectively and have published their templates for anyone to use.\n(00:02:47):\nIf you're ping-ponging between lots of documents and spreadsheets, make your life better and start using Coda.

I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferris and Lex Fridman, and so, I finally gave it a shot earlier this year and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One, with a small scoop that dissolved in water, you're absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as a little safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies, and internal testing that they do. And three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself.\n(00:04:09):\nRight now it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop in a cup of water every day, and that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. To make it easy, athletic Greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny. Again, that's athletic greens.com/lenny to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.\n(00:04:45):\nBen, welcome to the podcast.\nBen Williams (00:04:47):\nThank you very much, Lenny. Thanks first of all for inviting me. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. I've got to say that kind of what you're creating with the newsletter and now the podcast, just such awesome resources for the product growth and wider tech community, so it's real honor to be invited onto the show, and I hope there's a few useful things that people can take away.\nLenny (00:05:07):\nAwesome, man. I really appreciate that. I have no doubt there will be many useful things people will be able to take away. I'm really excited to chat about Snyk and the things that you're building there. I feel like Snyk is this very under-talked about company and also super fascinating companies, especially in terms of how it got started, how it scaled, and it's also at the center of so many trends, product-led growth, community-led growth, focusing on developers to grow, and also just security in general is really interesting, and so, I'm really looking forward to our chat.\nBen Williams (00:05:36):\nMe too.\nLenny (00:05:37):\nBefore we get into all of that, I'd love to spend just a minute on your background. So, you're currently VP product at Snyk, and I'm curious how you got to that role and just some of the other wonderful things you've done in your career along the way there.\nBen Williams (00:05:51):\nI'll try to keep it reasonably short. My education is in computer science, graduated from the University of Manchester back in the late '90s. I'd already landed as a job as a developer, but ended up having a bunch of other interesting offers, one of which was to join a small startup building requirements management tooling for product and engineering folks. This was all pre-Agile, but that whole space of developer tooling, engineering tooling, it was something I just felt naturally drawn to and it's where I've really specialized through my whole career. I actually joined that company as a solutions engineer, so lots of demos and so on. I was really close to the product team, but also speaking with customers every day which as is quite common I think was my path into products there.\n(00:06:34):\nSeveral years and a few acquisitions later, I find myself in IBM with the Rational software developer tooling group. I was leading parts of the product strategy there and a bunch of initiatives. I actually, I learned a ton of useful stuff there, but also that I had a strong preference for working in smaller, fast-growing orgs verse 350,000 people [inaudible 00:06:55]. After an interesting unexpected interlude, leading a DevOps transformation at a fintech and some consulting and advising, I then joined CloudBees. They're a DevOps startup with an open-core model. I was leading product design and growth there. Stayed with them for three years through several raises and a period of really fast growth before finally joining Snyk to build out our growth organization and lead our developer experience initiatives. I have a broad remit at Snyk now than just the growth org, but yeah, that's how it started.\nLenny (00:07:26):\nAwesome. To give folks a sense of just how successful and big Snyk has gotten, one is just what does Snyk do, we haven't even talked about that yet, and then two, just some stats about the scale of the company and the business at this point.\nBen Williams (00:07:40):\nThe developer security company, we make it ridiculously easy for developers and their teams to improve their security posture while still moving fast. So, Snyk can find and automatically fixed vulnerabilities in code, open source dependencies, containers, infrastructure and cloud configurations, and all underpinned by the best security intelligence data in the market with a laser focus on developer experiences, which is why we're, we are really different. It's also an amazingly fast-growing business with some stellar PLG-focused investors and board members from the likes of Ed Sim at boldstart to Tamar Yehoshua, Slack CPO. We were founded in 2015, last valuation after our Series F was at 8.6 billion. We're securing the software of millions of developers now, well over 2,000 paying customers, now around 1300 people of which are around 500 in R and D with nearly 70 folks in our product org. And the people here just create this amazing culture, and all in all, it's just a really exciting place to be.\nLenny (00:08:44):\nOkay. Did you have any sense it would get to this scale when you joined early on?\nBen Williams (00:08:49):\nYes, I think because I wasn't looking for a new role when I ended up joining Snyk, when I was first approached by them, but everyone I spoke with along the interview process, just became more and more impressed with not only the caliber of people here, but the vision, the mission for the company, and all those things you mentioned in terms of PLG, community-led growth, focus on developers, the security space, these were all things that if you create a Venn diagram of all the things that I'm really interested in professionally, super interested in, super exciting to me, then kind of Snyk ended up in the middle of it. So, it's pretty cool.\nLenny (00:09:29):\nAwesome. So, that's a good segue to where I wanted to start is how Snyk started and how Snyk got their first hundred users, and I know you weren't there necessarily for that, but I'm curious what you can share about how the founders found their first say a hundred users. How did they get to their initial developers and get people excited?\nBen Williams (00:09:47):\nI think it's a really fun story. So, if you don't mind, I'll just take a moment because I think it's important to set the stage by looking back at-\nLenny (00:09:52):\nLet's do this.\nBen Williams (00:09:53):\nYeah, just look back at the market in general. So, PLG or bottom up and security, these were never words that were known to have been spoken together in a single sentence, right? So, security has always been a centralized function. Security programs were historically more about audit and policing and enforcement versus developer enablement or empowerment. A sales motion you saw it was always top down. It was seen as immovable, CISOs, other AppSec leaders with the buyers. Security tooling that was out there at the time, they all catered to this dynamic and these were tools that slowed developers down. They created a lot of frustration. They were met with a lot of resistance, not the ideal recipe really for consistent adoption and strong engagement and retention, and ultimately, app security programs based around those kind of solutions just weren't effective as they really needed to be.\n(00:10:46):\nSo, it was a realization around this, timed with adjacent market shifts happening with DevOps that sparked the ideas behind Snyks. So, the founders, Guy, Danny and Assaf, they saw a real opportunity just to do things differently. They believed that the most effective way to improve application security posture was a developer-first approach. They knew that the developers were increasingly caring about the security of their code in the same way that they cared about performance and functional quality of their code. But they also knew that to empower developers to own that security, they needed just much better tools with way less friction than they ever had before. And their approach was, I think looking back, super smart, focus on a community. It wasn't the full extent of what we'd think of as community-led growth now, but it was close.\n(00:11:35):\nThey started with a really narrow, early focus. It was a single persona, single context, single use case, and what that meant for Snyk was developers building applications using Node.js who wanted to ensure that the open source dependencies they were pulling into their apps were secure. Now, open source software, that's a huge accelerant in building modern software. The average software application today is at least 75% of open source libraries and components. So, this was increasingly becoming a primary attack vector for malicious actors who could find a single vulnerability in an open source component and then find it and exploit it in every single application that was using that component. And at the same time, at least back then, open source software was much less tested for security vulnerabilities, and the maintainers of open source libraries were often less security aware. So, you get that context, and then at the same time, Node.js as a run time was gaining traction. So, there was this increasing adoption in the enterprise, more and more dedicated conferences and the like, but the community was still small enough that Snyk could meaningfully influence, and Guy and the others just went all out on being deeply involved in that community. They were presenting at dev conferences, meetups, they were building online content and so on. And the question that they repeatedly posed to the community was do you have known vulnerabilities in your apps, and Snyk was there to help them answer that question. And fun kind of fact on the side, if you search for Snyk in the Urban Dictionary, you'll see it's an acronym for so now you know. But all of this kind of I think really only worked because of the parallel product-led approach. So, while the answer to the question about how does your product monetize users was much less clear cut in the early days for Snyk, the answer to the questions, how does your product acquire and retain users has always been product led.\n(00:13:35):\nAnd the initial version of Snyk, it was a command line tool. It was a tool for developers, it could be run locally or easily integrated into CICD pipelines for early feedback. It allowed devs to assume more responsibility for the security of their apps, and that was just very different from the typical incumbent technologies that were run by security teams late in the dev process, long feedback loops, issues thrown over the walls, inevitably just frustrating developers. And all of this was just built on this fundamental belief that the only viable path, and by viable I really mean sustainably effective, the only sustainably effective path for software-centric organizations to meet the challenge of becoming and staying secure was for them to take this developer-led approach to that challenge. So, really kind of complete disruption of the industry and developer adoption for that reason was always a key priority for us.\n(00:14:31):\nSo, with that in mind, Snyk has just been free to use in some capacity from day one, and the early strategy was always about creating something valuable that was readily available, something that solved a real problem in a uniquely differentiated way, and making it pervasive. So, with dev-led option, this core concern, a freemium go-to-market strategy was just the obvious approach. So, eventually, getting back to your original question, that's all of the context and where and when and how they did it, but the first hundred or so users really just came from the founders engaging with the Node.js community and the interest that drove. I think we probably had maybe around 5,000 free users before there are any attempts at monetization.\nLenny (00:15:13):\nAwesome. There's a bunch I want to unpack there because what's interesting the way you describe it maps to the series that I recently wrote about consumer growth strategy and how the first three steps after you have an idea is to come up with your super specific who, kind of your target persona, come up with a hook that catches them and gets them excited, and then go find them where they are and pitch them your hook. So, the super specific who for Snyk was you said open source developers working on Node.js. Is that right?\nBen Williams (00:15:41):\nWell, it was Node.js developers, and Node.js developers were building their applications using open source Node components.\nLenny (00:15:50):\nMm-hmm. Got it. Was there any other constraint to that, do you know, or those were the two to three attributes of a user?\nBen Williams (00:15:56):\nThat's really it. The community was growing for sure. It was big enough to have a decent opportunity there-\nLenny (00:16:03):\nMakes sense.\nBen Williams (00:16:04):\n... but narrow enough that technology wise, it meant that a product could be brought to market in a reasonable time.\nLenny (00:16:10):\nYeah, that's great. And then the hook was basically you have known vulnerabilities in your code base which if I were an engineer, like, \"I don't know, shoot, I don't know. Get a find exactly. I'm scared now.\"\nBen Williams (00:16:20):\nExactly. And then so now you know. Right?\nLenny (00:16:22):\nYeah, exactly. Okay, cool. And then the where, so you said that they went to open source communities. Do you have any more specifics about what those were? Was it like a specific forum? Was it like GitHub somewhere? Was it Reddit? Do you know any idea where those communities lived?\nBen Williams (00:16:36):\nYeah, it was less about a particular place, but more about the community of developers themselves who focused on Node.js. So, a bunch of early evangelism was really at conferences. It was I think the Velocity Conference in Amsterdam where Guy and Assaf kind of first unveiled Snyk to the world, and yeah, it went from there.\nLenny (00:16:58):\nI see. Interesting. So, it was in-person events, conferences, and meetups probably focused on Node.js developers.\nBen Williams (00:17:03):\nExactly. Yeah.\nLenny (00:17:05):\nOkay, awesome. What happened after that? So, that was the first hundred. Was it just roughly the next stage of growth or did it focus on that for a long time? What was the next stage roughly?\nBen Williams (00:17:14):\nYeah. I think that focus was the really important kind of element there, if I can kind of latch on that. Starting with that narrow focus and building around community engagement, I think it's a well-proven playbook now, particularly in the developer tooling space like New Relic did it notably with Ruby community for example. But ultimately it was important because of this kind of depth verse breadth approach and that depth-first approach that Snyk took was important to be able to effectively validate the solution on the path to product market fit. A JavaScript developer just won't care if you support Golang or Rust, but will absolutely care if a key feature like automated package upgrades just isn't available for their ecosystem.\n(00:18:04):\nOf course, the bigger problem of vulnerable components in open source across all languages and all ecosystems, that's a very widespread problem. It affects the industry at large, but that just spoke to the potential opportunity that was there to be unlocked. But the key for Snyk I think was just not to go too wide, too early. So, it focused on nailing that initial use case for that specific community of Node.js devs, like I say, narrow enough to be able to really focus on quickly building a compelling solution to a real problem, but also wide enough to be something viable from a growth perspective. And even back then the NPM, the Node Package Manager hosted around 200,000 open source packages. They were downloaded something like two and a half billion times a month by over 2 million devs. And the typical node app would have hundreds of dependencies, mostly indirect and so hidden less immediately visible. But each of those dependencies brought with it some security risks. So, yeah, I think nailing that narrow and deep-use case before expanding wider was absolutely critical and generally just sound advice around finding product market fit and building solid momentum before casting a wider net. It's difficult to maintain that focus for sure as the lure of that bigger term can be really tempting, but ultimately you have to build a service and market well to capture it.\nLenny (00:19:23):\nDo you have a sense of when that focus expanded to an adjacent group, how many years into the growth story that happened, or was there some kind of milestone there? Because I know everyone imagines, yeah, we'll expand, the question is when and when does it make sense and when is it too early. Do you have any insights into that phase?\nBen Williams (00:19:43):\nYeah, for sure. First, I think if we're talking about PLG and the story with Snyk, I actually like that definition of product-led acquisition from Julian Shapiro when you spoke with him, and beyond that maniacal focus on finding product market fit for your product, founders really should be thinking about how their product is going to grow, and that's important of course as you think about taking that next step. So, let's assume in a simplistic definition that you found product market fit as demonstrated by a strong retention, and then the real question is where are the new users for your product going to come from, and founders really should have, I think, strong hypothesis around this, your risk essentially, adopting an if we build it, they'll come approach.\n(00:20:27):\nSo, if your acquisition strategy is product- led, then understanding and being intentional about your early acquisition growth loops I think is an essential founder's responsibility. Dedicating time there to design those loops into the product, it's key. And when I say product, I really mean the whole product experience considering every touchpoint in and out of the core application that your users and customers might have with you. Snyk, for example, believed very early that we could build out powerful content loops via fixed pull requests that we raise on GitHub. New users, they'll sign up for Snyk, they'll connect their GitHub accounts, Snyk will scan their code, will find vulnerabilities, will automatically create Snyk-branded pull requests to fix those vulnerabilities. Other devs in the repo will see and interact with those PRs, and some of them will follow links to Snyk, create accounts and some of them will connect their own repos, and so the loop continues. So, company generated, company distributed content loop, it's actually really powerful for us because it's both an acquisition loop and an engagement loop.\n(00:21:28):\nOver the course of time, we extended that loop by adding support for other source controlled systems beyond GitHub. We layered on a bunch of new loops, and I think if founders can be intentional about this as you're developing early product iterations, then you're going to have a bigger advantage when the product clicks with the market, and that was built into Snyk as we went along. So, that was kind of ready as we found product market fit. But I think to talk about specifically how Snyk took that next stage, it was a function of when we were chatting before this, we talked a little bit about some of the failed experiences spinning up a self-serve revenue channel, and-\nLenny (00:22:09):\nActually before we get there, which I definitely want to get into all that, I love this story you just shared. I hadn't heard of this growth tactic of basically they connect their GitHub account, you find all the vulnerabilities, push a fix, people see that Snyk did this for them and it just provides all this value, and you're saying that was really effective. It's an example of something that worked very well.\nBen Williams (00:22:29):\nFirst of all, that integration in terms of connecting your code with security scanning like that was a first of a kind integration.\nLenny (00:22:38):\nYeah, magic.\nBen Williams (00:22:39):\nNo one had done that before. But the key was that we ultimately controlled the content. So, not only was the fixed pull request doing something useful in terms of the code, but all of the description of the pull request was explaining about the vulnerability, educating users, and it was all Snyk branded and saying, \"If you find this useful, click here, come and learn more about the vulnerability. Sign up for an account if you don't have one.\" It kept existing users coming back.\nPART 1 OF 4 ENDS [00:23:04]\nBen Williams (00:23:03):\nYou sign up for an account if you don't have one, it kept existing users coming back and it brings new users, a lot of new users, in fact.\nLenny (00:23:06):\nYou'd be in there all like, \"Do you have known vulnerabilities in your code base? Click here to find out.\" Is that responsible for much of the early growth, that loop?\nBen Williams (00:23:15):\nI think that was one of the loops. We also have a couple of, from fairly early on as well, other content loops that are more kind of programmatic SEO assets that have both been pretty instrumental in terms of new user growth, yeah.\nLenny (00:23:31):\nIt'd be cool to hear about those if they're relatively straightforward to explain, and then we can get to the thing that didn't work, the self-serve monetization piece you were going to get to.\nBen Williams (00:23:40):\nWe have a bunch of loops actually at this point to start off.\nLenny (00:23:42):\nLucky you.\nBen Williams (00:23:44):\nYeah, I'm a big loopist, funnily enough. But yeah, we have a bunch of loops. Company generated, company distributed content loops have actually worked really well for us. We have a side car product called Snyk Advisor. Snyk Advisor, it's basically a service that developers use to search and find open source packages when they're considering integrating some within their software applications. The unique thing about it is it indexes all of the package managers. It learns about those packages. It augments the data about them with a bunch of metadata, including of course Snyk security scans, but we also find out how actively maintained the software is on the source repo on GitHub or wherever.\n(00:24:31):\nWe build this kind of package health score, so anyone searching on Google for a package that does X, Y, Z or a specific package by name, Snyk Advisor will be right up there in terms of the search results. They'll land on there, they'll get a good idea about that package, they can look at similar packages and it's all, of course, a Snyk website and we have CTAs to say, \"If you want to secure your application on a perpetual basis, then just come and join us.\" That's a great loop. That's all kind of a programmatic asset. There are hundreds of thousands of these package pages, but they're just automatically being generated continuously.\nLenny (00:25:07):\nGot it. It's programmatically generated better indexing of open source libraries that you can integrate with. That is so smart. It's programmatic because you can inform on the security vulnerabilities and then the maintenance and activity. Interesting. Yeah, that makes sense. That's all data you could just gather. That's awesome. Okay, so there's that. Is there anything else that's worked really well for you guys to help you grow self-serve?\nBen Williams (00:25:31):\nOne of the recent ones that's really interesting is security education. We think of Snyk as a change agent in helping DevSecOps transformations and it's fine kind of having this capability, but what we really want to get to is this position where developers truly understand and can be better placed to prevent security vulnerabilities being injected into their code. One of the things that is, again, something that's pretty different from the industry from an incumbent perspective is that we believe it's really important to democratize security education.\n(00:26:06):\nWe have been building this bunch of really high quality but bite size lessons about developer security that focus on developers about security issues and vulnerabilities and we surface them. Again, they're out there in the public domain. There's no paywall to get access to those. All the traditional solutions you need to sign up, you need to pay to get access beyond more than a couple. But these were just, they're all out there in the public domain. That works really well for us from a company generated company distributed loop as well.\nLenny (00:26:36):\nSo cool. SEO and then integrating to GitHub in an interesting way. Imagine there's also a lot of intra-company virality when someone uses Snyk at a company and they spread it to their colleagues?\nBen Williams (00:26:47):\nYeah, I mean, I didn't talk about those. I think those are pretty well understood. We have both referral loops and invite loops as well.\nLenny (00:26:55):\nOkay, awesome. Coming back to what didn't work, and I think you mentioned that there was a monetization attempt that was self-service oriented and that had some challenges. Can you talk about that?\nBen Williams (00:27:06):\nAt the time, a few things were in place. Valuable product, check, strong developer user growth, check, strong retention, check, but the first self-serve monetization efforts only really saw traction with individual developers paying a hundred dollars a month. Or purchases in larger companies, they just didn't happen as everyone had hoped. There was a really critical part of Snyk's history. At the time a bunch of investors didn't lean in, perhaps shy away from early conviction with the founders on building strong usage without a proven path to monetization at that point. Ed at BOLDStart who I mentioned previously, he was one of the first kind of true believers and was I think really key in helping with providing runway during that time. But it was clear that there was a lot of work still to do. The team dived in, they really figured out what the constraints were and through that process really learned about the importance of catering for the broader governance needs of the enterprise buyer.\n(00:28:07):\nAnd that meant a couple of things. First, there was a need to build out table stakes features around governance at scale. Just things that companies of a certain scale and size expected reporting, robust user management and so on. And second that it was time to move beyond that depth first approach, right? That depth first approach was absolutely critical in getting to that point, but it wasn't good enough to take the next step. If you think about it, there's a point in a company scale where you start to see diversification of tech stacks and all of those tech stacks need securing. It's obvious in retrospect that only supporting developers using a narrow slice of those tech stacks wasn't going to meet the needs of the security teams who were ultimately the people who were held accountable for the security of their entire application estate. The teams worked hard over the next few months starting to build support for additional languages and ecosystems and adding those table stakes features.\n(00:29:04):\nI think back then Snyk were simply ahead of this inevitable curve of developer first security. At the time, the only buyers were security teams and dev first Security for the most part wasn't something that CISOs and ApSec leaders were driving. But if you look at Snyk through that lens of, as I mentioned, being a change agent, being a key piece of the transformational journey of our customers' DevSecOps journeys, you realize how important it was for us to start to build relationships with those security leaders. It was that time also that it was the right time to bring in the first sales and engineering hires as well.\nLenny (00:29:48):\nYou basically found it couldn't work self-serve, independent of sales being involved in convincing the folks at the top, which makes sense. How do you trust a company with your security if the people at the top responsible for security aren't bought in? Makes sense.\nBen Williams (00:30:04):\nToday it's less like that. There are organizations where the buying center is still very much ApSec, but there are also many organizations where kind of technical leaders on the buying decision around security investments. What was always true though even back then was the influencing power of developers, regardless of where the buying center was.\nLenny (00:30:28):\nAnd I imagine as the brand has grown, it's gotten easier to convince people like, \"Oh yeah, look at all these other logos using this. It's probably going to be okay.\"\nBen Williams (00:30:33):\nFor sure.\nLenny (00:30:36):\nJust to understand in your experience with Snyk, it never really worked self-served monetization. It worked as a way to get into a company and then developers started using it in small scale, but you needed sales and marketing to really grow monetization. Is that what you found?\nBen Williams (00:30:51):\nI think back then, yes. Now it's a very different story. We have a lot of self-serve only customers scaling pretty large, so.\nLenny (00:30:59):\nGot it. That's interesting. I rarely hear that you start out with sales being important and it becomes less important or I imagine it's still very important, but there's like a segment that has emerged that can self-serve. Fascinating.\nBen Williams (00:31:14):\nYeah, I think it is important to acknowledge though, that the product has always played a really key part in the sales process for sure.\nLenny (00:31:21):\nThat touches on something I wanted to ask. [inaudible 00:31:24] you've mentioned him a couple times, he's got this awesome newsletter, he talks about you guys all the time. I think he's very proud of the progress of Snyk and he talks a lot about that for developers, you got to win hearts and minds of developers to build something that works. Any lessons or pieces of advice for folks that are targeting developers to win hearts and minds and get engineers, developers excited about what you're building?\nBen Williams (00:31:47):\nI think there's two things, right? First of all, fundamentally for someone to get excited about using a product, they've got to care enough, right? They've got to have a problem that you're solving. I think there's two things. One, there is a shift that is happening and still happening. I think there's still a long way to go for developers to really care about security as an integral part of their job in the same way they think about functional quality or performance. I think that we're still, we're making strong progress there. It's changing all the time, but there's still a long way to go there. But the reality is that I think in most companies, developers have to care about security because their companies need to be secure. The key then is how do I make the job of being secure for these developers, as painless as it absolutely needs to be?\n(00:32:44):\nAnd that means really meeting them where they are, integrating with their tools, finding ways to take security to them instead of trying to pull them out of their workflows. Flow is just this incredibly important concept for developers and you want to strive to keep them in that flow for as long as possible. The GitHub kind of pool requests are a great example of that. Someone can sign up for Snyk and they could theoretically be the only user of Snyk and connect their repos. All of a sudden we're protecting, securing those repos, a hundred, a thousand developers could be working in GitHub with that code, all benefiting from Snyk without necessarily needing to sign up. That's that example of taking the product to users without pulling them out of their workflows. I think that's absolutely critical.\nLenny (00:33:38):\nAs an outsider hearing all this, it's a product that magically helps you avoid security issues, very little work, does a lot of the work for you. It's hard to imagine it not working looking at it now, and I'm curious what it was about the early days that just felt like maybe that people didn't believe in this working. Is it just there was doubt that it would be smart enough to find your security vulnerability issues? Was it the timing wasn't right, people weren't ready, weren't concerned about security enough? What do you think it was that created challenges early on? Because looking back, it's like, of course this is going to work. How could it not? It sounds just like a magical all win product.\nBen Williams (00:34:16):\nFirst of all, don't think the challenges were there in terms of the developer adoption. Even when those first kind of forays into self-serve were struggling in terms of breaking into some of the larger customers. The developer adoption, the free user base was still growing at a really good pace. That momentum was just constantly building and it's that momentum that has ultimately fueled the sales led business as we've gone through the years. But it was just those few things I think that I mentioned earlier in terms of stumbling blocks that needed to be overcome because when those first sales and marketing hires did join us and we started having conversations and we also tweaked some of the things in the product to meet, had some breadth, had some additional languages, ecosystems, building those table stakes features, then it really unlocked and it was rocket ship time from then.\nLenny (00:35:11):\nGot it. Sounds like the biggest issue is monetization. Can we make money doing this? Developers love it, they're using it like crazy, but will people be convinced to scale this an inside an organization and pay us a bunch of money for it?\nBen Williams (00:35:21):\nExactly, yep.\nLenny (00:35:22):\nOkay, got it. I want to dive a little bit deeper into your growth team and product team and how you think about organizing teams like that in a product led growth sales org. The first question, just how did the growth team start at Snyk? What was kind of the early days and then what does it look like today?\nBen Williams (00:35:41):\nThere were some ad hoc efforts happening in various places. We had a small growth marketing function, we had [inaudible 00:35:49]. We also had some ownership of key growth services in R&D. There was a team that owned the new user onboarding flows, for example. But it wasn't until I joined that we really formalized the notion of a growth team. It was very kind of ad hoc before then. When I joined, we created what we call the developer growth group now. Before then there maybe wasn't strong an understanding about what a growth team needs to look like, how they might need to work differently to the core product teams. And I'd say overall it was much later than you'd typically expect to see. And at a bigger scale. You normally are going to start growth teams, one or two people, three or four maybe, and scale out from there. But we started much bigger than that. But at the same time, this bottom up developer first approach, it was baked into the company DNA in terms of how teams think and operate. Yeah, we were growing fast even before we spun up the growth group. I think the significant change that happened there, it was a transition from a simple freemium approach to a holistic and well-coordinated PLG strategy. It's much more common to start earlier, much more common to start at a smaller scale than we did at Snyk, but it worked for us because of this kind of perfect storm of where we had a product with that bottom up growth built in from the beginning. We had founders with a deep appreciation for how the product could grow and there was strongly exec alignment and sponsorship for scaling the motion. The problem when starting the growth group, it was really for the most part more oriented to how we can get the flywheel spinning faster as opposed to getting it moving in the first place.\nLenny (00:37:26):\nWhere did you initially focus that team? Which part of the flywheel?\nBen Williams (00:37:30):\nRight now we have dedicated teams focused on acquisition, activation and monetization along with a supporting team who own our growth platform, including all of our data and experimentation stack. But the macro structure, it's changed over time to enable us to focus on the biggest constraints in our growth model. At the beginning we just focused on acquisition and activation, intentionally deferring any investment into specific monetization initiatives around the self-serve revenue channel until we felt confident that A, we'd built the necessary growth muscles to scale, and B, we'd figured out some of the more pressing issues that were present earlier in the user journey. It was important that we felt really confident about our ability to effectively connect developers to Snyk's value in such a way that introducing and optimizing a self-serve revenue channel would make sense. I also really wanted to avoid one of the common failure modes I've seen around cross-functional collaboration and growth.\n(00:38:28):\nWhen I joined, there was an inherent tension built into the system. It was particularly noticeable between R&D and the growth marketing team. We had amazing people in both teams, a ton of really great ideas, but many of them were just not being executed on and it was leading to a lot of friction, a lot of frustration, ultimately caused by misaligned incentives between the different functions. When creating the growth group, we resolved this by ensuring that each of the growth teams were truly cross-functional in nature with everyone in each team aligned around common objectives and KPIs. Every team has engineers, an engineering manager, a product manager, a designer, a growth marketer, decision science support, and a basic shape of the growth teams that'll be familiar to most, but I spoke to a bunch of people over the last couple of years and I've actually learned to my surprise that inclusion of growth marketers in the product teams is not all that common. And I personally think there's just a lot of opportunity being missed there and I expect that to start to become the norm rather than the exception over time.\nLenny (00:39:32):\nOkay. I want to talk about that, but before we get there, you said there's a decision science person on the team. What is that about? That's cool.\nBen Williams (00:39:38):\nThat's right. We started off from a fundamental BI data analyst perspective, but over time we wanted to apply a much deeper level of analysis on the data such that we could start to build in predictive models that could help us make better decisions and can ultimately fuel and power some of the end product experiences. Yeah, we spun up a decision science function and those folks are very smart.\nLenny (00:40:13):\nIs that similar to data science or is that a separate ... Okay. It's cool that you call them decision science people versus data science, because that's so much more actionable.\nBen Williams (00:40:23):\nYeah, I think so.\nLenny (00:40:24):\nWow, that's cool. All right. I haven't heard that before. Makes me think of Annie Duke and all the stuff about how to make better decisions and I love ... Is this something anyone else does or is this something you came up with calling [inaudible 00:40:38]-\nBen Williams (00:40:37):\nI'm not sure. I don't necessarily think what we are doing is revolutionary there, but maybe the name, I'm not sure.\nLenny (00:40:46):\nYeah, the name is cool. I haven't heard that before. It implies bias towards action versus just we're going to do a bunch of cool stuff with data. Interesting. Okay. Then you said that there's a growth marketer embedded in each team, so maybe just broadly what makes up these teams? Which you touched on briefly, then what have you learned is the value of having a growth marketer embedded within each team?\nBen Williams (00:41:06):\nIt's important to have balanced teams with strong diversity across multiple vectors. Focusing on functional diversity at the moment, which is kind of what you're asking about with having growth marketers on the team, one of the big benefits you get is a broader pallet of ideas, but also a bigger toolbox when it comes to execution, which generally translates in an ability in a growth team for them to test and learn faster with more parallel, yet at the same time, aligned threats. Perhaps I can give a recent example there. Having a growth marketer in an acquisition focused team led us to some lightweight experimentation on the website in creating an SEO optimized page. It was something that was really high performing, both from the perspective of traffic and conversion, but it didn't require any engineering resources to create. The growth marketer and the team, and they decided together this was something worth pursuing.\n(00:42:01):\nBut the growth marketer was able to kind of execute that independently while engineers were working on other things. But then based on the success of that, the team went on to build out a functional sidecar product that allowed users to basically try Snyk without needing to sign up by simply placing their code in for us to scan and giving them some results there and then. We saw really great results with that visitor traffic, saw a significant increase, sign up rate dropped a little bit as we'd expect it would, but overall new users had a big bump and those users had much higher intent, which we saw play out with increased activation rates.\nLenny (00:42:37):\nAwesome. Okay. And so there's essentially four teams under the growth umbrella. There's acquisition, activation, monetization, and then this kind of experimentation platform team. Is that right?\nBen Williams (00:42:47):\nYeah, that's right. And that team is also responsible for making that data available elsewhere in the organization as well. Product led sales is a really important motion for us, and so taking the knowledge we have, the insight we have around behavior with the users and their teams and their companies within the product, and making that available to the GTM teams outside in smart ways, allowing them to focus on the things that are most important to focus on. That's a really important part of what that team does.\nLenny (00:43:20):\nIt's interesting, you guys are the epitome of product life sales. That's this new trend of from PLG to PLS for sales. It's obvious that they're a big part of this whole process. The fact that monetization happens almost all through sales is interesting. That's interesting. Cool. Okay. That's not a question, just a thought, talking out loud. One other thought I had is, so you talked about SEO being a really important part of your growth. What is the person team like to do the SEO piece, the right content? I imagine they're on the acquisition team, there's maybe a content person that lives within that team.\nBen Williams (00:43:55):\nWe have actually one of, the smartest SEO people I've ever met within [inaudible 00:44:02].\nLenny (00:44:02):\nWhat's their name? Let's give them a shout out if you want.\nBen Williams (00:44:03):\nAnna. Yeah, cool.\nLenny (00:44:05):\nJoanna.\nBen Williams (00:44:05):\nWell, she's part of growth marketing, but she works extremely closely with the growth teams and she's got a few people in her organization and we bring them into specific SEO focused initiatives when we're looking to build loops around that. Incredibly important to have someone like that who understands that at a far deeper level than I could ever hope to, how SEO works. And particularly in terms of keeping on top of some of the things that Google are constantly doing in terms of their algorithm changes.\nLenny (00:44:37):\nAnd does she actually do the writing for editorially, for I guess even the programmatically made pages or there's someone she outsources-\nBen Williams (00:44:43):\nNo, but what she does do a great job of is providing the kind of continuously updated guidelines on how content should be structured to lead us to good results.\nLenny (00:44:55):\nThen it's just engineers and PMs that end up writing the things? Wow. Cool.\nBen Williams (00:45:00):\nYeah, that's exactly right.\nLenny (00:45:04):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold.\n(00:45:39):\nIf you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Getting a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months. Less than a-\nPART 2 OF 4 ENDS [00:46:04]\nLenny (00:46:03):\nCan get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes.

What advice do you have for folks building growth teams and maybe either similar space or just B2B, PLS oriented businesses in general? What have you learned about what is important to get right?\nBen Williams (00:46:34):\nThis is a big topic. I have a lot of thoughts here based on what I've seen work well and also not so well. I think I can broadly bucket things here into maybe three main topics. So the first would be people and process. The second would be strategy, and the third would be data. Now they're all related and they all have to be working well to be effective in growth. Starting with people maybe touch the first element there in terms of balance teams, you've got to have those balance teams with diversity and ability to create great ideas, but also ability to execute. So that's the first thing.\n(00:47:14):\nBut still on the topic of people, I have this kind of mental model, that potential that at its core is unbounded, but that a bunch of things situationally prevent people from fulfilling their potential. It might be how they're thinking about something. It might be organizational. It might be in relationships with coworkers or in broader team dynamics. It might be in them not even being in the right role even.\n(00:47:37):\nSo fundamentally I think it's the role of managers and leaders to help them identify those things and work with them to find ways to thrive and grow. And I've seen this have particular significance in a growth org where people are just naturally less good fit. Now that doesn't mean that they're not amazing talented humans. It just means they aren't going to do their best work in a growth context.\n(00:47:59):\nSo when you're starting a growth team, you'll often be doing so with internal moves. So this can be something that's maybe a little bit easier to miss than with external candidates where you are likely testing for those things explicitly during the hiring process. I'll share an example with developers.\n(00:48:17):\nSo the devs that really thrive in a growth context are the ones that are motivated by moving quickly, iterating to create measurable impact. They're not attached to their work. They embrace imperfection as part of the process. They happily discard their code, their ideas even. They're curious and they're always looking for ways to be closer to their users.\n(00:48:38):\nNow those are the folks that generally make great growth engineers and I've also known incredible engineers that are most motivated when they're working on really deep technical challenges and love the process as much as the outcome. And they've struggled in growth. Of course it's never that simple in reality. There's nobody who's really at either extremity of that spectrum. But it's really important to try to answer the question, can this person do their best work in this environment? So I think that's a really key part of it.\n(00:49:10):\nAnd yeah, you need to also make sure they're well equipped from a kind of skills and knowledge perspective as well. So they need the right skills and knowledge to be able to do their best work in the context of your growth process. So the ideal state is that every growth team member has common vocabulary. They're comfortable with the growth process. They can work well with data and experimentation platform. They understand the data. They have the right skills and mindset.\n(00:49:36):\nEducation I think plays a big part here. So we're big fans of Reforge, but we've also developed a bunch of internal programs to align and uplevel the teams. Something we learned, I think as an example, is the importance of starting simple and going deeper as the teams build experience. So for example, when it comes to experimentation, don't try at the beginning to introduce multivariate testing or concepts like sequential samplings and alternative evaluation approach.\n(00:50:04):\nTeams are still trying to just dip their toes in that... This water, it's kind of a recipe for a lot of mistakes. So that would be some advice there.\n(00:50:15):\nBut people also need to be well aligned. I've talked about this actually on another podcast that I did recently. But what I mean by that is their execution needs to be aligned with an evolving growth strategy. The growth strategy needs to be aligned with and at the same time influence where the company's going. The growth strategy needs hooks into the product strategy and ideally there's some overlap and alignment of KPIs so that the growth teams and the core product teams are swimming in the same direction. The skills and experience in the team need to be aligned with the strategy. If you've got to focus on activation and acquisition, then someone who's a plans and pricing expert probably isn't the right set of skills at that point in time.\n(00:50:57):\nBut you also, leaders need to plan to ensure those skills are available as focus of the growth team inevitably shifts over time. But at the end of the day, I think everyone needs to be able to easily answer the question why they're there. Why the work they're doing is important.\n(00:51:14):\nI don't know if it's too far off track here, but I have a vision and mission framework that I like to use that leads to I think, great simple statements of an imagined better future state and your role in getting there. So I can talk about that a little bit if it's a-\nLenny (00:51:28):\nYeah, let's do it. That sounds too good to pass up.\nBen Williams (00:51:31):\n-Cool. So the vision is the nirvana state that you aim to enable for your users and customers in five to 10 years. It's something that could equally be enabled by your competitors if you don't execute effectively or efficiently or quickly enough. You can always prefix a vision statement with in the future, dot, dot dot.\n(00:51:52):\nNow it's something that should be bound to your target market. So not too wide and not too narrow. And critically it should not mention your company, your product, or anything solution related at all. Completely agnostic of those things.\n(00:52:05):\nAnd then the mission, that's the thing that you are going to relentlessly iterate on to take you incrementally closer to the nirvana state described in the vision. It should answer how you'll realize the vision by describing what your fundamental approach will be. In other words, what you will do and how you'll do it. It should ideally aim to encode any unique differentiating advantage you have. So if I think about Snyk at large when it comes to advantage, we might mention our unequal security intelligence and knowledge of application context.\n(00:52:36):\nAnd one of the neat things about this framework is if you find utility in doing so, you can apply it at every level from the company level all the way down to individual team. It doesn't mean the process is not difficult and you need to spend a lot of time, but it gives you this set of kind of a framework, a set of bounds that help you really come out with world crafted statements that kind of stand the test of time.\nLenny (00:53:00):\nIs there an example you could share of the mission vision, whether it's Snyk or something else?\nBen Williams (00:53:03):\nYeah, yeah. I'll give you one for the growth group of Snyk. So great. The vision, every developer securely unleashes their creativity and the mission is to connect every developer and their organizations to the value of the Snyk platform with frictionless self-serve, adoption and expansion.\nLenny (00:53:19):\nInteresting how the vision is so big beyond Snyk's current focus. And to your point, this kind of trickle down, right? There's a company vision and mission and it's the growth team's mission vision.\nBen Williams (00:53:32):\nYep.\nLenny (00:53:32):\nAwesome.\nBen Williams (00:53:32):\nExactly.\nLenny (00:53:34):\nI want to shift a bit and talk about your product work. So we've talked a lot about the growth org. I'm curious what the broader product org looks like. How many teams do you have? How do you structure it? Is it like product focused, user focused, outcome focused? And then just how does that team work with the growth team?\nBen Williams (00:53:53):\nSure. Happy to go into a bunch of that stuff. I know I'd mentioned earlier kind of three areas of building a growth team. I don't know if you want me to cover those other two. 'Cause we talked about-\nLenny (00:54:02):\nOh yeah, okay, let's do that. Let's finish that thread.\nBen Williams (00:54:05):\n-Cool. So people and process was the first and we'll cover process really quickly. I think on the process side, at a minimum here you need well understood, documented growth processes, practices, working cadences. Teams in growth need to work differently in some ways from R and D teams working on core product, assuming otherwise, and just giving growth responsibility to an existing team without working with them to implement appropriate ways of working. I think it's a common track.\n(00:54:31):\nIdeally you get to a point there where the growth process is something that's continually refined and iterated on trying to build in more predictability. But what I've found I think most singularly most important in a growth process is facilitating a rapid learning cadence and providing the means to socialize those learnings, surfacing them in the right place at the right time so they can be leveraged and at the context. And if you think about experimentation, it's not about delivering outcomes it's about generating learnings that the organization can leverage effectively to deliver outcomes.\n(00:55:05):\nMight not be now, might not be tomorrow or some point in the future. But the sad reality is that without good process learnings easily end up unused and gathering dust. And you have to ask then what was the point? So as people in process and you know when that's on the right track, when you start to see enthusiastic sharing of learnings, when you see regular contribution of ideas coming from everyone in the form of well crafted hypotheses that are based on data and learnings. And when you see a wide variety of folks, just assuming end to end ownership of managing and running experiments instead of delegating that to the product manager or an engineer and tech lead. So yeah, that's people in process and strategy is-\nLenny (00:55:48):\nLet me throw in a question real quick before we get to the last piece.\nBen Williams (00:55:50):\nSure.\nLenny (00:55:51):\nSo learnings, just to kind of touch on that. I've heard more and more pushback on the idea of learnings being an outcome. Because a lot of... As a leader, you're not going to be like, Cool, we learned so many things but nothing really got done. How do you think about the tension between, yeah, learnings we want to learn, but we also want to move metrics, grow the business and learnings are a way to inform decisions more than even just learn. How do you think about that kind of balance?\nBen Williams (00:56:17):\nUltimately you're there to create impact, right? There's no getting away from that, but learnings is the means. It's the same as, there's a quote that I love from [inaudible 00:56:27] around focus on the user's path to value not on monetization. Because if you focus on the form of the latter will follow, and that's the same thing with learnings and impact here. If you try and focus on the impact itself might struggle. If you focus on the things you need in terms of learnings to take you step by step, that will pave the path to creating impact.\nLenny (00:56:47):\nI imagine your OKRs and goals are still like move this metrics some percentage, but you think of that as an output and the input is let's learn a bunch of stuff about what works and doesn't work and use that to inform what we're going to double down on.\nBen Williams (00:57:00):\nExactly. Yeah.\nLenny (00:57:00):\nSweet. Okay.\nBen Williams (00:57:02):\nYou got to focus on when you build a strategic opportunity, you are thinking about the outcomes, but you don't just go right to the end state. You've got to think about what's the quickest way we can test this hypothesis? And from there, what we learn from that and what do we take into the next set of the next set of experiments and it... You're paving this path along the way. You kind of that rough destination. How you get there, you don't know at the start. And that's what the path that the learnings take you on.\nLenny (00:57:31):\nCool. Okay. And then strategy we're talking about.\nBen Williams (00:57:34):\nStrategy. Yeah, so strategy, it's a good one. At a very basic level, you need to be able to answer questions. How do you acquire users? How do you retain users? How do you monetize them? I know you talked with Elena on that in more depth, but from there you need more detail. It's going to guide the growth teams and where they look for strategic opportunity, how they approach that. The best way I've found to articulate a growth strategy that fulfills the promise of usefully guiding the team's execution, it's the loop based model, Reforge, as specific kind of documentation that I think is great around that.\n(00:58:15):\nBeing able to identify the various micro and macro loops, how they're all connected, being able to document them in a qualitative model to communicate a shared understanding of how you grow. It's really powerful. Augmenting that then with the quantitative side of things, that helps guide quarter to quarter focus and ensure you can be intentional about where you're investing. That becomes a big enabler.\n(00:58:40):\nYou're never going to have a shortage of ideas in a high performing growth team. So knowing where to focus amidst that kind of sea of ideas is a really important role of the strategy and fairly on, you'll probably have one or two core loops, but inevitably you'll need to layer on and connect new ones over time. And having a framework for doing that and having a framework for regularly revisiting that in the context of growth, team learnings, changes in broader company strategy, evolution of the product, new features being added, and so on. Market shifts, that becomes a big up level for teams to be able to create timely impact.\n(00:59:19):\nSo the model you create there is what enables you to know at any time where the biggest constraints to your growth are and allows you to balance your growth investments accordingly. It's neat for sure. We've had times where we've focused on a broad set of constraints and opportunities and other times where we've had a much narrower focus. For example, on driving improvement to activation and engagement, even more narrowed like doing that through empty states, for example.\nLenny (00:59:44):\nI want to unpack the strategy piece real quick. How do you operationalize this idea of you have this growth model, growth loop, you figured out here's the ways we're growing. How do you tactically connect that to a strategy? Is it, here's how we're growing, here's where we're going to focus this quarter, optimize this part of the loop, or is there some other way? You write it down, basically.\nBen Williams (01:00:05):\nVery simply, it's first of all alignment on how you grow the different loops, how they work, the roles of different teams and the roles that they play in fueling those loops and getting them to spin faster. I think that's the first thing, having that common vocabulary and understanding.\n(01:00:25):\nSecond is understanding the way they work in terms of what is constraining them, what are the inputs to them? What are the opportunities for making those loops spin faster? How can multiple loops work together in a macro context?\n(01:00:41):\nAnd particularly using the data there to be able to identify and understand and get alignment around where are the biggest constraints in your growth model overall and therefore where are the things that we need to focus on as a team over the next quarter or two quarters, and so on.\n(01:01:01):\nAnd that it's constantly changing. As I mentioned, there's a bunch of stuff that needs to feed back into that model in terms of growth loop performance or the learnings you're making and so on. That means it's changing and you're constantly reevaluating and it's guiding kind of quarter to quarter planning.\nLenny (01:01:19):\nCool. So just to make it even more concrete for folks that are listening. So one of your loops is this integration with GitHub where you automatically fix their code and create a PR. You may find at some point somebody clicking that link to becoming a user is too high friction, too many people are falling out. So one strategy for one of say the activation team could be we're going to optimize this part of the funnel. So when clicking from GitHub to sign up as a user and get them to a point where they found value, right?\nBen Williams (01:01:48):\nYep. That exactly that sort of thing. Or earlier on, for example, it might have been with that taken that same example of that same loop, and this is sufficiently far in the past that it's easy for me to talk about. But we start with GitHub. We want to now expand the scope of that loop. We've seen success with it. We see the performance of that loop growing, but we think there's opportunity in saying let's expand that by adding support for Bitbucket. And now all of a sudden we spin up that same loop with Bitbucket and then GitLab and so on.\nLenny (01:02:20):\nAwesome. Okay. We could go a whole hour on just that piece, so we'll move on and we'll save that for feed two.\nBen Williams (01:02:26):\nData was the last thing. And growth team just can't function without data that even with early stage products, before you have the needed volume of traffic to be able to run formal tests in reasonable timeframes, you still need to have signals that help you learn and inform your decisions, both quantum and of course qu through speaking with users. My advice there is really just to invest early the infrastructure, the tooling then at a given scale, the dedicated people as well. They're going to be core to building out the growth team and they'll enable data to ultimately pretty much inform all critical decisions.\n(01:03:01):\nSo Snyk was interesting that we didn't have a problem of not having enough data. In fact, there was an abundance of data, like too much. We collected absolutely everything. And the problem I identified very early was that we didn't have enough behavioral specific data and we weren't intentional enough about the data that we were collecting and how we were collecting it, which made the data hard to trust and that becomes a big problem.\n(01:03:26):\nSo we invested in tooling and processes for building out event tracking plans, and now we test conformance to schema of the instrumented code in our CI processes. So we have absolute confidence in the data. So that was getting to a point of trustworthy behavioral data was absolutely key.\n(01:03:43):\nBut the reason I say invest early here is that to remember that it also takes time to accrue enough data that you can learn about and make some key decisions around retention, for example. Also that you have enough data to run regressions on, be able to inform definition of your activation metrics or engagement states and so on. So the earlier you can start collecting the better. So yeah, people in process a strategy and data and you absolutely need all of those things to build and run an affected growth team.\n(01:04:14):\nWhen you get all of those things working, it's like rocket fuel for focus creativity, but at the same time slowing down to put the maturity in place as on all scales at the pace Snyk has it's pretty much impossible. You still have to get stuff done while you're kind of building all that stuff out. You have to accept that you're going to make a bunch of mistakes along the way. You have to be a hundred percent comfortable with that. And you have to treat those mistakes as learning opportunities that provide leaves for improvement.\n(01:04:43):\nAnd it's also useful to... You know, asked about KPIs and what the team are responsible for it. And that is one way in which a growth team absolutely needs to make impact and it's the way that primarily they're going to be held accountable. But it's also I think, useful to think about the efficacy of the growth org, not just in terms of the impact they drive our experiments and new product experiences and on core growth pick KPIs, but also how they enable and uplevel the rest of the org.\n(01:05:10):\nSo for example, our entire product led sales process, it's powered by an evolving model that describes our understanding of users, teams, accounts, the usage and adoption patterns and signals, the best in form where and how our GTM teams focused. Insights from growth teams often have utility far beyond growth, but people can't know if something is useful to them if you haven't shared it with them. So the learnings made in the growth teams, even those from mistakes or failures, we socialize them widely and visibly.\n(01:05:41):\nWe want every R and D team to be leveraging experimentation where appropriate to learn to create business impact. So one of the things we did here is creating a paved row for adoption of behavioral analytics and experimentation stack, coach teams on getting started to make it as easy as possible for anyone to start to reap the benefits of the platform, built out internal education programs on data driven development, on experimentation, built internal tools to help with metrics design and so on.\n(01:06:08):\nAnd then building core platform services as well that are useful for people outside of growth. So we built services that power contextual onboarding, and originally that was the intent, but now those same services can be used anywhere in the product to give contextual experiences. I know that was a bit of a ramble, but hopefully there's one or two useful things in there.\nLenny (01:06:29):\nYeah, there's two things I wanted to quickly follow up and then we can talk about the product team. You said you socialize learnings and experiment results. Is there anything you could share there about tips to do that? You have a tool you do use that for? Is there someone posts stuff in Slack? Is it an email that goes out? How do you actually socialize learning such that say a salesperson can do something with it?\nBen Williams (01:06:50):\nYes. So there's, first of all, there's a bunch of Slack channels like Synk runs on Slack basically. So there's a bunch of Slack channels. Even when we're planning experiments, those are kind of wide and in the open and we invite collaboration on those. But from a ceremony perspective, we try hard to institutionalize ways to generate and leverage learnings. It's something I feel pretty strongly about. So we have these team level impact and learnings reviews loosely modeled from a blog years back down, I don't know... Six years I want to say that Brian Balfour wrote about a similar ceremony from these HubSpot days.\n(01:07:26):\nAnd if I had to pick one meeting that as the most important in the growth team, it would be this. The teams continuously document any learnings from data exploration, from experimentation, from user research and so on. They document that in their weekly impact and learnings document.\n(01:07:43):\nSome teams find it better to pair up and advanced into dedicated learning sessions to deep dive on specific relevant topics. But however it comes together, it's all put into that document.\n(01:07:53):\nWhen it comes to the meeting itself, it's usually run by the pm. Most of it is spent discussing learnings that have been documented, their implications, how they can be leveraged in follow up work, where they might have relevance to other teams and so on. For relatively smaller part of the meeting is also spent looking at key metrics. Some teams have actually split that out entirely into a separate meeting. And then no time at all is spent reviewing what the team have actually been doing. It's more on kind of the outcomes and the learning. So that's at the team level.\n(01:08:21):\nBut then we run that same meeting at the group level on a monthly basis. So that's run by the product engineering or marketing director for the growth group. And that's where all of the growth teams come together. They share some key learnings, can't share everything. Of course, what they're doing is picking specific learnings that have potential relevance in utility across the other teams. So also as a standing agenda item for our user research team to share what we call developer insights. That's one of my personal favorite meetings to attend. It's always recorded and socialize with the rest of the company afterwards. And yeah, I'd say that's really important, but there's a bunch of different ways in which we're filing out that information constantly.\nLenny (01:08:59):\nSo cool. And this is a meeting that anyone can come to like a sales person comes to.\nPART 3 OF 4 ENDS [01:09:04]\nLenny (01:09:03):\nAnd this is a meeting that anyone can come to like a sales person comes to see what interesting stuff the product team has learned recently from experiments. How cool. Would you be able to share a template of that document that you put together that we could include in the show notes?\nBen Williams (01:09:13):\nYeah, for sure.\nLenny (01:09:14):\nSweet. And then the meeting, you said it's run by basically like some of the product functions and ideas to share things they've learned in recent experiments, say in the past month.\nBen Williams (01:09:25):\nSo typically the team level ceremony, it's PM-led. That's from more from a facilitation perspective. The learnings are all brought forward by the various folks in the team and each one of them who's contributed to learning will talk about that learning with the group and facilitate the discussion from there. And then at the group level, those are read by the directors for the growth group and each team it might be an engineering lead, it might be a tech lead, it might be a designer, it might be the product manager. We'll talk about some key learnings from that month.\nLenny (01:09:56):\nMakes sense. If there's nothing PMs are good at, it's facilitating meetings. So that makes sense. Okay. And so that's a good segue to just chatting a bit about the product org. I'm curious just like how you structure the product team and then how that works with the growth team.\nBen Williams (01:10:10):\nThat's good. So the product org, what do you want to know?\nLenny (01:10:13):\nBroadly, how do you structure it? Just like how many teams do you have? Do you align it across by outcome or is it by surface area of a product? And then is the growth team like adjacent to this product org? Is it like a unit within the product org or is it integrated? But I don't think it is. So what does that look like org chart wise?\nBen Williams (01:10:34):\nI think we've got a fairly common pattern for how we structure our product and wider R&D org. So most of the org functional ownership-based, there are a lot of really complex domains in the core product. So having that localized knowledge is important to be able to own and run the code that teams ship. The growth teams, on the other hand, are structured by outcomes. We talked about that already. Owning areas like acquisition, activation, engagement, monetization. These outcomes and team remits change over time as we talked about. But the teams here are often working on areas of the product where they don't own the code, which I think is the key difference between how we structure our growth teams and product teams with some exceptions. One of the growth teams actually own the onboarding flows and so on. So that does require a lot of trust.\n(01:11:25):\nIt requires very transparent communication mechanisms built into how we work. One of the meetings that we have regularly is experiment plan reviews. They're ad hoc meetings. They're led by the experiment lead, could be the PM, could be anyone else in the team. But the important thing is a bunch of people will be invited there, especially stakeholders from other teams where we might be experimenting on their surfaces and that won't be the first time they've learned about this. We'd like to try and actually include them in co-designing the experiment plan so they're fully on board with it. But absolutely kind of inviting them into those experiment and views really key. If we're going to run an experiment on that surface, we need to make sure that everything in that experiment plan is watertight, especially from a scheduling perspective because the last thing we want is a week and a half into an experiment for some change to happen within that surface from the product team unaware that an experiment's happening and completely invalidate the experiment.\nLenny (01:12:26):\nCool. And then in terms of just org wise, do you have a lieutenant that is responsible for just say the product team and then someone responsible for the growth team or the directors report up to you and you have a bunch of reports? How's that structure?\nBen Williams (01:12:39):\nOh, so our CPO on the exec team [inaudible 01:12:43], he runs the entire product organization. He has four, I want to say VPs, that own different areas. So there's a couple of VPs that own different areas of the product. So first of all, our application security products. Secondly, our cloud security products. Third is platform. And fourth is what we call developer journeys, which is the area I own, which has a few groups within there, one of which being the growth group.\nLenny (01:13:13):\nGot it. Okay. Makes sense. Okay. There's just a couple more questions I want to ask that are very tactical specific before we get to a very exciting lightning round to close this out. One is with a freemium product, there's always this question of what to put into free and what to put into the paid plan. Is there anything you've learned about how to think about that? What should be in free and what should be behind a paywall?\nBen Williams (01:13:36):\nWas it on your show with Elena that she talked about things that promote your growth model being good to land in free and things that add friction? So I really like that guidance. I'll add that for many businesses there might be some cost of service element to consider as well. Providing a feature to free users is cost prohibitive due to the volume, then that's obviously something you're going to want to reserve for paid. Ultimately, that was the whole reason cited behind Heroku, recently removing their free plain entirely. I think your plans from free to the top, they should have well defined understanding of the target customer, the use cases they should map out or you should map out the motivations for motion between each. You're really clear about what are the drivers for someone to take a step from one plan to the next. For Snyk, the real drivers to move from free to a paid plan, for example, is when you want to secure business critical code and you start having needs around governance and compliance.\n(01:14:39):\nI think the other interesting dimension is of how you approach trials. Like with most things. I think we're still figuring that out at Snyk. I don't know that there's ever a perfect answer or even a correct answer here. Certainly different from product to product. We have a self-serve trial to support time box evaluation of some of the capabilities that are reserved for our paid plans. But we're intentional in revisiting the model periodically. It's important I think to regularly challenge yourselves to ensure you don't fall into the trap of simply assuming what was best fit in the past is best fit now and in the future. What if the trial duration was limited by some dimension of usage instead of time? Or what if we didn't have a trial at all but put more into the free plan with appropriate limits? How might making those changes impact our growth model?\n(01:15:27):\nIt's not always easy to answer those questions, but I think there are some ways that you could can help test there for example. You might cohort trial users and teams who have low engagement and don't convert during the trial and then when the trial ends, drop them back into a new enhanced freak plan and monitor engagement there. So there're some things you do, but I think that habit of continuously challenging yourselves and reevaluating whether the model, the specific delineations between the plans and how you support evaluation and the motion between those plans, I think it's really important to do that. And also when it comes to PLG and sales, we talked about the self-serve motion. Obviously, it's big and important for Snyk, but the sales led motion critically large as well and significantly impactful. You need to think about the plan design and those motions across both aspects of PLG and the sales led motion. When you have a strong PLG foundation that is inclusive of a product-led sales motion, you're going to be in a really powerful position from the perspective of having a significant volume of highly qualified leads that are coming from the product. We actually track a metric that we call product-driven revenue, which basically accounts for all revenue in customers where we saw meaningful value-based activity in the product before there was any sales contact. And that really tells actually a super interesting story about the PLG efficiency of your company across all revenue channels, self-serve and sales-led. And what's fascinating there is that the product-driven cohort contribute a relatively greater amount to net retention. So when you think about packaging, you know really need to think about and understand that macro level contribution of the freemium motion and know what you're trying to optimize for balancing revenue today versus potential future revenue.\nLenny (01:17:28):\nIs that increase in net revenue retention from product-led leads mostly because they start at a cheaper price, do you think? Or is it more that they just end up being better customers?\nBen Williams (01:17:40):\nIt's a great question. I'm not sure I have a good answer for that.\nLenny (01:17:45):\nNo problem.\nBen Williams (01:17:46):\nI'm still trying to figure that out.\nLenny (01:17:48):\nIt's a good prompt to have people adding more customers in seats. You talked about the importance to figure out the trial length and what to put in the trial and free and things like that. Is there anything that just has surprised you? Something you've learned from iterating on that comes to mind?\nBen Williams (01:18:04):\nI wouldn't say surprised me per se, but it's something that I think it's perhaps obvious in retrospect and that is that companies of different sizes, of different complexities of different industries from those that are very highly regulated to the other end of the spectrum, they're going to take different lengths of time to need to evaluate properly. So being able to cater for those in some way, whether it might be dynamic trial lengths or whether it be trial lengths that are based on usage or things like that, I think it becomes really important. That's something to be thinking about for sure.\nLenny (01:18:47):\nAwesome. That's a great learning. I know Elena talks a lot about how trials often, screw you because you don't give people enough time to really evaluate it a company, so that makes sense. Last tactical question that I wanted to touch on is around activation milestones. I'm doing a survey right now with Yuri that I think will come out before this episode airs. But anyway, in real time, I'm curious how you think about setting what the activation milestone is for a new Snyk user. So maybe just share briefly how you think about what is an activation milestone? Why is that important? And then how you define that for Snyk? What is the milestone of a user is activated for your product?\nBen Williams (01:19:28):\nFirst of all, what is activation? So for us, activation is indicative of the team forming a habit around the usage of Snyk. And when I say the usage, I actually mean deriving core value, which is ultimately fixing vulnerabilities. It's not just logging in. It's not even just finding vulnerabilities, it's fixing vulnerabilities. So building a habit around that. And the reason I say team instead of using them is, and we actually base most of our definitions of activation engagement around teams. It's really important because ultimately security is a team sport. That team might be one person, which case a user is equivalent to team, but often a team is multiple people and we actually expect different people to fulfill different parts of the team activation journey.\n(01:20:17):\nWe also want to enumerate aggregate level activity around fix that sometimes happens off-platform where we can't explicitly measure it at the user level. So in the activation process, we have set up moments, aha moments and habit moments and our habit moments that we define as a team being activated, it's related to fixing vulnerabilities within 30 days of team creation. And the reason that is chosen, it's because there is a significant correlation with downstream. And in that case with activation three month retention and retention again based on, again, not just coming back and logging in but still fixing. So teams, that fix of vulnerability within their first 30 days are much more likely to still be fixing three months later.\nLenny (01:21:09):\nThat's really interesting. I love that. How did you come up with that number? Was there a decision scientist that looked at some inflection of at 30 days, and it's probably not exactly 30 in real life, but it's like a nice round number that's close enough, right?\nBen Williams (01:21:24):\nYep, that's it. So there absolutely was a decision scientist in involved thankfully. We had to collect a lot of baseline data first. So after we built out the data platform, we needed actually to wait for bit to build a good data set. We did a huge amount of quantum analysis, a lot of splunking of the data, applying ML models along with a bunch of supporting call research as well. But we started really with identifying the corpus personas and they used cases, different roles of different users within the team based activation journey, defining our retention metric, which is still fixing. It's whether a team is fixed. Along with natural usage behavior and expected natural usage frequency. And then we found the habit moment that ultimately most strongly correlated with improved long-term retention. And most of the numbers side of things came out of our ML ops platform.\n(01:22:19):\nBut after that, we then worked back to figure out that's the habit moment. That's what we see as activation, but there's a set of steps that teams need to get there. So what's the aha moment before that? What's the setup moment and what are the individual steps that the team needs to go through to reach that set up moment? So that's the overall process and ultimately it's a really strong model that allows us then to feed in the set of user level behaviors that we know can influence those different steps on that path to activation.\nLenny (01:22:50):\nAwesome. I'm excited to get this post out and that's a really good anecdote of how a company comes up with it and what they set. I also just thought of another question I may start asking everybody. I know I keep saying we're going to wrap this up, but here's a question and if it doesn't work, we'll get rid of it. You mentioned a bunch of tools that you use and I'm curious, if you had to think of what are the five most important/valuable SaaS products to your organization other than the obvious ones like Salesforce? What comes to mind?\nBen Williams (01:23:21):\nWhen you say organization, do you mean Snyk at large or do you mean the growth?\nLenny (01:23:25):\nLet's say, let's start with growth and see where it goes.\nBen Williams (01:23:27):\nOkay. So I'm going to say Amplitude, first of all. Segment as a means to be able to get our data from the products to Amplitude and to everywhere else that cares about it. Whether that be a downstream BI system, Snowflake can looker on top of that, or system marketing automation systems like Marketo and stuff like that. So I'd say Amplitude. I will next say full story, which is absolutely fantastic for session replays of course. And it bridges that gap between [inaudible 01:24:11]. I would say userinterviews.com, which is comparable to usertesting.com, both of them amazing services in terms of getting fast curated access to individuals to participate in user research. Sprig is another one. So Sprig is a fantastic in-app survey platform, which is what we primarily use it for, but it also does a bunch of other cool stuff in terms of being able to test UX designs as well in-app. How many have I said?\nLenny (01:24:49):\nI think four. If there's anything else, you could add a fifth. If not, we can move on. That's awesome. This is a really interesting list.\nBen Williams (01:24:55):\nI'll stick it at four.\nLenny (01:24:56):\nOkay. Is there anything for in the wider product team that also comes to mind that you guys find useful?\nBen Williams (01:25:02):\nAirtable. In fact, Airtable for growth and product, just so flexible. It's just you can do anything. And in fact, if we think about growth, I should have mentioned that first because that's where we keep most of our experiment plans and knowledge base and our user research base.\nLenny (01:25:18):\nOkay. I like this question. I'm going to start asking it. This is great. Okay. That was a precursor tour, very exciting lightning round. I'm just going to ask you a bunch of rapid fire questions, just answer whatever comes to mind. We'll keep it short and quick. Question one, what are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\nBen Williams (01:25:34):\nI have been dreading this question as there are too many. So I'm pick a couple that I've enjoyed reading in recent months. So for product and growth geeks like me, or in fact anyone with more than a passing interest in data, I'll recommend \"How to Measure Anything\" by Douglas Hubbard. Second up, you had Marty Cagan and he mentioned the book \"Sprint\" by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky and I love that book, but personally their \"Make Time\" book. It was something that radically changed my relationship with information and I recommend that to all time staff, product people out there. And for number three, I'm going to say, \"This is How They Tell Me the World Ends\" by Nicole Perlroth, which gives an amazing view into the world of digital espionage.\nLenny (01:26:22):\nOh, I read that book. Tim Ferris recommended that at one point. That is a wild ass book. Very beautiful. Cool. I love these recommendations. All right. Great choices. Favorite podcast other than the podcast you're currently on\nBen Williams (01:26:37):\nMaybe \"Acquired\" with Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal. I just wish I had enough time to listen to them all.\nLenny (01:26:43):\nThey're very long. I was just at an event where they interviewed someone live as a live podcast. That was very cool. Those guys were pros. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\nBen Williams (01:26:54):\nSo a movie, \"Turning Red\" on Disney Plus, which we love watching with our kids. It was just fun. TV show, the most recent Curb Season had me in tears as usual.\nLenny (01:27:03):\nThey haven't had a new one in a while. So that's a little bit out there.\nBen Williams (01:27:09):\nThe new one's coming.\nLenny (01:27:10):\nOh, it is? I don't love watching that show. My wife loves it. Cringe, painful. But watch it anyway.\nBen Williams (01:27:19):\nAnd my wife's actually the same. She can't watch it because she cringes too much.\nLenny (01:27:23):\nWe're reverse.\nBen Williams (01:27:24):\nI love the awkwardness.\nLenny (01:27:25):\nOh man. It's good for a product leader to have that enjoyment. Favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates?\nBen Williams (01:27:34):\nGive a couple here if it's not cheating too much. First is one I like to ask when hiring for anyone actually really it's fast forward three years. What's different about you then? A lot of people will default to telling you where they aspire to be in terms of role or title, but what I'm really looking for is signals of humility, of self-awareness around areas of personal and professional growth. So people who can be open about where they think they need to work on to grow themselves as people. I love that. Also, so there's just generally throughout interviews, I'm looking for curiosity. So day-to-day good PMs will be asking why as much as my six year old son does, which is a lot. So I'll try and discern that through the course of the conversation. It's not really a question, but something I'm looking for.\n(01:28:27):\nAnd then maybe I want to flip it because building on something that Adam Fishman was saying, his theme of evaluating the people dimension of folks you are potentially going to work with when you're interviewing with a company. And this was a question I got asked myself recently by a candidate, which I just thought would brilliant, and that was, \"Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with?\" And it just felt like a really great way for them to be able to test alignment of their personal values with those of someone they'd be working with really closely. So I love that.\nLenny (01:29:01):\nAwesome. By the way, I love how many callbacks to other episodes you're making. You're definitely a power adopter of the podcast and I really appreciate that.\nBen Williams (01:29:09):\nOkay, there we go.\nLenny (01:29:11):\nLast question. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader, as a leader in general?\nBen Williams (01:29:17):\nSo maybe I'll cheat on this one a bit too, and I'm not going to combine it to the, when you say industry, I think security industry, but I'm going to look at the product domain and specifically product operations. And in my mind, there's not many people who know more in this area than Christine [inaudible 01:29:34]. So if you ever get chance to talk with her, I know that would be a fun conversation. Many gems would be dropped, I think.\nLenny (01:29:40):\nWow. I will get her on this podcast. That is my new goal. I had not heard of her and that's awesome. Thank you for the suggestion. Ben, this has been awesome. So many nuggets and stories and insights. I so appreciate you being here. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or learn more or maybe come work at Snyk? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\nBen Williams (01:30:04):\nFirstly, I'm of course want to say a big thanks for having me on, Lenny. I love talking about all this stuff and really appreciate you being willing to let me bend your ear a little bit. As to finding me, I'm a bit of a Twit when it comes to Twitter. I generally spend a bit more time over at LinkedIn, but you can find me on both of those platforms @SemanticBen. And in terms of how people can be useful to me, I'm starting to take on some additional clients in advisory capacity, so feel free to get in touch if you think I could help.\nLenny (01:30:36):\nI can't not ask about Symantec Ben and what the story is there and before we let you go.\nBen Williams (01:30:41):\nSure. It's actually when I was at IBM, it was a focus that I had on linked data.\nLenny (01:30:48):\nBecame Semantic Ben. All right. Awesome. All right. Ben, thank you so much for being here and thanks for listening.\nBen Williams (01:30:56):\nThanks, Lenny. Take care.\nLenny (01:30:59):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How marketplaces win: Liquidity, growth levers, quality, more | Benjamin Lauzier (Lyft, Thumbtack)\n\n## Transcript\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:00:00):\nI think when you're running a marketplace, you tend to sit in your ivory tower a little bit, looking at stats and thinking like, \"If only we could get people to do X, it'd be better for everyone.\" I certainly did that in my career. I think that's missing the point that we're humans, and I think sometimes we act in ways that are non-deterministic or counterintuitive. But my take is I'm a huge believer in market forces and empowerment, so provide guardrails for what a good experience is in your marketplace, set a clear bar for quality, and provide the right coaching and tools for supply to be successful, and then take a step back and see where the gaps are and invest more in hands-on tactics just to close those gaps more specifically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):\nToday my guest is Ben Lauzier. Ben was VP of product and growth at Thumbtack, where he rebuilt the product team and Thumbtack's growth strategy, re-architected the revenue model, and helped 3X Thumbtack's growth within three years. Prior to Thumbtack, Ben was at Lyft for over six years, where he was employee number 30 and led product and growth for the driver's side of the business, and at one point reached 1% of U.S. workers driving for Lyft every month. He currently spends his time advising marketplace teams and founders, teaching a reforged course on marketplace growth, and most recently started a healthcare company called Nurra that connects you to a care advocate to help you navigate the healthcare system in the U.S. In our conversation, we go many layers deep on the many key elements of building and scaling a marketplace business, including what to focus on pre-product market fit, how to know which side of the marketplace to prioritize, what product market fit looks like, how to track liquidity, what causes most marketplaces to fail and how to avoid that.\n\n(00:01:43):\nAnd a bunch of examples of really clever growth strategies, especially on the supply side, and some really interesting stories about how Lyft was able to compete with Uber early on with one-tenth of the resources. As a bonus, Ben also shares insights into how the European product market is different from the U.S. product market, and what he encourages European companies to change in order to operate more effectively and be more innovative. This episode is for anyone building or thinking about building a marketplace business.

With that, I bring you Ben Lauzier. \n\n(00:02:26):\nBen, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:02:29):\nThank you so much, so good to be here. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:32):\nIt's absolutely my pleasure. Okay, so you are one of the most knowledgeable and experienced product leaders in the world on building and scaling a marketplace company, and so I want to spend the bulk of our time talking about and essentially extracting as much wisdom out of your brain on how to build and scale a marketplace business so that founders and teams that are struggling with building their marketplace company, or just thinking about building a marketplace business, can save a lot of time and a lot of pain. How does that sound to you?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:03:03):\nThat sounds amazing. That's a high bar, but I will try to live up to your expectations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:08):\nI'm confident we will hit that bar. Let me start with just setting a little context, and for folks that aren't super familiar with what is a marketplace business, they hear this term marketplace company, what's the simplest way to understand what makes a company a marketplace company and a marketplace business?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:03:24):\nI mean, like you mentioned, I love marketplaces. I think I've been building and scaling marketplaces for I think almost 15 years now, and I feel like they add just such a fascinating dimension to the challenge that we work on as PMs, and it's this hidden dimension that you uncover when you work on marketplaces. And I think on paper what makes a marketplace is pretty straightforward, it's two or more sides that are distinct from one another, and they provide value to each other, and then you have an intermediary trying to facilitate that exchange of value in the middle. So, that's pretty simple explanation. I think in practice it's always a little bit more nuanced on the fringes. You have all those interesting dimensions, like how involved is the intermediary defines how managed the marketplace is. So, something like Craigslist is super hands-off, unmanaged, and something like Lyft starts to be more into the semi-managed where the platform significantly shapes the transaction in this exchange of value. So, I think that's how I see it, but there's all those fascinating variations of marketplaces, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:25):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth, and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more, with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. \n\n(00:05:18):\nEppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's get E-P-P-O dot com slash Lenny. This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the developer platform for building native customer-facing integrations with third-party apps. Our native integrations on your product roadmap, whether it's to ingest context from your users' external data and documents, or to sync data and automate tasks across your users' other apps, integrations are mission-critical for B2B software products today. \n\n(00:06:06):\nBut building these integrations in-house cost an average of three months of engineering, according to the 2024 State of Integration survey, which results in difficult roadmap tradeoffs. This is why engineering teams at Copy.ai, AI21, and over 100 other B2B SaaS companies use Paragon so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The result? They've shipped integrations seven times faster, all while avoiding the never-ending maintenance that comes with rolling your own integrations. Visit useparagon.com/lenny to see how Paragon can help you accelerate your product's integration roadmap today, and get $1,000 in credit on their pro and enterprise plans. That's use P-A-R-A-G-O-N dot com.\n\n(00:06:52):\nYou've mentioned managed marketplaces and just how that becomes something marketplaces start to think about more, I want to get back to that because a really important point. But just to even clarify this point, a key part of a marketplace is that the company doesn't own the supply. That's in a sense what defines their marketplace versus they're just selling stuff.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:07:12):\nTotally. Yes, yes. And I think again, you have companies that claim to be managed marketplaces, I think depending on how you want to look, with investors perhaps, you'll pick one angle or the other, but that's where you get into gray waters. But yeah, the marketplace implies this concept of two independent and supposedly autonomous parties that you help connect and provide this exchange of value for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:40):\nAwesome. Okay, so let's come back to that, because that's a really important topic and it's something that every marketplace trends towards or thinks about is just like we're going to control the supply, we're going to manage it, we're going to maybe own it in the future, but let's get back to that. So, you work with a ton of marketplaces, you've built a bunch of marketplaces. What do you find is the biggest struggle to building a successful marketplace business? The most common problem people run into.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:08:05):\nI think there's two types of challenges, I guess there's when you're talking about creating a marketplace, and then there's when you're talking about scaling a marketplace. For creating a marketplace, I see many founders that are pre-product market fit, super eager to nerd out on marketplace dynamics. They're super excited to launch a marketplace, we all are, and they want to talk about supply and demand, they want to look at all kinds of ratios. They show me economic papers and ask, \"How could we apply this principle to my company?\" And here, my advice is generally always, \"If you don't have product market fit, and if you don't have a good enough growth strategy for at least one side of your marketplace, just forget about all this marketplace stuff.\"\n\n(00:08:46):\nFocus on this core exchange of value, go deep with one side of the marketplace and see if you can rely on some crutch, some hack for the other side for time being. And you see companies like Airbnb and Thumbtack doing this with Craigslist pretty early on to jumpstart their growth as just countless examples, but don't get distracted by this shiny and cool intellectually challenging idea of working on the marketplace, and nail the basics of your product market fit at first.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:13):\nSo, just to spend a little more time there to make this even more real. So, you're saying that pre-product market fit, before you find that anyone really wants what you're building, focus on figuring out a way to grow one side of the marketplace. So, maybe just two quick follow up questions. How do you know which side to focus on initially? And can you give an example, I think Thumbtack may be a good example of this, of how they did that?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:09:38):\nWhich side to focus on is there's different approaches to this, but generally people will pick the hardest side. And so, I'll take the example of Thumbtack, because we're going to talk about it. So, Thumbtack is a home services marketplace to help you find plumbers, electricians, and the harder side there was demand. There's supply, and you can look for, you can open the yellow pages, you can find plumbers somewhere, but the hardest question was can we go out there and can we find people who want to do something in their house, who have projects that need to be done? What is the core growth strategy for us to acquire those people, to find them? And what kind of retention can we create? Can we create a delightful experience for them to come back to our platform and want us to take care of their home for them?\n\n(00:10:32):\nPick the hardest side is my advice. And then, how some companies do this, again, I think there's a lot of different ways to do this, but a common advice is find a way to jumpstart one side. Find a way to hack one side, play one player mode is what it's also called sometimes, but try to find a way to tap into existing channels that have one side of your marketplace already latent. And so again, you have countless businesses that if you've been built off of Craigslist, I think Thumbtack was partially one of them, and the idea was like, \"Hey, we can find all those great pros on Thumbtack. When we have someone who wants a job, 'Oh, you want your kitchen remodeled?' We can, behind the scenes, go and post a job on Craigslist and then we'll bring on all the contractors who are browsing Craigslist looking for jobs, we'll bring them to our platform.\" \n\n(00:11:26):\nThat's an example of how that you worry about the core value proposition of can we get people to come back to the platform? Can we create this delightful exchange of value? Are people trusting us? Do we have the right checks in place to make sure that you are hiring the right person? What will make you come back? And once that's done, then you can focus around how do I build a flywheel on the supply side, and how do I manage and how do I make sure I have enough plumbers per market, or something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:53):\nWhen you say find the hard side, how do you find that? Any advice you can give founders and teams?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:11:58):\nIn general, I would say intuitively the teams know, especially the teams are in the weeds, they know. They know, \"Well, yeah, we can get X. But what we really struggle with is getting students to look at this.\" That's your sign. And I think sometimes it takes someone else to make you think about it, to reflect like, \"Actually, yes, you're right. This side is obvious. We know how to get it, we just don't have the right supply for it and we don't know where to find the supply.\" Boom, that's the side that you should be focused on. Then you find a way to add source to demand, subsidize it, find some other way, and focus on this side that you have no idea how to grow. You should have a reliable growth strategy for the side.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:39):\nIn my experience, it's almost always the supply side is what you need to work on, because once you have awesome supply, people are going to be really excited to tap it. Like Uber drivers, Airbnb homes, professionals on Thumbtack. Is that your experience too?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:12:54):\nYes. I would say supply is the hardest side maybe like 80% to 90% of the time. Yeah, I totally agree. I was trying to think of counter examples, but I can't think of one. I just know that there are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:05):\nThere's one I know, which is Rover, based on research I did, because it turned out it was really easy to find people who want to walk dogs and watch dogs for 50 bucks an hour or whatever. It was a very easy value prop, and so they had a waitlist, they had just so many people. Also, TaskRabbit is the one I know about where they had so many people wanting to be taskers, whatever they call them-\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:13:24):\nI was going to mention TaskRabbit as well. I heard of that as well, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:27):\nOkay. And then you talked about there's a core part of figuring out how to grow that part, how to grow the hard part, generally the supply side. You shared a couple examples. Are there any more clever things you recall that you might be able to share of just ways people grew supply early on that could inspire people that are trying to figure this out right now?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:13:46):\nYeah, I think there's a couple of common tactics I would say pretty early on that I think companies rely on. So, we've talked about jump-starting one side of the marketplace with, it may be with Thumbtack and Lyft, also leverage job boards. You have also a lot of companies building value added services pretty early on as a core way of retaining supply pretty early on. Like let's build a really compelling basket of value for this supply, and this is going to be the thing that appeals everyone. So, OpenTable did this really well with all the restaurant services, other things that I've seen people use really well early on or converting your supply into demand or demand into supply pretty early on, so Lyft, we tried that. It actually didn't work at Lyft, but I know other marketplaces have been pretty successful with that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:44):\nJust to make sure people understand that one, it's a really interesting one is, in the Lyft example would be convincing drivers to become riders, convincing riders to become drivers, and mostly the latter, convincing riders to become drivers.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:14:55):\nYeah, exactly. In our case at Lyft early on, we had a waitlist on the demand side because we just couldn't onboard enough supply. And so, we had this idea of having a pop-up. Instead of saying no drivers available, it would be like, \"Hey, sorry, all the drivers are taken. People are making 50 bucks an hour right now, do you want to hop on your car and drive?\" And we had some conversions, but it felt a little distracting to the overall experience and it wasn't a huge driver of supply. But I know that for Uber it actually was. I think they had a relatively meaningful amount of supply coming from [inaudible 00:15:27]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:27):\nWow, how does that make you feel that Uber figured out a better way to approach this and made it work? That doesn't feel-\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:15:33):\nAnd it's a different audience. You would think that the Lyft passenger and driver is more likely to flip back and forth between the two. I don't know, I don't know. [inaudible 00:15:47]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:46):\nYeah, a PM at Uber outdid you guys. Oh, no. \n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:15:50):\nYes, on a couple of other things. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:52):\nInteresting. \n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:15:52):\nAnd we outdid them on a few other things [inaudible 00:15:55]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:54):\nOkay, okay. That's right. So, essentially what we've been spending some time on here is just when you're starting a marketplace, figure out which side you need to drive, because that's what will unlock this opportunity. There's a hard thing that nobody's ever done before, and most of the time it's build a bunch of supply that nobody has done before, and there's all these tactics to do that. And all of this is, as you coming back to the main question I asked, we've gone on this awesome tangent, is pre-product market fit before you even know this is a thing. Spend time most of the time building supply to see if demand, customers actually want this thing. Right?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:16:34):\nExactly. And then I think there's a different set of challenges. The other pitfall that I see is, so pre-product market fit, people tend to be distracted by those marketplace dynamics like we talked about instead of doing what we just talked about. For companies that have some sort of scale and product market fit, to me the place where I see people getting tripped up most often is the concept of marketplace liquidity or how to match the health of a marketplace. To me, liquidity is how marketplaces win. It's this measure of your ability to match buyers and sellers efficiently, it's how quickly and efficiently people can find what they're looking for on your platform. So, you can picture a Venn diagram. One circle is this is what supply wants to sell, and another circle is this is what demand wants to buy, and your liquidity is the overlap between those two circles.\n\n(00:17:26):\nSo for, let's take the example of Lyft or Uber, because we talked about them. It might be for all the people who open the app with the intention to book a ride, how many of those actually turn into a ride? And this metric liquidity, it's a direct multiplier on the efficiency of your marketplace. It's literally at the center of your vision, it's why you exist as a marketplace is to connect the two. And it's also the ultimate engagement loop. The more supply you have, the more choice people have, the better the services, the more likely it is that it turns into a transaction and the more likely it is that they come back. And so, it's really this incredible circle. And what I see is people missing how critical this component is in the marketplace, struggle to define it for the business, and most importantly struggle to build an actionable playbook against it. Like, \"Okay, how do I manage this? Okay, it's important, but what do I do about it?\" Basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:21):\nIs there a metric you recommend people specifically look at to understand liquidity?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:18:26):\nI think the metric that I like the most is a predictor of liquidity. So your liquidity might be, it's typically a measure of demand utilization. It might be looking for something on there, maybe how many of those searches with intent actually turn into a transaction. So, it's your field rate of your intentful demand typically, and that's really indicative of the net output of your marketplace. And so, that gives you a sense of the health of your marketplace, but it can be influenced by a whole bunch of different factors. So, if you think about for Thumbtack, it can be influenced by if there's a snowstorm out there, if the competition is bidding, there's a whole bunch of exogenous factors that come into play. And the metric that I think is slightly more actionable is a little harder to define, but so much more helpful in my opinion.\n\n(00:19:19):\nIt's what I call a market health metric, and this is basically think of your proxy that is the best predictor of your liquidity. So, I'll use the example of Lyft. You have your liquidity is your demand utilization, it's how many app opens turn into a ride, and what predicts this? What will predict you and deciding to book a ride? For Lyft and for Uber, it was ETAs. So, we knew that if the closest driver was at least two minutes away from you or closer, then we had hit a ceiling, you were more than X person likely to convert and book a ride. If it's more than two minutes, if it's five, then maybe you check at Uber, maybe you walk, maybe you take the bus. If it's two minutes, it doesn't make a big enough difference, you're just going to book the ride anyway.\n\n(00:20:06):\nSo find this threshold, find this predictor that tends to plateau that correlates strongly with retention but with also the transaction happening, and that's the metric that you can predict. That's a metric that's so much more actionable for teams to work against. If you're a supply team now you can think of, \"Okay, I'm adding 100 supplies into the platform. I want to know if it's actually reducing ETAs in this case,\" or I can look at correlations like this and limiting some of the effect of those exhaustive factors that I mentioned.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:38):\nAwesome. So, essentially watch fill rate is the term used that a lot of people love, which is just people with intent converting. So, the Airbnb example is exactly the way we did Airbnb is we looked at people that are searching with dates as intentful users, and then how many of them convert to a booking. So, that's basically what you're trying to get to, and your point here is that's kind of the output metric. That's what you want to move, but in order to move it, there's something that is the biggest lever to moving fill rate. And in your experience, and I've seen this exact same thing, it's usually amount of supply. Do you have enough good supply? And so, in the case of Lyft is do you have enough cars? Do you have enough homes, do you have enough plumbers on Thumbtack? And that's usually where you can actually impact fill rate. Sweet. \n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:21:25):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:26):\nAnd that becomes the goal of the team, that becomes the focus of the company, basically drive that up in all the little markets you're in and all the categories you're in.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:21:34):\nExactly. Yeah, completely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:36):\nAwesome. You mentioned this idea of product market fit and the things change, pre-product market fit, post-product market fit. Classic question, I'm curious if you have any insights here, just what tells you that you've climbed that hill of product market fit, that you might have product market fit, or you definitely have product market fit in a marketplace?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:21:55):\nIt's hard because to me, the two are most independent. Maybe this is a hot take, but I feel like product market fit is independent of your marketplace dynamics. You might have a great product, and it provides amazing value to both sides, but you have yet to crack the flywheel on the supply side for how to bring those people. You don't have the right product channel fit, for example. And so, this will have a massive impact on the dynamics of your marketplace. And so, to me, my answer would tend to be pretty classical, it would be like measure your product market fit the way you would for a normal company. So yeah, it's a bit of an art more than the science, but I like the classic if we were to take this product away, what percentage of users would be significantly disappointed or have no other solution?\n\n(00:22:50):\nSo, questions like this I think go to the heart of how valuable is your solution to users, and you can do this on the supply side and the demand side. I think here my advice is typically to consider that you have two product market fits essentially. You want to make sure that you have a compelling enough value proposition on both sides of the marketplace, and very often at the beginning you find product market fit on the demand side, but you realize it's not compelling enough for your suppliers because your margins are too high or something like that. So, realizing that you have both those things, but I think you can measure them in a way that's relatively traditional, and that's independent of marketplace dynamics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:27):\nI love that. We actually just had Sean Ellis on the podcast talking about that exact survey, the Sean Ellis test of asking people how disappointed would you be if they left, if the product didn't exist. And I just love that you keep coming back to this point that I 100% agree with, that most of the challenges you have with a marketplace business, 90% are the same challenges you'll have with a non-marketplace business. And people over-focus on, \"Oh, I need to think of this like a marketplace, and all the marketplace science behind all this stuff.\" And really it's all the same stuff every founder is dealing with product market fit, except you have two sides of it growth strategy, but you have two sides of it. So, I love that you keep going back to that. \n\n(00:24:10):\nSomething that I definitely want to touch on is when people are thinking about starting a marketplace company, what are signals that a marketplace is a good model for the idea? Because I think a lot of people come into and be like, \"I want to build a marketplace. Oh, I'm going to connect these two sides. It's going to be great,\" and there's no marketplace in this business, in this vertical. What are signs that marketplace dynamic and a business model is right for an idea versus no, it's not?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:24:40):\nNo one ever say like, \"Oh, I'm going to build Airbnb for X,\" it's not something that people say. I think the signs that come to mind are one, higher fragmentation. I think you want this long tail of buyers and sellers without a handful of big players controlling the market, because this is where you can provide value by doing this job of aggregation. I think you also want a relatively uniform set of needs. That means that it can be, like your supply can be commoditized to some extent. This is what's so tricky, by the way, about services, service marketplaces like Thumbtack, because unlike eBay, where sellers, they just want to sell very clear and distinct inventory, on Thumbtack you have electricians who only want certain types of jobs, but they only want it if they're available that day. And they might take a job and cancel it because something better comes up.\n\n(00:25:34):\nAnd so, this makes for a very fuzzy definition of supply, and you have very different set of needs. One electrician wants something, the other one has a very different perception of the same unit of demand, and that makes it very, very difficult. So, it's feasible, but I would say that is not a compelling attribute for building a marketplace. So, a relatively uniform set of needs. And the last one I'd mention is a high enough bearer in the matchmaking or the creation. I think how hard it is for people to find each other today, and how much effort do they have to put in to vet each other, I think is another great sign. The higher it is, the bigger the opportunity because it means you come in, implement the right processes to simplify this exchange of value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:24):\nAwesome. I'd love to know if there's any examples you can think of, of bad marketplace ideas that people have tried, but I'll summarize the three points you just made, which I love. So, these are signs that this is a great opportunity for marketplace business, that there's a lot of fragmentation on both sides. There's not just a small number of companies or customers on one side or the other, because if there are, why do they need you? There's five airlines or whatever, you don't need a marketplace to match with an airline. Then two is there's uniform needs, the needs are basically consistent. I just want to stay in a home, I want a car to take me somewhere, I want a plumber.\n\n(00:27:04):\nAnd then there's a barrier, there's complexity to the matchmaking and helping someone book the thing, work with them. Finding a car, I imagine is like, I'm not going to just flag down a car. There's challenge there. I'm not going to just go and ask someone, \"Can I stay in your home?\" There's challenges there.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:27:19):\nExactly. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:20):\nAwesome. Are there any examples of companies you've seen that are just like, that will never work as a marketplace, or here's a funny example of a marketplace that tried to be a marketplace and it's not ...\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:27:29):\nI don't have a great example of that, but I can give you a tangentially related example of a marketplace that I don't want to throw anyone under the bus. I respect the company and the effort, but Sidecar at the time was another ride-sharing company competing with Lyft and Uber, and there's, I'm sure a whole bunch of lessons there. They ended up closing, but I think one really interesting direction that they took pretty early on to differentiate themselves was, in my mind perhaps very naively a mistake, they decided to give complete control to the user where as a user you had a whole bunch of filters. You could decide, \"I want a car that's at least 2015 or newer. I want a driver that's at least this or newer.\" And so, I think the theory was reasonable on paper. It was like, \"Hey, let's give people more control over it.\"\n\n(00:28:29):\nBut you have those other players out there, you have Lyft and Uber, and people feel forced in this standardized experience, \"We're going to compete by giving you the choice, you get to decide the experience that you want.\" I think in reality, it just fragments your marketplace even further, and you have this hyper fragmentation in your marketplace, and I think it hurt their SLAs quite drastically. If you think about the ETA, when you ask explicitly you're like, \"Yeah, sure, I want a newer car,\" and you slide it to 2020 not realizing that you just lost 10 minutes because now we had a great driver, but they have a Honda Civic from 2018, and it's not the special that you wanted. \n\n(00:29:08):\nSo, I think people who build marketplaces tend to want to give a lot of control to the users because this is what users want, or this is what comes up oftentimes in user feedback like, \"Oh, we have those two distinct group of users. Those ones, they really want new cars. Those ones, they don't want new cars.\" And so, naturally you have a product team that builds the toggle to get the new cars, and I think the mistake is that you unknowingly fragment your supply in a way that has a much more meaningful impact on the health of your marketplace than you suspect. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:43):\nI think this is another awesome example of don't over listen to users and do what you think is going to be best for the business, and this is not even a marketplace lesson. It's just generally you don't want to give users more options than they will need to be successful and happy. And I think Sidecar did that because they were trying to differentiate from Lyft and Uber, like, \"What can we do differently?\" And they're like, \"Oh, let's give people all these options.\" I think they even let drivers choose the price that they're offering their ride at, which made it extra complicated. They're like, \"Oh my God, all these cars at different prices,\" but I respect their attempt because they were just the third wheel, no pun intended.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:30:21):\nIronically, it's almost the opposite advice that I usually give to companies who struggle with market health, it's if you have different verticals, try if possible to open up your supply walls. Your user is telling you like X, but try to give them something that is tangential to what you think they want, because odds are that they are actually fine with it. There's this amazing example from Thumbtack, it's the smoke machine example. So Thumbtack, now they specialize a little bit more in home services, but a few years ago they were also doing a lot of events. So, you had DJs, you had photographers, and a lot of people were hiring for wedding DJs on the platform. And one of the checkboxes was a smoke machine, and it turns out a lot of people are checking this. You're like, \"Yeah, hell yeah, I want a smoke machine at my wedding.\"\n\n(00:31:14):\nAnd unknowingly to them, obviously, only 5% of our DJs had a smoke machine, and so you would carve out 95% of our supply. And if when we talked to users, they were like, \"Oh, no, no, I don't care that much about the smoke machine. I didn't realize that this was automatically going to remove half of the supply.\" And so, work on ways to make this checkbox affect the ranking but not the actual filtering is a great example of how you can listen to your users and tweak the experience, but simplify their cognitive load by knowing like, \"Hey, we know you prefer a smoke machine, but we're intelligent enough to know it's probably not a deal breaker for you.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):\nI love that example. The other thing that I think is important to talk about briefly is when you're thinking about building a marketplace, a lot of times they fail because the business model just doesn't work. I think about a company like Cherry that tried to do Uber for car washes, and in theory there's a smart idea of I'm going to just do on-demand car wash. The problem is no one's going to pay what it costs to do that, to a car wash person shows up and washes your car. I think cleaning is another example. There's also just like going-\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:32:26):\nExec is another one that comes to mind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:27):\nOh Exec, yeah, where it's just like someone come does stuff for you.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:32:32):\nSomething, yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:32):\nYeah. And so I guess, is there anything you want to add there? Just like this is another reason your marketplace might fail? And maybe just let me expand on this question. Just what are the most common reasons marketplaces fail in your experience? And I think it's important to say most marketplace ideas fail, just like most startup ideas fail.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:32:49):\nYeah, most ideas period fail, I think. Yes. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:51):\nMost ideas period fail, same. Coming back to most of the things you're going to struggle with are the same things that every company struggles with outside of marketplace. So, let me just ask, is maybe specifically within marketplaces or even just broadly, what are the biggest reasons that marketplaces fail?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:33:06):\nI think a few things come to mind. One is this concept of liquidity that we've talked about. So, you need to kick off this flywheel, you need to build enough of that density within your marketplace. And depending on the business, you can take a lot of time or money, and without the right diagnostic framework you can end up running out of both. And so it's like, that's the same one, and I felt this at Lyft, I've seen this at other companies, this rush like, \"Wow, we have to get to this point, otherwise we know it's a losing battle until we have enough density for both sides to have a good enough experience.\" The other one that I see is ignoring one side. So, we talked about doing that when you're early on, but I see a lot of larger companies operating for too long as one-sided businesses. Many large marketplaces only thinking about their demand side funnel.\n\n(00:34:01):\nSo they run ads, they get clicks, they turn those clicks into dollars, and they try to get enough supplies that intuitively the experience is good enough for users. And my advice is, if you're doing this you're missing out on half of your business. And the trick is marketplaces are very laggy, so once your network effects start to die down it turns into this moment of panic of, \"Oh shoot, we forgot about half of our users. We forgot that sellers are people too, and they're all leaving, and now we need to completely transform our product to save the ship, and to create a compelling value proposition on their side.\" So, that's the other thing that I see is businesses realizing that they are marketplaces with true marketplace needs too late in the game. And the last one is quality. I think we talked a little bit about the quality before, but it doesn't mean that you always need to have the best quality in your marketplace, but being a marketplace implies a level of curation.\n\n(00:34:58):\nYou need to be intentional about the quality that you aim to provide, and I think a lot of companies don't have necessarily that intentionality and you have this constant push of supply, \"If only we'd lower our bar a little bit, we could get more supply.\" And so until you end up, we've all experienced this at some point, you found some e-commerce website, you look for something and there is also like, \"Oh my god, this looks super shady,\" because all the sellers don't look that great. That's a quality problem. And so, you need to be intentional about your quality and I think that's another area where companies fail.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:31):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

That's V-A-N-T-A dot com slash Lenny. \n\n(00:36:23):\nKind of as a segue from that idea of quality, I want to talk about managed marketplaces, managed supply. So, I think the reason quality is such an issue for marketplaces is because you do not own the supply and control the supply your marketplace, you're not just selling something, quality is innately going to be a challenge. Airbnb doesn't own homes, Uber doesn't employee drivers. They can't even legally tell them exactly what to do because their contractors, so quality is always this ongoing challenge with marketplaces. So, there's always this push towards making it more of a managed marketplace. We give people a lot more instruction, maybe they own some of the supply, maybe they invest a lot in training, all that kind of stuff. And in a perfect world, not unlike an idealized world, quality will be best if you own it. But then you're no longer marketplace, your business model sucks. I guess just any thoughts on marketplaces that are considering becoming more managed? Any advice on when it makes sense to move towards that spectrum, and how far to go?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:37:27):\nI think when you're running a marketplace, you tend to sit in your ivory tower a little bit looking at stats and thinking, \"If only we could get people to do X, it'd be better for everyone.\" And I certainly did that in my career. I think that's missing the point that we're humans, and I think sometimes we act in ways that are non-deterministic or intuitive. I'll mention another example, but we'd originally sell leads to pros like plumbers and electricians. And of those leads, obviously only a fraction would turn into actual jobs and revenue for those pros. So, we also saw that those pros were always great at converting leads into jobs. And so, naturally we thought that we could provide a more consistent experience for customers and for pros by improving their ROI and selling bookings directly to those pros. It's a common marketplace move, going from some version of lead to a direct booking.  \n\n(00:38:22):\nAnd digital, great. We knew we were going to improve their ROI by something like 20% maybe, and we launched this and pros hated it. They hated it because they actually subconsciously, they liked the thrill of the sale. They loved this contact with customer, and they sometimes completely overestimated their ability to close the customer. They were like, \"You took all those phone calls, they kept me busy. I felt like I was hustling, I was about to close this customer.\" And so, no matter what the data says of like, \"Oh, we increased their earnings by 20%,\" the pros don't feel this way and it's the right to feel however they want. And we saw the same thing at Lyft when trying to make driver earnings less volatile, we had to fight a lot of that perception and a lot of that peak end effect. So, my call-out here is any attempt at control can be really tricky and backfire in ways that are unpredictable.\n\n(00:39:12):\nYou also touched on employment classification. In the U.S., when you talk about controlling supply, all the lawyers are like, \"No, no, no, that's not something that we do.\" Because if you control your supply, then there can be legally classified as employees and be entitled to a whole bunch of benefits. So, my take on this in general is I'm a huge believer, and it really depends on the type of company I should say, obviously, but my take is I'm a huge believer in market forces and empowerment. So, provide guardrails for what a good experience is in your marketplace, set a clear bar for quality, and provide the right coaching and tools for supply to be successful. And then take a step back and see where the gaps are, and invest more in hands-on tactics just to close those gaps more specifically.\n\n(00:40:02):\nSo, lots of coaching tools that Lyft, Uber did it, like most marketplaces provide some sort of coaching. You have a review system perhaps, you have stars for your sellers, for sellers who fall below the threshold then coach them, provide them the right tools, the right guidance, what is the standard that you have on your marketplace and help them meet that bar. And for people who fall through the gaps that you have, then that's when you invest in more hands-on tools. And this is one of the things that we did at Lyft also with the rental company that we spent up. I'm happy to tell you more about that, that's interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:40):\nI'd love to hear about that. Before we hear that, is there any marketplace that has been very good at upleveling quality without becoming managed, that did this really well that you can think of?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:40:54):\nYeah, there's a talent marketplace called Toptal, and they are specialized in this. They have a really high bar for quality, they claim to only have the top 1%, top 3% I believe, of talent there. And they have a really amazing set of checks and processes. This funny story from them, but apparently they advertise something maybe a 3% pass rate for their talent, so they only on board like 3% of the people who apply. And allegedly their actual pass rate is even lower than that, but they thought that if they actually advertise the actual number it would sound fake. And so, they actually say 3% because 1% would sound like too ridiculous and it would discredit their talent. So, they're one company that does a tremendous amount of work for vetting quality early on with a ton of different checks, but also maintaining that quality. So, throughout with the right coaching tools, with education and things like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:06):\nThat's a really good example. And so, basically they just vet and only approve high quality supply in their case. It's mostly engineers, right? I think on Toptal?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:42:16):\nCorrect. Yes, it's mostly engineers, designers, I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:18):\nWhich you can only do if you have so much supply that has so much interest in becoming part of your platform, but that's a really cool example. Basically it's just only allow really high quality supply. Let's hear this rental car story, so this is Lyft trying to do rental cars, right?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:42:32):\nCorrect. Yes, yes. Yeah, so this is a little bit of context. I was leading the driver's side of product at Lyft, and General Motors had invested half a billion dollars in our last round of funding. And this was Christmas Eve, I'll always remember, I got a call from Lyft CEO and General Motors CTO, and we decided to build a rental company essentially. And the reason for it was really fascinating. GM had all those vehicles that were coming off of lease, and that they were forced to sell at auctions they didn't really know what to do with. And from our perspective, we had this massive supply gap. We've talked about this before, but we had this huge supply crunch, we were growing super fast and couldn't hire drivers fast enough, couldn't onboard drivers fast enough. And when we looked at the market, we realized that 50% of the job seekers and welfare recipients in the U.S. don't have a car.\n\n(00:43:26):\nSo, that was our supply gap. This was a huge pool of people that we just couldn't tap into because they didn't have a car. And so, by renting cars we could essentially manufacture our own supply. We could dial this up and down, we could be very surgical about how many vehicles do we bring in, which markets do we bring this in, at what price? We could even offer to pay for the car if they drove 30 hours a week and completely transform the lives of those people, now we allow them to have true mobility. They can go buy groceries, they can go take the kids on vacation. So, a huge win-win for everybody with something like this. And I think in few months we had built a rental company from the ground up, and within 18 months I think we were the fourth-largest rental fleet in the U.S. \n\n(00:44:10):\nBut all of this stemmed from this gap that we saw of like, okay, it's not about controlling the drivers in general. It's about like, okay, we want to be surgical. We want to control the quality of the cars on the platform. So, we talked about that, that's a great example. In the markets where we thought the vehicles of quality was too low, we knew we could onboard more rental vehicles that were more recent to raise the average age of a vehicle on the platform. So, it gave us more control in a much more surgical way, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:44):\nSo, it's not that you are launching a rental car service, the idea was add supply and give drivers a car so that they could become drivers.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:44:54):\nIt was a bit of both. We actually launched, it was we had vehicles that drivers could rent from Lyft, and to drive on the platform, and also to drive for their personal needs essentially. But yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):\nGot it, okay. And then, did this actually work and have impact? Was this a good idea?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:45:16):\nYeah. Yeah, it had a tremendous impact. Like I mentioned, I think we scaled this exponentially to become, I think again, the fourth-largest rental fleet in the U.S. because it was so effective for us, both because we had the right amount of control, but also those drivers were incredibly loyal to us. We had a whole bunch of other incentives that we could do, we could offer to pay for the car but only if you don't drive for the competition for Uber, and only if you drive at least 30 hours a week. So, this again provided us with, again, much greater retention, much higher engagement, and was a real incentive for us but also for the drivers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:59):\nAwesome. And maybe the reason it's most interesting is this is along the spectrum of a managed marketplace. It moves closer to you guys are paying and covering costs of cars. It makes it less just like this simple, highly efficient marketplace.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:46:15):\nExactly, yeah. It's the marketplace version of maybe your black car fleet owner has their fleet of vehicle and they have people. So, this was the marketplace version of doing that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:26):\nAnd it's also just a differentiator, because GM and you guys were close, and so you had this lever that say Uber didn't have. Amazing. Another area that I know you spent time on that I think is really interesting, and I think it'd be helpful to people to hear is the mentorship program, and the ambassador program that you had at Lyft, and how that helped you scale much more quickly than other folks were able to. Can you share that story?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:46:52):\nPretty early on at Lyft, this was 2014, 2015 maybe, Uber was basically 30X our size. They had 30 times more revenue, more people, more liquidity, everything you can think of. They were growing like crazy, and we had a bit of this existential moment, as you can imagine, where we were wondering how we're supposed to compete with that. And we had to be super clever, everything that you did at the company had to be 10 times more efficient per person than the competition just to survive. That was the bar, just not to die, and put a lot of pressure on us but we basically found a clever way of onboarding drivers at a fraction of the cost and resources. So, let me give you a little bit of context on how the onboarding flow worked. So, at the time, the last step to get onboarded as a driver was after you background check and your driving record check came back, you had to do a visual inspection of your car, a quick test drive, some light training, and we would check your documents.\n\n(00:47:53):\nWe would check that you are the person with a driver's license and all those things. And Uber at the time would launch a team on the ground, they would go and open an office and they would have DMV-style group onboarding sessions and car inspections. And we did this as well in our first three to four markets, but you can imagine the overhead and the lead time. You had to go and you had to find office space, sign the lease, hire employees, you had huge, huge lead time. And we thought about it, and at the time a huge competitive differentiator for us was our brand. As a passenger or as a driver, why would you use a platform with lower liquidity? As a driver, you had lower earnings guaranteed. As a passenger, you had longer wait times. Why would you use a service like that? You do because of the brand, because of its values, it's how it makes you feel.\n\n(00:48:41):\nAnd so, we had the pink mustaches at the time, we had this very strong brand identity. I think a lot of that has been lost now, but we also had this amazing community of drivers who were fierce advocates for the brand. And so, what we did is leveraging this community and building essentially a soft onboarding supply engine where we would pay our best drivers $35 per mentor session, and a mentor session was essentially replacing this onboarding flow. So, it was basically another driver looking at your vehicle to check all your documents, take photos of your driver's license and all that stuff, and take you on a short ride along. And the benefits of this were absolutely mind-blowing and kind of unexpected for us on all sides. First, the mentors were our very best drivers, and they were evangelists for the brand. So, what they did was they would share personal tips on when and where to drive.\n\n(00:49:34):\nOftentimes they shared their contact info. And this created tremendous leverage and social proof for those new drivers who were on the fence about taking strangers into their car. It's actually quite funny because we had the brightest minds in the company writing the best marketing emails and copy, like, \"Hey, hop on the car and drive this Saturday.\" And you had all those drivers and all those mentors like, \"No, no, don't listen to those Lyft guys. Here's what you should do. Go on Tuesday at 2:00 PM, text me, I'll tell you where the good spot is, and this is how you're going to get rides. This is how you're going to get rich and make a lot of money.\" And this recognition lever was just so much more powerful than anything we could be telling you. And so, very, very efficient activation lever for the new drivers. For us, also incredibly scalable.\n\n(00:50:22):\nWe could fly a small team to rigorously vet and onboard maybe like 10, 20 top drivers, and then they'd fly to a different market, and we would let the rest of our drivers be onboarded by those mentors. And even for those mentors, for those top drivers, it was an incredible recognition lever. For them, if you were a 4.9 driver, you had enough rides, you had a chance to make it into being a mentor, and this provided additional earnings opportunity for you. If you did two mentor sessions in an hour, you could make 70 bucks an hour. You could take a break from driving if you're tired, and just do some of those. It felt like getting promoted at a job. And so, it actually had a huge impact on the retention of our very best drivers, which was unexpected. So, a lot of really, really interesting benefits, and we actually lean into this and built a couple of really fascinating variations of this for a while, but this allowed us to match most of Uber's footprint with a 10th or a 20th of the resources at incredible speed, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:21):\nThat is an amazing story, and it's such a great lever that I totally agree, I don't hear people using and I wonder why. So, what I'm hearing is it was cheaper, the drivers were making money. I imagine the drivers trained by the mentors ended up being better drivers, that's what we saw at Airbnb, hosts that came in through a referral ended up being better hosts, for whatever reason. And you're saying basically, this is what allowed you to compete with Uber at a much smaller scale and much less money raised. Amazing. \n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:51:51):\nExactly. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:52):\nYou said there's a couple of variations. Is there anything interesting there to share, just things that you built as a follow-up based on the success?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:51:58):\nSo, the next step in that journey was basically we were growing like crazy, but now we had cracks in like the activation phase, but now we had a whole bunch of people dropping off in the funnel before activation]. So, they didn't enter their SSN, they didn't enter the right info for us to run all those checks in the previous steps of the onboarding flow. So, we built a team of hundreds of account executives, and their job was just pick up the phone and call those drivers. And so, we had the same aha moment of like could we get some of our best drivers to do that for us, and empower them to be a part of this? And so, we did this and we launched another, like I said, role. We called them recruiters. And so, as a recruiter, as a driver, you could just, if this was quiet on the road, you could just hop on your phone and you would have a mini sales dashboard where you could claim leads.\n\n(00:52:49):\nAnd this was a driver who had dropped off in the funnel, and you had a telephone number, you could just call them and text them. And same thing, those guys were outperforming our very best of trained salespeople, because it's not like, \"Hey, it's Ben from Lyft. Hop on the road, please.\" It's like, \"Hey, my name is James and I'm a fellow driver as well. Lyft told me that you have a incomplete application. Do you have any questions? Do you want me to come to your house, we can do this together?\" And we would pay them 20 bucks per person that they converted to activation. And so, something incredibly scalable for us, another way for us to reward and recognize our best drivers.\n\n(00:53:27):\nAnd it also provided a really interesting way for us to smooth out the supply and demand. The problem with a marketplace like Lyft is that you have this big spike. Everyone wants to drive on a Tuesday at 2:00 PM, but everyone wants rides on a Saturday at 2:00 AM. And so, how can you manufacture demand during those low utilization times? This was a great way to do that. Now you could wait on the road and still make money while just sitting in your car while waiting for the next ride. So, this was another iteration of this model that was really cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:58):\nAmazing. That is so cool. I just know the feeling of being on a team, coming up with this idea and the thing working must feel so great. Just like, \"Holy shit, look at this. Look at all these cool things that we can do with our supply.\" Something I wasn't going to get into, but it might be interesting just to hear if you have thoughts on this. So, I've been a huge fan of Lyft from the beginning, I used Lyft the very first weekend it came out in San Francisco when there was like five drivers. It was like a beta test, I was friends with someone that worked at Lyft early on, and it was just like, \"Man, Lyft's the best.\" I was like all Lyft, Uber sucks, I hate that. I want to give it the fist bump or the mustache. So great. Today though, I was just looking at market caps.\n\n(00:54:38):\nSo, Uber is worth $150 billion, Lyft is worth $5 billion. I'm curious if you have thoughts on just, it feels like Uber has won at this point, and I don't know where Lyft goes. I know your heart is with Lyft and you worked at Lyft for a long time, I know it doesn't feel great to see how things have played out necessarily. I'm curious just to hear your take on just what do you think Uber did, if you look back, that allowed them to basically win? And where do you think Lyft goes from here? What do you think happens with Lyft? They're still worth 5 billion, it's still a huge, amazing, successful business, but just where do you think things go?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:55:15):\nYeah. I think it all went south when I left the company. I'm just kidding. No, and again, I have to call out the fact that I haven't been close to Lyft, and their business and strategy for many years at this point. So, take this with a grain of salt. This is my very naive perspective, but I think to me, perhaps the biggest blow to Lyft's business was somewhat inherent, like the vision. Lyft's vision was always anchored around transportation, people of transportation. The founders were deeply passionate about moving people, they were passionate about transforming the way people move around in a city. They wanted to just change how cities are designed, how roads are designed. And so, that meant investing in dynamic shuttles and things like that, and there's a lot of experimentation that went to that. But it also meant that Lyft never invested in things like food delivery, or goods and parcels, and things like that.\n\n(00:56:26):\nAnd I think that crushed them during COVID essentially. I think Uber had, I think at some point their slogan was moving in bits and atoms, or something like that. But I think it implies this notion of being a logistics platform for assets in the world, for transporting people, for transporting things, for transporting ... And I think they built, they invested lot in trucks and food delivery, and all those really exotic things that Lyft had never any intention to invest in. Not even because of the lack of resources, but because this was in part a distraction from our vision. We wanted to change how people move around in cities, we wanted to reinvent public transportation, we did not want to be a DoorDash competitor and help you get in donuts during COVID. And a huge part of it also was leaning heavily in shared rides. And so, this was like, again, how do you reinvent public transportation?\n\n(00:57:28):\nIt's like every car is a dynamic bus, and now there's a bus line. The bus line is always running, it's always by your house. So, a lot of our investment I think in thinking went in that direction, and the last thing that people wanted with COVID was to be in a car with five strangers, but what people wanted is food delivered to their house. And so, I know that the business had a huge blow during COVID, whereas I think Uber was able to rebound much more quickly because of how diversified the business was. And so, it's funny now because I think Lyft actually killed shared rides, which was just so core to their identity. They were the first ones to launch this. And so yeah, the new COO I think killed the shared rides, which actually I'm really sad about. But yeah, so I think it indicates a very different vision now, a very different direction for the business. And yeah, that's my take, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:19):\nInteresting. So, essentially COVID really effed them because their strategy was always about transportation, and when nobody needs a ride and people want food, strategically Uber made a really good move expanding into food delivery, which I think was a bigger business than rides for a long time. I don't know where it's at today for Uber, and Lyft didn't have that, and it's hard to recover from a time like that. So, it sounds like it's a combination of strategy was pointing Lyft in a certain direction, and circumstances in the world just made it really hard-\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:58:50):\nAnd losing me me. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:51):\nAnd losing Ben. So, you left in 2019, March 2019, and is that when they went public? \n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:58:52):\nNot for the IPO.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:59):\nYeah, and it's all downhill from then. And then-\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:59:03):\nI'm telling you. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:04):\n... during COVID actually, when there was a big bump, which I think when people started riding again, and then it went down again. So, I think there was a correlation there, so there we go. That's the thing, don't ever fire Ben, don't let Ben leave. That's our take on it. \n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:59:16):\nI was not fired, yeah. Just to be clear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:18):\nOkay, just different ways you might leave a company, don't let it happen. \n\nBenjamin Lauzier (00:59:23):\nI know, I'm kidding.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:25):\nOkay, so there's two more things I want to spend a little time on before we close up. One is your work in Europe, so you're a product leader in Europe, and I want to hear a little bit about what it's like to be a product person in Europe. And then two, I want to hear about the startup. So, at this point no one can actually fire. You have your own company that you're running, and I want to spend a little time here. Usually we don't spend time on this sort of stuff, but you're working on something very cool that I think is going to be really helpful to a lot of people in a really meaningful way. So, I want to spend a little time there. But before that, so you're living in France now. Before you started your company, you were interviewing for CPR roles in France, you work with a lot of French companies, European companies. I'm curious what you've noticed might be different in the cultures of tech companies in France and Europe in general versus the U.S.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:00:12):\nIt's been really fascinating, I think. So, my entire career has been in the U.S., and I'm just starting to understand what that European and the French market in particular looks like. And my read so far is that product management has really exploded I think in Europe in recent years, but the market dynamics are still quite different. In the U.S. I think you have this inherently very liquid and dynamic market. I think, this is my interpretation of it, but I think it leads to greater ownership and accountability for people and product at all levels. So, product managers and leaders, they join a startup and you're immediately in charge of a relatively meaningful piece of the business, with genuine autonomy oftentimes. It doesn't always happen, but oftentimes I think that's the case. And if things don't work out, well, there's this expectation that you'll be managed out.\n\n(01:01:09):\nThere are countless memes on LinkedIn about the tenure of CPOs at tech companies to illustrate that. I think in France the market is much less liquid, so it's incredibly difficult to change jobs, and it's very expensive to fire someone in France. So, it seems to lead to two effects beyond the obvious job security. One is, I think PMs tend to have less autonomy and ownership, and a little bit more like micromanagement. And there are also less business owners than they can be in the U.S. And I see founders and managers struggling to let go of control a little bit more, again because it's understandable in a way, you don't have as much of a control as you do in the U.S. And so, you see a lot of really fascinating effects.\n\n(01:01:55):\nYou have startups who tend to wait a little bit longer before hiring, especially in product. The art of product a little bit less of a thing. You have a lot of amazing PMs in France, but the recognition of the craft is a little bit different outside of the people who practice it. And you have a lot of real interesting outsourcing also, you see startups and companies of all sizes actually relying on great product studios, like Mozza, to build end-to-end products from the ground up. So, something that's been really, really interesting. Another side that I see is this dominance of business over tech in France.\n\n(01:02:35):\nThere isn't as much of a cult of technology and software engineering in France as there is in the U.S. And so, the French Ivy League schools are business schools, like HEC, and the most highly valuable skill that you get is soft skills around management and business. It differs from the stereotype of the CS degree, Stanford dropout that you have in Silicon Valley. And I think because of a few of those things that I just mentioned, less liquid job market, but also less liquid financial markets, the last thing that I've observed that's interesting that's also around ownership I guess, is equity is much less meaningful in France. So, of the product leaders that I talked to, most of them consider their equity to be virtually worthless. None of them know of anyone who's made a down payment on a house thanks to their sort of equity.\n\n(01:03:25):\nSo, it's seen as a nice bonus, but it's not the token of ownership and the promise of future wealth that it can be in the U.S. when you join a startup. For exec roles, I think it's often sub 10% of their total compensation, whereas in the U.S. it's very often more than 50% of your compensation will be equity. So, that's been interesting in terms of the dynamic, but it's also been real interesting to just see how vibrant the startup culture is here in France. You have a truly exciting innovation happening, especially in AI. You have a lot of French companies at the forefront of this, like Mistral AI and Hugging Face, and things like that.\n\n(01:04:03):\nAnd also how it's been exciting to see how the government is leaning into that as a catalyst for this innovation. I think the French government has dedicated something like $2.5 billion in funding to support French AI excellence by 2030. So, they're running a lot of internal government incubators to try to disrupt some of the government functions from the inside, and they're hiring top talents to do that. I've met some of the people working on this, it's just really fascinating. It makes me super excited about what a federal startup task of reinventing [inaudible 01:04:38] would look like. So yeah, it's been really exciting to see the whole space and how it differs from the U.S.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:45):\nFascinating. So, I know there's also AI regulation that feels really strange in Europe, but think that's EU based, not like France specifically.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:04:46):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:55):\nYeah, that people are not excited about. There's just a lot of fear of AI, and so there's a lot of regulation talk in Europe.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:05:02):\nI'm a big Android guy, and a lot of the features like Gemini and all this is only available in the U.S., and now that I'm in France I see the difference a little bit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):\nInteresting. So, the cultural differences you spoke of, do you think they're rooted in the fact that people don't move jobs often, or is it culture? People just don't learn to work in the way that people learn to work in the U.S. in the product role? What do you think is the root of why things are so different?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:05:35):\nI'm not quite sure, it's a good question. My take, and I think this is I'm sure very naive and reductive, and I know this is one of my core principles, so I'm sure I also have a tunnel vision on this a little bit. But to me, one of the biggest difference that I see is really around this concept of ownership and accountability. Whereas in the U.S., and again, I saw it, I'm sure you saw it at Airbnb, you see it at a lot of companies, not everywhere, but a lot of companies will hire you, give you a big chunk of the business, and it's up to you to prove yourself out. Where you have six months, you have a year, it's up to you to show impact. I think the French employment model is less conducive to this type of dynamic, because employment is much more rigid.\n\n(01:06:20):\nSo, you have much less of this hire now and prove yourself out, it's much more of prove yourself beforehand. And if you've made a bad hire than as a founder, you become perhaps a little bit cagey about your vision. You want to be more hands-on because you made a bad hire. It's not like someone perfect, then he'll make you work but it means you'll be more hands-on in the work of PMs daily, and perhaps we'll think like, \"Oh, maybe I don't need product managers who want on my vision, I'll hire project managers,\" or something like that. So, it's perhaps slightly more conducive to those types of dynamics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:53):\nAnd you're saying that's in part because it's harder to fire people in France and in Europe?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:06:58):\nYeah, I think so. It's not just about firing I think, to be clear, I just think it's culturally the market seems like a lot less liquid and dynamic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:05):\nSo, people don't move around as much, they stick around for a long time.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:07:10):\nYeah, exactly. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:11):\nGot it. And it sounds like there's also just a cultural difference of founders innately are much more, \"I am in control, and I'm not going to hire people and trust you to take this thing on. I'm just going to run the show.\" It's basically Paul Graham's founder mode is already instilled in everyone.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:07:29):\nMaybe yeah, maybe that's a little bit. And I think also it's this culture of business, so very business-centric sort of culture. And again, it makes sense, the markets, you have less venture capital, you have less equity in the financial markets as well. And so, when you raise funding you need to have a strong business case. The business case is at the center of your habits. Whereas I think oftentimes in the U.S. you have, again, it's a little bit stereotypical, but it's a very tech or product-centric view of the world, or it can be a very tech or product-centric view of the world where it'll be like this product, this is the vision of the product, and sometimes even the business model will follow. And in France, I think the business model has to be front and center perhaps for you to be able to raise venture capital for you to be able to even exist. So, it means it attracts a lot of business minded entrepreneurs, much more so perhaps than tech-minded or product-minded entrepreneurs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:29):\nGot it. If someone wants to help their company in Europe and France operate more closely to the way companies in the U.S. operate, do you have any advice for them? I know you talk and work with a lot of companies in Europe, what do you help them change and see differently?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:08:47):\nYeah, it's a great question. I haven't fully cracked that, and think it's a really hard question. I'll give some sort of small pointers that have helped at least some of the companies that I've talked to. But the one is equity, I think there's a desire from a lot of the founders that I talk to, to give equity to employees, but because it's not in the culture yet I think employees also have an under-appreciation for equity. Like, \"Well yeah, it's nice, but I don't know what's going to happen. I just work for the CEO anyways.\" There's less of this sense of, again, ownership that you can have in the U.S.\n\n(01:09:22):\nAnd so, I think leaning into that and investing in education around equity, the case is also in the U.S., I'm convinced 80% of people just don't fully understand their equity. But I think leaning into that, especially in Europe, to help people understand the value of their equity, help them by telling more about the story of the business, the trajectory of the business, why it matters for their future equity. I think anything along those lines I think can help cultivate this greater ownership mindset, I think for people.\n\n(01:09:58):\nAnd then yeah, I think another big piece again is, at least to me this is a big recipe to successful product teams, is to develop teams that revolve around this concept of ownership and accountability teams that are clearly owning a huge, or it doesn't have to be huge, like a slice of the business, not feature teams like shipping maybe guests, but teams that have clear accountability with consequences, but also clear ownership and leeway to do their best and to thrive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:29):\nAgain, I usually don't spend time on this sort of thing, but I just think that what you're working on is extremely cool, and I think it's going to be really meaningful to a lot of people. And so, I just want to spend a few minutes giving you a chance to talk about what you're working on now. You started a company, is this your first company that you've started? \n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:10:45):\nIt is, yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:45):\nIt is first company. \n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:10:46):\nFirst real company. Doesn't accept projects, but first company. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:48):\nYeah, there's a LC, there's a C corp, or yeah, it's like filed. There's paperwork. Amazing. Talk about what you're building, how people know how to find it if it's right for them.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:10:59):\nYeah, I have to say entrepreneurship has been a very humbling journey. I think the zero to one is way harder than anything us have done so far, and I feel like when you're used to building and scaling products within companies, you take for granted, at least I did, I take for granted that the problem space has already been validated. You have some brand equity, even if you launch a new vertical, there's an existing user base, there's a validation of the broader problem space. I think going to truly zero felt, at least to me, super overwhelming and lonely, but also super exciting with tons of condensed learnings. It's been a really interesting journey. So, what brought me there is my wife started to have some health issues about three years ago now, it's partially why we decided to move to France last year just for a couple of years.\n\n(01:11:47):\nAnd she's had this undiagnosed condition and chronic pain, and we saw just how much of a nightmare it was to manage her care and to navigate the healthcare system in the U.S. So, we'd wait three months for an appointment for a neurologist, then did see her for maybe eight minutes. Average appointment time in the U.S. is between 10 and 12 minutes. They'd dump a bunch of jargon, say like, \"Hey, tests all look normal. Sorry, you should just go see this other specialist instead.\" Would wait another three months, see another specialist. And with a lot of anxiety, a lot of pain, as you can imagine, all those things, you have another eight minute slot with someone and you're like, \"Oh, why didn't the neurologist do this test? I can help you, let's make some sense.\" And so, it ends up being incredibly isolating. The whole time we just felt completely alone.\n\n(01:12:32):\nIt was just like us and Google, we felt we kept getting conflicting advice from doctors, and I was spending all my time researching specialists, what solutions to consider, spend all my nights reading through research papers to [inaudible 01:12:48], \"Hey, what is the academic consensus on this particular treatment that the doctors don't seem to know about?\" And throughout this whole process it felt like no one really had her back, no one within the medical system was fighting for her the way that your family doctor might have fought for you 20 years ago, knowing everything about you and being like, \"Lenny, let's talk about this. I know your uncle had this,\" or there's this sort of a sense of advocacy that came from your family doctor that just doesn't exist today. It's not uncommon for doctors to have thousands of patients that they see just a few minutes each year.\n\n(01:13:19):\nAnd so digging into this, we just realized it's not an isolated case. You have nearly half of Americans have at least one chronic condition, or have to deal with some sort of complex health issue largely on their own. You see a lot of those large online communities revolving around chronic conditions or chronic pain, and trying to make sense of it and advocate for themselves. And I think I want to be clear, in my mind the problem is obviously not about the practitioners, it's systemic. It's just growing financial pressure from private equity firms, it's just countless other factors. But you see the physicians being overwhelmed, overworked, burning out, and you see that pressure just only increasing, I think. So, I basically spent the next six months just talking to hundreds of patients, and doctors, and experts, and what we built is basically a platform to help people fight for their health.\n\n(01:14:12):\nAnd so, we want to close the gap between patients and the healthcare system. There's this critical layer of the system that's missing, I think, people are navigating life-threatening or debilitating conditions largely with Google, and at some point you just get tired of fighting for yourself. So, we connect people with complex conditions, typically with their own health advocate. So, it's essentially like their own health assistant. They're available 24/7 to help you navigate your care. So, we find appointments for you, we help you prepare your appointment, we make sense of a diagnosis, of test results. We spend hours researching solutions and potential treatments, and just more generally we do everything we can to help you just better advocate for themselves basically. And now we launched in the U.S. a early version of this few weeks ago, and the engagement has been really, really, really mind-blowing so far. And we're helping cancer patients, people with a lot of those niche chronic conditions, and literally harassing the doctor's office like, \"Hey, we still haven't received that referral.\"\n\n(01:15:15):\nAll the things that you just get tired of doing when you're dealing with so many appointments, and when you're having to manage a condition like this. And our mental model is what would we do if this user was our partner or our parent? You'd likely spend all night combing through research. You'd call all the providers in the state to be like, \"Hey, who has an appointment?\" Because there's no PT available for the next two months. We'll find you a PT available sooner. So, we're building the engine to do that at scale essentially, and make people feel like they're not alone and that someone is fighting for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:45):\nSuper cool. It's sad that we need something like this, but we do, because the healthcare system is so not ideal. And so, it's basically someone in your corner that's just, it's like in the inside that knows how these things work that is there to help you through the process. What's the company called, where do people find it?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:16:03):\nYeah, it's called Nurra Health, and our website is Nurra, N-U-R-R-A.me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):\nAwesome, and we'll link to it in the show notes. And just to be clear, I'm not an investor, I'm just excited about this thing. I think a lot of people need this. Just to loop back to what we've been talking about, it's not a marketplace. How would you describe this business in relation to marketplace companies?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:16:22):\nWe're ignoring the marketplace dynamics. I'm following my own advice, and I'm one jumpstarting one side of the marketplace, the health advocates were like jumpstarting this side for now, and we're only focusing on what I think is going be the hardest side for us, and it's going to be demand. How do we find those people? How do we create the right value proposition for them? So, that's what we're focused on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:44):\nAnd so, in the future there may be a marketplace component, is what I'm hearing?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:16:49):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:50):\nInteresting. Very cool. Ben, is there anything else that you want to share, mention, leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:16:59):\nNo, no. Thank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:01):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Ben, are you ready?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:17:06):\nI'm ready, let's do it. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:08):\nAll right. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:17:14):\nI'll give you books in different directions. One is Misbehaving: The Makings of Behavioral Economics. I'm really interested in behavioral economics, I love this intersection between economics and human psychology. It's a great analogy for product, so that's a great introduction to this field. The second book that I recommend a lot is Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World, by David Epstein. I've always felt curious about a lot of things, but it's made me feel like I'm decent at many things but I'm good at nothing. I'm very good at nothing. And so, even in my career I see all those pianists who are like machine learning gurus leading conferences on weekends that are contributing to think tanks, I just felt like a generalist.\n\n(01:17:55):\nSo, if you feel this way, this is a good book to make you feel a little bit better by yourself and your imposter syndrome. At least it did for me. And last one, nothing to do with business, but Immune, by Philipp Dettmer. This is the creator of the YouTube channel Kurzgesagt. I don't know if I'm pronouncing this right, but it's a science channel. If you're even remotely curious about how your body works, how your immune system works, it's an amazing book that's really, really fun to read, super entertaining, and just great biology and fun book, I promise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:26):\nI've been trying to get the author of Range on the podcast, I have not had success yet. So, if anyone knows him, his name is Epstein? Is that right? \n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:18:34):\nYes. David Epstein. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:36):\nDavid Epstein, please connect me. I would love to have him on the podcast. I really love his message of just, basically it's the most successful people, or is it that you should be a generalist or that you can be very successful as a generalist? Is that the message?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:18:50):\nYou can be very successful as a generalist. Yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:51):\nYeah, great. I completely agree. That's been me too. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:18:58):\nTV show? I haven't seen anything lately that's been mind-blowing, but I'll share an old new one. I've rewatched The Last of Us recently, and it's an old favorite. I love the TV show. I like the game, I played the game many years ago, and love the TV show\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:12):\nWhen the heck's the next season coming up? I'm excited for that. Because I know the game has more-\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:19:12):\n2025.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:16):\n2025. Oh man, so long. Okay, good to know though. Next question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:19:25):\nMaybe a little bit behind the curve on this one, but I've been loving the Arc browser. I don't know if you use it, but it's been-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:32):\nOh, I love Arc. It's my number one, my main browser. Absolutely, I love it.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:19:36):\nAmazing. All right, so yeah, you know all about it. Yeah, it's been really fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):\nYeah, just the onboarding of the Arc browser is such a lesson in onboarding. They do such an amazing job. It's like that alone is a great thing to do as a product person, just see how they do onboarding.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:19:52):\nI was like, I've been using Chrome for 12 years, or I don't know how many years, it feels like such high friction to change my entire life. In eight seconds it was done, it felt like home. I was like, \"Wow, this is way faster than I expected.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:05):\nTwo more questions. Do you have a favorite motto that you often come back to or repeat yourself, share with friends or family?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:20:11):\nI don't have anything particularly philosophical, unfortunately. I lived in [inaudible 01:20:16] for a few years. I live now in the French Alps, so I have a frame with a John Muir's quote, \"The mountains are calling and I must go.\" I feel like this is, it's my grounding place. The mountains are my happy place, and so I don't share that work often. I don't peace out in the middle of meetings like, \"The mountains are calling, I must go.\" But it's been a grounding motto, I guess, for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:38):\nThat's beautiful. My nervous system relaxes just hearing that quote, and I know you live in a mountainy part of France so you've done it, you've listened to the call. Final question. You live in France, the Olympics were just in Paris. Did you go to any of the games? Did you watch any of the games? Anything stand out to you about the Olympics that were not so far from where you are now?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:21:02):\nGood question. I did not see any live events, unfortunately. Perhaps the highlight for me was I'm a big mountain biker, but in the biking realm I love the Men BMX event where all three men on the podium were French, so this was a great moment for France.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:25):\nI didn't even know that was an Olympic sport. So, it's a BMX, like dirt bike kind of race.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:21:32):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):\nSo cool. Amazing. Ben, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online, and what else are you doing that people can check out if they want to learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:21:46):\nYeah, you can find me, two things that are perhaps helpful for people out there. One is I have a Reforge course if you're curious about marketplace, if you want to dig deeper into marketplace growth, I have a course on Reforge. We're about to do our fifth or sixth cohort I think now. It's been going really well, we've been working with tons of really, really cool marketplaces, going much deeper into some of the topics that we just talked about. So, if you're interested in marketplaces, I would say check this out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:13):\nAnd on that real quick, is the customer ideal, is it founders or is it like PMs at larger marketplace companies? Who is this perfect for?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:22:23):\nWe've had both founders and PMs, and like a heads of product, but it's my strong recommendation it's people that have product market fit. Per our conversation, if you don't have product market fit, wait a little bit before enrolling in this course. Focus on your core business before worrying about the marketplace dynamics aspect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:44):\nAnd then I cut you off, there's something else you were going to point people to?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:22:47):\nOh, and just Nurra, the company that we're building. Anyone that you know, or if you yourself have chronic or complex conditions, and if you feel like you need help managing your health and navigating your care, would love to help or share what you need, and how we can help you. And our website is Nurra.me, N-U-R-R-A.me. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:09):\nAnd then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:23:11):\nIf you have advice, if you know anyone in the space, if you're interested in learning more about this, if you have advice, if you have learnings, if you know anything about this I would love to hear it. If you have hot takes about marketplace, if you disagree with any of what I've said, I'd love to also hear it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:25):\nI love it. Ben, thank you so much for being here.\n\nBenjamin Lauzier (01:23:30):\nThank you so much for having me, it's been a dream come true. Finally, I'm on this podcast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:34):\nSame. Same for me, Ben. Bye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
