I've had this conversation quite a few times over the years with founders and friends who were running a company going sideways or worse and have had this question, \"Should I continue or not?\" I always have the same answer. I basically say, \"How much conviction do you have in the solution you're building?\" I know in the beginning, before you knew all you know now, you had tons of conviction. That's what caused you to leave your job. Now knowing all you know, do you have more or less conviction in the problem and the solution you're building?\n\n(00:00:31):\nAnd I'll tell you, I get different answers. Some people are like, \"Oh, Scott, I mean, I have more conviction. All that I've learned, all the validation I've received from customers, we just haven't figured it out yet. It's driving me crazy. We've tried three times, and it's still like each product fails. But I have more conviction than ever before.\" And for those people, I'm like, \"You know what? You're just in the messy middle. Stick with it. This is par for the course.\" But oftentimes, I'll hear, \"Honestly, if I knew then what I know now, I would not have done this. Holy shit.\"\n\n(00:01:01):\nI'm like, \"Then, quit. Your life is short. You have a great team. Pivot. Do something completely different.\" If you've lost conviction, you should not be doing what you're doing in the world of entrepreneurship.\n\nLenny (00:01:15):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Scott Belsky. Scott is an absolute product legend. He's a former founder, starting a company called Behance that he sold to Adobe where he worked up the ranks to chief product officer, and more recently, to chief strategy officer and executive vice president of design and emerging products. He's also an author of the beloved book, The Messy Middle. He's also an angel investor in companies like Pinterest, Uber, Airtable, Flexport, Warby Parker, and many more.\n\n(00:01:53):\nIn our wide-ranging conversation, Scott shares his advice on how to build product sense, why you should only build half the features that you want, what it takes to build a successful consumer product. And we spend a lot of time on how AI is likely to change the world of product and the world broadly. Scott is such an insightful and articulate thinker, and I learned a lot from this conversation. With that, I bring you Scott Belsky after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:21):\nThis episode is brought to you by Braintrust, where the world's most innovative companies go to find talent fast so that they can innovate faster. Let's be honest, it's a lot of work to build a company. And if you want to stay ahead of the game, you need to be able to hire the right talent quickly and confidently. Braintrust is the first decentralized talent network where you can find, hire and manage high quality contractors in engineering, design, and product for a fraction of the cost of agencies.\n\n(00:02:48):\nBraintrust charges a flat rate of only 10%, unlike agency fees of up to 70% so you can make your budget go four times further. Plus, they're the only network that takes 0% of what the talent makes, so they're able to attract and retain the world's best tech talent. Take it from DoorDash, Airbnb, Plaid, and hundreds of other high growth startups that have shaved their hiring process from months to weeks at less than a quarter of the cost by hiring through Braintrust network of 20,000 high quality vetted candidates ready to work.\n\n(00:03:18):\nWhether you're looking to fill in gaps, upskill your staff, or build a team for that dream project that finally got funded, contact Braintrust, and you'll get matched with three candidates in just 48 hours. Visit usebraintrust.com/lenny, or find them in my show notes for today's episode. That's usebraintrust.com/lenny for when you need talent yesterday. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments.\n\n(00:03:54):\nWherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential. But there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.\n\n(00:04:25):\nEppo lets you go beyond basically through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the back end, email marketing, even machine learning plans. Check out Eppo at getE-P-P-O.com. That's geteppo.com, and 10X your experiment velocity. Scott, welcome to the podcast.\n\nScott Belsky (00:04:52):\nHey, Lenny. And it's great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:55):\nI don't know if you know this, but it's been a big goal of mine to get you on this podcast since the day I launched it. And so, I'm really excited that you're here. I wanted to start with your role at Adobe. So for the longest time, you're a chief product officer at Adobe. And then recently, I noticed you shifted to this very complicated sounding role. I'm curious what this new role is and then why you made that shift.\n\nScott Belsky (00:05:18):\nWell, in this new role, I'm overseeing strategy and corporate development, all of design across the company and emerging products for the business. If you look back at the last five years or so, it really has been about getting our core products to the cloud, making them collaborative, making some critical and interesting opportunistic acquisitions over the years, ensuring that we have connectivity between the products that we launched, new web apps that meet new types of creatives.\n\n(00:05:49):\nAnd that was a incredible five-year-old chapter. Now with the advent of AI and new and emerging fast-growing businesses we have like the 3D and immersive space, the stock business and how that whole space is being changed by new technology, the idea of bringing that into an organization and being able to focus on that full-time was really exciting to me.\n\nLenny (00:06:13):\nSo what is it that you're doing day-to-day now, just even get it even more concrete? I'm curious what your days are looking like.\n\nScott Belsky (00:06:19):\nWell, I think that it's the strategy of a company always needs to be iterated. And so being tasked with developing the strategy across the entire company, there's no shortage of opportunities and people to meet and things to think about there. Corporate development, certainly like new M&A stuff and integration, all that sort of stuff falls under me as well. And I have a lot of feelings about that having been an entrepreneur that went through integration myself. So it's kind of fun to be on the other side and try to improve it from that vantage point.\n\n(00:06:51):\nOn the design side, I spend a ton of time reviewing the design across every product and really trying to raise the bar for the experiences we're shipping. And that's a hard thing to do in a company that has a lot of legacy products and a lot of baggage that comes with them. And on the emerging products side, it's really about the new products we're bringing into the market and how to make them win.\n\nLenny (00:07:12):\nSomething that comes up on this podcast a number of times is how CPOs rarely last at a company. They stay. Like Casey mentioned this and a few other people, they stay around for a couple years, and the best they can do is just take a few swings at how things work, improve a few things and then, the CEO's like, \"No, this isn't great,\" and then find someone else. What do you think has contributed to you surviving and lasting and thriving and taking on more and more responsibility at Adobe?\n\nScott Belsky (00:07:38):\nWell, in the chief product officer role, I oversaw design, product, and engineering. And I think part of the reason I was even interested in coming into the company and taking this role is that I felt like these boundaries between these functions are at best artificial, at worst really constraining. And I always have felt like a lot of products win not because of the technology but the user's experience of the technology.\n\n(00:08:08):\nAnd so, if you have an aligned team that gets that and makes decisions accordingly, I think you can ship better experiences. So a lot of the work I had to do was breaking some of these boundaries down over the years. And I think that a lot of chief product officer roles traditionally don't oversee engineering and sometimes don't even oversee design. And for me, that wouldn't be interesting.\n\nLenny (00:08:29):\nZooming into product, if there's a Mount Rushmore of insightful product thinkers, I feel like you'd be on it. And part of the reason is that you have this incredible product sense, whatever that means. It's clear that you have strong product sense. And PMs often talk about the importance of product sense and how to build product sense. And I'm curious, how do you feel like you built your product sense. And what advice would you give to younger PMs looking to build product sense?\n\nScott Belsky (00:08:56):\nFirst of all, I think the biggest mistakes that teams make is they become very passionate about a solution to a problem they're trying to solve as opposed to do everything they can to develop empathy for the customer that's suffering the problem. And oftentimes, the empathy gives you the solution, whereas the passion you have for whatever you think the solution is might be 30 degrees off with the solution actually is.\n\n(00:09:20):\nAnd so, this development of empathy is a key part of it. And of course, as I think about the discipline of crafting product experiences, to me, it's all about psychology. It's about understanding the natural human tendencies that people have in their most primal moments. I talk a lot about the first mile experiences that we have across any product we use, whether we're a consumer or an enterprise user. In the first 30 seconds of using a new product, you are lazy, vain, and selfish.\n\n(00:09:51):\nYou want to get it done super quickly. You want to look good to your colleagues or to your friends. You want to feel successful very quickly by engaging in this product. You don't want to have to watch a tour or read anything, really endure any learning curve whatsoever.\n\n(00:10:06):\nOf course, if you can get people through the first 30 seconds, you have so much opportunity to build a more lasting relationship with that customer and have them understand your mission and the full potential of your product. But we need to ground ourselves with the fact that that's really hard to do. It's fascinating to me that most teams spend the final mile of their time building the product, considering the first mile of the customer's experience using the product. If you can just get more customers through that top of funnel, you are a world-class product team. Let's anchor ourselves on just doing that, and let's use psychology to do so.\n\nLenny (00:10:43):\nAnd just to make sure people understand, when you talk about the first mile, essentially that's the onboarding flow maybe to the activation moment.\n\nScott Belsky (00:10:50):\nI think that's right. It's the onboarding flow. It's the initial experience. It's the defaults that you see. It's the orientation of where you are. So many products you actually don't exactly know how you got to where you are and how to get home and where to get help. So I would say it's the onboarding. It's the orientation, and it's the defaults.\n\nLenny (00:11:10):\nYou've been a constant and early advocate of investing in that part of the funnel. And it's interesting how often that comes up on this podcast when people think about how do we improve retention, how do we improve growth. Often, the biggest wins from stories that we get on this podcast are in that part of the flow. And so, another data point to spend more time there. And I wanted to ask you, are you finding even at the stage of Adobe, there's still lots of opportunity in the first mile or do you find that it becomes less and less and less, and then it's less important?\n\nScott Belsky (00:11:41):\nThe answer is lots of opportunity. The reason is because the customers change. Every new cohort of new customers is different. The new customers you have in the early stages of your product are typically more willing and forgiving customers. And you might nail the onboarding process for them, and then suddenly realize that, \"Wait, it's not being as effective anymore.\"\n\n(00:12:02):\nAnd the reason is because now you're engaging more of those pragmatist customers, those later stage customers who are initially more skeptical, less forgiving, less willing to deal with your friction. And so, you have to reimagine the onboarding process all over again. I mean when you look at a product like Photoshop, for example, it used to cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars. Now, ow you can get Photoshop for as little as 10 bucks a month. And so of course, the funnel's a lot larger. A Lot more people come in with creative desires without the skills or the tolerance to develop them. And so, that dictates an entire change in the onboarding experience for a product like Photoshop.\n\nLenny (00:12:38):\nIt makes me think of something Shishir, the CEO of Coda, shared about how he's like, \"I don't really buy this idea of product market fit because you have product market fit with your existing users that love it and know about it, and you always don't have product market fit with the people you want to be used the product.\" And it's related to what you're talking about. The newest people joining have no idea what you're doing.\n\nScott Belsky (00:12:57):\nI agree with that, and I actually think that the role of AI going forward will be to have applications increasingly meet us where we are. To this day, we've always had to generalize onboarding experiences for the most part for everyone. And I'm really excited about the day when kind of products meet us where we are based on what type of user we are.\n\nLenny (00:13:17):\nI have a billion AI-related questions for you. So I'm going to hold off just-\n\nScott Belsky (00:13:22):\nNo problem.\n\nLenny (00:13:24):\n... a bit. And I wanted to double click on the empathy piece. So you talk about how to become better at product sense. Empathy and understanding the user's problems is really important. Do you have any advice for someone that wants to build that? What can they actually do to become more empathetic and build that part of their skillset?\n\nScott Belsky (00:13:41):\nWell, the most humbling moments for me as a product leader have always been shoulder to shoulder to customers. Watching them actually go about their day, not just use my product but go about their day because what you end up getting is context for a lot of data that you're missing.\n\n(00:13:56):\nWhen customers are using your product, they're using it amidst everything else around them. In the enterprise, it's all their other meetings and other products and pings that they're getting throughout the day. And as a consumer, it's between dealing with their kids or their loved ones or watching Netflix or whatever the case might be.\n\n(00:14:14):\nAnd in order to really understand where the customer is and where their mentality is, you have to understand the context in which they're using your product. So part of developing empathy is being shoulder to shoulder and just encountering that reality alongside your customer. And that time, it just gives you better intuition. It helps you understand more. And with empathy, we can then better create quote-unquote, \"for ourselves\" because by developing empathy for others, we're feeling what they're feeling. We can then be the customer. And, of course, we all know some of the best product customers, some of the best products in the world are made when we are the makers are the customer.\n\nLenny (00:14:51):\nIt makes me think of Marc Andreessen as this awesome code that I always come back to that everyone's time is already allocated. They don't have time for your product. They're not-\n\nScott Belsky (00:14:59):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:14:59):\nHow do I find a new app to [inaudible 00:15:01]\n\nScott Belsky (00:15:01):\nAnd by the way, as a related note, since I know Lenny, you talk to a lot of guests around product-led growth. And sorry, if I'm skipping around here. But-\n\nLenny (00:15:08):\nPlease.\n\nScott Belsky (00:15:09):\n... I think it's also relevant because everyone's trying to get their products to grow. And the other thing that perplexes me is that product leaders expect people to talk about a product being great. And people don't talk about a product doing exactly what they expected it to do. They talk about a product doing what they didn't expect.\n\n(00:15:29):\nAnd you look at a product like Tesla. People are not going and talking about how they had a great drive today, but they're talking about the Easter egg they discovered on the dashboard or the cool new feature that they discovered that is associated with Christmas or whatever.\n\n(00:15:47):\nAnd so, it always is interesting to me. In consumer and even enterprise products maybe especially so, why aren't we optimizing for those things that people wouldn't expect the product to do as a way to get that surprise and delight to talk about it, to develop a relationship with our products? I think that's another piece of the puzzle.\n\nLenny (00:16:08):\nThat is really interesting, and reminds me of something I just talked about with Gustav from Spotify whose episode might come out before this or after this about how every great consumer product pulls some kind of magic trick and feels like magic to you, like Spotify as an example. And-\n\nScott Belsky (00:16:23):\nI like that, magic, sort of a little mystery, a little intrigue, a little surprise. It's a classic trick that Hollywood uses all the time. Why don't we use it in our own products?\n\nLenny (00:16:34):\nSo let me pull on that thread a little bit about just consumer products in general. You spent a lot of your career, maybe most of your career in consumer, imagine Adobe. There's a lot of B2B elements now as well. And you also angel invest and you help a lot of consumer companies. And tell me if you agree, but it feels like new consumer products basically never work.\n\n(00:16:55):\nAnd if they do work, there's a period where they work, be real, is going through this now clubhouse. Paparazzi went through this. And then, they fail or fade away. Maybe, they come back and then fade away again. I guess, first of all, do you generally agree that consumer is just so rarely successful in consumer products?\n\nScott Belsky (00:17:14):\nUber was a consumer product, but it built a network effect that was never there before. It leveraged excess capacity that was always there, but never tapped. It did something under the hood that gave it lasting power. I think of Pinterest, and I was Ben's first seed angel and product advisor.\n\n(00:17:36):\nAnd with that product, he had this unique insight into the consumer psychology where it was not as much about getting likes and portraying yourself through pictures of you and seeing pictures of friends and all of this sort of anxiety that is induced by that, but rather helping people collect and represent themselves with their interests.\n\n(00:18:03):\nAnd so again, that was kind of a new insight that I also think developed its own network effect that enabled it to be lasting. And there was a fascinating business component which was it drove a crapload of traffic to every source of every pin, which then got those sites to then put pin buttons themselves because they wanted more traffic.\n\n(00:18:23):\nSo there were underlying things under the hood again that it's sort of tilting the market in his favor. I think that a lot of these other more recent consumer products are just kind of clever momentary interfaces. And they are in effect at the expense of venture capitalists, R&D for the platforms that already have the network effects and already have the distribution channels and the ad sales and everything else.\n\n(00:18:50):\nAnd so, I think that's why we're seeing B-reels capabilities now also in TikTok, and you're seeing a lot of flashes in the pan, especially in these creative consumer apps, which I've been paying very close attention to. They're fun and novel. But if they really work, those features are then brought into the native Apple camera, for instance.\n\nLenny (00:19:09):\nSo let's double click on that. I know this is a big question, but just what have you found is important for a new consumer product to work? You mentioned surprise would be great, network effects, maybe a new insight. What else do you find is important for a durable new consumer product to work?\n\nScott Belsky (00:19:30):\nYeah. And it's interesting because I think my answer 10 years ago would probably be different than my answer today. I think that there is a nimbleness. And maybe, it started in China with these super apps that were able to do everything. And that changed the idea away from the atomized experiences of a decade plus ago where you wanted a specialized product that did exactly what you wanted in a very reduced way.\n\n(00:20:00):\nI think Snapchat emerged under that world. I think Instagram became valuable to Facebook because of that phenomenon. Fast forward to today where all of us are far more technologically literate and we are able to manage a lot more cognitive load in our everyday technology lifestyles. And so suddenly, we don't mind five tabs. We don't mind features hidden and tucked away in menus because we're sort of used to that now.\n\n(00:20:28):\nAnd so, maybe that's one of the reasons why these established platforms get away with basically copying any novel new capability as opposed to those becoming apps in and of themselves.\n\nLenny (00:20:42):\nSo let me shift a little bit and talk about a tweet that you tweeted about one thing you've learned. You have this amazing thread of just things you have learned over the many years you've been thinking about products and consumer products. And one of them was about how you've learned that, you should do half the things that you want to do, half the features you plan to do, do half the features, offer half the options you want to offer, focus on half the market versus the market you're trying to go after.\n\n(00:21:12):\nCan you just talk about maybe how you came upon that learning and then also just how do you actually do that? It's like, \"Sure, great. We're going to do half.\" But then, which half? And oh, but someone wants this feature so badly, shoot. We can't do them all.\" So do you have any advice in just how to actually execute that sort of approach?\n\nScott Belsky (00:21:29):\nI mean one of the first comments I'll just make is whenever I'm asked by teams, what features need to be part of their MVP, how do they decide which features they need to ship first and whatever, I always tell them to optimize for the problems they want to have. You want the problem of customers getting through your funnel, feeling successful, using your product and getting value and then saying to you, \"Oh, but I need it on this platform, or I need this capability, or I want to be able to share this.\" I mean you want those problems. So don't do those features now.\n\n(00:22:03):\nOnly do the things that prevent people from getting to the point where they care enough to ask you for anything. Make sure they can get through the signup flow. Make sure they can connect their account. Make sure they can use Google login if they need to, or whatever the case may be.\n\n(00:22:16):\nSo I always remind the teams, optimize for the problems you want to have, and make sure that you eliminate all the brick walls, the major catastrophe-type things that can happen. But in terms of the half, the half-half, I learned this the hard way.\n\n(00:22:31):\nWhen Behance was launching back in 2008, I was always trying to hedge us with product features. I wasn't sure if people would be coming to join groups or if people would be coming for the tip exchange where creatives share best practices with one another, or if people were coming to build their portfolios or just share work in progress.\n\n(00:22:54):\nMaybe, it's too much to build a whole project of your work. Maybe, we can allow people just to share snapshots of their work. And so, we actually launched with pretty much all of these features. And then, it was the most complicated form of Behance, was ironically at the beginning.\n\n(00:23:10):\nAnd then, what we realized is that some things were taking off, and some things weren't. So I remember when we decided to kill the Tip Exchange. And suddenly, the publishing of projects in the portfolio went up. And we're like, \"Oh my gosh. Projects being published is the core metric and it's what drives the traffic back to Behance. Let's do this again. I don't know, let's kill groups.\"\n\n(00:23:33):\nAnd so, we killed groups. And lo and behold, more people published more projects. And it was like, \"Wow.\" So actually if you make the whole product about one thing, everyone does that. That core crank operates at 10X the velocity and if that's the most important metric for the business, that's gold. And so, we basically went on a killing spree. And we just started killing things. And over the years, we have actually tried to have this sort of, and I pushed this on many products, things I worked with now whenever you're adding things, consider what you can replace. Consider what you can also remove.\n\n(00:24:11):\nWhen we updated the portfolio on Behance, I remember we used to have this ability to change the colors of your portfolio in Behance. When people clicked on your profile and saw all your projects, you could control that and add your brand element to it.\n\n(00:24:24):\nAnd so, we know. We were like, \"You know what? What would happen if we just took this away? Would people again focus more on projects?\" And so, we took it away. For 24 hours, we had people reaching out to us being like, \"Damn you. How could you take away these controls for color of portfolio?\" After that 24 hours, we basically never heard about it again. All the portfolios look cleaner and more consistent. And people did the core metric more. And so, I just took from that, try to kill things and everything you think you need to do, you probably only need to do half of it.\n\nLenny (00:24:57):\nI wonder if in reality most of the time, you only realize this afterwards versus ahead of time. And that's just the way it is. And then, it's just the seal of sunset, things that aren't actually important.\n\nScott Belsky (00:25:08):\nI do have to say though, Lenny, some of the best product leaders that I've worked with, I do feel like they have this great reductionist or minimalistic tendency by default. They're just very much... They anchor themselves on the one thing they want people to do and do well. And they just are pretty ruthless about everything else, being like, \"Okay, but only if we have a problem with doing this core thing. Okay, put on the back burner.\" And so, it's something I've tried to get better at over the years.\n\nLenny (00:25:40):\nWhat's really interesting is this is exactly like Matt Mochary who is actually the number one most popular podcast episode talks about when you let people go. And he's helped a lot of CEOs let people go that 100% of the time everything just starts moving faster as soon as you have fewer people. And so, it's the same exact model in people and products.\n\nScott Belsky (00:26:02):\nI think that's right. And that's why I always feel like tough decisions almost always afterwards feel like a relief. And that's true for the product. That's true for people on a team as well.\n\nLenny (00:26:15):\nLet's shift to talking about AI, which I'm really excited about because I know you've been spending a lot of time talking with people about AI, building AI products. You all launched Firefly, which a lot of people are really excited about. You also have this newsletter where you kind of just share your implications on how AI and technology is going to impact the world.\n\n(00:26:33):\nSo I have a lot of questions I'm excited to ask you around this. And I'll just start really broad and maybe this is too big of a question, but just how different do you expect the world to be in, say, five years as a result of AI, both for product builders and then just people in general?\n\nScott Belsky (00:26:51):\nListen, I'm an optimist. And I feel like our human potential has always been held back by the laws of physics essentially. The mundane, repetitive labor you need to do to get anything done is what holds back our ingenuity. It's the friction. It's the work in workflows that wouldn't it be great if we could just have flow and no work?\n\n(00:27:15):\nAnd I think that that's what AI kind of does, is it gets us from workflow to flow. It gets us into this flow state where any idea in your mind's eye, you can start to develop it. I was having this discussion with Howie who runs Airtable actually just earlier today where we were talking about the leader at IBM who announced that he's not going to hire 8,000 people that he would've hired because AI is going to be able to do that work.\n\n(00:27:46):\nAnd what we were talking about was, and how he made the point, as engineers have become much more productive over the years, that doesn't mean that companies have wanted fewer engineers. It actually just means that they demand more of their engineers. And engineers have more possibility to do more.\n\n(00:28:02):\nAnd so, if human ingenuity goes up, maybe we actually want to hire more people because if you have more ingenuity per human being, maybe you can actually do more as a company. And maybe, companies that used to have three products will have five products or seven products or 30 products. And maybe, that's actually the trend that we're forgetting is that humans bring this level of ingenuity to every problem and every opportunity. Whereas computers remember like ChatGPT is basically just giving you what it would look like if, right? It's not truly finding edges that will become the center.\n\n(00:28:38):\nIt's actually just mining the center. And it's trying to regurgitate the center, which is also very helpful by the way. So I'm optimistic. I think that there will be far more people engaged in delivering experiences. I'm very long the experience economy because I think that there will be some people liberated to focus more on the non-scalable things that really move the needle for experiences for customers. And then, I also am excited about humans having less grudge work to do.\n\nLenny (00:29:09):\nI'm also excited for that. It reminds me it might have a TikTok account, and I have this team that helps with the TikTok and we haven't shared this, but a few of the TikToks are my voice generated with AI. And they just-\n\nScott Belsky (00:29:20):\nWow.\n\nLenny (00:29:20):\n... read script. And it's me reading this story. And it sounds sort of like me. And I showed it to a friend. And I was like, \"Do you see anything? You feel weird about this video?\" And he is like, \"No, you sound great. You sound really a great speaker.\" I'm like, \"Okay. Say hi.\"\n\nScott Belsky (00:29:35):\nWhile you were reading, instead of reading a script, you can be plotting the course of the next episode.\n\nLenny (00:29:40):\nYeah, exactly. So I totally see what you're talking about there. In the product team, which function do you think will be the most disrupted and/or the most, I don't know, optimized through AI?\n\nScott Belsky (00:29:52):\nWe're entering the era where we collapse the stack in every organization where instead of having to go to someone for anything, you can kind of do more things yourself. It's very empowering to get the answer from data as opposed to having to go to a data scientist or a data analyst in the middle.\n\n(00:30:12):\nSo there's going to be far less game of operator across the organization and far more empowerment for people to dig their own rabbit holes, answer their own questions and get things done.\n\n(00:30:24):\nI happen to believe that that's the advantage typically of small teams, is that they're flat. The stack is collapsed. People all can hear each other in an audible across the room, and that's how they run circles around big stodgy old companies that are dispersed around the world. So maybe, this technology allows cross-functional work and to happen. And I'm excited about that.\n\nLenny (00:30:51):\nThat is really interesting. So essentially, what you're saying is a PM will be able to do more design, more engineering, more data potentially. And maybe, one day, it'll be just as good as having a data scientist in your team. But essentially, everyone becomes kind of this unicorn cross-functional mini-team,\n\nScott Belsky (00:31:08):\nWhich sort of suggests this idea of meritocracy. It's almost like what if people get promoted an opportunity based on how creative and how much ingenuity they have as opposed to how many reports or bug things they've gone through or whatever else. So there's something about what you're saying that I do think, yes, it's disruptive to the degree that, well, you need a data analyst in the loop. But I also would suggest that again, that data analyst doesn't have to answer redundant requests all day. She can spend time on thinking of other things without the boundaries of functions like we just discussed.\n\nLenny (00:31:43):\nThis episode is brought to you by rows.com. The world runs on spreadsheets. You probably have a tab open with a spreadsheet right now. But the spreadsheet product you're using today was designed decades ago. And it shows, they live in silos away from your business data. They weren't made to be used on a phone. And if you want to do even the simplest automation, you have to figure out complex scripts that are nightmare to maintain.\n\n(00:32:05):\nRows is different. It combines a modern spreadsheet editor, data integrations with APIs and your business tools and a slick sharing experience that turns any spreadsheet into a beautiful interactive website that you'll be proud to share. If you're writing a report on a growth experiment, you can use Rows to do your analysis on data straight from BigQuery or Snowflake. If you're deep diving on marketing, you can import reports straight from Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, or Twitter, or if you're working with sales, you can natively plug Stripe, Salesforce or HubSpot directly into Rows.\n\n(00:32:36):\nAnd when you're done, you can share your work as a beautiful spreadsheet that's easy to read and embed charts, tables and calculators into Notion Confluence or anywhere on the web. I've already moved some of my favorite spreadsheet templates to Rows. Go to rows.com/lenny to check them out. That's rows.com/lenny. A lot of listeners are product managers. And so just going a little bit further, even within the product management function, how do you see the PM role changing in the next five years as a result of AI?\n\nScott Belsky (00:33:05):\nWell, let me start by saying that I think that the greatest performers I've ever worked with, whether they're designers or product leaders, basically preserve the time to explore lots of possibilities. They call those possibilities down to fewer set. They get feedback on those. They refine them even further.\n\n(00:33:24):\nAnd then, they present to the team. These are the two or three things I think we should do. And that's the way a great designer works, for example. That is a function of time. If you have the skills and the capabilities, it's just how much time. How much time do you have to explore the full surface area of possibility and find the best possible option.\n\n(00:33:43):\nIn my world, in my mind, generative AI and AI for all, when it talks to me about just product leaders exploring possibilities, this should expand the surface area. I was talking to a pretty well known director in Hollywood world, and he was telling me that he uses ChatGPT. I was like, \"No. Are you serious? You do?\"\n\n(00:34:04):\nAnd he was like, \"Yeah, I don't use it to write any scripts.\" But sometimes when I'm developing something with a writing partner, I will ask ChatGPT, \"What would you do?\" And I'll explain the full instance, the full situation in extreme detail. And it will spit out five scenarios. And I actually don't use any of them, but it just gives me more surface area. It tells me the things that I wouldn't want to do, which is also good data. And I just thought that response is so interesting. And so when you ask about product leaders, I think that's what we're going to have, is we're going to have the superpower of exploring far more surface area in far less time.\n\nLenny (00:34:41):\nIt reminds me of something I always share about why do you need a PM? Why do you need a designer? Why do you need a researcher? It's not necessarily that they're just very good at these specific skills. It's that they just have time to do this one thing that needs to be done. You can have engineers do the PM role, but they don't have time. They want to code and they'd rather do that. And so, this is really interesting that it connects to. It'll give everyone a little more time to get better at the thing they want to be doing.\n\nScott Belsky (00:35:08):\nThat's true.\n\nLenny (00:35:09):\nIs there anything you're doing with PMs at Adobe at this point that help them leverage these tools and just the ways of working that you're actually using today?\n\nScott Belsky (00:35:18):\nOne of my obsessions has been bringing design earlier into the process of product development. So it's not necessarily AI yet. But it's the idea of designers, first of all, being in the room, even being in the room with some of the customer research and some of the debates around even the value proposition to the customer and some of the things that traditionally happen only with the PMs. I just find that, again, collapsing the stack, if you will. Having the designer hear these things and contribute gives them a golden gut as they are then sitting down later and going through possible interfaces to solve the problem.\n\n(00:35:57):\nSo I love bringing design upstream. In fact, that's probably been the cheat code of my career as a product leader, has just been disproportionately empowering design throughout the process. I think what we're going to start seeing is generative AI augmenting the designer's work in real time.\n\n(00:36:15):\nSo right now, I mean in Photoshop, we're experimenting with instead of just reducing an image and cropping, you can also extend an image. And that's, of course, using generative AI for out painting. And so, you can imagine as you're doing edits in that as well as in other forms of design, getting kind of thumbnails of what you might be trying to accomplish and then touching them, almost like predictive text to go to the next step, to the next step, to the next step and take leaps in the creative process as opposed to incremental steps.\n\n(00:36:47):\nI think that that's going to happen far more. And hopefully, product designers, product managers will be involved to some extent in some of these decision points as designers have more options to choose from.\n\nLenny (00:36:59):\nYou threw out this term golden gut. What is that about?\n\nScott Belsky (00:37:02):\nThe golden gut is when you're designing an experience and a flow. You are playing around with all kinds of options. You're moving things around. You're saying, \"Actually, that's too complicated. Maybe I'll separate this one page into three steps as opposed to one page with three steps in a row. How do I break this down? How do I simplify?\"\n\n(00:37:26):\nYou sometimes have instincts like, \"Well wait, what if I just remove this all together? What if you didn't even have this whole series of steps? What if I just had a presumptuous default instead and customers could change it if they think they need to?\"\n\n(00:37:39):\nAnd in some of those sorts of, I wonder if, I wonder if, I wonder if, to me is the difference between a very junior product thinker and a very experienced product thinker? I think experienced product thinkers with that golden gut of, \"Oh my gosh. Wait, reduction of cognitive load.\" Maybe even if 10% of people get confused to get 90% of people far faster through this process is a big win and a great opportunity cost trade off. I think those sorts of little micro-decisions that we make in the process of building products, that's the golden gut.\n\nLenny (00:38:13):\nI love it. I have not heard that term before. For PMs listening and they're like, \"Okay, AI's happening. I don't know what to do,\" what would be your advice for them to stay ahead and be aware of where things are going and not be left behind?\n\nScott Belsky (00:38:28):\nQuite simply in one word, play. We all have to be playing with this technology. We have to find ways. The risk of becoming more experienced in your career is you get stuck in your ways. And you're like, \"Ah, no. I don't need to have that automatic draft in my email and get ChatGPT to suggest what I want to respond with. I'm fine without that.\" Make sure you try it. Make sure you play with it. Write poems for your friends. Try a lot of these various generative AI tools out there just to see what's possible and pursue every curiosity.\n\n(00:39:06):\nThe reason I started the Implications newsletters is because I was seeing this high velocity of new stuff every day. And I'm like, \"I have to force myself to make sure I understand all of this and think about how these implications will change my business as well as the world that I operate in.\" And there was no better way to do that than to have to write about it, and promise my readers I'll get a monthly thing out there. So I just think we all have to do some version of that.\n\nLenny (00:39:33):\nLet's plug Implications while we're at it. How do people go subscribe or do they find it?\n\nScott Belsky (00:39:38):\nYeah. No. It's implications.com. So it's easy to find, but it's a monthly exercise where throughout the month, I try to capture a few things I think are important. And I really try to go deep down the rabbit hole of what the implications are for various parts of our work and life. And it's been a fun exercise. And also, I get some good polarizing feedback in the process.\n\nLenny (00:40:02):\nOh you do? Interesting. You should share that. That'd be interesting, is here's what I'm getting in response to the stuff I'm writing. This also touches on a thread that comes up a lot on this podcast, is the power of just writing to help you think through stuff. A lot of people think my newsletters, I'm just sharing all these things I know. I'm just like, \"I know it in my head. I'm just going to share it in the thing.\" But it's more. The writing helps me figure it out and gives me an excuse. And like you said, it's a forcing function to spend the time crystallizing it. And so, that's another reminder for that.\n\nScott Belsky (00:40:29):\nAnd capturing those things, I think, the thing I've kind of learned over the years with writing and also with product development is sometimes you capture these little glimpses and things or sketches, and they become relevant years later. So don't always capture and write because of a foreseeable need for that content. Consider it almost like a back burner that you're constantly tending to. And imagine that three years from now, the stars will align, and this will become invaluable content or some crucial idea for a problem you're facing at the moment.\n\nLenny (00:41:03):\nThere's a lot of people actually in your shoes that want to write more and put content out, but that also have a full-time job with a lot of things on your plate. Any advice for actually getting it done the way you've been getting it done?\n\nScott Belsky (00:41:15):\nListen, there's no hack to it other than ruthlessness of time and prioritization saying no to most things. This morning, I went for a run and I was like, \"I have 40 minutes exactly until I have to get in the shower and I have to be somewhere in 30 minutes from that moment.\" I'm going to take those 40 minutes or at least 35 of them, and I'm going to write. I don't care if I write five words or five pages. And it's just a great... Without that discipline though, as you said, it's super hard to get it in the seams of the schedule.\n\nLenny (00:41:49):\nSpeaking of discipline, you wrote a book called The Messy Middle. And without even talking about what it is, title's pretty... I think people feel like, \"I get it.\" And imagine many people listening are founders or PMs that are feeling like they're in this messy middle. What is one piece of advice for people in this period that you think might help them through the messy middle?\n\nScott Belsky (00:42:12):\nThe bottom line is that these years in the middle of whether it's a venture, [inaudible 00:42:19] new startup, old turnaround within a big company, they are messy because they are full of lows. It's very volatile. When you're in those lows, you need to find a way to endure them. You need to endure the anonymity and uncertainty and anxiety.\n\n(00:42:32):\nI'm sure a lot of listeners, whether they're in big companies or starting their own company, it's hard to be doing something that no one knows or cares about. And I always like to remind myself that the life expectancy of humans a hundred plus years ago was 25 years old. So the idea of spending three to five years of your life on something, especially if it might fail, was a bad decision. And I think biologically, we feel the need for constant rewards and affirmation to stick with something long enough.\n\n(00:43:01):\nAnd in fact, most of your listeners were all building things that take many, many years to defy the odds. And we have to overcome our natural human tendencies in this instance by sticking together long enough to figure it out. So how do you do that?\n\n(00:43:16):\nI mean, obviously, part of it is culture, wanting to serve the customers you serve and working with the team you are working with and that being enough to kind of stick it long enough. I think part of it is short-circuiting the reward system, finding micro goals and milestones that are mutually agreed upon. We're going to celebrate these even though in the greater scheme of things, they don't matter much.\n\n(00:43:39):\nI think that's a key part of keeping the team and keeping the dream alive. I always like to use the analogy of we're driving our teams across country as product leaders with the windows blacked out in the backseat and everyone's sitting in the backseat. And so, if they don't know what we're doing that we're making progress, this traffic is clearing, we just cross state lines. If they don't receive the narrative, they will go stir-crazy. And so there's a lot of research around progress, be getting progress and how progress is a source of motivation. And so as product leaders, we have to merchandise progress. We have to be the steward of this narrative.\n\nLenny (00:44:19):\nAnd you touched on this a bit as you were just talking, but there's also this moment where it makes sense to quit like you shouldn't stay with things endlessly. And I guess any advice on just when something is like, \"Okay, you should probably move on from this.\" Makes me think a little bit about there's all these companies that just keep going that maybe shouldn't keep going because they have enough money or they're just like, \"No, founders never quit.\" Any advice or thoughts that you share there?\n\nScott Belsky (00:44:46):\nYeah. I've had this conversation quite a few times over the years with founders and friends who were running a company going sideways or worse and have had this question, \"Should I continue or not?\" I always have the same answer. I basically say, and I really ask, \"How much conviction do you have in the solution you're building?\"\n\n(00:45:12):\nI know in the beginning before you knew all know, you had tons of conviction. That's what caused you to leave your job. That's what caused you to take all this risk and hire people and raise money and all this stuff. Now, knowing all you know, do you have more or less conviction in the problem and the solution you're building? And I'll tell you, I get different answers. So some people are like, \"Oh, Scott, I mean I have more conviction. All that I've learned, all the validation I've received from customers, we just haven't figured it out yet. It's driving me crazy. We've tried three times, and it's still like each product fails, but I have more conviction than ever before.\"\n\n(00:45:49):\nAnd for those people, I'm like, \"You know what? You're just in the messy middle. Stick with it. This is par for the course.\" But oftentimes, I'll hear, \"Honestly, if I knew then what I know now, I would not have done this. Holy shit. \" I'm like, \"Then quit.\" Your life is short. You have a great team. Pivot. Do something completely different. If you've lost conviction, you should not be doing what you're doing in the world of entrepreneurship.\n\nLenny (00:46:19):\nSometimes, there are moments of that, I imagine. And so, there's probably some spectrum of just how little conviction and how long you felt that, right?\n\nScott Belsky (00:46:27):\nI think so. But at the same time, listen, we all have ups and downs. We all have good days and bad days. However, I do think that great founders are just... They absolutely know in their core that something needs to exist, and they will just be ruthless and relentless until it does. But if you lose that, I actually don't know if you have the fuel to continue. So listen, you're right. Don't make a bold decision on a bad day. But if the conviction generally dissipates, be open-minded about other options.\n\nLenny (00:47:03):\nYou do a lot of angel investing, talked to a lot of founders. What is it that you look for? What do you think is important for a startup to show you for it to feel like a good bet that it'll likely work out? What are some of the important attributes that you look for?\n\nScott Belsky (00:47:18):\nI'll talk for a few things on team and then a few things on product.\n\nLenny (00:47:21):\nPerfect.\n\nScott Belsky (00:47:22):\nOn team, I really value founders who listen, who really learn, who long to shake shit up a bit, and also value the mission that they're on more than the money that it yields because I do think that especially during a period of time where you don't have revenue, you're going to need to be motivated by something grander and bolder than revenue.\n\n(00:47:47):\nI also have an allergic reaction to founders that are real promoters who are constantly trying to sugarcoat the truth, who like to gloss over the hard parts. I've always admired leaders that are optimistic about the future but very pragmatic and somewhat pessimistic about the present. So the founders that I have a great sort of chemistry with are people who are like, \"This is how big the market is. This is how amazing this is. I know this needs to exist.\"\n\n(00:48:15):\nBut we've got a lot to figure out. There are things that are not working. We don't have these data sets. These are the major obstacles we're struggling with. These are the things that keep me up at night. Those are real people. And you know that in that volatile messy middle that they're going to inevitably go through that their team, their investors are going to have the real truth and they're going to be able to engage and find solutions.\n\n(00:48:37):\nSo I really love finding those types of founders, and I'm very wary of the name-dropping overly promoting folks who are unlikely to be able to partner in that way. On the product side, I'm looking for an object model way of thinking about a product that I am confident the will scale and as they solve their problem. And when I say object model, what I mean is it clear whenever you're seeing the product, how it works, where you came from, where you're going?\n\n(00:49:11):\nThose are the three questions I always ask when I'm doing product reviews. It's like, \"How did I get here? What do I do now? And what do I do next?\" And I feel like every screen and every product experience, you should be able to answer those three questions. Sometimes, I'll be talking to a team that says they're design driven, says that they're building a incredible product, and they'll show me a demo and I'm like, \"This is all over the place.\" There's no clean clear breadcrumbs and object model for how this thing works. How are they ever going to get people through their funnel? Clearly, they don't value this as a core principle, and that's also always a red flag. And then finally, I just obviously have to believe in the problem they're solving. So those are some of the things I think about.\n\nLenny (00:49:53):\nAnd you focus primarily on consumer or do you invest all over the place? And I'm asking in case people want to reach out and maybe, \"Hey Scott, you want to [inaudible 00:49:59].\"\n\nScott Belsky (00:49:58):\nYeah. No. I'm pretty agnostic. I look for product design-oriented teams making things that need to exist. Beyond that, I try not to be too prescriptive.\n\nLenny (00:50:06):\nOkay. Excellent. Any last words of wisdom that you think impact the way people build product in the world that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of listeners listening? Is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nScott Belsky (00:50:20):\nTwo quick things. One, for the moment that we're in, and then one for why we do what we do. For the moment that we're in, we're in a resource-constrained environment. Let's face it. We're all going to have less money, fewer headcount, all that kind of stuff.\n\n(00:50:35):\nAnd I've always found that resourcefulness brings you further than resources despite the fact that over the last seven to 10 years, we've basically thrown resources at every problem. Oh my gosh, this is not scaling. Throw more money at servers. Oh my goodness, we need more people on the social media team. Throw more money at headcounts. We've had a resources way of solving our problems as opposed to a, well, let's refactor how we run that database, or let's refactor how that team answers customer service requests. Let's bring a new technology to make it more efficient. Let's leverage and play with AI to see if that can help us.\n\n(00:51:11):\nWe are in this era now where we're being forced to be resourceful and to refactor as opposed to hire and throw resources at problems. I think that's a great opportunity. I feel like this is where the best teams are going to build that muscle, that are going to go the distance. That's why all these VCs say it's so cliche that the best companies are always built in errors like these.\n\n(00:51:33):\nSo my point number one is capitalize on the crisis, everyone. If resources are carbs, resourcefulness is like muscle. It stays with you. It makes you stronger, and it helps you have a better intuition and better performance over time. And then, I guess taking a step back, I would just encourage folks to recognize that anything amazing in the venture world is ultimately an exception.\n\n(00:52:05):\nAnd with all of the best practices, Lenny, that you and I just discussed and all the stuff that we read and books and whatever else, I always try to remind myself that at the end of the day, sometimes, exceptions are the rule when it comes to doing something truly transformative and that nothing extraordinary is ever achieved through ordinary means. And so, while we should always take these best practices and, sure, listen to some of the lessons I learned the hard way and whatever else, but at the same time if everyone says you're crazy, you're either crazy or you're really onto something. So take that with a grain of salt.\n\nLenny (00:52:41):\nLove that. Speaking of extraordinary, I thought it'd be cool to just give you a chance to talk about what you're doing at Adobe. What are some of the products that you're working on? What should folks know about potentially what's happening in Adobe they may not be aware of?\n\nScott Belsky (00:52:53):\nYeah. No. Thanks for asking. For us, I would say there's really three trends that are driving or three waves of transformation, I would say, that are driving the strategy right now for us. One is just that people are becoming more creatively confident. It's kind of wild that we're like most confident as five-year-olds creatively when we're drawing and our parents are like, \"Oh my God, that's beautiful. That's amazing. Let's put it on the fridge.\" And then creative confidence kind of goes down from there for most adults, and that's really sad.\n\n(00:53:22):\nAnd with generative AI and tools, we have something called the Adobe Express in market, and our generative AI offering is called Firefly. These types of tools make people feel more creatively confident right away. It's pretty amazing to see people that would never pick up a pen and draw or suddenly feeling confident. So I would say that's like wave number one.\n\n(00:53:42):\nWave number two that we talked about a little earlier is the fact that creative professionals can now explore 10X the surface area of possibility. These tools are making them so much more efficient. And some people are like, \"Oh my gosh, creative pros are going to be replaced.\" No. No, no, no. They're not. They're just going to find 10X better solutions. They're going to have that capability to explore more possibilities. And that's what makes design great, is finding, exploring more surface area.\n\n(00:54:10):\nAnd then, I would say the third wave that's fascinating to me is personalization. I think we talked about this a little bit, our apps will meet us where we are. I think that every marketing experience will be increasingly personalized for each of us. Every commerce experience, they'll know who we are. They'll just show us our shoe size and no one else's.\n\n(00:54:28):\nThese sorts of transformations will really change the entire world of commerce, and content, and media, and everything else. And Adobe has a big digital marketing business that is focused on enabling some of that. So those are factors of strategy that I would say are driving some of the new products we have under development. And now, it's all about let's talk more shit.\n\nLenny (00:54:50):\nI love that. You need a banner of that. It's been amazing to watch Adobe's rise over the last decade. It just felt like it was going nowhere. And all of a sudden, it's a juggernaut. And so, great work, Scott and everyone else involved. But with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. We'll try to go through it pretty fast. Sound good?\n\nScott Belsky (00:54:50):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:55:09):\nOkay. Sound excited. Here we go.\n\nScott Belsky (00:55:12):\nSounds good. Let's do it.\n\nLenny (00:55:12):\nLet's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nScott Belsky (00:55:19):\nFirst is Build by Tony Fadell. Tony is just an amazing, charismatic, deeply pragmatic, product builder. He's been brave enough to do both Adams and Bits as he says. And his book is just chock-full of wisdom. I do appreciate some of these kind of laws of nature, laws of power type books. I love psychology books.\n\n(00:55:47):\nI'm trying to think of some offhand that have really struck me. But understanding the natural human tendencies of people, I think the laws of power talks about tons of wars over centuries and what sorts of natural human tendencies or inequalities drove massive rebellions and revolutions. These sorts of insights, believe it or not, parlay into decisions we make in products and making people feel successful and productive. So I don't know. I love those books just because I think that they remind us of the limitations and opportunities or possibilities of humanity.\n\nLenny (00:56:27):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nScott Belsky (00:56:29):\nWhat I love is these documentaries about the cosmos and about the edge of our understanding of black holes and what happens out there in space. So I don't remember. I know one is called Cosmos on Netflix. There are a few of them. But in my downtime, I get lost in some series like that.\n\nLenny (00:56:49):\nYou have kids, one or more kids.\n\nScott Belsky (00:56:51):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:56:52):\nWhat are you doing to help them plan for this future?\n\nScott Belsky (00:56:54):\nI think about this all the time. What are our children going to do in a world where if you believe Vinod Khosla's prediction that 80% of the work, of 80% of jobs will be replaced by AI, what will people do? As we talked about their ingenuity will be unleashed, that's great. But ultimately, I always revert back to this one belief that if people are passionate, they become successful in something.\n\n(00:57:21):\nSo I've always just been focused on trying to make sure that they find something they're super passionate about. And it doesn't even matter if the thing they find now is the thing they do later because I do believe that passion in itself and taking initiative on your passion is a muscle memory that once you develop it... I have a daughter who loves horseback riding. I don't know if she's going to do horseback riding forever or whatever. But I think that the passion that she has for it, and this desire to be better and to constantly learn more and do more, that in itself is like a replicable muscle memory. So I don't know what the future holds, but I believe that passionate people will always have a path.\n\nLenny (00:58:01):\nLove that. What's a favorite interview question you like to ask when you're interviewing people?\n\nScott Belsky (00:58:05):\nThere's a real one, and there's a snarky one. So I do love trying to understand if people are introspective. And so, I like asking about something people have learned about themselves that reveal the limitation in how they work. It's a way to test introspection. And once this person hits their limits or struggles, can they be open and introspective or are they going to blame and point fingers? So I do ask that. I also like the question, like, \"Do you consider yourself lucky?\" I think it's a fascinating question because also some people who are super insecure about where they are and how they got there and might decline admitting luck, those who are comfortable should admit that they were lucky, I mean, I think the truth is we're all very lucky and certainly privileged. And I just think that that's always an interesting conversation.\n\nLenny (00:59:05):\nWhat's a favorite reason product you've discovered, app or physical product? Anything that comes to mind?\n\nScott Belsky (00:59:10):\nI've been playing with a product called Queue. And it's Q-U-E-U-E, I think. And it's basically a way to keep a queue of all of this content you want to watch across every streaming platform because there's so much content across so many streaming platforms and to make your own queue and then to see your friends queues and to see what content is in most of the people you know queues, it's actually an incredible graph of kind of stuff that people want to watch or have liked that I think we're going to need in this world where there is just a billion sources of content.\n\nLenny (00:59:44):\nI'm definitely going to check that out. I've been looking for an app like that of I'm sitting in the evening, \"What the hell should I watch?\" I've seen everything that exists on the internet. So that's awesome. What's a favorite AI tool that you've recently discovered or find useful that isn't something Adobe has made?\n\nScott Belsky (00:59:59):\nOkay. Well, I will mention if it's okay a product that I did invest in.\n\nLenny (01:00:05):\nAbsolutely.\n\nScott Belsky (01:00:05):\nBut it's a product called Tome. And they can take a narrative that you want to put into a presentation, and with AI basically create just a draft of this presentation with imagery and compelling points. And it's almost as if you handed this off to an intern and said, \"Come back to me with something I can work with.\" And suddenly, it's instantly there. So that's been like a fun one to play with.\n\nLenny (01:00:34):\nI will check that out. We'll link to that. Also reminds me Kevin Kelly on Tim Ferriss was talking about how AI and ChatGPT is basically an intern. That's like the level of their skill right now. They're just this intern that's helping out with stuff.\n\nScott Belsky (01:00:46):\nI think that's right. And that's why we have to see it as a resource but not a constraint because, again, it's answering that question like what would it look like if as opposed to doing true distinct thinking per se.\n\nLenny (01:01:00):\nScott, this is the first time we've ever chatted. But I feel like I know you. You are wonderful. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nScott Belsky (01:01:13):\nYeah. No. Awesome. Listen, thanks, Lenny. And your podcasts and your emails are probably among my more forwarded pieces of nuggets and resources that I send to product teams I work with. So thank you for elevating the field for all of us, I should say. And it's an honor to be on this podcast. I'm easy to find, just scottbelsky.com or @scottbelsky on your favorite social network of choice. And implications.com is where I'm writing these days.\n\n(01:01:45):\nAnd then, you know what? I welcome folks to share what they're working on. I just love taking as much data points as possible. I love connecting dots for people and making introductions. I feel like that can be a contribution to this whole world of better and better products, and I welcome you to reach out.\n\nLenny (01:02:04):\nAwesome. Scott, again, thank you for being here.\n\nScott Belsky (01:02:06):\nThanks, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:02:07):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:02:10):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Inside Devin: The AI engineer that's set to write 50% of its company’s code this year | Scott Wu\n\n## Transcript\n\nScott Wu (00:00:00):\nOur whole team is only like 15 engineers a year. We use a ton of Devin when we're building Devin. Most folks on the team are definitely working with up to five Devins at once, and so Devin merges like several hundred pull requests into production in the Devin code bases every month.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nWhat percentage of your PRs are Devin versus humans right now?\n\nScott Wu (00:00:16):\nIt's in the neighborhood of a quarter or so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):\nWhere do you think this will be at the end of the year?\n\nScott Wu (00:00:21):\nHonestly, we expect it to be a decent bit more than half.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):\nYou guys are so ahead of how companies work with AI engineers.\n\nScott Wu (00:00:28):\nAI is going to be the biggest technology shift of our lives, so most of the big tech revolutions that we've had over the last 50 years, like personal computer, and the internet, and the mobile phone, they all had this big hardware component that was a big part of the distribution. Folks who were building for those industries kind of saw their market grow and grow and grow basically steadily year over year as the number of people with mobile phones increased, right, as the number of people connected to the internet increase. One of the things which is already I'd say different in AI, is just how explosive the technology can be. There's no weight on hardware distribution. It means that the space is just growing so exponentially.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):\nHow is the act of being an engineer and building changing?\n\nScott Wu (00:01:05):\nI think there's going to be way more programmers and way more engineers a few years from now. Pretty quickly. The form factor of what it means to be a programmer obviously is going to change, but at the end of the day, of course the discipline is all about just being able to tell your computer what's do. And so in that lens, I really think that programming is only going to become more and more important as AI gets more powerful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:20):\nToday my guest is Scott Wu. Scott is the co-founder and CEO of Cognition, which makes a product called Devin, the world's first autonomous AI software engineer. Unlike other AI tools that I've highlighted on this podcast, Devin is designed to act like an actual remote engineer that you chat with like you would with any other human engineer through Slack or through its dedicated website. When Devin launched about a year ago, it was very much a junior engineer. Over the past year, they've made a lot of progress and Devin is now being used by tons of companies in production. We chatted about how their engineering team of 15 uses Devins to build Devin, including how every engineer uses about five Devins each to help them code and move faster. How a quarter of their pull requests today are committed by Devins and that they expect this to be over 50% by the end of the year.\n\n(00:02:05):\nWe also talk about how Scott imagines software engineering is going to look in the future and how the role of an engineer changes from a coder to an architect. We also get into the eight pivots that they went through before landing on this path, why Scott believes AI tools like this will lead to more engineer hiring versus less. Also where the name Devin comes from and so much more. This episode is going to blow your mind. I highly recommend you listen to it if you're at all interested about where engineering, product building, and AI is going.

Hey Brandon.\n\nBrandon Foo (00:04:15):\nHey Lenny. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:17):\nSo integrations have become a big deal for AI products. Why is that?\n\nBrandon Foo (00:04:21):\nIntegrations are mission-critical for AI for two reasons. First, AI products need contacts from their customer's business data such as Google Drive files, Slack messages or CRM records. Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:40):\nSo where does Paragon fit into all this?\n\nBrandon Foo (00:04:42):\nWell, these integrations are a pain to build and that's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months across every use case from RAG data ingestion to agentic actions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):\nAnd I know from firsthand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.\n\nBrandon Foo (00:05:01):\nExactly. We believe product teams should focus engineering efforts and competitive advantages, not integrations. That's why companies like You.com, AI21 and hundreds of others use Paragon to accelerate their integration strategy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:15):\nIf you want to avoid wasting months of engineering on integrations that your customers need, check out paragon@useparagon.com/lenny. Scott, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nScott Wu (00:05:29):\nThanks so much for having me. Excited to be on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:31):\nI'm really excited to have you here because you are building and you've been building something that is very different from what a lot of other AI companies have been doing for a long time, although they are starting to converge to where you guys are now. We're going to talk about that and it's also just such a unique point in the history of AI and just the journey of AI. And so it's really cool to be chatting right now. And I feel like we're going to chat again in a few years and be like, wow, we were so right about so much and so wrong about so much.\n\nScott Wu (00:05:59):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:00):\nAnd so I'm excited to have you here. Let's start with talking about Devin, giving people an understanding of just what the heck Devin is, is the main product that you guys build. What is the simplest way to understand what is Devin?\n\nScott Wu (00:06:10):\nAbsolutely. And so Devin is a fully autonomous software engineer that is going to work on tasks end to end, and so there are a lot of great tools for all parts of the stack of the AI code workflow. What Devin does is it is a full asynchronous workflow, and so you can tag Devin on an issue in Slack, you're talking about an issue and you tag Devin, you can tag Devin in Linear, you can have Devin and Devin will make pull requests in your GitHub, and so it's very much built to work with engineering teams as your junior engineer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):\nAmazing, okay. So I remember when you guys launched this, there was this big pitch of this is your new AI engineer and it was really good at a lot of stuff. It wasn't great at other things. It's been a year now about since you guys launched, is that right?\n\nScott Wu (00:06:50):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:51):\nWhat's the best way to think about the level of seniority that engineer had back in the day when you guys launched and then the level of seniority of engineer today if that's, I don't know, measure of how to think about Devin?\n\nScott Wu (00:07:02):\nYeah, and it's crazy to think about by the way, because a year ago when we did the initial launch, I mean people didn't really believe that an agent was possible. Right. And it was, I mean, it was a very different time. So like start of 2024, things with model capabilities were definitely quite a bit earlier on, reasoning especially was quite a bit earlier on. And yeah, I mean, in the time since then it's obviously developed a lot. I think in terms of practical skills, there's some comparisons we make. Sometimes we kind of say, well, when we got started it was kind of like a high school CS student and then as time went on, it became more of a college intern and now it's like a junior engineer. But I would say though that those are more rough guidelines because I really like the phrase jagged intelligence for example, because obviously there are certain things that it is much better at than a human. There are certain things that it's much worse at than a human.\n\n(00:07:52):\nAnd I think over the last year we've learned a lot especially about not just coding agents but agents in general just really building out how all of us should be working and interacting with agents as part of our flow. And so a lot of the things that we built, I mean, there was no Slack, there was no GitHub integration, there was no Linear, there was no interactive planning phase working back and forth. There was no way to touch up Devin's code. And so a lot of the features that we've built on the product side since then have really been about basically yeah, figuring out how to make working with Devin and handing off tasks to Devin as smooth of an experience as possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:27):\nThat's so interesting. So a lot of the work has gone not into how do we just make Devin the best possible engineer, but it's how to work with this new type of entity that we haven't ever worked with.\n\nScott Wu (00:08:37):\nI think it's a 50/50 of both. I think the capabilities obviously have improved a ton and we've seen these get better and get measurably better. But I think the other side of it is everything to do with yeah, really the product interface and the tools and so on. And I think today folks generally know how to use chatbots and to with chatbots, right, and that's an interface that people are familiar with and obviously with agents it's still like a real curve, I think to learn how to use them and how to get the most out of them. And so it's really exciting to see a lot of others starting to build and do a lot more in the agent space as well. But I think this is the kind of thing that we're all really figuring out together as a space.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:15):\nWhat can you share about just the scale of Devin at this point, whatever you're comfortable sharing, and then just where do you think the level of Devin's coding abilities will be in a year?\n\nScott Wu (00:09:24):\nSo we work with companies of all stages and sizes. On the smallest end, it goes to startups of just one or two people who are using Devin to build out a lot of their kind of initial prototype or initial product all the way up to big public companies, Fortune 100 companies or public banks or things like that who are using Devin across their engineering teams. In general, we've seen a huge range of the use cases there. And obviously the kinds of engineering work that you're doing at a one or two person startup, they're very different from the kind of work that you're doing at a public bank.\n\n(00:09:55):\nBut throughout it's all been basically yeah, being that junior buddy of yours that makes you go faster and really multiplies you, I would say. I think it can multiply you as an engineer obviously by just letting you work with your own team of Devins instead of having to be kind of fully synchronous on a single task. And then it's also kind of multiplying your team and multiplying your team's knowledge base because Devin really accumulates a lot of the knowledge from working with every member of your team and is able to bring that into each new session.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:23):\nAwesome. We're going to show people how it actually works later in the podcast. We're going to do a few live demos, but let's actually go to the beginning of the journey. What's just the origin story of Devin? How did this all begin?\n\nScott Wu (00:10:33):\nThe founding team, I mean most of us have known each other for years and years and years actually. And for almost everyone, this is our first time working together, but we've known each other a long time. And we all actually had our own kind of journeys in AI for the last decade or so. And so for myself, I ran a company before this called Lunchclub, which was an AI for a professional networking product and I ran that for about five years. And one of my co-founders, Steven was one of the first engineers at a company called Scale AI, which has obviously grown a lot and done very well. My other co-founder Walden, was an early engineer at a company called Cursor, which has also obviously grown a lot and done really well. And our whole team was kind of like that. Many of us knew each other from competitive programming and math competitions, but we had stayed very closely in touch in the decade since then and we've all kind of all had our own journeys.\n\n(00:11:22):\nAnd so we had one person who was running teams at Neuro, we had one person who was at Waymo, someone who had their own YC tools startup for machine learning, and we were really excited to build something together. And this was around late 2023, so about a year and a half ago at this point. And yeah, when we got started, I mean I think there were a couple of things that we felt really strongly about and one was that reinforcement learning was really working and was going to be the next big paradigm shift in capabilities. Back then it was the initial ChatGPT launch in 2022, and those models were, to first order were what we would call imitation learning in AI, right, which is basically you have the model read all the texts that you can find on the internet and then train it to talk like somebody on the internet would talk. Right. And there are kind of obviously a lot more details on top of that, but that's kind of the first order pass of what was really done.\n\n(00:12:16):\nAnd it was amazing. Right. I mean, it passed the churn test, it was able to respond and to have encyclopedic knowledge about a lot of things. And I think this new paradigm which we've gotten into over this last year or year and a half is really high compute RL, which is a very different paradigm, right, which is basically the ability to go and do work on task and put something together and then be evaluated on whether that was correct or incorrect and use that knowledge to decide what to do and to learn from that. Right. And so we felt very strongly that that was going to happen. I think for us, code was the natural thing to work on for a couple reasons. One, because we're all programmer nerds ourselves, and so teaching AI to code is about as cool as it gets for us, but also because code has this whole automated feedback loop, right, where you can run the code and that is the kind of automated feedback that really feeds into the RL, which makes these models so great at coding.\n\n(00:13:06):\nAnd then the other thing that we felt very strongly about was that the product experience was going to shift from what I'll call text completion to agents basically. Right. And to first order, I would kind of say there's been a lot of great experiences in text completion. It's been used for marketing, it's been used for customer support, it's been used for education and in Coda obviously as well. The GitHub copilot was kind of really the dominant product of that initial wave. Right.\n\n(00:13:34):\nBut I think that the big shift that we really felt we would see is moving from kind of this text to text model to an actual autonomous system that can make decisions, that can interact with the real world, that can take in feedback, that can iterate and take multiple steps to solve problems. And now we call that agents, but that was what we were really excited about at the time. So it was always coding, it was always agents. And in some ways that kind of feels like it should have been cleared from the start. But even with that, I feel like we've pivoted eight times or something within coding agents over the last year and a half, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:08):\nI just noticed recently all the AI, top AI companies sort of, not all, but many of them, the product that is winning is different, has a different name from the company, which is not typical, Cursors, Anysphere, Bolt, StackBlitz, you guys are Cognition Labs, like V0 is Vercel. And it just tells me these all emerge later in the company's journey and they tried a bunch of stuff and like, oh wow, this thing worked and it's so interesting that it's so common amongst these top AI companies.\n\nScott Wu (00:14:34):\nYeah, and there's even, I mean OpenAI, ChatGPT, Anthropic and Claude and Google. Yeah, it's funny. Yeah, yeah, I agree. So when we got started, it wasn't even really a company. I mean, it was more like a project or a hackathon almost. We got a bunch, we booked an Airbnb basically for a couple of weeks. This was around Thanksgiving time and just got a bunch of people together who were just excited to hack on some projects and build something cool. And it's funny, actually the first thing that we were building for actually was more solving these more contest programming problems and using an agentic loop to really do better on that. And so obviously if you run your code on the test cases, you can evaluate, there's a lot of agentic work that you can do there to try and do better, and that we spent some time on that initially. And then we've kind of gone from, I mean the story of the whole company for us in some sense has been going from hacker house to hacker house.\n\n(00:15:26):\nSo after that we had another hacker house and that's where kind of some of the initial ideas for Devin came and really building a software engineering agent and not just a coding agent and having to interact with a lot of these tools, but even then there were so many iterations. And even the idea of talking to Devin for example was like, it was something that we had to come up with. Right. Initially, it was just like you hand off a task and then it works and then it shows you this whole finished code. Right. And now obviously it's like you can jump in at any time, you can get feedback on the plan, you guys can scope out the task together when you're working with Devin. And a lot of these things we had to develop obviously, and certainly we've learned a lot about the use cases, the form factor. We've made a lot of big improvements and step function improvements on the capabilities and Devin's ability to use tools and to bug and make decisions.\n\n(00:16:11):\nAnd so it's yeah, it's been a fun journey. I mean, I think I would say that the grounding question for us really, which is one that we think about all the time, is really just what is the future of software engineering and how should we be working with AI to write code? Because I think at the end of the day, of course that's what underlines all of the product decisions that we make, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):\nI like that you're asking the juicy question I wanted to get to. Before I ask it just for the history books, when did you guys start kind of hacking around and when did Devin launch? How long was that period?\n\nScott Wu (00:16:45):\nYeah, so we started in November of 2023, which was then yeah, just like hackathon mode. We officially made it into a company around the start of 2024, and then our initial launch was in March. And so it was like nonstop, I mean it's been nonstop for the entire last 17 months, but it's getting to the launch and then obviously working with enterprises and developing the product a lot more, building it and getting it to work for a lot of practical use cases and then making it fully available self-serve in December of last year. And now we've rolled out 2.0 obviously just a few weeks ago. And so it's been a very busy time for us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:25):\nUnderstatement of the century. Let me ask this question because you touched on it a bit, this whole idea of Devin as a person and this idea of creating a personality for Devin. It's unlike any other, I believe, AI app. No one else has a name and you don't think of it as a person. What made you guys decide to go that approach and just how do you design it to work well that way?\n\nScott Wu (00:17:44):\nI would say it's a decision we're pretty proud of, I would say. I mean, I think there's a lot of different product experiences out there, and I think the thing that really makes Devin unique in what it does is that you can really hand off and more and more what we've seen honestly is that I think a lot of kind of explaining the Devin experience to folks is really just explain it as, yeah, this is your junior buddy. And that goes for a lot of the parts of the flow where in the onboarding for example, initially I would say we've definitely had a lot of users come in and just kind of see the blank screen and not really know, or they'd ask, \"Hey, I'm going to do this whole big re-architecture, the whole code base.\"\n\n(00:18:21):\nAnd basically what we've learned over time is to basically get folks to think more like whoa, whoa, whoa, let's work on getting the repository set up first. Let's make sure we hand Devin a couple one pointer tasks so it can get familiar with the code base. Let's get it the thing. If Devin needs to be able to test the code or run the linter or CI or things like that. Obviously we want to make sure Devin's got its own virtual machine set up to be able to do that.\n\n(00:18:45):\nAnd similarly, I think the usage pattern, I think often it wasn't clear and obviously you can sit and just kind of watch Devin do it action by action and work that way, but we found that the best workflow really as a team building a lot of stuff was to work with multiple Devins and to run them asynchronously and to kick them off and to only jump in basically as you needed to provide feedback or steer the plan or anything like that. And so in many ways, I think Devin as a name really is our attempt to kind of capture the soul of that as a product where it really is treating it like a bit more of an autonomous entity that you can hand off tasks, that you can work with, that you should be teaching and learning with over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:29):\nI want to come back to an area you started us down and then I took us away from which is impact on software engineering and how software engineering is going to change. So there's kind of two parts to this. Just like when people are using Devin today, say this year, how is the act of being an engineer and building changing for those companies? What does that look like?\n\nScott Wu (00:19:49):\nBy the way, we're all software engineers ourselves. It's like I'm a programmer by training and still a programmer at heart certainly. And I think the way that we've always thought about it is there's layers of abstraction and there's tools, and one way I would say it at a high level is kind of I think of AI in general as, yeah, I mean computers are obviously getting more and more intelligence and are able to do more and more and it's possible there may come a day where computers truly do everything that we do and humans are not responsible for any of it.\n\n(00:20:20):\nI don't expect that to come particularly soon, but I guess what I would say is until that point, for as long as we're still part of the equation, one of the most important things to do obviously is for us as humans is to instruct our computers on what we want and what we want to build and what we want to do. Right. And software engineering is, we think of it today obviously as Python and C++ and JavaScript and all these things, but at the end of the day, of course the discipline is all about just being to tell your computer what to do. And so in that lens, I really think that programming is, if anything, is only going to become more and more important as AI gets more powerful. And I think the thing that's really exciting for us is yeah, it's really seeing that kind of iterative transformation. And so you ask what things look like today, and I would say, yeah, it really is like having a junior buddy or really a team of junior buddies that you can work with. Right.\n\n(00:21:12):\nAnd so every engineer on our team, we use a ton of Devin when we're building Devin, and so Devin merges several hundred pull requests into production in the Devin code bases every month, which is, I mean, our whole team is only 15 engineers, and so it's a pretty sizable fraction of all the code that we write. And the way that we use it is basically, yeah, everyone's got their whole team of Devins. If you're going to be looking through various issues, if you're going through feature requests, if you're going through bugs, if you're going through new paradigms that you want to build, then it is naturally the case that there's a lot of handoff points where you just say, \"Hey, at Devin, here's what's going on. Can you please take a pass at this?\" Right.\n\n(00:21:47):\nAnd sometimes Devin will be able to do the task 100% autonomously and just makes the PR and then you merge the PR and that's great. Sometimes you want to be able to jump in for the 10 or 20% that really needs your help. Maybe there's a few details with how exactly you want to scope it or how you're architecting this feature, or maybe you want to go and test the front end at the end yourself to make sure it looks exactly the way that you want and give your one or two lines of feedback after that. Right. But a lot of it is really yeah, is kind of like yeah, learning to work with Devin to be able to just do more in parallel and build more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:20):\nWhat percentage of your PRs are Devin versus humans right now?\n\nScott Wu (00:22:25):\nYeah, I'd have to look, but it's in the neighborhood of a quarter or so of all of our-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:30):\nWow.\n\nScott Wu (00:22:31):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:33):\nAnd then what was it like six months ago?\n\nScott Wu (00:22:35):\nOh yeah, it's grown a ton for, I mean, we've seen it grown exponentially internally ourselves as well. And so it's kind of an interesting one where again, it's always both the capabilities and the product interface. And so I think the intelligence has increased a lot. But the other thing of course is that we've spent a lot of time in figuring out how to build and to really kind of build for an interface where you can get Devin's value on tasks where Devin is able to do the 80 or 90%. And so Devin is obviously not perfect and it'll make mistakes and so on. And a lot of the question is basically, yeah, how do you scope out your initial task with Devin and then just kind of set Devin off and have it go and do the things that you want do? How do you come in at the end and review and give feedback? How do you make sure Devin learns over time? How are you able to kind of just check in as needed and course correct if you want to?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:24):\nOkay, so today about quarter of your PRs are Devins. Where do you think this will be at the end of the year? What would you guess?\n\nScott Wu (00:23:31):\nI think by the end of this year, we expect it to be more than half. And I mean, as time goes on, one of the things that we've seen is just you're able to do more and more and more work asynchronously. Right. And you're able to hand off more and more. I think the soul of programming, the soul of software engineering has really been about through all the areas, not just now, but even when it was assembly, right, and even when it was Pascal and even when it was punch cards or whatever, I think the soul of it has really been basically just about defining the problem that you're facing and really thinking through exactly...\n\nScott Wu (00:24:00):\n... about defining the problem that you're facing and really thinking through exactly what is the solution that you want to build. Thinking through the architecture, thinking through the details, and really mapping out in your mind exactly what you want to build basically and what you want to have your computer do. I think that's what makes software engineering really great and I think that's the funnest part of software engineering. \n\n(00:24:21):\nI think, at the same time, that's probably in the neighborhood of 10% of the average software engineer's time, right? Because 90% of the time is you've got this Kubernetes error, then you've got to debug, and you have to see what went wrong and the system crash, or you left some port open and this is messing up, or there's a bug report that you have to take care of, or you've got to migrate your code, or you got it upgraded to a new version or things like that. A lot more implementation. \n\n(00:24:48):\nOne of the ways that we've kind of thought about Devin in building Devin is really allowing engineers to go from bricklayer to architect, so to speak. A lot of it is just getting to the point where you can do the high-level directing and you can basically specify things exactly how you want. I think it's very much about still having the human in control and having the human able to do the full specification, but just multiplying the magnitude of what you can do and what you can build in one day or one hour or however long.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:18):\nIn the future, say someone is trying to get into software engineering, thinking about becoming an engineer, first of all, do you think people should... Classic question everyone's getting these days. Should you still learn to code? \n\nScott Wu (00:25:29):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:30):\nI'd love your perspective there. And then two, for people that are engineers today, what skills do you think will be more and more important and then less important in this discussion of moving from bricklayer to architect? \n\nScott Wu (00:25:41):\nYeah, for sure. I love this question. First of all, the question of whether you should still learn to code, my answer would be absolutely yes. I think, to a large extent, when you take computer science classes and when you learn these fundamentals, sure you're learning a little bit about how a particular language is, syntax works or something like that. But honestly, most of what you're learning really is about the ability to logically break down problems for number one. And two, I would say is just the model of a computer and a lot of these decisions and a lot of the abstractions that we've built over time. \n\n(00:26:11):\nWhat is a database and how should you think about a database? What is a garbage collection system and how do those work and all of these different pieces? The reason I think that's important is because it's the same with a lot of these other... Arguably we've already gone through these phases in programming and I think this next one is going to be somewhat faster and somewhat bigger, but in many ways a similar flavor, which is when you work with Python today, obviously, a lot of things are already abstracted away from you.\n\n(00:26:38):\nIn some sense, someone from 50 years ago might already call Python. You just get to explain in English what you want and now the computer does it for you. That's great and I think it's really powerful. It's opened it up. I mean, we have far more programmers, obviously, than we ever have before because of that, but I would say certainly as you're building your skills as an engineer, it really helps a lot to understand the abstractions and to be able to peel the layers beneath. Folks will use assembly for example if they're really performance optimizing a piece of code, but also in order to build good systems and to understand these things, you certainly want to understand these abstractions of how does networking work. \n\n(00:27:18):\nWhat is TCP/IP like exactly or what happens with this Python code when it gets interpreted or all of these details. Similarly, I think we will get to a state where, with no experience at all, you're going to be able to build some pretty cool stuff and to do some pretty amazing work just by explaining what it is that you want. But I think that, for quite some time, you really want to be able to think precisely about the details, to peel back the abstractions, to be very precise about what it is that you want to build and how.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:48):\nAnd then for skills that you think are more and more valuable for engineers, where should engineers today be leaning more and more into versus like, \"Forget this. I don't need to think about this anymore\"?\n\nScott Wu (00:28:00):\nFor sure. I think architect... I mean, we already have a term for architect and engineering and I think it is directionally the right term. It's, I think, one thing to just do a routine implementation and write boilerplate code and things like that. I would say that, in many ways, AI coding has already made us much faster at that, but I think a lot of the core questions of understanding very complex systems and working in the context of the whole company and thinking about the product that you're building or the work that you're doing and understanding, \"Okay, what are the problems that we want to solve? How do we want to solve those problems? What is exactly the solution that we want to build? What are all of these key decisions and trade-offs that we're going to be making?\"\n\n(00:28:40):\nBasically, I think folks who are able to do that really, really well are just going to be able to leverage themselves more and more. If anything, I think there's going to be way more programmers and way more engineers a few years from now than there are today. I think pretty quickly the form factor of what it means to be a programmer, obviously, is going to change. And in some sense, it already has, but I think there's just going to be so much more for us to build. Folks talk about Jevons Paradox all the time. I mean, software is truly the shining example of Jevons Paradox, where we have always managed as a society to find more and more things that we want to build software for and build more code for. I really think there's a lot more out there to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:23):\nFor people that don't know Jevons Paradox, can you briefly explain it?\n\nScott Wu (00:29:26):\nAbsolutely. Yeah. Jevons Paradox just says that as the price of something goes down, it can still be the case that the total spend on it actually goes up. You can think about this with money, you can think about this with time or resources, but the direct version here is, I think, as it becomes easier and easier to program and as programming becomes more and more effective, I think we're going to have a lot more programmers. I think in a kind of zero-sum view, you might say, \"Well, we're going to be 10 times faster at software engineering and it means that we're going to need 10 times fewer software engineers.\" But I think in practice, what really is going to happen is actually we're going to build even more than 10 times as much code. And because all of the work that we do is so capped, obviously, on our ability to actually build and execute and iterate, we're going to have so many great ideas out there, we're going to have so many great products out there. People are going to build a lot more personalized experiences, for example, and there's going to be a lot to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:22):\nGoing back to the way you guys use Devin, you said that every engineer has this fleet of Devins. How many Devins per engineer do you find most people are working with these days at your company?\n\nScott Wu (00:30:33):\nYeah. It's very asynchronous. Obviously, you can kick them up and start them up and shut them down basically as you see fit, but most folks on the team are often working with up to five Devins at once, I would say. It's a nice flow where you think through, \"All right, what are the five things that we want to get done today?\" You have Devin one do number one, you have Devin two do number two, Devin three... For what it's worth, I think it's taken us some time to adjust to it and get to the point where it's really intuitive for us, but I think it's definitely a different experience where you're handing off most things asynchronously. \n\n(00:31:14):\nThe goal for each of your tasks is to be there for the parts that really need your expertise, either you really, really need to define exactly what it is that you're solving for and what you're building or maybe some of the more complex parts where you want to steer Devin towards, particularly what kinds of changes you want to make. \"I want the class to be set up this way and we should go and change all the downstream references to this as well or whatever.\" But basically having Devin do the bulk of the work asynchronously with you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:43):\nAnd then how many engineers do you guys have roughly?\n\nScott Wu (00:31:46):\nYeah, our engineering team today is about 15 people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):\n15. 15.\n\nScott Wu (00:31:50):\n15, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:50):\nHoly moly. Okay. And then each one has five-ish Devins.\n\nScott Wu (00:31:54):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):\nSo there's five times the number of Devins as engineers. What I love about this is just a glimpse into where the future is going. You guys are so ahead of how companies work with AI engineers. Seeing how you operate is going to be, as a sense, essentially how most companies will end up operating.\n\nScott Wu (00:32:11):\nYeah. For what it's worth, we've already seen this shift, I would say, ourselves where... In terms of the team, obviously, folks don't spend that much of their time just writing out boilerplate or just doing pure implementation of features. People get to spend much more of their time focused on really just thinking about the core questions of, \"How do we make Devin better? What is the right interface for Devin? What is the right flow or the right set of features that's really going to make this as great of an experience as possible?\" That's how we like things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:46):\nWhen is the point you reach, where there's takeoff of this being the by... Your Devin starts moving so much further ahead of everyone else. Once you have enough Devins doing all these things, they're just like wherever and you're 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 100 years ahead.\n\nScott Wu (00:33:00):\nHonestly, as a community, I think all of us as engineers around the world, I think, are going to have to think about this and build for this and adapt to these new technologies. But what I would say is, I think more and more... Especially as capabilities get better, but certainly even in studies say today, I think more and more things are going to shift towards this asynchronous flow. And one of the reasons I would say for that is in the real world, you're just capped by real world constraints. I think that one way to put it is kind of like... Don't take these numbers exactly, but it's kind of like the first order math of it is, of course, being able to write files or to complete this function or complete this line or things like that.\n\n(00:33:44):\nIt helps a ton. It's a really great experience. There's a lot of parts of building software that obviously are almost not that at all, right? If you have a bug that you're trying to fix and so you spin up the local server, you click around on your own product on the front end and try to reproduce the bug yourself. Once you have the error, you take a look at Datadog and you see what happened and you try to find other errors in the logs. You look at those files and you see what went wrong, you make some edits, maybe you go and rerun the whole process again now that you make sure your change looks right. That's a lot of what it means to be a software engineer. These are processes that take real time. I think we're going to shift more and more towards this agentic workflow, because that's in some ways the way to really get to that 200%, 500%, 1000% gains that we'll be getting to with software engineering over the next few years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:39):\nEnough talk. Let's show people what the heck this actually looks like. You've got a couple demos prepped that show a few use cases that you found helpful. You're going to pull up your screen and then we'll kick it off and then we'll talk as it's happening.\n\nScott Wu (00:34:52):\nYeah. The whole process obviously of working with Devin is working asynchronously. I thought it'd be cool for us to actually just watch Devin a little bit in action and then we can go through some other examples of work that Devin's done or things that Devin does for us, even on our team for example. But then we can check back in asynchronously with our Devin after. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:12):\nLet's do it. \n\nScott Wu (00:35:13):\nI'll share this real quick. The key thing that I would just emphasize here is a lot of it obviously is really just about thinking about as a software engineer or as engineers ourselves or engineering teams, PMs, and so on. What are the things that we would want to build that we would want to hand off? We have Devin set up with our own Devin code base, for example, and so I'll go ahead and kick off with Devin for that. I'll just say, \"Devin, I'm on with my friend, Lenny.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:45):\nHi, Devin.\n\nScott Wu (00:35:48):\n\"Can you modify Devin web app two?\" Let's feature your newsletter as part of the Devin website. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:59):\nLet's do it. On the real Devin website. \n\nScott Wu (00:36:02):\n\"Feature Lenny's site.\" \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:04):\nYeah, lose all your features. \n\nScott Wu (00:36:06):\nWe're going to kick this off. As you can see, Devin gets started instantly and goes ahead and responds. Again, you can work with this asynchronously, you can work with it synchronously as well. For this, we'll just kind of go in a little bit and see exactly what's going on. But as you can see here, Devin's going through files and taking a look through a lot of stuff. We can follow here basically as we need to and see what makes sense. You can see Devin's already called out a few particular pieces where there's the sidebar, which we have implemented on the front end, and there's pieces there. We're going to have a new component and that component's going to link to Lenny's website. That all sounds good. Devin's asking us any questions if there's anything that we have here. Same story here where you can let Devin make its own decisions and hand off, or you can go ahead and give some more thoughts. Should the button open in a new tab or within an application? I'll say let's open it in a new tab.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):\nAnd you could answer these at any point. Is it waiting for the answer? \n\nScott Wu (00:37:06):\nYou answer these at any point, you can hand off, hand back off. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:07):\nIt's not going to be like, \"Just god damn it. I just wrote it this way. Why didn't you tell me earlier?\" \n\nScott Wu (00:37:11):\nThat's right. One of the big pieces with Devin is Devin will always be enthusiastic, will always be ready to put in the hours. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:21):\nThanks for changing scope. Thanks, Scott.\n\nScott Wu (00:37:24):\nWe'll give Devin a chance to work and it's going to go through these files and it'll make a pull request for us and we'll see and go from there. But I thought it'd be fun to show some other examples of Devin in action as well. One of the examples actually this morning, which I just used Devin for, is I asked Devin to help me brush my own facts up for this podcast. Obviously, a huge fan of the podcast and the newsletter. I asked Devin, \"Hey, Devin. I'm to be on the podcast. Could you please research everything you can about him and make a nice website quiz for me so that I can make sure I know my facts?\" This was just this morning, I asked Devin to do this and I'll just show what Devin did, it looks like. Went to Wikipedia first. Unfortunately, it's not a page in Wikipedia, which is... Lenny, we will work on that. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:09):\nI'm not a big enough deal yet. \n\nScott Wu (00:38:12):\nThey did you dirty. I mean, we need a page list. And so then it went and found it on Spotify.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:19):\nSo you're watching what it's researching live?\n\nScott Wu (00:38:21):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. This was this morning, obviously. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:24):\nThis is a playback of what Devin did. This is part of Devin you could just watch what it did.\n\nScott Wu (00:38:29):\nYeah, yeah. Especially when you're building engineering products or something like that, you can see each of the steps that Devin was doing, or if Devin tested the code locally, obviously you want to be able to go and look and see what Devin was cooking around with and testing or things like that. It found the newsletter. It's going and looking at this and it's going and reading all of this. And then it says, \"Okay, let's get started with putting the code together.\" It says, \"Hey, I've researched.\" It's going through and writing all of this, putting the app together. It plays its own quiz itself. Actually, we should just play this quiz actually. Let's see how much I know. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:05):\n[inaudible 00:39:05]\n\nScott Wu (00:39:06):\nWhat is the name?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:08):\nWhat is the name of the podcast? Lenny's Podcast. For people not watching, so to say, approximately how many subscribers? A million. Very good.\n\nScott Wu (00:39:17):\nYeah. Yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:18):\nWhat are three main topics Lenny is focused on? Oh, product, growth, and career. Very good. It's a good quiz [inaudible 00:39:25] of people. \n\nScott Wu (00:39:25):\nWhat does [inaudible 00:39:26] besides podcasting?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:27):\nWhat does Lenny do besides podcasting? \n\nScott Wu (00:39:30):\nI'd say writing, investing, and advising. How often does Lenny-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:35):\n[inaudible 00:39:35]\n\nScott Wu (00:39:35):\nOnce a week, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:36):\nOnce a week.\n\nScott Wu (00:39:37):\nYeah. We can go through all these and do all these. I took this quiz, by the way, obviously, to make sure that I was well-prepped, but this is kind of one of the more fun examples, obviously, of [inaudible 00:39:46]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:46):\nScott, how many subscribers do I have at my newsletter?\n\nScott Wu (00:39:50):\nOver a million, actually. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:52):\n[inaudible 00:39:52]\n\nScott Wu (00:39:53):\nAnd then one last one I'll show and then maybe we can come back to our initial run after. Like I was saying, a lot of this is really built to work with all of the existing code workflows out there. For example, we were doing some exploration with the DeepSeek repository on GitHub and we imported it into Devin and we got our own fork of it set up in Devin. A couple of things I just wanted to show here. One is Devin sets up its whole wiki with all of its internal understanding. When Devin indexes the code base, obviously, building a representation of the code base and learning it and improving it over time is one of the big things that Devin does. Funnily enough, we found that naturally humans really are interested to understand this code base representation as well.\n\n(00:40:38):\nDevin Wiki is something that we built here and you can take a look at all these different pieces and see each of these different things. Here are the FP8 operations, here's an SG [inaudible 00:40:46] integration. There's diagrams of how the different layers are built and put together. There's deployment operations. There's a lot of details about the architecture as well. You can ask questions about it as well. For example, you can say, \"How does DeepSeek handle multi-token prediction designed for spec deck?\" It'll go through and it's able to search through the entire code base and give you an informed answer based off of that. \n\n(00:41:10):\nWe use this a lot. It helps when you're scoping out a task for Devin and doing an initial prompt. It also helps, obviously just in a vacuum, you often have questions about your code base that are really nice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:20):\nThis episode is brought to you by Attio, the AI-native CRM.

That's A-T-T-I-O.com/lenny. \n\n(00:42:21):\nSomething that I've learned as I've been talking to more and more AI building companies and apps is there's a big difference in how large of a code base they could integrate into. That's a big deal for companies that are existing versus startups, people that have large existing code base. How should people think about what kind of code base Devin can plug into?\n\nScott Wu (00:42:41):\nYeah. We go all the way to the biggest code base as possible. One way I'd kind of put it is how... The way that we as engineers would think about a large code base is certainly when you're making changes or when you're thinking about a particular task. You're not bringing in every single line of the code base at once. You have a high level of traction that you're able to think about and look into and then you're obviously able to zoom in and get to higher resolution on each of these different things. Devin works in much the same way, where the first thing it'll do is it's going to figure out the high level architecture of what's going on here and what this is built for and so on. But within each of the components, it's obviously also going to be able to zoom in and give some more detail about each of these. Here's FP8 to be float 16 and how exactly a lot of that is set up. Here's each of the different parts of the code base. Similarly, we built this to be scalable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:38):\nIt's essentially coming back to the engineer as architect. Now, it's helping you understand the architecture, kind of circling back to that.\n\nScott Wu (00:43:46):\nYeah. Yeah, exactly. One of the fun use cases that we've seen actually with folks is they'll often actually get Devin's help to onboard new engineers on the team. When you're new and you're joining, there's obviously a lot of questions that you have about the code base or about how things are set up. It also sometimes can be a little bit awkward to ask your mentor or your manager the questions and if you're worried that they're going to be really dumb questions. It's nice to just be able to ask Devin and to go through Devin's wiki and to understand these internal representations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:15):\nI think that's really interesting, because it comes back to your point that Devin is not just a junior engineer. It's what you call a jagged engineer.\n\nScott Wu (00:44:21):\nA jagged intelligence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:22):\nA jagged intelligence, where it's almost like a staff engineer at understanding the code base. Usually, you have to ask an engineer that's been there a long time, \" What does this do? Where is this thing? How does this work?\" It feels like Devin's very good at that.\n\nScott Wu (00:44:34):\nYeah. Yeah. Obviously, the retrieval and processing a lot of code and a lot of tokens at once is something that language models are really great at. Basically being able to get those gains in the places that you need them is really great. Yeah. Sweet, cool. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):\nAll right. You got a couple more use?\n\nScott Wu (00:44:51):\nYeah. One last thought I'll show is just... We just rolled this out last week actually, but it's a full Devin automation setup with Linear. If you have tasks that you're doing on the DeepSeek repository, for example, and it's all set up, all you have to do is you just add the Devin label and Devin will come through and it'll give you this. It's going to give you its thoughts on what the tasks looks like and you can take a look at each of the particular files that you see, or it'll point out snippets that it thinks are important. From there, if you feel good about what was built or the conclusions that we came to, then you can just start off the Devin session that will go and actually do that work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:30):\nThat is insane. That sounds like such a simple idea, but essentially what you're saying is there are tasks in Linear that are fixes and features and now Devin just goes off and can just do them for you.\n\nScott Wu (00:45:44):\nYeah. Definitely it's a hands-on process. You certainly want to be involved when Devin is scoping out the task or giving you its thoughts. The nice thing, too, by the way, is Devin will give you its confidence level. Here's how likely I am to really understand this piece or that piece or whatever, but it helps make things a lot faster. To your point, a lot of product managers, for example, obviously love to be able to use Devin in Linear to understand the code base better or things like that. Claire Vo, for example, from LaunchDarkly is a big Devin user and she loves basically going and scoping out tasks or asking data questions or asking, \"Hey, what's going on? Or is this merged into production yet? Or is this a feature flag right now? Or what percent of people are getting this or that feature?\" It's a clean way basically to make that intelligence much more accessible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:40):\nI love, just with the integration with Linear, that you can still keep it really simple. You add a little ticket like, \"Hey, this link to this home page, do this,\" and Devin will be really good at understanding what you mean and then show you, \"Here's what I'm thinking.\" Is this right?\n\nScott Wu (00:46:53):\nYeah. Yeah, cool. Okay. Yeah, Devin did finish working. It seems like there's something going on with the CI and it's debugging that right now, but it went ahead and put up the initial first pass pull request and we can take a look. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:04):\nLet's do it.\n\nScott Wu (00:47:06):\nThis is the Devin website, obviously, in this custom deploy and we have Lenny's newsletter right here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:11):\nLet's ship this to production. We won't be so confused.\n\nScott Wu (00:47:15):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:16):\nThat's amazing. Okay. Show it again real quick. Just added it to the home page of Devin.\n\nScott Wu (00:47:22):\nYeah. Devin, obviously, has access to our Devin code base. It does a lot here and so it's super familiar with all the pieces here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:28):\nBeautiful.\n\nScott Wu (00:47:29):\nYeah, I like how that looks. We've got Devin search, we got Devin [inaudible 00:47:33], and we've got Lenny's newsletter. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):\n[inaudible 00:47:34]. You link to my site. We'll get some PageRank going. \n\nScott Wu (00:47:37):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:39):\nOkay. Is that a good example? Oh, there it is. What a beautiful website for my newsletter. Is that just a good example of the kind of thing Devin is very good at like, \"Here's a very specific thing to change on the website\"? How does your people think about what Devin is very good at and maybe where it starts to fall apart?\n\nScott Wu (00:47:55):\nThe way that we often describe it is, I think, Devin is best when it is working on tasks that are well-defined. One way to put it, you might...\n\nScott Wu (00:48:00):\nOn tasks that are well-defined. One way to put it is, you want to be giving Devin tasks, not problems. And a lot of these things like what you just saw, which was kind of like a quick front-end feature request or a bug fix or adding testing and documentation or things like that.\n\n(00:48:16):\nOne of the things that makes a loop really nice obviously is a quick way to iterate and test. And so with something like this, obviously super easy for us, for example, to just go pull up the preview and see that the link worked. Obviously it would be easy for Devin to do as well. Devin will often go and log in to Devin and start a Devin session and make sure when it's working on our code base, which is kind of hilarious. But yeah, you generally want something that is kind of easy to verify and easy to test is the main thing. And you can work on bigger projects or bigger asks as well, obviously. But in that case you should certainly expect to need to steer Devin more to make sure it's going the right direction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:55):\nIt's interesting because that's very similar to the way people talk about synthetic data and reinforcement learning, creating data that's very easy. There's a very definitive answer, yes and no.\n\nScott Wu (00:49:04):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):\nIt's very clear.\n\nScott Wu (00:49:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:07):\nOkay. Let me ask you this question. What's something that you guys debated a lot as you were designing and building Devin?\n\nScott Wu (00:49:15):\nI'll give a couple that comes to mind. One I would say is a question of, I'll call it how opinionated we should be. We had the workflows that we used to Devin for, which was very much as you can see for basically integrating to our Slack and GitHub making pull requests for us in our repos, responding to issue reports or things like that. And naturally we've had certainly a lot of other different things that have come up that folks have tried. I mean, we have folks who order their DoorDash with Devin, for example. Even we have folks, certainly a lot of people who are building cool websites from scratch or working on things like that.\n\n(00:49:53):\nYeah, I mean it is been an interesting trade off for us where I think the way that I would describe it is in our product, certainly the large bulk of the features that we build are for this kind of making pull requests and engineering teams use case. But I think basically our kind of general stance with all the others is obviously if folks want to use Devin for that, that's great and we want to just make sure that they're fully aware about the limitations and about where things can get caught up.\n\n(00:50:20):\nIt is funny with AI and especially because I would say one of, I would say the most common pieces of advice out there I would say is focus on a really niche cohort. Do things that don't scale, make one use case that's really great and then you grow from there. And I think that's great advice across the board. But yeah, it's kind of interesting because I think with generative AI, you naturally see this where a lot of product experiences can turn out to be more general. And so it's an interesting trade-off for us. This is something that we still always go back and forth on and how much do we want to do more to support all the other kind of use cases out there to handle other things that folks might want to do with Devin.\n\n(00:51:03):\nI think another one that comes to mind is how much Devin should be, let's say a single comprehensive project experience versus a suite of tools. And as you can see here, we have Devin search, we have Devin Wiki, we have the linear ticket scooping, and certainly these tools interact with each other, but I think as time has gone on, we've seen it more and more as really building this suite of tools. And I think the core agent experience and the core kind of agent that will go off and build each of these build things for you, for example, is always of course going to be that's Devin, and that is the core piece. I think that will always be what's really special about our work. But I think that all of the other features out there, there is a complex suite of work that's required for real-world software sharing and engineering is just messy at the end of the day.\n\n(00:51:55):\nAnd so I think there are a lot of different flows and a lot of different use cases that makes sense. And an obvious thing to point out is you could ask the same questions to Devin search as you could to Devin and Devin will go through and it'll do the same thing. It'll go through and look through the files and give you an answer and stuff.\n\n(00:52:10):\nBut with that said, on the one hand, I think on the capability side, there's certainly a lot you can do to really optimize things for very specifically question answer about this repository and that made sense to really build into a specific kind feature.\n\n(00:52:23):\nAnd then on the other side, I would say we found that users actually really, really like having this access of control. Sometimes you have a task that you're thinking about, but you actually don't want Devin to get started on the task just yet. You want to ask Devin and understand what parts of the code base might be relevant. And so you want to be very direct about saying, \"This is just an ask and I just want to see the snippets of the code base that relate,\" or, \"I just want to look at the Wiki and understand the existing representation.\"\n\n(00:52:50):\nAnd so it's on both the capabilities and on the UX side, we've found that that's kind of what's naturally made sense over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:58):\nWell, let's talk about the landscape then of just other companies in the space, which is something a lot of people are always thinking about. There's all these different approaches. You guys are going full on AI engineer, there's obviously ID companies. There's also just models being built that are really good at engineering. Everyone's kind of starting to build agents now. You guys are ahead on this in a lot of ways. OpenAI just recently said they're going to build a software engineering agent. Anthropics got something there. Cursor and Windsurf have their only agents and Replit. Thoughts on just where you guys fit in the landscape and then how do you think you win long term. How do you think about that?\n\nScott Wu (00:53:31):\nYeah, and for what it's worth, I think all of these are incredible teams. I think really smart and really forward-thinking folks who are building a lot of great products out there. And I think there's a lot to do honestly over the next few years with the advent of AGI or whatever you want to call it. I think one of the quotes that I love is in 2017, if you asked if we had AGI, the answer is no. And in 2025, if you ask if we have AGI, the answer is, \"Well, you have to define AGI. And it depends on your subject.\" And I think it does get to the point of, I mean there is a lot of really amazing stuff happening. I think that it's easy to underrate, I would say just how big of a shift it is that we're seeing where I think there are a lot of great products out there, for example, over the last 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, that have made each of these different niches of the life cycle of building a product a little bit easier, for example, right?\n\n(00:54:28):\nThere's great products out there for instant response, there's great products out there for logging, there's great products out there for billing, there's all of these different tools. And the obvious thing is what we're seeing with AI is all of these spaces are going to be moving multiple times faster and it's going to be like an order of magnitude shift, if anything.\n\n(00:54:47):\nAnd so I think from our perspective, we've obviously had a very specific lens that we've bet on this whole time, and that is autonomous coding agents. And there's a lot of problems to solve there, to be honest, right? There's still a ton to do on the core capabilities, certainly, and we see cases all the time where it's like, wow, why did Devin make that decision? That seems, no human engineer would've ever done that. There's all sorts of spots where, with the product interface, there's obviously a lot to think about.\n\n(00:55:16):\nAnd I think it's by the way, not just a single thing that we're working towards, but something that will change with every edition of capabilities. I kind of think of it as there's 20 generations of agent product, agent coding experiences to come. I think the one that we'll get to over the course of several years is probably something where you don't even look at the code at all, right? And you're actually just looking at your own product and you're just able to look and specify and say, \"Hey, this button should be a little bit rounder. Let's do that. And by the way, let's add a new tab here and maybe we should save this information. Let's start up a database table and let's index it on X, Y, and Z columns.\" And you're just basically working with your products in real time and having your agent build out those things for you. Obviously there's going to be a lot of generations in between here and there, but I think the product experience itself is going to change every single time.\n\n(00:56:04):\nAnd then obviously there, there's all of the practicality of just getting it out there in the world. And so folks obviously need to learn how to use the new technology. There's a lot to do to deploy into all of the messiness of real world software. There's a lot of COBOL out there still. There's a lot of FORTRAN out there still. There's lots of kind of abstractions and details that folks have done.\n\n(00:56:27):\nAnd so I think from our perspective, we have since the beginning have been laser-focused on agentic coding, and that is the one thing that we've really believed in. It's the one thing that we've designed for and that goes all the way to even the revenue model with ACUs and having the usage-based setup. It does into obviously all the product experiences of thinking how, okay, where do you want to talk to Devin? You want to be able to talk to Devin in Slack, you want to be able to spin this up from your issue. You want to be able to all of these things and then of course the capabilities.\n\n(00:56:58):\nAnd so I don't think there's any one easy answer. I think it's obviously a combination of things, but this has been the space that we've lived in and spent all of our time in for the last year and a half, and it's going to be that way for the next five or 10 years too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:14):\nAlong these lines, a big question everyone always has in AI's moats and defensibility, it's a question I've been asking every founder that comes on. How do you just think about how to build a moat in this space when it's so much easier to build and so much is built on these models that are themselves advancing so quickly?\n\nScott Wu (00:57:30):\nI'd give one slight tweak on that, which is I think it's often less about moats and more about stickiness. And what I mean by that is moats are in some sense, typically what folks mean by moats is something that means that a competitor couldn't even enter the market. And I agree that at a high level, a lot of different folks at different layers of the AI spectrum, the foundation labs or the application layer or so on, I don't think there's any kind of hard barrier that would prevent others from entering. I think what does exist is stickiness, which I would kind of define as once you have a product experience that you really like, are you excited to keep using that experience or is there an effect where it is just as easy from now on to just switch on to a new one and learn a new one and so on.\n\n(00:58:15):\nAnd I think from that perspective, I think there's a few things that are really great about coding agents in particular. One I would say is there is a lot of just inherent stickiness and learning and buildup over time, which is that as you use Devin and as your whole team uses Devin, it's the same thing with an engineer. If you're joining on day one versus you've been at the company for five years, you wrote half the code yourself, you've touched every file you've built every single piece, you know all the engineers. And so similarly, it's like Devin will really learn and build its representation of your code base and of your stack and of your process over time and will be able to do a lot more with that.\n\n(00:58:51):\nAnd then the other piece of it, which I think is really exciting I'd say is there really is a lot to do of what I would call a multiplayer aspect of code, which if you think about it, is how a lot of things get done in the real world, certainly. And so it's one thing to have your own experience, which you use yourself as just an engineer, but for example, ourselves, we see this all the time where some engineers are working with Devin and teaching Devin things and as I mentioned, folks will have Devin on board their new engineers and kind of convey that knowledge to them.\n\n(00:59:24):\nOr similarly, it's like I'll start a session with Devin in Slack and I'll say, \"Hey, it'd be cool if we could do this thing.\" And some other engineer will chime in and say, \"Oh, by the way, the reason we did it initially was X and Y.\" And so Devin, just make sure when you do this change that you still support that workflow. And Devin will say, \"Okay, sounds great.\" Or Devin will make a PR, I'll be working with Devin, we'll make pull requests and GitHub and somebody else will be reviewing that PR or give some comments and Devin will work on that too. You'll be in linear.\n\n(00:59:52):\nSo all these kind of spaces, it really does just kind of set up for an experience basically where Devin can just grow in the value that it can provide for your whole work over time. And so I think from that perspective, if anything, we want there to be a lot of innovation and a lot of new products and so on. I don't think that the goal is to try to lock other people out of building. There's a lot of stuff to build, and I think there's going to be a lot of different experiences. I think from our perspective, what we think about is more like how can we make Devin more and more and more useful as you're using it more?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:27):\nIt's very similar. We had Michael from Cursor, the CF Cursor on the podcast, and he had a similar point of just he thinks moats are just kind of like consumer, like Google is the way, he thinks it's like Google where people can easily switch. You just have to stay the best, and that's the answer. And it feels like you're adding to that of just like, but also if you can create some stickiness where it is very hard to leave because it's so good at what it's doing and it's built knowledge and integrated to your workflows and builds on that on that stickiness.\n\nScott Wu (01:00:58):\nYeah, and I think one of the things that's nice about our space too is, software engineering for better for worse has a very clear tie to value. And what it means is, I guess one way to put it is there is always kind of a clear next level, at least for the next while. I think there could be some point where you're just like, \"All right, just build the entirety of YouTube for me.\" And Devin just does the whole, it's like there's probably been a hundred million hours of human engineering time building YouTube, building the algorithm, building all the infrastructure, all of the, everything, every little detail. And maybe there's some time where Devin just does that out of the box. That's obviously going to be a long time from now.\n\n(01:01:36):\nI think on the interim, on every level in between, obviously it makes a difference the quality of software engineering. And I think one of the cool things with developers obviously is developers are really willing to learn new experiences and to put in effort if it means that they're able to have a higher and higher quality experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:57):\nAwesome. I'm going to spend a little time on the tech that enables Devin. Without divulging trade secrets, just what allowed you to make Devin so good? Was there an unlock with a certain model? Some folks have shared three points on a 3.5 was a huge unlock for a lot of their products. Just what's kind of the key to the way you've architected or built Devin that makes it work so well?\n\nScott Wu (01:02:20):\nWe obviously, we've been betting on agents for a long time. I think that agents were doable and workable a lot earlier than most folks might've thought. But certainly I think as the community has really rallied around it, I mean you see the impacts of that in the pre-training, you see the impacts of that in a lot of the work that's done with these models. I actually don't think there's been any, from our perspective, I don't think there's been any single step function based model shift or anything that has been kind of like a night and day difference in Devin, but I certainly think that the curve of every point on the chart, I mean there's a new model that comes out every week now has obviously made a big difference in terms of what we've been able to do. And then obviously on top of that, we work with the research teams at all these foundation labs to do a lot of our work on top.\n\n(01:03:11):\nAnd so I think that my hot take here at which I would give is, I think in terms of base intelligence, we're honestly basically already there. And I think a lot of what we see actually and what we spend our time on is less so, obviously, we don't our own models or things like that. It's less so increasing the base IQ of a model, for example, and more about teaching it all of the idiosyncrasies of real-world engineering and thinking about here's how you use Datadog and do this, and here's how you might diagnose this error and here are the different things that you could run into and here's how you handle each of those. And when you're ready, here's how you make GitHub PR.\n\n(01:03:50):\nAnd this is true in engineering. It's true in every other space as well. I mean, there's so much detail and idiosyncrasy to the work that we all do obviously day to day. And a lot of it is kind of like teaching the model to mirror the complexity of the real world, I would say, rather than getting it to some higher fundamental level of problem solving, which I think the foundation labs are doing a really great job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):\nThere's something you shared when we were chatting before we started recording around the growth of previous transformative technologies were very hardware oriented and there was a limiting factor to their growth and AI is not that. Can you just share that insight?\n\nScott Wu (01:04:30):\nFor a number of reasons? I think AI is going to be the biggest technology shift of our lives, but I think one thing, which is what we were just talking about before this, which is most of the big tech revolutions that we've had over the last 50 years, I mean, I'm thinking about personal computer and the internet and the mobile phone and stuff, they all had this big hardware component that was a big part of the distribution. And so you had the internet, and initially it was just these universities that were talking with one another, but obviously over time we got the whole world plugged into the internet and it took years and years and years. Same thing was true with mobile phones. Same thing was true with PC.\n\n(01:05:06):\nAnd the thing that's interesting about that in particular, which is I would say we're already seeing the effects of that, is in these hardware distribution machines, obviously there's a lot that depends on real time. And so folks who were building for those industries saw their market grow and grow and grow basically steadily year over year as the number of people with mobile phones increased, as the number of people connected to the internet increased. And many of those businesses, it's still crazy to think, but many of those businesses got started right in the beginning. I mean, Apple and Microsoft were started right around the same time. And same is true for a lot of the great internet businesses or wherever, but certainly it was something that touched whole world with time or a large fraction of the whole world. And it had a really massive impact, but it took place over several years because of the time that it took. And I think one of the things which is already I'd say different in AI, is just how explosive the technology can be. Once AI could, and I think we're firmly past the inflection point in AI code where it's, as an engineer, if you're not using AI at all to write code, I mean you're falling behind honestly. And it is a technology that everyone should have and should be using, and there's no kind of weight on hardware distribution that is causing that. It means that the space is just growing so exponentially, basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:36):\nMichael Ballin has this interesting point that cliches are cliches because they're so true and that's why they're cliches. I heard that a million times and I think it's like people hear this like, \"Yeah, yeah, I know,\" but it's actually insane what is happening. That's why you're here to help us through this transition.\n\nScott Wu (01:06:52):\nYeah, no, I mean, it is a fun time and I think there will be real investment and real work that it takes. But I think from the perspective of us as engineers, for example, I think it just means it's so important to stay in the loop with everything that's happening. And as we're seeing it's not only because of your learning and your ability to work these technologies, but it's also about basically teaching the AI what there is to know about your code base in order to make it really effective at building with you and doing more of the things that you would want it to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:27):\nSo along those lines, for people listening that they're like, \"Hey, we should be using Devin at our company,\" what are things you've found to be helpful in helping an engineer at a company get adoption and be able to use Devin either culturally or logistically?\n\nScott Wu (01:07:42):\nSo a pattern which we often see with folks is there will be a few folks at the team who are really excited and want to try out the new thing, and they want to put in the investment and are really excited to get it going. And they'll go through all the setup. They'll give Devin the repos, they'll teach Devin how to run the lint and the CI and all of those details. And they'll start off by giving it those initial tasks and help Devin build a foothold basically. And as time goes on, eventually folks will see, \"Wow, Devin's writing all these PRs, Devin's doing this [inaudible 01:08:14].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:13):\nWho's this Devin person that just joined the company's just knocking out PRs?\n\nScott Wu (01:08:17):\nYeah. And they'll see that, and then naturally they'll get on and they'll get an account. And one of the cool things of course is by the time they join, Devin already knows a good amount of detail about the repositories that they're already working in and they're working with that. And so one of the really cool things which we often see is that the early adopters themselves can really pave the way I think, for everyone else on the team.\n\n(01:08:37):\nBut yeah, I think the main thing I would just kind of call out is it really does take, it's a very different product experience, and I think for what it's worth, I think there's still a lot more that we can do to make it as intuitive and as clear as possible to folks like how to use Devin and what the right steps are and how to really maximize value out of Devin. But I think that, yeah, it's the kind of thing where if you put in the investment and understand exactly what it takes to get Devin to be successful, we've found ourselves that as time has gone on, we just use Devin more and more and more with every next update.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:15):\nSo let me follow that thread. There is a question I ask every AI app building founder, which is, if you could sit next to every new user of Devin and whisper something in their ear to help them be successful with Devin, one or two tips, what would those tips be?\n\nScott Wu (01:09:31):\nI think the biggest thing I would say is it really is just treat Devin like your new junior engineer. And I think that's the biggest thing. I think folks come in and they see the blank page and they think of all sorts of various things that they want to try out. They think of lots, where I think typically the flow that we see that works best is obviously you can try demos and you can do things, but a lot of it is just like, \"Yeah, let's figure out what tickets we want to get done today or this week and let's have Devin get started on those and let's start with the easier ones and then work with Devin and understand what things Devin needs to get set up to be able to test its own code and do this well. And then let's scale up over time.\" And then obviously as you work with your engineer, you understand better how to communicate with them or what are the right tasks or projects to bring them in on. But I think that really is the one-liner for us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:31):\nOkay. There's a question I'd be meeting task. I just want to get back to this because it's something I think a lot about with Devins. Everyone's going to have five Devins, let's say 10 Devins. Everyone's kind of turning into basically an engine manager with a bunch of junior engineers, which isn't necessarily the best job in the world because it's just a bunch of, at least you don't have to do performance reviews and one-on-ones, but it's sitting around, checking a lot of PRs all day. There's a sense of you become an architect, which is kind of what every engineer wants to become eventually, right? They're all, \"I just want to think about the architecture. I don't want to code all these stupid, fix bugs.\"\n\n(01:11:06):\nSo I get that there's a good side to that, but just I imagine you're thinking a lot about this, just like how do you make life pleasant and fun and enjoyable as basically an engine manager of say, 500 Devins in the future?\n\nScott Wu (01:11:19):\nYeah, I can just imagine the performance, \"Devin, you've done a really great job on your task, but I really would like you to be more proactive in the team meetings.\" So what I'd say-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:29):\n[inaudible 01:11:29].\n\nScott Wu (01:11:29):\nIt's funny actually because something that in terms of the wording that we thought a lot about as well is just, we've used the term manager of Devins in the past, which of course I think is a big part of it. But I think that the only thing I would point out here is I think that the bricklayer versus architect is closer to the experience than being a manager. Because I think a lot of the difficulty of management or the reason that people shy away from it is more because of a lot of the various.\n\nScott Wu (01:12:00):\n... [inaudible 01:12:00] because of a lot of the various, let's say... There's all of the context, and the ownership, and the responsibility and stuff, and then there's also all of the emotional aspects of it. Where, I think working with Devin is a little more like just being, more as having an interface to hand off tasks and build tasks. And so, the parallel that I would draw is when we invented Python, obviously... It's like, in many ways the description and the outlining of tasks, obviously it was a different paradigm, but I think certainly it was nowhere near what folks typically think of as management bureaucracy today.\n\n(01:12:50):\nAnd I think that with Devin, a lot of it is just like, it's more like finding the right levels of abstraction that you could work with Devin on, and just finding the workflows that work really well, and the obvious thing to say here is, it's like you can always have Devin take a first pass at things. And so you have Devin take the first pass, if it's great, you merge it right away, if it needs some touch up, you can obviously give that feedback, for example, but a lot of it is like, it's more about, basically making Devin part of your flow than it losing control, which I think is the main thing that folks are scared of with management.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):\nAre you thinking about a manager Devin? Like a Devin that manages other Devins?\n\nScott Wu (01:13:37):\nYeah, yeah. So, for what it's worth, Devin can start other Devins through the API, right? And so, we've seen this happen quite a bit of times, where naturally if you have some big tasks that you want to do, Devin will do this all the time, it'll chunk up and then [inaudible 01:13:53] into smaller Devins. And so, it's the kind of thing that you need to give Devin the credentials to be able to do that, it's not currently something that is default enabled, but I can certainly imagine as time goes on that there's more and more of that\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:03):\nDevins all the way down.\n\nScott Wu (01:14:05):\nYeah, yeah. I think the thing that's kind interesting too is, with humans, the way I almost say it, in technical terms, it's like there's this coupling of a context and a thread, and what I mean by that is basically, each human can only operate a single threaded on the work that they do, and they have their set of context, and then there's other humans obviously who can do other stuff at the same time, but they have their own context. With agents, one of the cool things is you can have an agent that's doing multiple lines of exploration at once, but is sharing all of the context of everything that they find, and so I think that this is very early, and I think we'll see this, but folks obviously love to talk about basically systems of agents communicating with one another, and I think that there will be a lot of new paradigms to build for, once we get there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:55):\nAnd it's so interesting what you said about the decision between having one Devin and only one Devin do all the things, and you just tell them things and they fire off jobs versus you have five Devins, and they're each doing individual things, it's such an interesting decision to make.\n\nScott Wu (01:15:10):\nYeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:12):\nOkay, two more questions. Maybe the most counterintuitive thing you've learned so far building Devin, that maybe goes against startup wisdom, common startup wisdom?\n\nScott Wu (01:15:21):\nSomething I've thought about a lot lately as we've built this is, this is not my first company, actually for a lot of us, it's not our first company, I think of our 26 or 27 people total on the team, I think 18 of us have started our own company before this. And yeah, one of the things I think about is, there's actually your point about cliches I think really spoke to me as well, which is, there's the really common things which you hear all the time in startups, where you're like, you got to move fast, or you got to hire great people, it's like, okay, well, obviously you do, I wasn't planning on not hiring great people, I wasn't planning on going slow. And similarly it's like, yeah, you really got to build something that people want. And there's these three to five things which are always repeated, and they're always the common wisdom in startups.\n\n(01:16:11):\nAnd I definitely had this idea as a founder, when I was starting initially, that, all right, so those are the three to five basic things, but as you get really deep into it, you spend a lot of years into it, you learn all of the thousands of other things that you have to learn to build a company. And I think to some extent that's, of course, true, and there's lots of little details that you'll get into with all these different things, including team building, and product, and strategy, and engineering decision-making, and fundraising, and sales, and every other component. But I also realized that as time has gone on, more and more, I felt like building companies well sometimes just comes down to doing those three to five things just even more than you could possibly expect.\n\n(01:16:58):\nAnd so, with us, it's like... And everyone says we go fast, but it's like, yeah, we had a hackathon in November, we had another hackathon in December, we started the company officially in January, we got the prototypes out to initial users in February, we did a launch in March, we got our first customers in April... It's just like, basically truly pushing the pace in every spot where we possibly could has really made a difference for us. And similarly, it's like, yeah, everyone always says you should hire great people, but I think that the truth within that truth is basically you should fight to all ends basically, to get the folks that you really want to bring in. And one of my favorite stories to share is we had a candidate who came and interviewed, he was a junior at MIT, so he was very, very young, and we gave him an interview, and he did way better than almost any of the full-time candidates that we had ever talked to. And so, we said, hey, what do you think about taking some time off of school and working with us and building out Devin?\n\n(01:17:57):\nWe really think you're just going to be able to come in and just have a ton of impact already from day one. And he thought about it for a while, and he came back and he said, you know what? I'm down, I want to do it, but my parents really want me to graduate from school, and I'm just not sure there's a way to make it work. And so, we talked him more and just understood the situation, and then we flew to North Carolina, went straight from the airport to his parents' house, had dinner with him and his parents, we talked a lot, a really nice Gujarati family, we gave them some gifts and just talked to them about it, and try to understand what would it take, and what would we need to make work. And they just said, it sounds like a great opportunity, but we really want our son to be able to graduate.\n\n(01:18:45):\nAnd we talked that through and we figured out a setup basically, where he could work for us essentially full time, but then come in for his required classes, and do what he needed to do to get the diploma basically, but no more than that. And we talked that through, and then we got to a point where everyone was happy with that, and then went straight back to the airport and flew right back, basically. And that was the first and only time that I've ever been in North Carolina, and it was just a great trip. And it is the kind of thing where it's like, hiring great people is one thing, but truly just never giving up, and really giving it everything that you can to make it work for people who really makes sense to be on the team. And he's been with us on the team for over a year now, and he's been an incredible, incredible engineer, and we wouldn't be here without him.\n\n(01:19:31):\nAnd similarly, we had someone else who was again, really, really talented candidate, did amazingly well, very young, and had a lot of great offers at a lot of other companies, and we were talking to them about, he wanted to start his own company someday as well, and we were talking to him about certainly a lot of the obvious things, which are having him meet our investors, or get to do work with customers, or see a lot of these other components so that when the time came that he would have all the experience he needed to start his own company. But one of the other things that was big is he was talking with a lot of great companies already, he didn't want to burn any bridges, and so we actually worked with him and basically hand wrote all of his rejection responses to each of the other companies, and worked with him on it to say, here's how you should say it in a way that's going to come off as that you really did appreciate the time with them, and that obviously you want to remain close with them and stay in touch. And it was the kind of thing obviously where it's like, look, obviously our job is to make sure that he's happy enough that he doesn't want to leave at any time in the near future, but I think it's the kind of thing where the way that you put together a really, really great team is by fighting for what's right for them too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):\nWow, those are incredible stories. And it makes so real these, as you say, cliches, hire the best people, this is what it sounds like to hire the best people. This is what it takes.\n\nScott Wu (01:20:56):\nYeah, no, and I was just saying, a lot of things we've fought very hard to just reimagine things from the ground up because a lot of it really is just thinking about where do we think the technology is going over the next five, 10 years, and what is the place that we want to have in that future?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:16):\nI wonder if people are going to be fighting for the best Devin someday. They're just going to [inaudible 01:21:19] Devins.\n\nScott Wu (01:21:18):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:19):\nThey're [inaudible 01:21:22] so smart.\n\nScott Wu (01:21:22):\nI'll give you overtime pay, benefits, free healthcare, and everything, and then the Devin's like...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:29):\nThree Devins like Magic: The Gathering cards.\n\nScott Wu (01:21:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:32):\nAnd then just going back to your three to five things. So, essentially this is incredible advice, essentially, it's like you always hear hire the best people, move fast, build things people want.\n\nScott Wu (01:21:41):\nYeah, build something people want, stay as close as possible to your customers, and then I think the other thing is just always think about where things are going, not where they are today. I feel like those are the five things, which is... Especially in AI, with things moving so fast, and there's so much great talent, I feel like a lot of these are even more true, where it's like it's not just thinking about where things are going to be in 10 years, it's like thinking about what's going to happen next week. And obviously, things are moving very quickly, and it is very hard to predict, but you really have to be very rigorous with yourself, I'd say, about thinking through those things and evaluating all of the decisions that you make in that lens.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:25):\nAnd staying focused is the big takeaway to me here, is it ends up feeling like there's 1000 things you should do, but it's always these five things.\n\nScott Wu (01:22:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:33):\nScott, we covered a lot of ground. We went through every question I had, which is great, is there anything else that you want to share? Anything else you want to leave your listeners with, maybe a final nugget or something really you want to double down on that we said before we let you go?\n\nScott Wu (01:22:49):\nThe biggest thing that comes to mind for me is there's a lot of different perceptions about AI, right? I think basically every emotion under the sun right now. There's a lot of fear, for example, there's also a lot of skepticism, and we're very skeptical types as well, and we always wanted to try it ourselves to really see it and believe it. And I think the main thing that comes to mind for me, is I'm honestly really optimistic about what we're building here with AI, not just with code and with Devin, but the whole space, and everything that's getting done. And I think one of the cool things that is really actively happening is just the ability for everyone to multiply themselves, and that's how we've always thought about it, it's how we've thought about what we're building. And I think there is a lot more to do out there in the world, I'm not too worried about us running out of things to do, and from that lens, I think that the thing that we've always been most excited about is, how can we all do more?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):\nI hear you Scott. Well, with that optimism, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nScott Wu (01:23:59):\nYeah, let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:00):\nOkay, here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nScott Wu (01:24:07):\nIn terms of nonfiction, I think for folks in startups, I think one of the things that I've really enjoyed is just learning and understanding the history of Silicon Valley. And it's all of these things that we think about, somebody invented them. It's one of the great realizations I feel like, is somebody invented the idea of a seed route, somebody invented the idea of venture capital, somebody invented the idea of product-market fit, and all of these different principles that we talk about. And so, for that, there's a book called The Power Law by Sebastian Mallaby, which I really like. And basically, it's just a tour of many of the great businesses and the great products that have been built over the last 60, 70 years in Silicon Valley, which I really love. I think in terms of fiction, I actually have always really liked The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, it's one of my personal favorites as a fiction book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:57):\nDo you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nScott Wu (01:25:01):\nI have to admit, I have not watched... I can't think of a single movie or TV show that I have watched in the last while, so I'm sure, I'm looking forward to watching a lot of great ones post-AGI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:17):\nThat's got to be in the trailer, that's great, I like that. And that just shows how hard you're working, just how much shit is going on, and how fast everything's moving. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be something physical, could be a toothbrush.\n\nScott Wu (01:25:32):\nOne I would say is I got an Aura frame recently, it's just like a frame that shows photos, and you can show a new photo every day, or every hour, or every 15 minutes, or whatever you like. I've actually, I've really enjoyed it a lot, I think it's a nice way to basically just have a picture frame memories that come up. And then, the other thing I would say as a general purpose thing, it's not particularly new, but I would say, I think AirPods are extremely well-built and well-designed. And I realize now that it's like, I basically use them for all... I'm taking calls on a walk and I'm using AirPods, obviously I'm doing work at my computer, at my desk, I'm plugged into AirPods, and it works quite well, honestly, for a lot of different situations, and they're very comfortable, they're very consistent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:21):\nI'm going to double down on the Aura frame, I also, I got one of these for my mom and my mother-in-law, and they're so great for just sharing photos of your kids with your family. And people have, they've heard of digital picture frames, but the Aura just does it really well, and it's really easy to add photos, and they're just really nice looking.\n\nScott Wu (01:26:39):\nYou can imagine not that long from now, we'll have the Aura Frame except Studio Ghiblifies every photo that you have in it, and then it's... Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:47):\nOr just imagines things you've done that are really cool. Look at my sweet life. Yeah. Cool. And it's Aura, it's A-U-R-A, I believe is how you spell it. Folks who want to check it out, we'll link to it. Not affiliated. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?\n\nScott Wu (01:27:06):\nYeah, something I've thought about a lot is a lot of the proverbs out there are actually contradictions, right? It's like birds of a feather, and then you also have opposites attract, and you have all... And it's kind of funny, because you feel that both of them are true, and often they both are true, and a lot of it is about understanding why. And one of those that I feel like, especially in the world of startups that I think about all the time is, I think it is very important to be focused and driven, and to really maximize your potential, and then at the same time, it's also very important to not let your own personal emotion get tied up in your success or failure, and I think especially with startups, because there's always ups and downs, honestly, even in the most successful companies ever, it's just like, it's a rocky road, there's a lot that happens, and a lot that goes down.\n\n(01:28:03):\nAnd I think one of the things which I've thought a lot about is that somehow you really want to do your best, and put everything you can into it, and do everything you can to... Basically, you want to put it all out on the field. But at the same time, you want to be okay with both wins and losses, and you want to be able to move on, and go into the next one each time. And something, yeah, it's funny, but what I've found personally is that obviously it's really important for your own emotional state and mental state to be able to do that, and we've had lots of mistakes, and I've had a lot.\n\n(01:28:49):\nI had my first company, which obviously, which was cool, but there are a lot of tricky spots there, and then over the course of Cognition, it feels like it's been already eight years compressed into one year, and it's still going at that pace. But somehow it also actually makes you more successful, I think, too. It's like, you are just more able to give it your best, and to do the things that will lead to success if you're not tying it up in your own personal worth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:19):\nThat is so interesting, I just had a podcast recording recently where with an executive coach, Jerry Kelowna, that I think will come out before this, might be after this, that's one of his big pieces of advice, and it's a very Buddhist approach of just [inaudible 01:29:33] and attaching to a certain outcome.\n\nScott Wu (01:29:35):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:36):\nOkay. Final question, I'm curious if there's a story here, but we could keep it short, is there a story behind Devin as the name, or is there another contender for Devin being the [inaudible 01:29:48]?\n\nScott Wu (01:29:47):\nDevin was the name from pretty early on, we were interested, we were working on coding agents from the beginning, and my co-founders are Steven and Walden, for example, and we had this idea, all right, let's get started, and let's try to expand the box as much as we can. So, have everyone think out of the box and do their own thing, and let's have everyone do their own thing first for a bit, and then we'll consolidate and take everything that we've learned. And so, Walden made a virtual developer version of him, which was called DevWalden, and then Steven made one of him, which is called DevSteven, and we had all these... And then we were kind of combining it all into one thing, and we're like, okay, you know? It's Devin. And that was the thing. And so Devin was, yeah, Devin stuck for us quite early on, I would say.\n\n(01:30:31):\nOne thing which we did have a big decision on though actually is what the image of Devin would be. And so, as folks know, there's the hexagons and then people have seen this more recently, but there's actually also an otter, a little otter with a laptop in its lap, and that is Devin as well. And we had this debate over what to go with, and what not to go with and stuff, and it's been a while now, but somehow we still have both the hexagons and the otter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:01):\nYou skipped over where the Devin, did you have just have, it just came to you?\n\nScott Wu (01:31:06):\nOh, so Devin is, it's a dev. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:10):\n[inaudible 01:31:10].\n\nScott Wu (01:31:09):\nAnd so, it was kind of like, when we were consolidating all the names, it just seemed clear then that this would be the universal dev that we all liked to work with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:17):\nWow.\n\nScott Wu (01:31:18):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:18):\nIncredible. Scott, this was so much fun. Oh my God, I learned a ton, which is always a really good sign. Two final questions, where can folks find you/Devin/anything else you want to point them to, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nScott Wu (01:31:29):\nAwesome. Yeah, no, we're at App.devin.ai, and you can find us as well on Twitter or a lot of other social media. We'd obviously love to hear any feedback you have about the Devin product, there's so much to figure out, and I think the, like I said, I think we're all still 20 steps away from really the future of software engineering, and so it really means a lot to hear what folks think about the product as they're trying it out. And so, please let us know anytime if there's things that we can do to make it better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:00):\nScott, thank you so much for being here.\n\nScott Wu (01:32:02):\nThank you so much for having me. I had a great time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:04):\nMe too.

  "transcript": "# The original growth hacker reveals his secrets | Sean Ellis (author of “Hacking Growth”)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nThe Sean Ellis test, such a seemingly simple idea that has had such a profound impact on the startup world.\n\nSean Ellis (00:00:07):\nThe question is, how would you feel if you could no longer use this product? Once you got a high enough percentage of users saying they'd be very disappointed, most of those products did pretty well. If you felt too low, those products tended to suffer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):\nSay someone is listening and they're like, \"Okay. Man, I'm getting like 10%. I don't know what to do.\" What do you find often works?\n\nSean Ellis (00:00:25):\nJust ignore the people who say they'd be somewhat disappointed. They're telling you it's a nice to have. If you start paying attention to what your somewhat disappointed users are telling you and then you start tweaking onboarding and product based on their feedback, maybe you're going to dilute it for your must have users.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):\nMoving retention often is really hard, but I guess it sounds like there's often something you can do.\n\nSean Ellis (00:00:45):\nIt's usually much more function of onboarding to the right user experience than it is about the kind of the tactical things that people try to do to improve retention.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):\nWhat are like three or four things that you think people should definitely try to help improve activation?\n\nSean Ellis (00:00:58):\nIn my experience-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):\nToday, my guest is Sean Ellis. Sean is one of the earliest and most influential thinkers and operators in the world of growth. He coined the term growth hacking, invented the ICE prioritization framework, was one of the earliest people to use freemium as a growth strategy, and maybe most famously developed the Sean Ellis test to help you understand if you have product market fit, which a large percentage of founders use today and profoundly impacted the way startups are built. Over the course of his career, Sean was head of growth at Dropbox and Eventbrite, helped companies like Microsoft and Newbank refine their growth strategy, was on the founding team of LogMeIn, which eventually sold for over $4 billion, and he's the author of one of the most popular growth books of all time called Hacking Growth. In our conversation, we dive deep into two topics. One, how to know if you've got product market fit and what to do if you don't, and two, how to figure out how to grow once you've found product market fit.\n\n(00:01:58):\nIf you're in the early stages of a new product wrangling with product market fit or trying to figure out how to jumpstart or further accelerate growth for your product, this episode is for you. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Sean Ellis.\n\n(00:02:23):\nSean, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nSean Ellis (00:02:27):\nThanks, Lenny. I'm super excited to be on with you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:29):\nThere's so much that I want to talk about. There's so many directions we can go, but to keep it focused, I want to spend time on two areas. I want to talk about how to know if you have product market fit and what to do once you have product market fit in terms of figuring out how to grow. I know these things are very linked. I know you spent a lot of time on these things. How does this feel?\n\nSean Ellis (00:02:49):\nSounds perfect. Yeah, let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:51):\nOkay. Okay, amazing. Let's talk about, first of all, the Sean Ellis test, slash something people call sometimes the product fit test. Such a seemingly simple idea that has had such a profound impact on the startup world. I've never actually seen you talk about the history of this thing, how you came up with these questions, how you came up 40%, the whole journey of this thing. So let's talk about this. But first of all, can you just tell people what is the Sean Ellis test for folks that aren't exactly familiar with this?\n\nSean Ellis (00:03:19):\nIt's a simple question that helps you figure out, does anyone consider your product a must-have, or ideally, who and how many people consider it, but ultimately it's about trying to figure out is your product a must-have, which could be equated to having product market fit. And so the question is, how would you feel if you could no longer use this product? And I give them the choice, very disappointed, somewhat disappointed, or even not disappointed or not applicable, I've already stopped using the product. And what I'm trying to find are those people who say, \"I would be very disappointed if I could no longer use this product,\" then that's a really powerful vein to dig into when you discover that you actually have some people who would give a crap if your product disappears.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:08):\nThis episode is brought to you by Gamma, an entirely new way to present your ideas powered by AI.

If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product pop-ups really annoying. \"Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature.\" And these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible. But every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone.\n\n(00:05:34):\nCommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product, growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. They use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions. And they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps, and websites. And they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/LENNY and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/LENNY. And the idea is that if you, 40% or more of people, say they'd be very disappointed if they can no longer use the product, you essentially have product market fit.\n\nSean Ellis (00:06:40):\nI would say it's a leading indicator of product market fit. The lightning indicator is, do they actually keep using it? So probably retention cohorts are more accurate, but the problem is, like your time at Airbnb, how long do you have to look at a retention cohort before you know that you've actually long-term retained someone?\n\n(00:07:01):\nAnd so with this question, you can kind of find out day one, you don't need a good analytics system in place to be able to see if product market fit exists. And so yeah, the 40% was not something I originally had in there. Originally, I was trying to have just a filter so that I was not treating all feedback from customers the same, but I was trying to find feedback from customers who actually really cared about the product. And then was over time, at the time I was working for a couple of YC-backed companies, and so those companies were all pretty connected, and so I would share the question with a lot of other startups in Silicon Valley. And so over time, I started to see there was a pattern that once you got a high enough percentage of users saying they'd be very disappointed, most of those very disappointed without the product, most of those products did pretty well. And then if you felt too low, those products tended to suffer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:05):\nOkay, there's two things I want to definitely follow up on here. The first is such an important point that you made at the beginning when I introduced this test that you described it as a leading indicator of product market fit and actually retention, people actually using your product, the product actually being used by the market is the actual ultimate test. So the idea here is this is a good way to get a sense of, before you actually have data, are we headed in a good direction? Could you speak more about that, of like, when to use this and when it's most useful in best [inaudible 00:08:34]?\n\nSean Ellis (00:08:33):\nYeah. I mean, so for me in particular, when I come into a company, my goal is to help them grow. And so I don't want to put myself in a situation where I'm going to fail because no one actually cares about the product. And so it can really be asked at a company of any stage. It's helpful to understand who your must have users are. But essentially once you have even an MVP, like a very first MVP on the product, you can still get some useful feedback about the product if it's resonating with anyone.\n\n(00:09:08):\nSo I actually had a company where I had committed to work with them. It was right after I left Dropbox and I committed to work with these guys for six months to help them grow. I ran the question and it came back at only 7% of users saying they'd be very disappointed without the product. And so I'm like, \"I have six months to help them grow and they're only at 7% right now. It might take six months to get the 40%. Am I doing them a disservice by being in a growth role and being on payroll during this period of time?\" But fortunately with the signal and the information we got from the initial survey, we were able to get them at 40% in two weeks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:50):\nWow. What did you do there just as a case study?\n\nSean Ellis (00:09:53):\nYeah. Yeah. So the company called Lookout, it's a mobile security company, and now most of the things in Lookout are built into iPhones and Androids. But at that time, the product had everything from backup my data to find my lost phone to protecting your phone with a firewall and antivirus. And so when we ran this initial survey, I dug into the 7% who said they'd be very disappointed without the product and found that most of that 7% were focused on the antivirus functionality. So they were like, they know they need to protect their computer from viruses, smartphones were becoming more like computers, so it just made a lot of sense for them that they'd need to protect their phone. And interesting, at the time, I think there was only one kind of phone virus that had ever even happened, but it was a pretty easy mental leap for people.\n\n(00:10:50):\nAnd so now we knew, okay, it's antivirus that people really valued. And so step one was just reposition the product on antivirus. So that kind of creates a filter. So anyone who now is coming in to sign up for the product who doesn't care about antivirus is not going to convert, and those who are excited about antivirus are going to convert. We already know from the initial survey that people value that after they convert. So by setting the right expectations around it up front, you're going to bring people in with the right expectations. But then the second thing that we did was we streamlined onboarding so that the first thing that they did after signing up for the product was to set up the antivirus and then get a message \"you're now protected from viruses.\"\n\n(00:11:38):\nAnd so it's really the combination of those two things. It's set the right expectations and then speed to value. And so the next cohort of people that we surveyed were at 40% saying they'd be very disappointed without the product. So that literally took two weeks to make those changes. Six months later, it was 60% on the score. And then I think they hit the billion dollar valuation four or five years later on ultimately being one of the early unicorns.\n\n(00:12:11):\nAnd interestingly, as all of those things were built into mobile phones now, they've completely changed the business, but they continue to do really well, but they've continued to iterate the business. I think that having that kind of finger on the pulse early in the business was important to build the muscle in the business to be really responsive as the market changed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:35):\nSean, this is already amazing. There's just a fractal of topics I want to explore from this very short conversation already. So the first is just follow this thread of basically you're sharing kind of a growth strategy that I imagine you execute, is look for the percentage of people that would be very disappointed if your product went away, see who they are, see what they're excited about and lean into that both positioning-wise, onboarding-wise, and probably also cut out stuff from your product that they don't care about.\n\nSean Ellis (00:13:02):\nYeah. And I was coming at it from a marketing perspective initially. Over time, I position myself more in a growth role with product and marketing as areas I could influence. But as a marketer, I probably didn't have a lot of influence on a engineering founded company to say, \"Let's cut out stuff.\" So it made more sense to say, \"Let's just sequence the onboarding so that we're highlighting this and onboarding to this.\" That was a little easier to sell.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:33):\nAnd just hearing that you can move this score so quickly without even changing the product substantially, I imagine what surprised a lot of people when you think about moving retention often is really hard. And maybe we talk about that, but I guess it sounds like there's often something you can do that's not very hard that might significantly shift this product market fit test.\n\nSean Ellis (00:13:57):\nRight. And then that ultimately moving retention is really hard, but it's usually much more function of onboarding to the right user experience than it is about the tactical things that people try to do to improve retention.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):\nOkay. I want to put a pin on that and come back to that because a really important topic. I'm going to come back to, say someone runs this survey and they get 40%, what should they have in their mind of like, \"This is what this is telling me\"? Because I think a lot of people are like, \"I got product market fit. I got this. Let's go, go, go.\" What's the best way to think about what this tells you?\n\nSean Ellis (00:14:30):\nYeah, I mean it tells you something really important, which is, you haven't created something that people don't care about. So that's an important insight. But until you deeply understand that product market fit, you kind of don't have the tools to be able to grow the business. So that's really the next step, is to dig in and figure out who considers it a must have, how are they using the product, what did they use before, what problem are they solving.\n\n(00:14:59):\nOne of my favorite questions is... So I tend to have a lot of questions that I build off of that I'm using that filter, trying to drill into the users who say they'd be very disappointed without the product, and one of my favorite questions is, \"What is the primary benefit that you get?\" And then I use that initially as an open-ended question to kind of crowdsource different benefits people are getting. But then I run another survey where I turn it into a multiple choice question, force them to pick one of four distinctive benefit statements. And then the question that follows on that next survey is, \"Why is that benefit important to you?\" And then I start to get really good context.\n\n(00:15:43):\nSo I actually came up with this question when I was working with an early YC company called Xobni, which is inbox felt backwards. And when I ran that question, basically the people who said they'd be very disappointed without the product we're focused on, \"Xobni helps me find things faster in my email.\" So it's great to know, okay, that's the benefit. But when I asked, \"Why is that benefit important to you?\" They said, \"Oh, I'm drowning in email.\" I kept seeing that statement as a written statement. And so when I then was trying to figure out how to acquire customers, when I tested \"drowning in email?\", that set such a good hook. That was the context that people were living in, that they were really responsive to the message of find things faster with Xobni and then a description of what Xobni is. So I think when you can really dig into the context of why that must have benefit is important to people, you start to get the ingredients to build that flywheel that leads to long-term sustainable growth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:51):\nSo what I'm hearing is whether you have 40%, whether you have 60% or even 7%, the actual best use of this tool is look at that percentage of highly disappointed and see what they're looking for, what they're excited about.\n\nSean Ellis (00:17:04):\nStart drilling in, start feeling back that onion-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):\nStart drilling in.\n\nSean Ellis (00:17:06):\n... and just deeply understand them and make sure that ultimately your product roadmap is doubling down on the things that are important to your must-have customers. Onboarding is bringing new people to the right experience. Your messaging is setting the right expectations, your acquisition campaigns are targeting people who actually have the need. And so it's all about getting the right people to the right experience. And then even your engagement loop is about just reinforcing how to get people to experience that benefit more often.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:40):\nAwesome. And the 40% threshold, so what you shared is you basically emerged from just looking at tons of startups doing the survey and finding a pattern. How firm is that 40%? How big of a deal? Is it 39 versus 41?\n\nSean Ellis (00:17:53):\nI don't think it's that firm. To me, I think the real power is having some kind of target for the team to be shooting for that basically says, \"We're not going to aggressively start to grow until we hit this target.\" And I think that as just a focusing piece is really important because I think one of the biggest challenges in an early stage startup is half the people feel like we're years from having this product ready to grow, and half the people are like, \"What are we waiting for?\" Where if you can actually get people on the same page of what does product market fit look like for our business, and it's at that point that we're going to.\n\n(00:18:36):\nBefore I ever heard the term product market fit, I remember the conversations back at LogMeIn in the mid 2000s of kind of like, \"When do we step on the gas? What is the combination of factors that need to be in place before we start pouring fuel on the early fire?\" And so yeah, I think that kind of nail it then scale it. It's probably been a term that's been around for decades now, but it's all kind of pointing to that same concept of product market fit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):\nHow often have you seen false positives with this test where someone gets 40% and something is not right, they're actually far from it? Or is it generally pretty accurate?\n\nSean Ellis (00:19:14):\nIf you're having people say that they'd be very disappointed without your product, that's a really good sign. What I can tell you is that not necessarily a false positive, but what is driving people to say they'd be very disappointed. One of my favorite books is Hooked by Nir Eyal and he talks about in the kind of engagement loop that your last step is investment.\n\n(00:19:38):\nAnd so I ran the survey on a business that I thought was a fairly commoditized business. Part of it I wanted to see, could I use the same go-to-market approach on a later stage company and use it to accelerate growth. And so this was a business called webs.com. They eventually got acquired by VistaPrint. But they'd been pretty flat for the year before I went in there. And then I started to use this approach to try to dial in their growth engine. I ran the survey thinking, \"Yeah, you've had products like Wix and Weebly that have come on to the market since this more legacy website building product has been around. I personally think they're a little easier to use, they're a little better.\" And so I didn't have high hopes when I ran the survey, but it came back with one of the highest scores I'd ever seen. And it was like 90% of the people saying they'd be very disappointed if they could no longer use the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:39):\nHoly shit. I've never seen that.\n\nSean Ellis (00:20:39):\nAnd I was like, \"How could that be possible? This product is kind of a commoditized category. I wouldn't even say it's one of the best.\" And then when I want to dug into it again, it comes back to that Nir Eyal Hooked model, is that the investment people have made in building that website, they put so much into that they know exactly how to make the changes and the kind of the CMS kind of side of things, they have spent a lot of time just making it beautiful. And so ultimately it was something that that was why they were saying they'd be very disappointed.\n\n(00:21:15):\nBut fast-forward when I initially went in, still doing these things help the business resume growth and have significant growth over the next 12 months after we did these things. So still the signal we got from why people would be very disappointed without the product was important and speed to value. All the other things I think about in go-to-market for an early stage product still were relevant, but just I think they were a little stronger on the percentage he'd be very disappointed.\n\n(00:21:51):\nEven Eventbrite when I was there when we ran it was probably the second highest I'd ever seen. But with event organizers, if they've already set their event up on that platform and they've sent it out to their list and all those people are coming in and they're managing their event, again, they've invested a lot in the platform. So sort of switching costs I think can factor in there. So it's a function of both switching costs and utility of the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):\nSo that's a question I wanted to ask is, what's your guidance on when to ask this question? What I'm hearing is, if you ask it very far along the journey, when they're very invested, you'll get a much higher score. Is there any advice on the timing and the best time to ask this question to your users?\n\nSean Ellis (00:22:38):\nWhat I recommend is a random sample of people who've really used your product. So they've gone in, they didn't just sign up, but they went in and hopefully hit that deviation moment. They've used it twice, two plus times, and they've ideally used it, say, within the last week or two weeks, so they haven't churned yet. So if it's a random sample of those people, that's kind of the ideal time to ask it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:09):\nGot it. So basically it's people that have activated whatever that means to you and have been using it for a couple weeks?\n\nSean Ellis (00:23:14):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:14):\nNot people landing in your home page, not people just signing up, not people months later.\n\nSean Ellis (00:23:19):\nNot people who've seen a demo of your product, but it's people who actually have experienced the product. But it's okay if you're hitting people who've used it months later, but in that Lookout example that I gave, if I'm testing people's perception of the product after I made updates to the onboarding, I'm going to only want to survey people who went through the new onboarding.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):\nYep. In the experimental. Yeah. Okay. So I asked people on Twitter what to ask you. A lot of people had a lot of awesome questions. I'm going to sprinkle in a couple of these questions throughout the chat.\n\nSean Ellis (00:23:54):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:54):\nOne came in from Shraaz Doshi, a popular guest of the podcast.\n\nSean Ellis (00:23:59):\nOne of the ones that I listened to recently.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:01):\nAmazing. I think it's the second most popular episode behind Brian Chesky. Okay. So he had a question of just, \"What are the limitations of the score? When does it break down? When should you not use it if ever?\" Is there anything of just like, \"Here's when it's not going to work for you\"?\n\nSean Ellis (00:24:14):\nYeah. I think one-off products would probably, like, how would you feel if you could no longer watch the movie you just watch? I wouldn't care. Even when I run a workshop, I don't run this as part of my survey after I do a workshop because how would you feel if you could no longer attend the workshop you just attended? It doesn't make sense. So I'll ask an NPS question as my filtering question so that I'm looking at focusing in on feedback of people who love it, also then through a separate lens, looking at people maybe who would be my detractors. So I think one-off products are probably not good products to run the question on. There may be other places as well that I'm not thinking of right now, but that [inaudible 00:25:00].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):\nIt sounds like not many. What I'm hearing is it's generally widely applicable.\n\nSean Ellis (00:25:04):\nYeah, I think it is, at least from my perspective. It's been really useful for me anyway.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:12):\nAwesome. Okay. And then the follow-up question from Shraaz is, and I kind of asked this, but I'm curious if there's anything more here, just, \"Have you seen any instances of startups over relying on the score prematurely declaring product market fit when in reality they haven't reached it yet? And just are there any other caveats of like, 'Cool, I got 40%'?\" Is there anything else you should know, like, \" Okay. But maybe check this one thing\"?\n\nSean Ellis (00:25:31):\nYeah, I mean, I think to me it's kind of like what really is the definition of product market fit is the definition that people who get through my crappy onboarding and actually experience the product love it. And if I'm able to retain those people, that means I have product market fit. Or, is fixing that crappy onboarding part of getting to product market fit as well? I think that's up for debate.\n\n(00:25:55):\nSo to me, the hardest, I wouldn't obsess on onboarding if I know those who kind of get through the challenge of getting started with the product still don't like the product then feels like it's a core product issue or wrong people using it in the wrong way issue. But once you have that, then ultimately it doesn't mean that you're ready to grow. When I focus on growth, then customer acquisition is almost the last step. Once I validate that it's a must have for those early users, then I'm thinking about, \"Okay, how do I optimize speed to value? How do I make sure that people have the right prompts to come back and use the product at the right time so that's kind of more of that engagement loop? How do I get my existing users to bring in more users if there's something that makes sense on that end? Even how do I optimize my revenue model?\"\n\n(00:26:53):\nOnce all of those things are working well, then I'll obsess on the customer acquisition side. But customer acquisition is so hard that if you're not really efficient at converting-\n\nSean Ellis (00:27:00):\n... customer acquisition is so hard that if you're not really efficient at converting and retaining and monetizing people, you're going to really struggle on the customer acquisition side.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:09):\nYeah, cool. And we'll talk about customer acquisition/growth.\n\nSean Ellis (00:27:13):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:14):\nAnother question I wanted to ask, and a couple listeners asked, is the 40%. I had Jag from Nubank on the podcast, I think you may have worked with them, and they use 50% as their threshold because apparently Brazilians are very nice.\n\nSean Ellis (00:27:27):\nYeah. Optimistic I think is what I said.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:31):\nYeah. I guess the question is do you find instances where you should increase that percentage? And in B2B, is anything different? Do you change the percentage in B2B? Any advice there just when you adjust the threshold?\n\nSean Ellis (00:27:42):\nYeah, I hadn't really thought too much on that. Again, for me, generally I'm trying to just figure out is this a product that can grow? So if I got a 37%, am I going to be like, \"Oh no, this would be impossible?\" Or if I had a 70%, does that mean I'd say, \"Oh yeah, I want to jump in and work with this company?\" It's more nuanced than that. Obviously, if it's a 70%, but I have no idea how I grow the business, I'm going to be stuck there. But I do think he brought up a really good point that, culturally, some people are going to be more optimistic or pessimistic. Interestingly, when I came up with the question, I used to just use a normal satisfaction question.\n\n(00:28:39):\nWhen I was working at Xobni, I'm just an intensely curious person anyway, so I'm just trying to dig in and understand the customers, and so I've always done lots of surveying. But at Xobni, I was going to use my filter as a satisfaction question, so how satisfied are you with this? I'm very satisfied. I'm somewhat satisfied. And our main customers were actually senior management, and so I thought senior management's never satisfied. I'm going to get always this super lukewarm thing. How can I change this question to give me a more real answer from these guys? Well, if I flip it and say, \"How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?\" I'll probably get a more honest answer back from them. And of course, they're very disappointed if they can't get what they want.\n\n(00:29:29):\nAnd so initially it was just for the case of Xobni, but then I went to Dropbox right after Xobni and like, \"Oh, I'll try the question again.\" And the insights I got back were really useful. And so each company I went to, I kept using the question. I'm like, this works way better than your typical satisfaction question. But initially, it was more about thinking just senior management to get a more honest answer out of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:54):\nSo that's the origin story right there?\n\nSean Ellis (00:29:56):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:57):\nWow. That senior managers are just very harsh and they don't need anything?\n\nSean Ellis (00:30:02):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:02):\nAnd you have to flip it. That is so interesting. That question is such a good reminder of how hard it is to build anything people really would be disappointed not to have. That's why this works so well. People are like, \"I don't need this. Who cares?\" That's the core of this, is just that is hard.\n\nSean Ellis (00:30:19):\nEspecially when I first moved to Silicon Valley. The first 15 years of my career were not in Silicon Valley, and so I was in Eastern Europe and then New York and then Boston. But you move to Silicon Valley and you have people who get really excited about technology for technology's sake. And so just something being cool is like, \"Isn't it cool that we can actually do this?\" drives a lot of people. And so to me, I'm very practical. If it's not something that is really bringing value to people, then the likelihood that that product's successful long-term is going to be pretty low.\n\n(00:30:59):\nEven, interestingly, at Dropbox, through the six months I was there, I'd ask one question multiple times a month. I broke the early beta users into a bunch of different lists. And I'd ask, \"Which best describes you? I like to be among the first to try cool new technology, or, I only try things that I think will be useful for me?\" And over the six months, it flipped from 90% being people who try things that they want to try cool new technology to six months later, it was people who only are going to try something that they feel like is useful. But what's cool is just because what motivates you to try something is you're an early adopter and you want to try something cool, if you're going to keep using it, it's because it's giving you some utility. And so I can still use those early adopters to help me figure out where's the value inside the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):\nAwesome. So actually, two questions along those lines. How durable do you find this percentage being? Say you hit 40%, how often does that fade and go away versus stay there or go higher?\n\nSean Ellis (00:32:07):\nYeah, I haven't seen it really fade back down, but I've seen companies fail despite having it. And I think a lot of times then, it becomes an execution challenge. Once you have product-market fit, not everyone's going to be a good executor. But before that, I think getting to product-market fit, obviously there's a lot of methodology for doing it today that might make it a bit easier for people, but I still think it's fairly random and pretty dang hard. And so ultimately, the risk factor of creating something that people care about is really difficult. So if you can get to the point where you have 40% of the people who are using it saying they'd be very disappointed, and you have a reasonable sample size. Let's say you've got 10 people and four of them said they'd be very disappointed without it, you're still going to get something useful from those four. But I wouldn't say that's a sample size that you can really go to market on, so yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:07):\nWhat's a good sample size you look for of just, \"Okay, this is actually good data I want to rely on?\"\n\nSean Ellis (00:33:11):\nIt's really funny. So much of the stuff I self-learned, but I basically at one point said I need at least 30 responses, and I just thought I randomly made up a number and then I had people telling me, \"Yeah, 30 is the minimum that you want on stuff.\" Okay. And even when I first created this survey, I remember showing it to the co-founder of SlideShare and her PhD was in survey-related stuff like cognitive psychology, but she basically said it was really about surveying. And she's like, \"This methodology is amazing. How did you come up with this?\" And so having some of that validation around these things helped. But a lot of it was just, again, driven by my own curiosity and also just knowing that that failure is such a likely outcome that trying to reverse engineer that failure, and then the number one reason for failure would be that people don't actually care about the product. And so when I find that, that's a really good sign that we're now down to an execution challenge.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:15):\nAnd there's this obvious element of you may have product-market fit with people, but that group might end up being very small and the business you build around it could actually be cool, but it's not going to be a massive business. Is there anything there you can share? It's hard to know the size opportunity even though some people really, really like it.\n\nSean Ellis (00:34:35):\nYeah, I talked about I go to a multiple choice after I initially use open-ended questions to crowdsource the different use cases. But then I try to force people in a bucket, and then I can run filters on each of those buckets and I'll be like, \"Oh, people who use it this way are like 60% likely to be very disappointed without the product, but people who use it this way are 35% likely to be very disappointed, but way more people use it the 35% way.\" And so then, do you want that intensely loyal group or the much broader group that's maybe a bit less, but almost there?\n\n(00:35:17):\nI think that becomes a bit of a strategic conversation of do we want to have a better chance of surviving, going after a niche that we know we can serve well? Or have we raised so much money that we have to go after a really big market, and one that's not going to be long-term? But maybe then you're like, \"Okay, once I have traction in that market, I can start to try to appeal to some other markets.\" But I think that's where some strategic decisions come in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:47):\nDo you have a heuristic of which you often recommend or is it very dependent on the situation?\n\nSean Ellis (00:35:53):\nI prefer a more passionate customer base and work from there, just because I think your biggest competition when you're really innovating is just being irrelevant. And so if you're deeply relevant to anyone, I think that gives you a much better chance of long-term success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:12):\nAwesome. That's a really good insight. Okay, two more questions along this line and then I want to talk about growth strategy. One very tactical question. Is there a tool you recommend for doing this sort of survey? Do you recommend inline? In the product? An email? Something else?\n\nSean Ellis (00:36:26):\nI've used a lot of different tools. I actually had a survey business that I sold to private equity years ago. It is called Qualaroo. That's an inflow survey tool. I think just using SurveyMonkey with emailed surveys works fine. And for me, it's a lot more of what's pleasant for the customer to fill out and then what's going to give me something where I can work really easily with the data? So at Bounce, for example, they had already intercom in place that had just introduced surveying, but it was a really crappy customer experience, at least at that time. That's been almost a year now or actually a little over a year. And so I'm really sensitive to is it a good survey experience for the consumer itself? But yeah, I don't think I'm stuck to any one platform there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:30):\nSuch an important topic. Just, again, to remind people why this is so important, one of the most common questions founders ask is, \"Do I have product-market fit? Have I built something people want?\" That's just an endless series of, \"I don't know. How do I know? When do I know?\" And this is telling you in a really interesting way. So your advice is this is a leading indicator. You don't actually know until people actually start using it and whether they retain and continue using it. Is there just advice on the shift you make from relying on the survey to actually looking at retention cohorts? Is it just once you have enough data, once you have a couple of cohorts, then start looking at that? Forget about the survey?\n\nSean Ellis (00:38:05):\nYeah, but retention cohorts don't give you any of the qualitative insights into the why, so that's why we continue to do the survey. So initially I would say if the survey comes back and it shows whatever your target number is... If you want to be Nubank, it'd be a 50%. Or two of the companies I launched, we launched in Hungary, and I would say it was the opposite end of the spectrum of Brazil, maybe more pessimistic than the average culture. And so maybe 30% is good enough there, but that ultimately, whatever your target is, that you have the signal that says, \"Okay, we have enough value here. Let's start working on growing the business.\" But while you're working on growing the business, I would be paying attention to those retention cohorts. And if you're churning out all the customers who were saying that they'd be very disappointed without the product, then okay, let's retrench and rethink, do we really have product-market fit here and what do we need to do to get it if we don't?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:12):\nAwesome. And speaking of Nubank, if anyone wants to see how a company has actually operationalized this in the way they operate, that there's an episode that we'll link to in the show notes where every new product at Nubank they build, before they launch it, they wait for 50% threshold. For people to say 50% of people would be disappointed if this product did not exist as they're developing it. And only then do they launch it publicly.\n\nSean Ellis (00:39:36):\nYeah, I think they even do it down to the feature level.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:39):\nWow.\n\nSean Ellis (00:39:40):\nSo if you think about it, how would you feel if you can no longer use this feature starts to give you, again, the signal, is that feature a must-have feature? And if it's not, maybe we shouldn't have it. And so yeah, I was super excited when I saw how they were using the survey and they were doing it before I engaged with them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:00):\nOh, wow. That's awesome.\n\nSean Ellis (00:40:01):\nBut they were doing it, I think, from pretty early on in the business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):\nThe reason they can do this is they have a lot of users. They have millions of millions of users, so they can ask some small percentage of people this question. Because people hearing this might be like, \"Oh my God, how many times am I going to be asked this question when I'm using this feature?\" But they have a lot of users, so it's easier.\n\nSean Ellis (00:40:17):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:18):\nOkay. Last question, I promise, along these lines. Say someone is listening and they're like, \"Okay. Man, I'm getting 10%, I'm getting 15%. I don't know what to do to increase my product-market fit.\" You should have just a strategy of just dig into the people that are very disappointed and see what they have to say. But any other advice/what do you find often works in helping people move from, say, 10% to 40%?\n\nSean Ellis (00:40:43):\nYeah, so one of the things that's cool about almost open-sourcing the survey approach is, again, watching how Nubank has evolved their usage. But one of the other companies that I think used it in an interesting way is Superhuman. And I would say that they basically ended up probably putting a lot more momentum behind the question than it had even before. They posted something about how they did it on First Round Capital's blog. And what I have always said, and again, it's me coming at it from probably initially a marketing background, which is I'm taking the product as a fixed thing, and how do I actually figure out how to market and grow this product? And product changes are going to take a long time, and so what are the variables that I can control with a marketing background? So one of the things I've always said is just ignore the people who say they'd be somewhat disappointed. They're telling you it's a nice to have. They're as good as gone, so just ignore those guys.\n\n(00:41:54):\nI'll put one piece in the middle there before I say what Superhuman did. The reason that I say ignore those guys is that if you start paying attention to what you somewhat disappointed users are telling you, and then you start tweaking onboarding and product based on their feedback, maybe you're going to dilute it for your must-have users. And ultimately, it becomes kind of good for everyone but not great for anyone. And so that was my fear of trying to read too much into the users who say they'd be somewhat disappointed. But the Superhuman guys actually found, I think, a good way around that where they said, \"Okay, what is the benefit that my must-have users are focused on? And then of the users who say they'd be somewhat disappointed, so the nice-to-have users, of those users who are also focused on that benefit, what do they need in the product for it then to become a must-have for them?\"\n\n(00:42:48):\nAnd so they're staying true to that core benefit, but they're trying to essentially take those on-the-fence users and moving them up. And so I think their way of approaching that addressed what my concern was, which is are we going to break it for the must-have users?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:05):\nThat's an awesome insight. By the way, did Rahul and the team there just do this on their own or were you involved in any way in this at Superhuman?\n\nSean Ellis (00:43:11):\nNo. That's the same thing. Like I said, I wasn't initially involved with Nubank. I wasn't involved with them. We wrote about it in our book in 2017, and so I think that I got it out there. But I actually teamed up with the Kissmetrics team in 2012, and essentially published this survey on survey.io where we just made it freely available for people and a really easy template to prepare and send out, and the how-to guide on it. It was all just free. Kissmetrics is using it as maybe lead gen. And for me, I just wanted a way to put something out for the community. And so it's been out there for a long time, so it's not surprising that different companies have found different unique ways to use it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:01):\nThat's awesome. I think that post is one of the most popular in First Round. It really had an impact on a lot of people.\n\nSean Ellis (00:44:05):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:06):\nSo just to repeat, the approach you recommend for when you're digging into... I wrote this down. When you were talking for how to dig into what benefit people are finding, your advice is it's basically a follow-up survey to the extremely disappointed people asking them what is the primary benefit you get? It's an open text initially. Then once you get a collection, you do it sounds like another survey as multiple choice. Here's five benefits-\n\nSean Ellis (00:44:31):\nTo a different group of people, to be clear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:33):\nDifferent group. Yeah. Got it. Awesome. And then it's like, which of these four or five benefits is what you're getting out of this product? And then the question is, why is this benefit important to you?\n\nSean Ellis (00:44:45):\nEventually the survey.io got closed down, but essentially the template that I typically used was then moved to PMFsurvey.com. And so you'll see some other questions that I have on there as well, like what would you use instead if this product were no longer available? And that's one of the interesting things is you start to see people who say they'd be somewhat disappointed, usually, they're focused on a commodity use case and they know an easy alternative to switch to. So to be a must-have, it needs to be both valuable and unique.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):\nOkay. Anything else on this topic of the Sean Ellis task product-market fit test before we move on to growth strategy advice?\n\nSean Ellis (00:45:26):\nNo, I think that's it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:26):\nI think we did almost an hour on that one topic, which I love because I feel like this is such a powerful tool that I think people sort of know and have used, but I think there's a lot of opportunity to use it more effectively. And all the stuff you pointed out about it's not just you have this threshold goal, let's move, let's grow. It's like, this is how you figure out how to make it better and better and grow faster and faster. And it's actually a good segue to talking about growth.\n\n(00:45:50):\nEven though you coined the term growth hacking, you spend most of your time on the opposite, essentially, which is helping companies figure out sustainable growth strategies, not just a bunch of hacks to grow for a little bit and then disappear. And from what I've seen, it's all rooted in this idea of product-market fit and what helps you find product-market fit, and I imagine many of the stuff we've talked about.\n\nSean Ellis (00:46:10):\nYeah. Just one quick interjection there is that when I coined growth hacking, I did not think of it as a bunch of one-off hacks. What I thought of it was what's more about what is the way to ultimately drive sustainable growth? But it's, over time, maybe more interpreted the way you described it, but just to jump in and say that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:30):\nThat's a really good clarification, so how did you actually initially frame it when you first-\n\nSean Ellis (00:46:34):\nYeah, I just said it's about looking at every single thing that you're doing and scrutinizing its impact on growth in the business. And particularly, I think most marketers, when I first moved to Silicon Valley, most CEOs who were asking me to help their companies, they were saying, \"We need help with awareness-building,\" and I'm getting introductions from top VCs. And so, so much of, I think, the way people were approaching growth was marketing textbook how to approach it. And startups just don't have the luxury to do all of those things, and so you got to really focus on how do I acquire customers to an experience that's going to make them keep using this product? And so maybe I picked the wrong term in calling it growth hacking, but I think it at least opened the conversation to getting more people thinking about maybe we should be thinking about growth in a different way than as it's traditionally taught in marketing courses in school.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:33):\nIs there another term you think you should have used? Do you always think back, I should have called it this? Is there anything that you've had in your mind?\n\nSean Ellis (00:47:41):\nI don't. I think sometimes having something that's a little divisive is almost better because it's too easy to just go completely unnoticed. But I was trying to put a name on not just how I was approaching growth, but seeing Facebook obviously had a very different approach to growth than most companies. LinkedIn, Twitter, there was a handful of companies that were approaching it in the same way I had previously been approaching it, and I just thought this thing needs a name. And so I sat down with a couple of friends, came up with a name and it stuck. But yeah, obviously from day one it was pretty divisive with different groups.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:23):\nThat's a fun story. Thanks for sharing that.\n\n(00:48:25):\nOkay, so talking about growth and helping companies figure out how to grow. Say you go to a company, they're getting 42% on the Sean Ellis test, and they're like, \"Okay, cool, let's start thinking about growth.\" What's your first piece of advice to them to start when they're thinking about growth? And then just broadly, how do you approach helping them figure out how to grow?\n\nSean Ellis (00:48:45):\nUltimately, it's about trying to get as many of the right people to that same state that we just talked about with the must-have users, so trying to get as many people to experience the product in a way where they'd be very disappointed if they could no longer use the product. And so that's not just acquisition, which is how most companies think about... Initially, it was awareness then maybe the more developed way was, oh, let's at least focus on profitable acquisition. But in my experience, the hardest part really sits inside the product team, so how do you shape that first user experience so they actually use it in the right way and it's not so difficult that they give up? And that ultimately, we understand what makes it a must-have product. And then what we're trying to do is build a... Yeah, it sounds kind of theoretical here, but I can go into the details on how, but build a flywheel around that must-have value.\n\n(00:49:45):\nSo step one would be understand it. Step two for me is then figure out a metric that essentially captures units of that value being delivered. And so when I think about a north star metric, that's what I'm thinking about is something that reflects how many people are coming in and experiencing that product-market fit experience, whatever that is. And it's not just me telling them, \"Here's what your north star metric should be.\" It's that ultimately the team needs to decide that together. And then really just diagramming, what are all of the different ways that we can grow that north star metric? So that's where you start to actually build, I call it a value delivery engine, but it's what does our onboarding look like? What's that aha moment? That activation? What does the engagement loop look like? Is there any referral? Try to capture it as it is today.\n\n(00:50:47):\nAnd then, from there, thinking about where are the biggest opportunities for improvement, so those high-leverage opportunities, and then ultimately starting to run experiments against those opportunities. Generally, I think I touched on it a little bit earlier, but generally the sequence that I like to do is start with activation because that one's just so critical and it's easy to get lost in between, especially for an early product. The product team's so focused on the roadmap. We're two features away from not even needing marketing anymore. This thing's going to take off. And then a marketing team so focused on bringing new people in, but how do you get those new people to a great first experience falls through the cracks a lot of times. So a lot of focus on activation and then engagement and referral and getting the revenue model right. And then once each of those pieces are working well, then starting to really obsess on the channel side.\n\n(00:51:49):\nOne thing that I'll say. When I go in and directly am involved with a company on the acquisition side, I am thinking about my hypotheses on the acquisition pretty early on, because if I go into it and I have no idea how we'll acquire those customers, I'm not real confident I'll figure it out when I'm there. So I want to have two or three things that seem pretty viable as ways to profitably acquire customers, and knowing that once I get deep into it, I'll probably come up with one or two more and I've got five, one of them's likely to work. But I don't want to just be under the pressure of having to come up with that once I come in, if I don't at least see an angle from that before I get involved with the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:36):\nWhat I'm hearing is when you come into a company and they're asking, \"Sean, how do we figure out how to grow this thing?\" you actually focus first on activation onboarding, and we're going to talk about all these things. Then, after that, basically these are priority order for you. Then it's flywheel engagement referral stuff to see if there's a way to drive that. Then revenue. How do we make money with this and how do we make sure we're doing this profitably? And only then do you start to go big on acquisition top-of-funnel growth.\n\nSean Ellis (00:53:05):\nYeah. I may need to do some acquisition stuff before just to bring enough flow-through, but I'm not obsessing on how scalable is this. It's just like, yeah, let's get enough people coming through that we can start to take the slack out. Part of it comes down to that the acquisition side is so competitive now that if you're not really efficient at converting and retaining and monetizing customers, you can't find scalable, profitable customer acquisition channels.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:33):\nThis is fascinating because I think a lot of people probably do the opposite. Start driving a bunch of growth to a product, then we'll fix onboarding, then we'll figure out how we're making money, and referrals comes along there. So I think this is really important for people to hear. So again, the reason you invest first and focus a lot on onboarding/getting people activated is because that is very correlated to retention and this must-have customer, this, \"I'll be very disappointed,\" customer.\n\nSean Ellis (00:53:58):\nYeah. And they're at highest risk of losing them at that point. They-\n\nSean Ellis (00:54:00):\nThey're at highest risk of losing them at that point. They're probably a little skeptical about a promise that you put out there, but they're intrigued enough to want to use it. But until you get them to that must-have experience, until you kind of get them to that aha moment, they're at their high risk of being lost. And so a lot of people focus on, \"Well, I better get their email address or their phone number.\" But then you're essentially having to reacquire them at that point. So to me, if you can collapse that time to value, I can give you a couple of incredible examples of when we [inaudible 00:54:38]\n\n(00:54:37):\nSo at LogMeIn, when we initially tried to grow the business, I was stuck at being able to spend... I couldn't spend more than $10,000 per month profitably trying to grow the business. And then I dug into the data and I saw that 95% of the people signing up for LogMeIn. So LogMeIn, at the time free remote access for your computer. And so you install software and you can control it from any other computer. So 95% of the people signing up never once did a remote control session. And so not surprisingly, then I had to get my monetization off the 5% who did that was really limiting my ability to find channels that worked.\n\n(00:55:24):\nCredit our CEO with this, that I shared the data with him and he basically told the product team, \"We are putting a complete freeze on the product development roadmap.\" So every single person from product, engineering, design and then also said to me, \"Stop trying to find new channels.\" The three of us on the marketing side are all going to focus on improving the signup to usage rate. And so in three months, we improve the signup to usage rate by a thousand percent. So we went from only 5% of people using the product to 50%. I went back, tried the exact same channels that previously only scaled to $10,000 a month.\n\n(00:56:05):\nNow they scaled to a million dollars a month with a three-month payback on marketing dollars invested. 80% of new users were coming in through word of mouth. So there was this major inflection point by just focusing on activation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:19):\nThis episode is brought to you by Merge. Product leaders, yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration. They're not fun for you to scope, build, launch or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place. Lucky for you. The folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS. Organizations like Ramp, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customer's accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases in their product or HRIS data to auto-provision and de-provision access for their customer's employees.\n\n(00:57:04):\nAnd yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all? Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny and receive a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny. What do you find often works in helping increase activation? I know there's a million things that people do, but I guess what are three or four things that you think people should definitely try to help improve activation and their onboarding conversion?\n\nSean Ellis (00:57:40):\nOne of my favorite quotes is a quote from a guy Kettering, who was a hundred years ago at GM running innovation. And he says, \"A problem well stated is a problem half solved.\" And so I think a lot of it comes down to not the things you try, but how you deeply understand the problem that's preventing someone from using your product effectively. And so I'll just give you one example. We had one channel after we made a lot of these changes and had already driven a ton of improvement in the LogMeIn onboarding. We found a demand generation channel that was really cheap and the economics looked great, but at just the download step we had a 90% drop off rate.\n\n(00:58:26):\nAnd so we A/B tested a bunch of different things there to try to improve that conversion rate, and then finally 10 plus tests, not able to improve it. Finally, someone said, \"When these people are registering. Why don't we just ask them why they signed up and didn't download the software?\" And so we didn't want to do it in too kind of a creepy way. So we made it look like a note coming from customer service. This channel was sending 200,000 people a day, so 20,000 people were converting to registering. So we had essentially 20,000 people we could email and then 18,000 of them who didn't download. And so we just asked, \"Hey, notice you haven't had a chance to use the product yet.\n\n(00:59:11):\nIt looked like it was coming from customer support. What happened?\" And the answer we got back and not a formal survey was, \"Oh, this seemed too good to be true. I didn't believe this was free.\" I mentioned to you we were one of the first freemium SaaS products out there. And so people were skeptical, especially in a demand gen channel where they hadn't seen a radio or a TV advertisement from our competitor who was a premium only product. These were people who were discovering the category for the first time they were getting there. Once we articulated what the problem was, our next test gave us a 300% improvement in the download rate, which was...\n\n(00:59:54):\nWe gave them a choice, download a trial of the paid version or download the free version, put a big graphical check mark next to the free version. But when they saw we had a business model and a trial of a paid version, the free version was credible. And so that essentially made that channel work for us. So I think again, it's that combination of qualitative research, looking at how others did it. We had this theory, our previous company had been a game company that didn't require a download. So initially we had this theory that maybe just downloadable software can't be in the millions of new customers a month and so we're being unrealistic here.\n\n(01:00:31):\nBut then we were like, \"Are there any counter examples to that\"? And no, the instant messengers are downloadable and they have hundreds of millions of customers, so let's study their download and install process and see if we have any ideas that we could borrow from that. So again, some inspiration, tried some of those things, it was a combination of just trying a bunch of different stuff that ultimately led to, I wouldn't say there was one big gain, it was a bunch of small gains.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:00):\nAwesome. So a few things for people to try if they're like, \"Hey, how do I improve my activation rate? How do I improve my conversion rate?\" Just drill further into what is stopping people from progressing. Ask them, \"Why did you bounce here? What did you think this was going to be? Why didn't you end up using this?\" Look for inspiration from other products, I think people probably already know that. You talked about earlier this idea of the positioning, having a big impact of just figuring out.\n\n(01:01:26):\nThey want an antivirus software. Let's make that very clear. \"Hey we've got the best antivirus software, that's what we're here for.\" So there's probably just messaging that you find works a lot of times, right?\n\nSean Ellis (01:01:36):\nI mean your two big levers on driving a conversion are increase desire, reduce friction. And so you definitely want to increase the right desire. Sometimes it can also just be reminding people along the way of what benefits you're going to get. In the case of LogmeIn, it was probably the most complicated funnel I've ever seen because you couldn't even get to the aha moment while you're sitting in front of the computer. You had to actually go to a different computer and to use the service to remote control the computer you're in front of.\n\n(01:02:12):\nSo it's not surprising that there was so many steps where we could lose people, but we just weren't that intentional about designing each of those steps initially. And it wasn't until we thought through why would we lose someone at this step and studying the data, which steps were we losing the most people at? Then deeply trying to contextualize why are we losing them there, coming up with a set of tests that we want to run and then having a good way of deciding which one to test first and ultimately focusing the tests on the areas where we're losing the most people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:45):\nThe other element of this is coming up with an activation metric and aligning on here's what we consider so activated. I know this is very dependent on the product, but any advice or heuristic for how to help people decide this is our activated user.\n\nSean Ellis (01:02:58):\nI tend to start qualitatively. So just like when do I think they've had a good enough experience with the product to really know it? And so in the case of LogMeIn, it was pretty easy. If they didn't do a remote control session, they didn't use the product. There was no value along the way there. And then at least try to see if there's a correlation to long-term retention of doing that. Causation is you need to do some experimentation to prove causation. At the very least, I want to see that correlation, but if I start with two or three ideas of what it might be and then go and study the data, that can help you focus.\n\n(01:03:41):\nBut again, I don't think there's necessarily one exact right answer of what is that aha moment. There might be two or three different things. I think it's that intentionality about picking something that's experience-based and saying, \"What is a likely experience that someone's going to get a good enough taste of this product?\" And then I do see some companies that are like, \"Well, the activation moment should be, they've used it a hundred times.\" That's going to correlate to long-term retention, but it's just not very actionable. It's so far down the user experience.\n\n(01:04:16):\nSo ideally if there's a way that I could get them there in the first session, in the first day, that's great. And so it's sort of something that's value that can be experienced super early. To give you an example from the first company I worked on was a game company, where I actually flipped it and basically instead of making a traditional funnel where they could play our games after they signed up, I made our games the advertisements. So basically we syndicated our games to 40,000 websites.\n\n(01:04:48):\nThey started gameplay experience on the other website, then they would get a message that they now have a qualifying score and if they register, they'll be in the drawing for the weekly cash prize and then we could pull them into multiplayer games on the site. And so it's kind of the strategy that YouTube used to grow, but it was two years before YouTube introduced the approach.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:14):\nIt feels like you basically created Zynga, is what I'm hearing there. So let's move further down the funnel. So we've talked about activation, onboarding. The next phase that you focus on is basically some people call this growth loops, growth engines, flywheels. Basically it's the thing that helps your business grow and something I am curious if this resonates.\n\n(01:05:35):\nI found there's basically four ways to grow and usually one of these engines is responsible for almost all of your growth. So what I've seen is basically you're going to go through sales, you're going to grow through SEO, you're going to go through virality, word of mouth or paid growth. Does that resonate? Does that feel right?\n\nSean Ellis (01:05:52):\nAnd I wouldn't say it's necessarily one or the other. I think Bounce is a really interesting example where SEO is super important for Bounce. So people who are essentially saying, \"Luggage storage, Paris. Luggage storage...\" Most people when they're trying to find a place to store their luggage, they're starting with Google, but at the same time, a huge percentage of the people who use Bounce are dragging their bag down a street over cobblestones in Paris. And then they pass a sign that says, \"Store your bag here for $5 a day.\" And it's like, \"Oh, no-brainer.\" And so 10,000 partners around the world means that there's a lot of people in the right situation on the demand gen side.\n\n(01:06:44):\nOne would be, I actually think of kind of... I'm not sure how it would map to this, but demand generation versus demand harvesting. And so one of those examples would be a... Demand generation example, when you see the signs when you're passing, it's high context, right place. And then obviously the demand harvesting would be anyone who's Googling. And so they do paid search and organic search there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:10):\nInteresting. I don't see that sign approach work often, but I definitely have seen it work. Like Yelp I think grew in a lot of ways of just little Yelp stickers in all the restaurant. DoorDash I think probably grows through that.\n\nSean Ellis (01:07:20):\nI think every business could be a little bit different, but for Bounce it makes sense that that would be a really good opportunity for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:29):\nHow do you help a business figure out which area to bet on? Whether they should go paid, whether they should go SEO, whether they should hire sales. Sales is probably an easier one. B2B, you're probably going to have to be a sales team, I guess just to help them pick, \"Here's where you have a big opportunity.\"\n\nSean Ellis (01:07:46):\nAgain, it kind of comes down as I'm going into it, I'm thinking what are the realistic customer acquisition angles for this business? And I want to have ideally two or three that I'm coming into it with, but it's going to... Obviously Dropbox is a classic one of like, \"Oh man, this product...\" User get user is going to be just a classic. There's file share built into it, folder collaboration. There's so many pieces of it that cross from one user to the next. But interestingly, it was fairly similar to LogMeIn in some senses, it's two businesses are solving similar problems in different ways. Where LogMeIn, we grew almost entirely off of paid search. And part of it again is that for us, we had a competitor that was spending tens of millions of dollars a month creating the category with a premium only product through radio and TV advertising. GoToMyPC, they're creating all this latent demand. And so it just made sense for us to disrupt them with a freemium service and to insert ourselves in the flow of someone... What was that thing that I heard about on the TV commercial? And now they go and they Google it and same thing, but free. So we weren't really pushing for differentiation, but just really trying to harvest that.\n\n(01:09:15):\nSo I couldn't do that at Dropbox. No one was looking for when I went there. And so we tried a little bit with search to see can we make it work on cloud storage or backup or kind of going to some of these traditional categories. Cloud storage wasn't even a traditional category at that point, but backup was, and it was fairly expensive and there was just not that much demand there that way. And so it just made more sense to focus on the user get user loops at Dropbox.\n\n(01:09:50):\nI think basically for each business it's just thinking about what's unique for that business that is going to open up channel opportunities and everyone's going to be a little bit, I think jaded from whatever the last thing that worked really well. They're going to think they can apply it in the next business. But after enough times myself, I tend to get the most inspiration by just talking to customers and finding out how did they find it, how do they typically find something like that? And that starts to give me some ideas as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:28):\nI think that last point is really powerful and I'm just writing it down. You said, essentially one of your tactics is talking to users, asking them how did you find this product and how do you normally find products like this? Is that the second question? I think it's similar to your [inaudible 01:21:02] test. It's such a simple question, but it's so powerful because how else will people find your product? They go to a place to find stuff like this, and I searched Google for folder sharing. There's so much there that you just skip over.\n\nSean Ellis (01:11:03):\nI think the reason that you don't actually hear people taking the obvious route there a lot of times is because, and I used to be in the same thing, that people tend to be either over indexed on qualitative or over indexed on quantitative. So it's like analytics, I'm going to get all my answers from testing and analytics or I'm going to get all my answers from traditional customer research. And I was very much in that initial camp for the first five years of my career. I'm just going to measure everything and test the heck out of things and find stuff that works. But I had a VC who was our lead VC at LogMeIn who just said, \"When was the last time you talked to a customer?\"\n\n(01:11:45):\nJust pushed me to survey and talk to customers all the time. And at first I gave the smart-ass answer, \"I don't care what they say, I care what they do.\" And he's like, \"No, you got to talk to him.\" Then just to appease him, I would try to have a conversation every day because he was in our office a lot and so I could say, \"Hey, yeah, I talked to a customer today,\" when he would ask me. But I started finding that my experiments were so much better the more I talked to customers, and eventually I became very much... The blend of qualitative and quantitative research leads to much better tests.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:21):\nThat is another amazing story and insight. It's so interesting that people sometimes think of you as growth hacker guy experiments data, when most of the advice we've been sharing so far is very qualitative driven, very survey driven, targeting customers driven.\n\nSean Ellis (01:12:36):\nAnd it is just really hard to run good experiments when you can't deeply contextualize what's going on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:42):\nI love this. By the way, I don't know if I knew this. So you helped develop the Dropbox referral program?\n\nSean Ellis (01:12:47):\nI was there at the time. Basically, even when I first started talking with Drew. Before I came in, I was like, \"I think the way we're going to grow this business is by leveraging the really passionate customer base and that's what we need to double down on.\" And we had tried a similar kind of referral program at Zabni and a friend who actually started Ring, Jamie Simonoff, previously had a company called PhoneTag way before Ring, and he had actually done a lot of the testing on double-sided referral programs and having incentive on both sides, and he found that that worked the best.\n\n(01:13:33):\nAnd so between what we had tested at Zabni and those conversations with him, I hadn't actually seen PayPal yet at that point, what they were doing. But that was kind of like... It seems like a referral program where we have incentives on both sides is the best way to go. Interestingly, six months before I was at Dropbox, I was at LogMeIn, and I really thought about having incentivized referrals at LogMeIn, but 80% of our new users were coming in through word of mouth. And I had a hundred million devices connected in on our system, and I was just so afraid of breaking this growth engine by adding an incentive that I didn't want to risk it.\n\n(01:14:18):\nBut at Dropbox it was so early. I would still say no experiment is one person. It happened to be when I was there, I had some insights that I brought in, but ultimately... The guy who built it was actually an intern named Albert Knee and he ended up dropping out, I think, out of MIT to stay with Dropbox for a few years after that. But he was kind of my right-hand guy to collaborating on growth day to day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:47):\nWow. I would say Dropbox is the referral program, and the PayPal referral program, as you mentioned, are the two most legendary, studied, copied referral programs out there.\n\nSean Ellis (01:14:56):\nUnfortunately, I think that what they don't realize is that before the referral program, Dropbox had amazing referral rate. Companies that are trying to copy it are like, \"Why isn't anyone talking about a product? Let's add a referral program with incentives.\" To me, I think it's a great accelerant when it's already working, but it can't fix it if people don't want to talk about your product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):\nThat's an awesome point and something I was just going to ask about and just coming back to this topic of growing engagement, growing referrals as a growth mechanism, what do you look for to tell you that there's an opportunity there? And I'll just answer it, partly I've seen exactly what you just said, which is you need to already have strong word of mouth growth because referrals kind sits on that and gives you a little more incentive to share. So maybe do you agree with that, not agree to that? Any other advice on helping figure out is there some kind of loop here that we can build?\n\nSean Ellis (01:15:53):\nWell, one thing I will say is freemium when we first started with it, as I said, we were one of the first with it, so it took me a while to figure out exactly how freemium worked, but to me, freemium towards having a free and a premium version of your product to really work in any business, it needs to be that your free product is so good that people naturally have word of mouth around that product. And then to be economically viable, you have to have a premium product that's better enough and differentiated enough that people are going to upgrade to the premium product.\n\n(01:16:31):\nBut I think a lot of times people are so worried about the second part that they make the free version not very good and then they're surprised when word of mouth isn't very strong there. So I think you have to essentially have two distinct products that are great on their own. So that would be the one piece, but then obviously companies that have any kind of collaborative layer to them are going to be more likely to work well with referral. And then I think on the engagement side, a lot of it comes down to just the nature of the product.\n\n(01:17:10):\nLike Airbnb, you're not going to use it every day unless you're like a vagrant or something and then you wouldn't have money to pay for it. So there's kind a natural usage cycle to products and you want to be able to maximize against that cycle. That's where I was saying, coming back to the hooked model, I think is a really good way to help to have a framework to think about how do I improve engagement. One good counter example to that though of the natural frequency of using a product is Facebook when they change their North Star Metric from monthly active users to daily active users. I think, again, just having what gets measured gets managed.\n\n(01:18:03):\nOnce Facebook was on a daily active user goal, the team suddenly had a lot more incentive to think about, \"How do I bring people back every day and use this product?\" Where when it was monthly active users, they kind of only got credit for that person for using once in that month. And even if they used 10 times, they didn't get 10 times the credit. It was just like a, \"Oh, that's cool too.\" But they weren't sort of measured on that. And so I think it was sort of a random decision for Mark Zuckerberg to move from a monthly active to a daily active because they hit 1 billion monthly active users and they're like, \"Okay, let's go for 1 billion daily active users.\"\n\n(01:18:42):\nBut it had a really big impact on making that product way more addictive to the point where obviously they ended up in Congress or get a lot of pushback. I'm not sure they went to Congress for that, but they got a lot of pushback for having a product that's maybe too addictive. And the same thing carrying into Instagram and some of the other Meta products or basically anything that is highly engaging. So I do think the right incentives can actually help a team to focus on it, but there's going to be sort of a natural usage cycle to any product as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:22):\nI'm glad you mentioned North Star Metrics. I actually have a post I will link to in the show notes where I collected the North Star Metrics of 30 different companies to give you some inspiration. I know this is a deep topic of its own, but just when someone is trying to pick their own North Star Metrics, which I 1000% agree, informs so much about how your company operates. It basically focuses everyone's incentives to let's drive this thing. And that changes so much of what you're building. Any just bullet point piece of advice for helping you pick your North Star Metrics?\n\nSean Ellis (01:19:50):\nI start with the value that's uncovered through the [inaudible 01:21:02] test. So with a company, I'll say, \"Okay, this is what the must have value is according to our most passionate customers, and we want to think about a metric that reflects us delivering that value.\" And then I'll give them kind of a framework of ways to think about a North Star Metric. But I think it's really important for it to be a time capped group conversation. And if you give a team 30 days, they'll take 30 days. If you give them six months, they'll take six months.\n\n(01:20:25):\nBut I think generally a team can come up with a pretty good North Star Metric after 30 minutes if they have the right raw ingredients and a checklist of what's important in a North Star Metric. Something that's not a ratio, it's something that can be up onto the right over time. So you can keep managing it and feeling good. It should correlate to revenue growth, but revenue shouldn't be the North Star Metric, but as you grow value across your customer base, you should be able to grow revenue at the same rate. And so there's-\n\nSean Ellis (01:21:00):\nRevenue at the same rate. And so there's some other things, but I think that would be the most important, is that it's something that could be up and to the right over time and reflects value that you're delivering to customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:12):\nAwesome. And I was going to ask about revenue in your opinion there. And so your advice is don't make revenue or North star metric?\n\nSean Ellis (01:21:17):\nNo. Even Amazon, and again, this is just what I know of Amazon's as being but monthly purchases, but someone else might say Amazon, no Amazon's is GMV or something. But I think monthly purchases is great because it maps to value that people are getting from Amazon. And so even if I spend say $1000 on a TV set with Amazon versus $3 on a or $10 on an electric toothbrush, Amazon from the consumer's perspective delivered the same value. I needed something, Amazon helped me find that thing. And so units of value from the customer perspective I think is more important than overall revenue. But clearly with Amazon focusing on driving more monthly purchases, at least on their store side of the business, that has helped them become one of most valuable companies in the world. So I think focusing on value is, revenue should be a product of doing things. Right. It shouldn't kind of guide your day-to-day actions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:29):\nTo make this even more concrete for people, are there some North star metric examples you could share that you've seen that are good? Like say for Eventbrite or Dropbox or any companies you've worked with? And I'll share one real quick as you're thinking about it. At Airbnb, our North star metric was nights booked. And so it's similar to Amazon. It's not like the money Airbnb made from bookings, but it's like nights booked and it was really, and basically every experiment ran is like, is this increasing night booked or is this decreasing night's book?\n\nSean Ellis (01:22:57):\nAnd so that's a really good marketplace one. Uber obviously weekly rides. I'm always surprised with the Airbnb, that there's not a kind of time piece on it, like the weekly rides that you have with Uber, but maybe it's because it's such an infrequent use case on travel that it doesn't make sense to focus on. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:19):\nYeah. Why is the timeframe important to you? Why do you encourage that?\n\nSean Ellis (01:23:24):\nJust daily active users, you saw the difference between monthly active users and daily active users could change behavior a lot at Facebook. It gives you a quantifiable way, if you're just kind of taking an aggregate number over time, it always looks like it's going up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:41):\nSo it's an engagement element of how often are they engaging.\n\nSean Ellis (01:23:44):\nYeah. But,-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:46):\nAny others? Any others real quick?\n\nSean Ellis (01:23:47):\nYeah, I mean, I didn't really think about North star metrics when I was at Dropbox and Eventbrite, like the term itself, but I was thinking about what is a valuable experience with Dropbox and how do I get people to have that more time? But I don't even know what they go with today, but maybe files in Dropbox, files access might be better than just files hosted. And then probably for Eventbrite, again, I would say weekly tickets or something like you could say weekly events, but then you have events that don't sell any tickets where weekly tickets would be more likely to reflect, events are going to be happy if they're selling tickets and yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:30):\nOkay. Sean, we've gone through so much stuff. I'm trying to limit how many more questions we get through just so that we don't,-\n\nSean Ellis (01:24:37):\nWe're going long.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:38):\nWe're going long, which is amazing. I think there's so much value here that we're collecting for folks. So let just ask maybe a couple more quick questions. One is actually from Andrew Chen who is currently partnered at a partner at A16z. He wrote about growth for the longest time. I think he helped popularize growth hacking for better or worse with his article and it being the future of VP of what is it? Growth Hacking is the new VP of marketing, right, Is the title. So he actually had a question for you that he shared with me. His question is, growth strategies have changed a lot over the past decade. What is the biggest difference now versus when you first started working on growth?\n\nSean Ellis (01:25:14):\nWhen I first started just being data-driven on customer acquisition was enough to win and being test and data-driven on customer acquisition. All the other companies were like CPM focused and so we could do really well just with lots of testing and some creativity in how it all worked. But that over time as, now I would say most online marketers are very data and test drive. They know they need to do lots of testing. And so to be competitive today, you actually have to be able to be super efficient at all parts of the business.\n\n(01:25:57):\nSo again, like how you convert, retain, monetize, and that's when it gets hard. Getting a marketing team to be data and test-driven is pretty easy. Once you start getting into activation and referral and engagement and retention, now you're talking about the overlap between marketing, product if it's B2B, bringing sales in there, customer success, and those teams are not used to working together. And so it's really hard to drive the collaboration that's needed to have an effective testing program across the entire growth engine. And that's pretty much any business that's been successful with it, implemented it super early in the business, and so very few later stage companies have been able to make much progress in replicating that type of approach.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:55):\nIt's just gotten harder basically. Things are just getting harder.\n\nSean Ellis (01:26:58):\nIt's gotten harder, but I think it's possible. So it's what I obsess about all the time, is how do you get cross-functional teams working together on growth now? And it's still a huge advantage when you can pull it off.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:13):\nOkay. Totally unrelated question, going in completely different direction as we close out our chat. So you came up with ICE, the very popular way of prioritizing work, which is crazy. I did not know that until I started prepping for this conversation. What's your thoughts on RICE, the intercom version of ICE, where R stands for reach, I believe.\n\nSean Ellis (01:27:35):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:35):\nThoughts?\n\nSean Ellis (01:27:36):\nSo I think it's an unnecessary addition, but maybe I'm just being protective of my original idea, that the I in ICE is impact and it's essentially saying best case scenario, how much impact could we get from this? And reach is a super important part of impact. And so I think it's already factored in the I in ICE. And so I think if there's anything that I would be accused of, it would be being over simplifying things and I'm not saying them, but there's a lot of people who approach things with, there's got to be a more complex way to approach this and that's just not me. And so yeah, more testing is better.\n\n(01:28:21):\nNo, it doesn't just work like that. I mean, better tests are better than bad tests, but just if you have to hold yourself accountable to anything, more testing would be better. And so I think one just quick note on ICE is that in order to be able to effectively run a high velocity testing program, you need to be able to source ideas from across the company. And that's why I came up with ICE, that if you're having people submit ideas and you can't tell them why their idea was not chosen, they're just going to get upset and you're going to waste a lot of time. But if you have a systematic way of being able to compare ideas, it's more likely that people will be able to get it and they'll be able to come up with better ideas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:06):\nI love the way you think, Sean. I have a post on prioritization where I basically just make the same argument that there's all these complicated ways to prioritize. In the end, it's just impact, confidence, and effort and it really works and rarely is more work. On the other hand, I do also have a guest post called DRICE by these two guys called Detailed RICE, which actually I think is a really good point where sometimes it's worth spending like 30 minutes per idea to just really estimate how long will it take to avoid doing things that are just going to not work and very unlikely. So we're basically doing this reach piece and spending the time too. Right. And I think there's a lot of good value there.\n\nSean Ellis (01:29:45):\nYeah. And what I thinks going to be really interesting is that over time, I think AI is going to actually change our ability to model out potential outcomes on experiments and start to, whether it's a more informed way of doing ICE or replaces ICE, that ultimately probability of outcomes is something that AI will be pretty good at.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):\nWell, amazing segue to the final question. The actually final question is I wanted to ask you about any ways you've been using AI or ways you think AI will impact the work you're doing or other folks are doing? And maybe you just answered it, but you tell me.\n\nSean Ellis (01:30:26):\nNo, I'll touch on a couple. One is that probably the funnest way that I'm using it today. Obviously I've done it for coming up with experiment ideas, but the funnest way I personally use it is I get a lot of people asking me for advice, and I don't have very much time to answer with thoughtful answers to people. And so almost every question that I get, I go to ChatGPT say, how would Sean Ellis answer this? And it gives me an initial draft to make a couple of tweaks and definitely allows me to answer a lot more. So it helps to have a book that's indexed in there and lots of writing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:07):\nThat is so funny, and that the question, that's as simple as the prompt is how would Sean Ellis answer,-\n\nSean Ellis (01:31:11):\nYeah, because then a lot of times it'll say, Sean Ellis, author of Hacking Growth dah, dah, dah, believes that, and then it'll obviously pull that part out in the answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:21):\nOh my God. So you're one step away from a Chrome extension or something that just automatically plugs that into your,-\n\nSean Ellis (01:31:26):\nYeah, exactly. And I can even start to have my personal assistant maybe start to answer some of those questions as me, but I'm a little bit afraid to send something without reviewing it first because,-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:37):\nAbsolutely.\n\nSean Ellis (01:31:38):\nSometimes there's stuff that's pretty different from how I would answer it, but longer term, I actually think, as I said, I think the cross-functional challenge to growth is a thing that holds a lot of companies back from being able to implement this a bit later. Mostly product teams don't want to get direction from marketing teams. Marketing teams don't want to get direction from product teams, and maybe a growth layer can help to do these things, but I find that if AI is essentially saying, you're underperforming in this area of your business, you should drive some experiments in this area. It's a lot harder to kind of let ego get in the way when it's kind of dispassionate recommendations from a system.\n\n(01:32:22):\nAnd so I actually think, I think the ability to come up with great experiments is going to keep growing with AI and identifying opportunities. And then obviously the analytical AI side of things is going to be really exciting in terms of being, I do find with most companies, once we get a real high velocity of experiments going, the bottleneck ends up happening more on the analysis side. And I think AI will help a lot with that as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:50):\nSuper cool. These are awesome examples. Okay, Sean, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round, which we'll go through real fast? Because we've gone very long and I want to let you go.\n\nSean Ellis (01:33:01):\nYeah. As I've gone through and done a lot of workshops and programs with companies, I keep coming back to this advice that I heard from guy Oleg Yakubenkov, which is it often comes down to asking the right question at the right time in how you figure things out. And he's a former data scientist from Meta and so where he basically boils data science down to learning how to ask the right questions. And so I actually have a course with him called Gopractice.io, where that's really the big benefit of the course, is to learn how to ask the right questions and yeah, you learn how to query them and amplitude, but more importantly, being able to ask the right question. I think it's kind of cool to hear that from a data scientist from Meta, the importance of that.\n\n(01:33:49):\nBut every time I'm going through exercises in my workshops, it almost always comes down to people who aren't able to come up with the right or a good answer in a business. It's because they're not asking the obvious question. And as soon as they have, like why aren't users downloading the software? Let's just ask them that question. That would be one example from my workshop. Who considers the product a must have? That part of getting, to figuring out the must have kind of benefit that then allows you to hone in on product market fit. And so yeah, right questions, right time I think is a really important way to think about growth and even getting to product market fit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:40):\nI love this advice because I think it gives us a glimpse into how your brain has developed these really seemingly simple ideas that end up being really powerful. And it feels like the advice is just think a lot about the question you need to ask because that'll get you just something that a lot of people just kind of under think or don't. There's things, maybe it's too simple.\n\nSean Ellis (01:35:02):\nYeah, or they just jump right into the solution side of things where they're not really trying to understand what's going on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:08):\nYeah. Yeah. Amazing. Okay, well with that, Sean, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nSean Ellis (01:35:14):\nI am.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:15):\nAll right. Our first question is, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nSean Ellis (01:35:20):\nIncreasingly, I'm recommending a book called Presenting to Win that's been around forever, but it really helped me with my presenting. And so of course when I'm out traveling, I'm often sharing the stage with other speakers and yeah, I like to recommend that one to them. I've already talked about Muriel's Hooked. I recommend that always, and we'll just stick with two. That's good two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):\nWithin Presenting to Win, is there one tip that sticks with you of here's something that helped me be a better presenter?\n\nSean Ellis (01:35:52):\nUltimately, confidence in presenting comes down to having very well organized information that you're going to present. And when you organize it correctly, you are much more likely to deliver it with confidence. And so he basically says, if I had a presentation to do and I had an hour to present, I'd spend 55 minutes creating the right presentation and then five minutes practicing it. But yeah, there's a lot more to it, but,-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:18):\nWow. Amazing. Okay. We'll link to that book in the show notes. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nSean Ellis (01:36:25):\nYeah, so I've been binging the Olympics. I love that, just watching people who worked their ass off for years and then maybe have 30 seconds to do the thing that they worked hard for. So Olympics have been awesome. And then the movie, I actually just saw Blackberry, I don't know if you've seen that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:42):\nOh, the story of the Blackberry?\n\nSean Ellis (01:36:45):\nYeah. I mean obviously we all kind of know the story, but it was so really, I mean, it's a classic example of product market fit and then not. Actually, it's probably even a counter example to the dangers of the how would you feel if we could no longer use this product? Pretty sure most people would've said on Blackberry, it's the keyboard, and until iPhone came along, the keyboard was super important and then suddenly it wasn't. But yeah, it's also interesting on egos and other things that everybody's getting friendly in the beginning and then egos take over and things get a lot harder later on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:23):\nThat was actually a really good movie. There's also an amazing movie called Tetris. For some reason, I think of these two together,-\n\nSean Ellis (01:37:29):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:29):\nAbout the story of Tetris, and it's a similar parallels to those two movies.\n\nSean Ellis (01:37:33):\nAwesome. I'll have to see that one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:35):\nNext question, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nSean Ellis (01:37:39):\nI forget the name of it, but I think or it's called Pack Gear Hanging Suitcase, and I basically like, I've done almost 100,000 miles in travel this year, and I have another trip scheduled for next week, and I love it because it basically has all my clothes folded in this little insert that goes into my suitcase, and then I just pull it out and hang it up and just makes travel way easier.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:06):\nIt's called the Pack Gear Suitcase?\n\nSean Ellis (01:38:09):\nPack Gear Hanging Suitcase Organizer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:12):\nSo cool. Going to check that out. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to that you find useful in work or in life? Maybe share with friends and family sometimes.\n\nSean Ellis (01:38:22):\nFocus on reputation and learning over earnings has served me super well that, and I'll give you an example. I had two companies when I was doing a lot of this early interim stuff yeah, 10 plus years ago, and I had two of them where I talked to the founders afterwards and I could tell they weren't that stoked on my contributions. And I offered a full refund to both of them with a thought that like I have this reputation that's, like I randomly pulled the number and said, my reputation worth $5 million. Why would I possibly mortgage that reputation for $20,000? And so one of them, I gave the check back to them and he was happy to take it, but he had said, \"Oh, you can make it up to me. You don't have to give me the check, just make it up to me by continuing to help me for an unlimited amount of time going forward.\"\n\n(01:39:20):\nI was like, \"Oh, take the check.\" And then the other one said, \"No, no, I'm actually really happy with what you did. We're fine.\" But the two VCs who had made those introductions were the first two to give me term sheets when I went out to raise money for my company. And the pre-money ultimately ended up being valued at more than double what I had put my personal reputation at. So I, yeah, I think the, yeah, unfortunately the company didn't do that well itself because of the elusive product market fit challenges. But yeah, the learning there of just focus on learning and reputation. Reputation opened the door to more and more learning. And as I got more learning, the reputation grew. And so yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:04):\nThere's a really good corollary there with customer support. If someone just hates your product and wants a refund, just give them a refund and let them move on versus being upset.\n\nSean Ellis (01:40:12):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:13):\nI love that. Final question. You mentioned to me before we started recording that you were maybe indirectly responsible for TikTok's success. Maybe share that story.\n\nSean Ellis (01:40:24):\nYeah, I mean, I don't want to overstate it, but I yeah, my trip around the world that I did three months ago, I think I wrapped it up. I met with the original founding growth team at TikTok. They're based in Singapore and they had, I can't remember what the previous product was called, but they started with the previous product. And then when TikTok came, they were in place to be the initial growth team for TikTok, and they basically said all the early stuff we did to grow TikTok was based on your writing. So that was before the book came out.\n\n(01:40:59):\nSo it's a lot of just blogging that I had done, but it was really, really cool to get that feedback that, yeah, I've always said I have some really good wins, a lot of unicorns that I helped, but none of the really, really big guys. And then to hear that, it felt really good to know that I played some kind of role in TikTok. Of course, almost the same week they told me that that was Congress having TikTok ban conversations. So it was good. And at the same time, knowing that maybe if they hadn't read my stuff, Congress wouldn't be wasting their time on TikTok bans.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:36):\nOh man. Bittersweet. I hope they don't pull you into some hearings. Sean, this was incredible. This was everything I was hoping it'd be. I feel like we collected so much wisdom here for folks to them figure out product market fit, find product market fit, iterate, grow their products. So happy we did this. Two final questions. Where can folks find stuff that you're up to if they want to learn more and maybe work with you in various ways? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nSean Ellis (01:42:00):\nAwesome. Yeah, so Seanellis.me is the website where I kind of link to all the things that I'm doing. And so that would be one place where, and there's contact forms on there if anyone wants to reach out. Obviously LinkedIn people can contact me there. And then I did mention GoPractice. So gopractice.io. Really cool way to learn growth through a simulated environment of being able to try to grow products. So check out GoPractice and maybe go to Seanellis.me. When this comes out, I'll put a special offer on there for Lenny's listeners so you can save some money.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:36):\nAnd there's also a LLM AI kind of,-\n\nSean Ellis (01:42:40):\nI wasn't directly involved on that one, but there's yeah, there's some other really cool stuff that Oleg and the team are doing. Data-driven product management, and the user growth programs are the ones that I helped with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:53):\nAwesome. And then for folks, if they're wondering, do you do advising? How do you work with companies in case they're like, hey, I need Sean.\n\nSean Ellis (01:43:00):\nYeah, I mean, so the sweet spot for me on companies that I go hands-on with are ideally pretty early just after they get to product market fit and now you know how to measure it. So if you're kind of pre-scale, but you're seeing that 40%, or even if you're a bit earlier than that, we can start talking earlier. But to me, that's my favorite time to get in there, build it right from the beginning. It's so hard to retroactively do these things. And I'll go in for three to six months and I'm all in full-time, one of the team trying to really help build traction in the business. I do one of those every maybe year or maybe every year or two because I purposely burn myself out and then have fun doing more lecturing and workshops and stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:50):\nAwesome. Well, you might get a flood of requests after this comes out. Hope you're ready. Sean, thank you so much for being here.\n\nSean Ellis (01:43:57):\nAwesome. Thank you, Lenny. I really appreciate you having me on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:00):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

The most recurring theme actually had to do with AI. How do you think all these new AI companies build brands to distinguish and differentiate themselves?\n\nSeth Godin (00:10):\nAI very soon is going to stop being a feature the same way electricity is not a feature. What AI companies and all companies need to do is say, what's in this for the user? What promise do I want to make a difficult promise, a remarkable promise, and then how do I keep it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26):\nYou wrote a new book. You basically talk about how a great strategy has tension at the center of it.\n\nSeth Godin (00:31):\nTension is at the heart of every art form and every innovation. What we do when we launch a new product, we say, we have this thing that can do X, and now the person is imagining what their life might be like if that were true. If they fall in love with that possibility, now there's tension. Did you tell the truth? Is it going to work for them?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51):\nThere's the section that stuck out to me, these four insights that basically determine what your life is going to be like outside of actually building the product.\n\nSeth Godin (00:59):\nFor a product person, these are the critical choices and you probably have glossed over them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11):\nToday my guest is Seth Godin. Seth is an absolute legend. He's published 21 books, including 18 international bestsellers. He's been blogging every single day for almost 10,000 days in a row now. His writing and his advice have inspired me and so many people all over the world for the past few decades. He shares wisdom and advice around stuff that everyone can benefit from, including how ideas spread, when to quit, how to lead, how to stand out, and most of all how to change everything. In addition to his writing and speaking, Seth has founded several companies, including Yoyodyne and Squidoo. He also started the altMBA program, and as you'll hear in our conversation, he actually started his career as a product manager. In our conversation, Seth shares advice on how to know if you have good taste and how to build your taste, how to build a brand in an increasingly crowded world of AI startups and AI content, his thoughts on the Jaguar rebrand and also the Tesla Cybertruck.\n\n(02:10):\nWe also delve into his new book, This is Strategy, including why every great strategy has tension at its center, why you need to understand the systems within which you operate in order to build a great strategy and how choosing your customers, your distribution strategy, and how you validate your idea will inform the product you build and the life that you live. We also talk about how he used Claude as a writing assistant in developing this new book.\n\n(02:33):\nThis episode is short and packed with insights, which I know is what you all love.

Lenny was my late mom's nickname, so it's good to say that out loud.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (03:02):\nThat's so cool. I've never heard it used for a woman, and every Lenny out there I've met is wonderful, so I imagine she's wonderful. First, I just want to say how honored I am to have you on this podcast. When I actually started this podcast, I was like, and I was listening to you on Tim Ferriss at that point, and I was like, man, what if one day I get Seth Godin on my podcast? How cool would that be? I've read so many of your books. I have a bunch of them in the bookshelf back there. I reference your stuff all the time, so thank you again for doing this.\n\nSeth Godin (03:29):\nWell, thank you. It's a treat to talk to you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (03:33):\nToday's episode is brought to you by DX. If you're an engineering leader or on a platform team, at some point your CEO will inevitably ask you for productivity metrics, but measuring engineering organizations is hard and we can all agree that simple metrics like the number of PRs or commits doesn't tell the full story.

I imagine you remember Wes?\n\nSeth Godin (05:25):\nOf course. Wes and I sat in a room just the two of us for years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (05:29):\nSo what she suggested I ask you, and this question I love, is she... I asked her, what did you learn most from Seth Godin working with him? And she immediately said, it's helping her build better taste and increase her standards, having really high standards. So I want to ask you first of all, just how do you know if you have good taste and high standards and then how do you build good taste and higher standards?\n\nSeth Godin (05:54):\nGreat question. Thank you, Wes. I define good taste as knowing what other people want just before they do. So if you're the only person who wants peanut butter covered licorice, you're entitled to eat peanut butter covered licorice, but you don't have good taste because everyone else thinks that's weird. And people, whether they're jazz musicians or fabric designers are seen as having good taste when they bring something to the world that the world didn't necessarily expect but is glad to see.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (06:25):\nWhat do you find helps? So Wes learned from watching you that she realized, okay, my standards are not nearly as high as they could be. Other than working with you, maybe that's the answer is work with people like you that have really high standards. Just what do you find is most helpful in helping people build taste and also just increase their standards?\n\nSeth Godin (06:46):\nStandards, it's worth understanding what quality is and the people who listen to this podcast know better than most. Quality is not luxury. Quality is not perfection. Quality means meeting spec, and if you meet spec, you're done. If you don't think the spec is good enough, make a better spec. But if you meet spec, you're done. And so what it means to have high standards is that you relentlessly improve the spec in service of the people you're working with and for.\n\n(07:16):\nAnd what it doesn't mean is that you take something that meets spec and refuse to ship it because you're a perfectionist. That's hiding. And so what I learned at Spinnaker where I had my first job, real job as a product manager, was this idea that we weren't there to make perfect for us. We were there to delight the person who was buying the software. And our standards were untouchable. We said, \"If that person, the one we're describing is delighted with what we shipped, it's good. And if they're not, it doesn't matter what kind of excuses we have.\" This is the opposite of what most people in this job do, which is they say, how do I please my boss? And if you're just doing your job, then don't expect to get rewarded for more than just doing your job because we can find lots of people who can just do your job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (08:10):\nThat reminds me of one of your other really powerful pieces of advice about how no matter your job, this is a tangent, but it really stuck with me once I read your advice here is no matter what job you have, you couldn't love it, enjoy it, be amazing at it, even if you're just like a waitress or whatever. Can you just talk through that? Because that's so powerful.\n\nSeth Godin (08:29):\nWell, I think I got it from the late Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., and the idea is there's no perfect job. A friend of mine, Tim, is a famous jazz saxophonist and he's got to schlep from city to city, and he's got to play to half empty rooms and he is got to deal with this and deal with this. So you're never going to have unlimited artistic freedom. But what we all have is the ability to understand where the boundaries of our work lie and go there.\n\n(09:01):\nAnd if you're a barista and you've chosen to be a barista, maybe because it's the best thing you could get, well you're not going to get the next hour over again. So what would it be like to be the best barista in the world for an hour? Would that be worth it for you? Because I've had menial jobs in food service and I got to tell you, when the boss forces you to be mediocre and bored, there's no amount of money they can pay you to do that job. But if you're there and you have a chance to add delight to someone's day, you're doing that for you, not because you're getting paid.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:34):\nAnd you could totally tell these people in the world when you go to a barista that just you can tell, just loves their job. I know imagine she knows this is not her career long-term, but she just embraces it and just has fun with it. There's so much power to that. On a different note, you mentioned that you were product manager, which I did not know. That's amazing. So most of the people listening to this podcast are product managers. They're either product managers, founders, people that want to be founders, and then people that work with product managers. So first of all, I guess could you just share that part of your life? Because I don't think people know that.\n\nSeth Godin (10:05):\nAll right. So the origin story could take all day, but I'm not going to tell the whole thing. I'm going to tell the part that I thought was normal that turned out to be the luckiest thing in the world. The summers between the two years of business school are very important to establish your career arc. I got a job at Spinnaker Software. Spinnaker invented educational computer games. I was the 30th employee. And the summer was spent doing assistant brand manager kind of stuff, going to meetings with the ad agency, writing copy. But at the end of the summer, they had a lovely going away party for me, because I was flying back to California. And then at the end, the president of the company, the chairman of the company and the head of marketing bring me into this side when they say, \"We have a secret project, we want you to work for us while you're at business school and we're all going to pay you almost nothing.\"\n\n(10:52):\n\"Okay, what's the secret project?\" \"We're going to do computer adventure games with illustrations and music based on science fiction novels, and we've already acquired the work of Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke.\" Now, I had read every science fiction book in the Clearfield Public Library from Asimov to Zelazny. This was a dream come true, but they thought my job was going to be make the packaging and run the ads. And what I discovered, first of all is that I couldn't really go back to business school. So I showed up hardly at all at Stanford and just took a lot of red eyes. But I discovered that the engineers, the development team, they had a lot of people vying for their time. And if I didn't figure out how to get them to give me way more than my fair share of development, I wasn't going to have any products to make next Christmas and then I was going to be out of a job.\n\n(11:46):\nAnd so I started a newsletter internally, I was one of the first people in the world to have desktop publishing because I was a beta tester for the Mac, and in it I would mention anybody in the engineering team who had worked on my project and I would say something good about them. And then I would print it out and put it in every single person's inner office mailbox. And within three months, four months, partly because the project was really good, 40 engineers were working for me and no one was reporting to me. And so I became the de facto product manager and that is when I learned marketing is the product. You don't make a product and then hand it to some marketing yahoo and say, go put a logo on this. That the product we made, and five in a row went gold, saved the company. Though product is why it worked.\n\n(12:38):\nAnd so I was supposed to know how to code but I didn't, but I could be in the room. The last month, RadioShack had bought how many units? 3000 stores times five times five, a lot of units. And if we had missed a date, they were going to cancel the order and the company would go bankrupt, and the software wasn't even close to done. And we didn't have any source control like we do now. There was no cloud, so it was all in my head. So I did not leave the office. I'm not exaggerating this, I did not leave the office for the last 22 days, slept for four hours a night upstairs, and if anyone had a question, I could tell them who to talk to.\n\n(13:19):\nThat was so thrilling. It was so thrilling to make those decisions, to cajole this team, none of whom were in it for the money, to make something we were proud of. And then the stuff ships, everyone else goes home to sleep for a month, but I am the project manager and the marketing guy, so I got to stay at work. And the next day the phone rings and it's Herbie Hancock on the phone, the great jazz musician, and Herbie says, \"The receptionist said you're the person in charge of Fahrenheit 451.\" And I said, \"Herbie? I'm 24 years old, man. Herbie?\" And he went on and on about how he had stayed up all night to play it and that he loved it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:00):\nI love how natural of a product manager you were in these things you shared of just thinking everyone deflecting credit and all these things. It's sign of a great PM. Along these lines, I wanted to ask actually, so you're a PM early on. Now, you obviously spend a lot of time marketing. I know you're saying there's obviously a strong connection between the two, but is there anything you find that people building the product most often miss or misunderstand that just annoys you or do you think they need to hear?\n\nSeth Godin (14:26):\nMaybe I got seven, but I'll try to do them off the top of my head. The first one is this, empathy is not about kindness and empathy is not an option. This is something that you are making for other people. So the whole idea of RTFM, read the manual, I'm angry at you. If you're saying that to your customers, you made a mistake, they did not make a mistake.\n\n(14:49):\nThe second one is that the thing about projects is when you run out of time and you run out of money, the project is over. Don't run out of time, don't run out of money. Good intentions are no reason for an extension. The professional doesn't ask for an extension because the professional understands that things you didn't expect are going to happen. That's part of the deal.\n\n(15:14):\nAnd I guess the third one would be for software, particularly software as a service, if you don't build the network effect into what you are making, you are almost certainly going to fail. You cannot hope that Apple's going to pick you, promote you, and magically have you be successful. The question is, will this work better for my users if they tell other people about it? And if the answer is no, then why would they tell other people about it? And if they don't tell other people about it, no one's going to hear about it. But if the answer is yes, then your marketing problems pretty much solved.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:51):\nI feel like each of these is its own book that we could talk through. And I want to come back to this last point and how it relates to the purple cow. I want to spend a little time there, but first I'm going to ask a marketing question. So before you came on, I asked on Twitter, what should I ask Seth Godin? He's coming on my podcast. I got a flood of suggestions. The most recurring theme actually had to do with AI. Actually the co-founder of Intercom asked this question and it echoes what many people are wondering. So his question is how do you think all these new AI companies build brands to distinguish and differentiate themselves in a world that's increasingly filled with AI companies, AI products, AI content?\n\nSeth Godin (16:26):\nWell, the first question is what's a brand? Because it's not a logo. A brand is a promise. It's what do I expect from you. It's would I miss you if you were gone. And Hyatt Hotels has a logo, Nike has a brand. The way we know this is if Nike opened a hotel, we'd know what it would be like. But if Hyatt decided to make sneakers, we have no clue. They might be comfortable, but that's all we would know. And so if you want to build a brand, you got to stand for something and you got to say what you don't do. And the second thing is AI very soon is going to stop being a feature the same way electricity is not a feature. That lots and lots of things run on electricity, but they're not electricity companies. They just happen to use electricity.\n\n(17:13):\nSo what AI companies and all companies need to do is say, what's in this for the user? What promise do I want to make? A difficult promise, a remarkable promise. And then how do I keep it? So making absurd promises might work at the VC level, but it doesn't work when you're talking to consumers because you can only break that promise one time. And so to wrap up the brand part, airlines don't have brands and airlines don't have loyalty. And the way we know this is that the only reason people stick with an airline is for the points, which is bribery. Loyalty is would you pay extra to stick with this? And if you wouldn't pay extra, then the brand has no value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (17:58):\nI love this phrase, make a promise and keep it. And the AI element, that raises the bar because many more promises are being made, fewer promises are probably being kept. So is the advice there, continue making an ambitious promise and then the key is actually deliver on that and that's what builds you brand?\n\nSeth Godin (18:15):\nYeah. I have a very emotional connection to Claude.ai. I think they have a brand. ChatGPT's reputation with me is not good because it regularly over promises and under delivers and it does it without kindness or humility. Whereas Claude, I don't know how they did it, at least in my experience, brings kindness and humility. So when it doesn't know, it's very clear and it's not lazy and it's not angry at me. And so I happily pay extra for Claude because it has a brand. Whereas ChatGPT for me is just a tool that I use if I have no other options.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:55):\nI love the Anthropic/Claude's billboards. \"We're the ones without the drama.\" The AI company without the drama. I was going to save this to the end, but let's actually talk about it. So you mentioned somewhere that you actually use Claude to help you write this book and refine the book, which I think is going to increasingly happen. Could you just share that process of how you did that? What did you do that might be helpful to people to help you write this book?\n\nSeth Godin (19:20):\nWell, to be clear about my brand promise, because it's true, every word that has my name on it, I wrote. Every blog post, every book. I don't have a team. This is my whole staff is me. What I did with Claude and which I encourage people to do in the book is I would upload a list of four things and say, what did I miss? And it would suggest three things to complete the list. And often they would be things I hadn't thought of. And then I could go write about that or I would upload a couple chapters and I would say, what are the claims I'm making here that you don't think that I'm sustaining? And it became this patient editor that is so hard to find in the real world because editors aren't paid enough and given enough time to do their job right. And what I find is if I have a sentence that doesn't sound enough like me, I can ask Claude to help me figure out why that's true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (20:24):\nI love that tactic of using it to figure out what you missed. I feel like you agree with this. I find that when I write, part of it is I'm putting an idea out there. I want to see what I got wrong and what I missed. And I like that you basically skip that step and don't put it out and just make the thing you put out actually better.\n\nSeth Godin (20:42):\nWell, the thing about blogging every day is at first it felt like how am I going to keep up? But once I could build a queue because I didn't want my streak to end-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (20:55):\nHow long is the streak at this point, by the way?\n\nSeth Godin (20:58):\nPost number 10,000 comes out at the beginning of 2025.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (21:02):\nOh my God. In a row.\n\nSeth Godin (21:04):\nIn a row. Some days there were two. But what I found as I got a little bit of a queue is that I would feel bad because I had something to say, but I couldn't because there was already one in the queue. So I shifted from I have to write something to I get to write something. And now because I've taken the pressure off, I have time to rewrite it because I don't have a shortage of ideas for tomorrow. I have extra ones.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (21:34):\nThis episode is brought to you by Paragon, the developer platform for building native customer-facing integrations with third-party apps. Our native integrations on your product roadmap, whether it's to ingest context from your user's external data and documents, or to sync data and automate tasks across your users' other apps, integrations are mission-critical for B2B software products today. But building these integrations in-house cost and average of three months of engineering according to the 2024 State of Integration survey, which results in difficult roadmap trade-offs. This is why engineering teams at Copy.ai, AI21 and over 100 other B2B SaaS companies use Paragon so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The result, they've shipped integrations seven times faster, all while avoiding the never-ending maintenance that comes with rolling your own integrations. Visit useparagon.com/Lenny to see how Paragon can help you accelerate your product's integration roadmap today and get $1,000 in credit on their pro and enterprise plans. That's useparagon.com.\n\n(22:41):\nSo let's talk about your book. You wrote a new book. It's called This is Strategy. I've been reading it over the past week and I've been so into it that I actually left it at my mother-in-law's house. I don't have it with me. So it's called, This is Strategy. It's about how to build strategy and develop a strategy. There's a lot to love about the book, but the section in the middle that is what most stuck out to me that I want to spend a little time on. You have this four sequence of advice that I love, so I'm just going to read it real quick. Choose your customers, choose your future. Choose your competition and choose your future. Choose the source of validation and you choose your future. Choose your distribution, and you're also choosing your future. Can you just talk through these four insights, these four steps that basically determine what your product and life is going to be like outside of actually building the products directly?\n\nSeth Godin (23:31):\nYeah. And for a product person, these are the critical choices and you probably have glossed over them. You have probably assumed it's a given and you've sacrificed your agency over the four most important things you should be choosing. So the first one is picking your customers. If your motto is you can pick anyone and we're anyone, if your hope is that you have to win SEO to get anything, you're not going to succeed. When you choose your smallest viable audience, what language they speak, how much money they have, what problem they're trying to solve, what their technical facility is, whether they're short-tempered, whether they're kind, whether they're going to stick with you, you have chosen everything that's going to go into the product and what your future is going to be like. And so the Humane Pin people, whatever it was called, made a mistake when they picked their customers because they showed up like they had a finished Apple-quality product and they were trying to appeal to the kind of people that would buy on pre-order a finished Apple quality product.\n\n(24:40):\nWhen they shipped something that wasn't that, and they knew it wasn't that, they're doomed. Whereas if you say, here we are in Product Hunt, we're only looking for 400 people. We're looking for people who like the Raspberry Pi. Who wants to wonk with this thing? Now you can dance and you can have all these other things happen because you picked a different customer. If you decide to be a wedding photographer in the Hamptons, well you better expect to have some very spoiled, cranky brides and grooms, and grooms and grooms, and brides and brides, that you have to deal with because you picked your customers. Okay, so then the second one which comes with that is who's your competition? Because if you're competing against Walmart, why are you surprised that they keep lowering their prices? That's what Walmart does, right? That way you decide which space that you're going to operate in. You've built an enormous set of boundaries around what you do.\n\n(25:36):\nThe third one is validation. If you are trying to please your boss, that's what you're going to do. If on the other hand, you can have one difficult conversation with your boss and say, can we agree that I'm not trying to match your taste, I'm trying to match the taste of these 400 people that we've agreed are our customers? Every other meeting is going to go way better from now on because you've made it clear who you're trying to please.\n\n(26:01):\nAnd the last one, choose your distribution matters a lot in the software business. For example, a video game, which is where I started, we were in Target and Lechmere and mass merchants. Our competitors were in Ziploc bags in computer stores. Well, when something like Steam shows up, when something like downloadable shareware shows up, everything about your product changes. So again, these four things are choices, and if you're glossing over them it's because you're afraid.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:33):\nAnd I think it's important to note, it's not like you can just change these at will and just like, okay, cool, we'll change your distribution. These are intertwined. But the important point here that I hear is just make sure the product you're building understands this is how you'll be distributed. This is who you're selling to.\n\nSeth Godin (26:49):\nYeah, I mean, so a friend just sent me a business plan. They're making a food product and they're saying, we're going to distribute on Shopify and we're also going to sell to businesses, airports, hotels, and people who need to sell the food. I'm like, there's only two of you. No, that's not what your business... You got to pick, today, before you even turn the page, who are you for and who are you not for?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (27:15):\nAlong the lines of picking your customer reminds me, a friend of mine started a company selling a product to real estate agents and she just warned me, be careful who you're selling to because you're going to be spending a lot of time with these people. Make sure you're ready to be doing that.\n\nSeth Godin (27:28):\nOne of my very first books was a advertising supported directory paid for by law firms. This is not something I want to recommend to anybody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (27:38):\nAnother great nugget from the book that really stood out to me is this idea of tension. The importance of tension. You basically talk about how a great strategy has tension at the center of it. Why is tension so important to a good strategy?\n\nSeth Godin (27:53):\nOkay, so let's agree that tension and stress aren't the same thing. Stress is generally not good. Stress is two things at the same time, I want to leave, I need to stay. Right? I hate my boss, but I need this job. That's stress. Don't look for stress. Tension is at the heart of every art form and every innovation. Tension is it might not work. Tension is da-da-da-na-na, and the other person says, da-da. Because they need to finish the sentence.\n\n(28:23):\nSo what we do when we launch a new product is we say, we have this thing that can do X, and now the person is imagining what their life might be like if that were true. If they fall in love with that possibility, now there's tension. Did you tell the truth? Is it going to work for them? And when I was a kid, PF Flyers were the sneaker to get, this was before Nike. And the promise of PF Flyers was that they would finally make you fast enough to run away from the bully. And I remember 10 years old walking into that shoe store and there was real tension in my head because I needed to get away from that bully, and I was keeping the PF Flyers people to their promise, and they didn't tell the truth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:08):\nIt comes back to your point about not delivering on the promise that you make to build-\n\nSeth Godin (29:08):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:13):\n... A great brand, right? Okay, I want to take a little tangent into Purple Cow territory. I have your book right here, by the way. I have many of your books in the back, but I don't want to make my library... Oh, what is that? A milk carton?\n\nSeth Godin (29:26):\nThis is the first 10,000 copies came in milk carton.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:28):\nOh man, I missed out on that. Was there any purple milk inside? What color is a purple cow's milk? We'll never know. We'll never know. I know you've talked about this concept a gazillion times. I feel like still people don't actually... Many people haven't heard it. Many people don't truly understand it, and it's the thing that I reference most of your piece of advice. Could you spend a little time just chatting about this topic of the Purple Cow, the importance of being remarkable?\n\nSeth Godin (29:57):\nOkay, so let's start with Steve Blank. I'm sure you've talked about his idea of customer traction. The single best way to tell if a startup's got any hope whatsoever is do the people who engage with you stick around? Do they come back for more? The second piece is, do they tell their friends? And if they tell their friends, what do they say? The word remarkable means worth making a remark about. So I'm not talking about coming up with some viral video that's ridiculous in its gimmickry. I'm saying if you make something where the person's life gets better if they talk about you and you know in advance what you want them to say, then they are more likely to say it. So Marissa Mayer probably created more stock market value than any other product manager I can think of. And the way she did it was there weren't very many people at Google, but she was the one who said, \"No, you can't put another button on the homepage. There are only going to be two buttons on the homepage.\" And over and over and again.\n\n(31:04):\nAt the time I was at Yahoo. Yahoo had the chance to buy Google for $10 million while I was there. That's a whole interesting story. But Yahoo had 183 links on the homepage and Google had two. And the statement built into that is we are making you a promise, and the promise is we are smart enough to take you where you want to go without you spending a lot of time browsing through 183 links. Tell us what you want and we'll take you there. And so I was a tech-forward person, and if a friend came to me lost on the internet, confused about something, I'd just send them to Google because I knew they wouldn't come back to me for more help, because okay, fine, they're gone. It's going to work. That's what to say about Google at its launch is, hey, just type in what you want and you'll find it. They built that into the product. That makes it remarkable because I wanted to tell other people about that because it would raise my status as a tech innovator.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (32:05):\nAnd the implication here, and you talked about this, is that most likely the way you will win is word of mouth. It's hard to win with paid ads. It's hard to win with sales teams unless you're building B2B software. What you need to focus on is how to build something people tell their friends about. And the core of that is being remarkable. And I love just the way you break it down. Being remarkable is being something people remark about.\n\nSeth Godin (32:30):\nYeah, and if you think it's just for small companies, that's how Microsoft beat WordPerfect, because Microsoft Word was the format you needed your coworkers to work in if you were using a modern computer, because if they insisted on using WordPerfect, then you were stuck with WordPerfect. Whereas they had a migration path and once you migrated, you didn't go back. So again, it's in my interest to insist you use Word. So I did.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (32:58):\nThis point about Mercer Mayer of doing this thing that was controversial, it comes back to your point of creating tension. It feels like it created tension both with visitors and internally. There's also these quotes that I have here that are along these lines that you've said in the past, I don't think they're in this book. If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try. And safety is risky. Is there anything you want to say there?\n\nSeth Godin (33:22):\nWell, so one of the things I talk about in the book is that systems are everywhere we look and they're largely invisible, taken for granted. I spend time with high school seniors talking about college. They don't see the college industrial complex. They just think it's normal, because that's what it is to grow up in the suburbs. And what systems do to protect themselves is they invent culture. Culture is the way things are around here. And so if you think something is scary, that's probably because the system wants you to think that.\n\n(33:57):\nAnd so you shouldn't do something foolhardy. You shouldn't be fearless. But what you should do is think about why does it scare me to do this? What system will be offended if I do that? Am I trying to work with the system or am I leveraged enough to help change the system? And so the first people who put up downloadable software, all the feedback was, you can't do that. It'll be pirated. You'll never make a penny. Okay. That might happen, and I can see why that feels scary, but I could also see why the dominant system of software distribution doesn't want me to even experiment with this. But I only worked on the software for five months, let's try it, because if it doesn't work and it gets pirated, I'll just have to make new software. It's okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (34:44):\nIt's interesting, the opposite of that was also true with Salesforce. Their whole pitch was no software. It's all in the cloud. Once that became the system, that became the tension and the risky move.\n\nSeth Godin (34:55):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (34:56):\nSo you have this quote, actually. I want to spend more time on the system concept because it's so core to the book, and so core to your advice for how to be better, you have this actual quote. \"What does it mean to be a strategic thinker? It means to see the system.\" What else can you share about it just for people that are trying to become better strategically, to understand what you mean when you talk about the system, how to see the system?\n\nSeth Godin (35:18):\nWe have to invent systems anytime we engage with other human beings, because interoperability is essential. There's a system for how we greet other people in our culture. You shake hands, right hand to right hand. And just show up sometime and give the Vulcan salute instead and watch what happens. It's very awkward because we just needed to get this over with and now that's part of the system. And so systems serve a valuable function until they don't, because then the system starts doing things to support itself, to reinforce itself. So for example, there is a system that says we should interview people for jobs. And the most successful interviews are people where they show that they are like us, they look like us, they went to schools like us, they have privilege and background like us. That is toxic, because it diminishes not just diversity, but our ability to put real talent on the team.\n\n(36:19):\nAnd if you don't see that system and name that system, you're going to keep doing what you were doing. And I was talking to someone yesterday who said they had been working with a company and the last four people that they had hired had been captain of their Ivy League tennis team. Well, clearly there's a pattern here and it's being reinforced by people who don't want to get in trouble, but the system's not helping them. And so yes, we need the metric system and we need the zip code system. Those keep working really well. But if you are trying to show up in a place where dominant players don't want you to succeed, you're going to have to find something in the system that gives you a chance to change the rules.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (37:07):\nThis metaphor that I love that's along these lines of better waves make better surfers, that a lot of your success is driven by choosing the wave versus the skills that you have. Can you just talk about that?\n\nSeth Godin (37:18):\nYeah. So it's surprisingly profound. I don't know where I came up with it, but when I see people who are great at surfing, they're almost always on good waves. And my son who surfs a lot, I have noticed, passes up waves that other people might take waiting for the right wave because he knows he will be able to surf it better. So when you think about which company you're signing up to bring software from, which people you're willing to put on the key roles, are you willing to wait for the superstar who's going to change things or are you in so much of a hurry to make an imaginary deadline that you're going to ship mediocre work? Because all mediocre means is average. And so if you don't want to be mediocre, you better do something different than the other people are doing. Otherwise, you're going to get what the other people are getting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:10):\nAs you talk about this, I'm thinking about, I don't know if you saw Jaguar's rebrand and their whole launch. And it feels like it's been rejected by the system. Any thoughts on that? Maybe what they got wrong or maybe it was genius?\n\nSeth Godin (38:24):\nOkay, so you've picked a topic that I really like to talk about. Jaguar did not rebrand, Jaguar re-logo-ed. And the logo might be a sign that they're trying to rebrand and make a different promise, and they're switching to all electric, which I'm in favor of. But they made, I think, a very significant error, which is if you're going to start a car company, a hundred million or a billion dollars are going to get spent earning trust from people who never heard of you. If you're starting with one of the most iconic and beautiful and beloved car brands that has the luxury of having almost no cars in the world that could undermine what you want it to stand for going forward, it's perfect. Own that, that's brilliant. And to walk away from that so that you could please some art director, I don't understand why you think you're rebranding when you just put a logo on that undermines many of the awareness assets you already had going for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:28):\nIt feels like they got very, very controversial. They went against the status quo more maybe than they should. I don't know. What would you have done if you were them?\n\nSeth Godin (39:36):\nYou may recall when the International House of Pancakes decided to falsely announce they were changing their name to the International House of Burgers and made a new logo, because they wanted buzz. This is a Wendy's Twitter tactic. Buzz does not sell hamburgers. Oreo's got a lot of buzz when they did that tweet about the Super Bowl blackout. There's no evidence they sold even one more cookie. They're not in the business of entertaining us. So Jaguar isn't going to sell more cars because people like you and I are talking about their re-logoing. What's going to make them sell cars is customer traction. What they need to do is find 50 people who have authority and get them in a car that changes them somehow, that transforms them.\n\n(40:26):\nAnd it's interesting if you think about two things that Tesla did right at the beginning with the model S. The first one is, according to someone I know who worked there at the time, the number one thing people would talk about when they saw you in the parking lot of the supermarket was the door handles, because the door handles popped out. They popped out in a way that's annoying and dangerous, but it was noticeable. So there was a conversation.\n\n(40:52):\nAnd then what would happen is they'd say, what do you think of it? And you'd say, get in the car and you'd switch to ludicrous mode and you'd drive at zero to 60 in 2.4 seconds and they'd start screaming. This was fun for you and told a story to the passenger. This is how customer traction begins because I can't do that in a different car, right? Compare this to the clown car, the Cybertruck, which was intentionally divisive and most people don't want to not only drive one but have one on their block because divisiveness is not selling. That what's selling is being of utility, to help someone get what they want. So here you have a category, the pickup truck, the number one category for all cars in the United States, just sitting there waiting to be taken. You can cross the chasm if you're someone like Tesla. And instead, they decide to pull a stunt, and that's not okay. It's not good product management. It's not good marketing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (41:56):\nInteresting. So you think Cybertruck are not going to be a success?\n\nSeth Godin (42:00):\nWell, I think, compared to what, right? So the Ford F-150 some years has made more than a hundred percent of Ford's profit, meaning without the Ford 150 pickup truck, there is no Ford. That's how big a category that is. You have a car with momentum and a public company where you've earned the trust of a lot of people. Now you have a category, pickup trucks, that are purchased for a very specific reason to show your neighbors you care about utility. Even if you never use the bed, that's the story of driving a pickup truck. So now, if you bring people in that category who are inherently skeptical of change and inherently skeptical of design trickery, something that is nothing but change and design trickery, no, they're not going to adopt it. You could have sold an enormous number of people who might've bought a Ford 150 instead. That crossing of the chasm is how you become really significant.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:01):\nI feel like this alone could be its own separate podcast conversation. I wish we had more time. I'm going to ask one last question, and this is a quote that I found of yours that I also love that is reminiscent of Elon Musk, actually, as we were just talking about this. \"The secret to leadership is simple. Do what you believe. Paint a picture of the future. Go there. People will follow.\" Can you just talk about that?\n\nSeth Godin (43:25):\nI might be a little too glib because what I need to highlight is the painting the picture of the future needs to be based in empathy. You can't paint a picture of where you want to go. You have to paint a picture of where they want to go, and it's this non-narcissism that is where professionals do their work. That you are not entitled to raise money, you're not entitled to have market share, you're not entitled to get a good price because you worked hard. What we can do is be of service. We can open the door to help people get to where they always wanted to go. It's very difficult to change what people want, but it's pretty helpful to offer people a chance to get to where they always wanted to go in the first place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:14):\nSeth, this was a dream come true. I appreciate you coming on the podcast. I appreciate you saying that. Where can people check out your book? Where should people go to learn more about what you're up to? Anything you want to share.\n\nSeth Godin (44:25):\nSo I'm not active on social media, but I do have a blog at Seths.blog. If you go to Seths.blog/TIS, you'll find everything you need to know about the book and the strategy deck and the collectible chocolate bar and whatever other thing I've dreamed up in the meantime.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:42):\nChocolate. Seth, thank you so much for being here.\n\nSeth Godin (44:45):\nThese were great questions, Lenny, I could talk to you all day. Thank you,\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:48):\nI appreciate that. Same. Bye everyone.\n\n(44:52):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Why great AI products are all about the data | Shaun Clowes (CPO at Confluent)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nI love that you have very strong opinion about this, which is just the state of the product management career and how most PMs are not that great.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:00:08):\nWhy is it that product management is still such a relatively undeveloped discipline? We're like 15 to 20 years into this, and so there's something about the current state of product management that isn't getting at the truly important things, the truly value-added things. If we were doctors, you'd be like, \"That's totally unacceptable.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):\nWhat's the answer, Shaun? How do we solve this problem?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:00:26):\nIn everything always talk from the customer's perspective, from the market's perspective, from the competitor's perspective, the very small number of PMs do that. They get dragged into internal politics, they get dragged into scrum management or scrum execution or product delivery, and you just can't win that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):\nYou kind of have this hot take that the way AI will most impact product management is data management.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:00:45):\nWell, you've got this synthesis machine, which is this LLM thing that's going to help you do synthesis, but if it hasn't got all that data to do synthesis on top of, it's got nothing. And so that means that LLMs can only be as good as the data they are given and how recent that data is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):\nIn the future, if you can easily clone a B2B SaaS app like Salesforce or Atlassian, what happens to these businesses long-term? Do they just become, are they all in trouble?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:01:06):\nPeople really underestimate where the value is created in these applications and they just kind of get it completely wrong.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:17):\nToday my guest is Shaun Clowes. Shaun is chief product officer at Confluent. Previously he was chief product officer at MuleSoft, which is a billion-dollar business within Salesforce. Before that, he was chief product officer of Metromile, a public auto insurance technology company. And prior to that he spent six years at Atlassian where he ran the Jira agile and also built the first ever B2B growth team. He also created two of the most popular Reforge courses, one on retention and engagement and one on data for product managers. Shaun is awesome because he's both very tactical in execution oriented, while also being very philosophical and insightful about the craft of product and growth. In our conversation, Shaun shares why most PMs are not good, what it takes to become a good or great product manager, how he thinks about his career, like a Bingo card and why he indexes towards finding very different roles for every new job that he takes.\n\n(00:02:12):\nWhy good data is the most important ingredient in AI tools and for product managers working with AI. Also, how to build a great B2B growth team, what he's learned about doing B2B growth and his really interesting take on how AI will and won't disrupt SaaS tools out in the wild.

Shaun, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:05:12):\nThank you, Lenny. It's really awesome to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:14):\nI've had you on my radar for a long time and I am really excited to finally have you here and big bonus points for having a very beautiful, sultry Australian accent that always helps with the ratings, I think. I don't know if it's causal, but it's correlative.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:05:28):\nI'm glad to be a bit of a curiosity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:31):\nSo I want to start with something I totally believe and I love that you have very strong opinion about this, which is just the state of the product management career and how most PMs are not that great and how there's a big opportunity to level up. You just talk about what you've seen there and you're just thinking here.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:05:51):\nYeah, it's honestly a big conundrum for me. I think it's actually part of... It's grandiose to say so, a bit of my life's work. Why is it that product management is still such a relatively undeveloped discipline? We're 15 to 20 years into this thing. You would've thought that it would be less random than it is. The outcomes are random, the behaviors are random, individual performance is random, seemingly. And so there's something about the current state of product management that isn't getting at the truly important things, the truly value-added things, the right way to think about problems, the right way to think through problems, the abstract reasoning that's needed, there's something that isn't working about it. I spent a long time trying to put my finger on it and then be like, \"How do you reproducibly reproduce that?\" Reproducibly produce people who can really be really great product managers.\n\n(00:06:39):\nThe thing is that if you think all the way back to it, I spent a long time as an engineer and people always talk about 10 times engineers and I wanted to be a 10 times engineer. I'll leave it to others to decide to tell you whether or not I was or I wasn't, but certainly I wanted to be and I tried to be a really great engineer. And it must be true that if there's 10 times engineers, and I would argue they definitely are, they must be 10 times product managers too. But at the same time, those 10 times product managers, because product management is ultimately about leverage, so it's about helping other people have dramatically more impact than they would if they were unorganized that they didn't have somebody to organize the goals and what we're trying to achieve, then that means that a 10 times product manager has 100 times return or more because they're 10 timesing the return on 10 times resources.\n\n(00:07:23):\nSo the outcomes are so wild, like wildly distributed and the benefits are so good that you would've thought that it would've behooved us. There would've been a way that this had evolved and improved and really gotten way crisper than it has, but here we are. I'm not saying that we haven't gotten better, we 100% have, but I think we could all say that we're not reliably producing 10 times product managers every day of the week.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:49):\nI love this point and it's especially painful that when someone works with a PM that's not great. There's just this meme of why do I need PMs? PMs are useless, PMs suck, and it just creates that no one's ever like, \"Engineers are useless or designers are useless.\" But there's so many people are like, \"I don't need product managers on our team. Never hire a PM,\" and it just sets the whole profession back.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:08:12):\nWhen I first started out in PM somebody, it's obviously a chestnut, but he pointed out that realistically when you're a product manager, your job is to say no to 90% of things that get brought your way. And so that kind of makes you the bad person pretty much from the start. And so you're saying no to 90%, so you can say yes to 10% and that kind of puts you behind the eight-ball right at the very beginning, and so you have to very quickly get runs on the board. You have to prove to have the right insights, to have the right data, to make the right decisions or you don't get another go, you don't get another swing at it. So it makes sense that product managers are the easiest to single out and criticize, but that is also what makes it the funnest thing.\n\n(00:08:52):\nIf you think about why do we do this? Somebody once asked me, \"Would you retire? Why do people do what they do?\" Because certainly at some point it isn't just about the money and at the end of the day product management is so damn fun because it's about trying to figure out an edge. It's like trying to look at the world, find the portion of the chessboard that isn't occupied, but that is valuable and find a way to get into it, invade it and destroy it. It's decisions under uncertainty and that makes it unbelievably fun. Really, really painful and very frustrating and very hard to convince people, but very, very fun. So in equal measures basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:33):\nWhat's the answer, Shaun? How do we solve this problem? I know you said it's your life's work. What do you find actually helps most in helping PMs level up and become say 10 X PMs?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:09:43):\nI think the most important thing and the chestnut that I repeat to everybody is that at the end of the day, the time you spend looking inside the building doesn't really benefit you very much at all. And Steve Blanken, people used to talk about you should be spending 80% of your time thinking about things going on outside the building. You might not be outside the building, but you should spend 80% of your time thinking outside the building. And I would say that very small number of PMs do that. They get dragged into internal politics, they get dragged into scrum management or scrum execution or product delivery, like elements of the delivery thing and you just can't win that way. You just can't win that way. You can never get an A because you're fundamentally not solving the job. The job is not about execution or anything, it's about finding reliable, differentiated value that you can uniquely deliver into the market.\n\n(00:10:33):\nSo I would say if there's one thing, two things I would say actually that I generally guide product managers to do, one is to always start from the point of view outside the building in every document in everything, always talk from the customer's perspective, from the market's perspective, from the competitor's perspective, and the people who listen to me on that I would say get better almost immediately because they're starting from a place that's easier to understand and then secondarily be data informed.\n\n(00:10:58):\nThey use all of that view of the world, but don't just make up a bunch of statements, support that statements with anecdotes and bits of data. It doesn't have to be a treatise, but convince everybody of what the world really looks like and what the opportunities ahead of the company looks like and good things happen to you. And all of a sudden you go from a world where nobody wants to help you get anything done to where everybody wants you to win. They want you to win and they may not give you everything you want, but they certainly will try because they're like, \"Well, of all the bets we could make, this is a good one.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):\nI imagine many people listening to this are thinking, \"Oh, I am that person. I talk to customers all the time. I'm always interacting, looking at research, putting data together.\" And what you're saying is you're probably not doing that enough. Is there anything that you could help someone recognize of, \"No, you're actually not doing this enough and you think you are but you're not.\"\n\nShaun Clowes (00:11:50):\nIt's one thing to say you're spending a lot of time looking outside the building. It's a whole other thing to hear from the places you don't normally hear from. So avoid availability or confirmation bias. Most of the time people go talk to the people they always talk to and they learn nothing particularly new. They don't synthesize the results that they got from that conversation. They don't seek out the counterfactual, they don't seek out the proof that they're wrong. They don't analyze what their competitors are doing and figure out what that must tell you about the market. They don't bring back the data of how their product is actually being used versus how people say it's being used. It's like all data and no analysis is not very useful. Everyone can bring back an omnibus edition of random stuff I heard on a Tuesday, but the competitive advantage is extracted out of figuring out what other people don't see, figuring out where we are wrong, figuring out where a well-placed bet could have dramatically outlandish returns.\n\n(00:12:49):\nAnd so I think firstly, people often say that they do a lot of this stuff, but they actually don't because they don't have any structured way of doing it. So what they really mean is every now and then I get in a customer call or every now and then I get stuck into an escalation. And so they're kind of conveniently bucketing it. So firstly they don't do it in a very structured way, then they don't bring back analysis, they get true insights from that thing, so they don't really gain very much at all. It's just more activity, no outcomes. People do far too much activity with not enough outcomes and there just isn't enough time in the day to do that to be successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:24):\nYou as a product leader is at the Venn diagram center of the sweet spot of where this podcast has been going recently, which is product and growth and how AI helps you with all these things. And so to follow a thread there with synthesizing and understanding what people are saying, user research and surveys and all these things, have you found any tools that you and your team have found really useful to help you do this more efficiently versus traditionally just manually going through all the stuff and finding patterns?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:13:55):\nYeah, so firstly, stepping back a little bit just into the motherhood and apple pie portion of qualitative research or whatever, I find that most people don't even understand or don't start with a rigorous foundation in what they're going to need to do to get the answers that they want. So for example, your listeners have probably heard about the Nielsen number before, but basically the idea is that once you interview between 7 and 14 people, you stop learning new things. Less than 7, you don't learn enough, more than 14, you start learning anything new. And so if you interviewed two people, you probably don't have enough data. If you interviewed 22, you probably had too much, so they don't even right size their efforts. So that's a problem. So they don't start that way. Then they go into these conversations asking leading questions, which really are designed to get the customer to say what they already want to be true, which is so they haven't done enough research or they've done too much and then they've blown up all of the results before they've even heard anything.\n\n(00:14:48):\nIf you don't right size your research and you don't set this up to learn, then you're going to lose. No amounts of applying LLMs or any type of kind of structured reasoning is going to help you. Because you just basically you're reading back what you want to hear or some weird summarized version of what you want to hear. But stepping back from all of that, what I like to do specifically getting to LLMs is I think that we live in just the most amazing time for product managers right now in terms of being able to analyze vast quantities of information and see the common threads. And so let me give you few examples of that. One might be you can do a bunch of customer interviews, you can put a bunch of customer interviews into ChatGPT and you can say, \"Hey, ChatGPT, this is my strategy. Tell me where my strategy does not fit what these customers talked about.\"\n\n(00:15:40):\nIt's all about the not, not where it does, where it does not. People spend far too much time looking for what they're hoping to see, not for what they're not looking to see. So you can literally ask ChatGPT to help you find where the customer is probing at the edges of what you're trying to do, where it's wrong, where what you're saying is not what they believe. And you can ask it questions like that. You can ask it what your customers are saying would better fit what your competitors are saying. So you can basically say, you can copy and paste one of your competitor's positioning documents into ChatGPT and say, \"Is this a better fit for what they have said than my thing?\" Which is you can summarize your own strategy, you can take your competitors but public documents and you can ask it to summarize what their strategy probably is.\n\n(00:16:22):\nAnd it's actually supposedly good at that because mostly your public documents are actually a summary or at least they're derivative of what your strategy is. So it will give you crazy insights into what other people's, literally their product strategy at times creepy like, \"Oh, they will probably do this, they will probably do that. It's more likely they would do this than they would do that.\" And so normally that type of insight was hard one, it took a lot of sweat work. You basically get to read a lot of stuff. You kind of had to use your brain as this big summarization machine and eventually you knew what you felt about all the things you had read, but you couldn't summarize why. LLMs let you get to that really, really, really quickly in a very structured way, but only if you push at the edges, provoke the answers you don't want to hear, provoke the problems, try and prove to yourself that you are wrong, I think is the easiest way to start trying to use some of these tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:15):\nI love that. And it sounds like in your experience you're just using straight-up OpenAI, ChatGPT, Claude, not any specific tool for user research for this specific use case.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:17:26):\nNo, mostly I find that the straight-up LLMs themselves are good enough and we do have some internal tooling that we built around, I don't know if you've ever had Sachin Rekhi on the show, you may have. He was a product leader pretty well known in the gross community, and he was a leader at LinkedIn for a long time and he used to call this concept a Feedback River, and he basically said that really smart product managers are constantly swimming at a Feedback River. They set out to surround themselves by Feedback River and I really deeply believe in that. It's like, \"Okay, how can I surround myself with user interview data, with direct customer feedback, with NPS data, with competitor information?\" Like I'm always trying to wash myself over with information. And where I'm going with this is that LLMs and tooling based on it can be exceptionally good for this.\n\n(00:18:20):\nSo for example, at Confluent we get a ton of inbound customer requests, as you can imagine coming from the field or directly from customers. We use LLMs to take in those asks to summarize what they're about, to find other asks that are like that one, really in a compelling way, a real way, like a semantic way, not other words, exactly the same, are these the same concept? So that we can look across all of the inbound demand on us and say, \"Well, the most popular idea is this one and is getting more popular. The least popular idea is this one. It is getting less popular.\" In a really deep rich way, even across hundreds or thousands of pieces of inbound feedback. I think it's a really great time to be a product manager if you can put these types of tools to work, but they don't do the job for you, they just help you do these things that are intricate in that job of finding the gaps, finding the opportunities, finding the common threads without necessarily having to do all of it just inside your wear-wear, just inside your brain.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:21):\nI'm going to stay in this AI river that we're in right now and ask a couple more AI-related questions. And this may be what you just said, but I'm curious if there's more here. You kind of have this hot take that the way AI will most impact product management is data management and data versus models you're building or anything else. Can you talk about what you've seen there?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:19:40):\nYeah, I mean, I think there's two implications for people as they're building products based on AI and as they're thinking about AI in their workflow. So let's start with the first one, because that's how product managers do product management things. You just asked this question of should it be specific tools built to make AI easier for product managers to use? Or is it in fact more general models being put to work? At the end of the day, these models are very, very, very smart, but they're also insanely dumb and everyone knows that, insanely dumb. In other words, they really only know what they were trained on or what you bring to them right at that moment. In that millisecond, and then they will forget it immediately. And it's very easy to convince yourself that isn't true, but it is actually what really matters. And let me add one extra piece that makes that really important.\n\n(00:20:28):\nAt the end of the day, information has a decay rate. So think about customer feedback, it has a decay rate or what your competitors are doing has a decay rate. So any new piece of data decays in its value to your decision-making very, very quickly, very, very quickly. You can plot your own decay chart if you want to, but the answer is very, very quickly. And so when you think about the job which is synthesizing all of this very complicated information to make good decisions, what does that mean? Well, you've got this synthesis machine, which is this LLM thing that's going to help you do synthesis, but if it hasn't got all that data to do synthesis on top of, it's got nothing. And so that means that LLMs can only be as good as the data they are given and how recent that data is. They're ultimately like information shredders.\n\n(00:21:11):\nThey are limitless information eaters. You can never have enough information to give to an LLM to truly gain its value. The more things you give it, the better it gets. Broadly speaking, that's just not perfect, but that's close enough. And so what that means is as an internal product leader or putting LLMs to work, you need to figure out how to bring as much information about customers or their asks or your competitors, all of it. How much can you find all of it and bring it together and give it to the LLM either in your tooling or even in just copying and pasting or whatever your flow is going to be, that's one thing. But then if you take it beyond that and you go, \"Okay, well now I'm a product leader and I'm building an app and I want to put AI in my app, what will make my AI experience really great?\"\n\n(00:21:57):\nIt's definitely not going to be the models because these models are mostly going to be somewhat replaceable. And you could say, \"Okay, well, is it going to be the prompts?\" Maybe, but certainly good prompts are better than others, and that's kind of an ongoing investment you'd probably want to make to ask better questions to get the LLM to deliver better answers. But it's obvious that the real answer is the context, all the context you're going to give it, all the data you're going to copy and paste. And so if you think about, let's say I'm building a, I have no relationship to this, but let's say I was trying to build a human capital like a HCM bot, like an AI bot. Let's say I was working at Workday and I was trying to bring an AI bot. It's pretty obvious that the smarts of the bot would really be related to all of the employee information, but not just that, it would be the benefit's information, it would be the legal situation in the country where that person is currently working.\n\n(00:22:47):\nIt would be the company's policies and procedures that apply to it. So you get what I mean, by about these kind of the jumps of logic and the jumps of data and the way data is all linked together. If you want to have a smart AI experience, you'll convince yourself that all I really need to do is get a model and wire it in and I'll build a little pipeline that will suck some data in and it will whack it into the LLM. And if you think that way, you're going to be very sad, very, very sad for a very long time because you are constantly going to be wrestling with how do I get data to this thing? How do I get good data to this thing? How do we get timely data to this thing? How do I get well-structured data to this thing?\n\n(00:23:21):\nAnd so it's a data management problem. It's getting access to good data, getting access to high quality data, getting access to timely data and getting it to the LLM to get the LLM to make a smart decision. That's where 90% of the calories go. Maybe it's a bit like Einstein's thing, \"It's 10% inspiration, 90% perspiration.\" Nobody wants to hear it. Everybody wants to just think about what these really cool models and how smart they are, and the next one will be even smarter. But really it's just the hard work of getting really good data to the LLMs to get them to do good things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:51):\nIt sounds really obvious as you make this case. It makes me think about at the Lenny and Friends Summit, Mikey Krieger talked about how he had the two types of PM groups within Anthropic. One was focusing on user experience product and the other was working on the model research side, and they realized that all of the success came from the model research work, like making the model and the data they provided the model was where all the value came from, not just optimizing the user experience and they're just putting more and more of their product team on just that versus tweaking UX and buttons and things like that.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:24:27):\nYeah, exactly right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:29):\nSomething sort of related, I'm just going to ask one more AI question. I don't want every talk to end up being just all AI, but something that's kind of been a meme recently, and I know you have a perspective on this, is that AI makes it really easy to build products. So in the future, if you can easily clone, say, a B2B SaaS app like Salesforce or Atlassian or whatever your favorite B2B SaaS app, what happens to these businesses long-term? Do they just become, are they all in trouble? Are there going to be 100 Salesforce competitors? What's your sense and prediction on what might happen there?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:25:03):\nYeah, I think it's really weird. I think people really underestimate where the value is created in these applications and they just kind of get it completely wrong, and I'm not sure why that is. So if you think you bet. So I spent a long time at Atlassian, so I worked a lot on Jira, which many people know, and I spent a long time at Salesforce, so I spent a lot of time in the CRM ecosystem, the marketing ecosystem and all the rest of it. If you want it to be not charitable, you'd step back and you'd look at all those applications and you'd say, \"They're all just forms on databases.\" You'd say, \"The Jira is a form on a database, Workday is form on a database, so Salesforce.\" They're all forms on databases, all vertical SaaS or business SaaS is ultimately forms on databases. And you're be like, \"Well, how hard can that be to replicate?\"\n\n(00:25:45):\nAnd the answer is unbelievably hard, unbelievably hard. And people just think, \"You totally get it wrong.\" Because it's not actually just about the data model. So if you think about, if it formed some databases, it's these beautiful user experiences that sit on top of data models. So whatever the object is, it might be a customer object or a campaign object or an employee object, you could say that, \"Well, there's some elements of lock-in in the object, the object itself, like the fields of the object.\" I'm like, \"Pretty boring. That's not very interesting.\" But sure, maybe. Certainly there's some value in being the system of record like the default that everybody uses. There's definitely some value in the UX. Like, \"Well, I want to be the best HR-facing applications for working employee data.\" Yeah, there's some value there, but the real thing just staring at everybody in the face is it's all about the business rules.\n\n(00:26:35):\nThat is what drives the lock-in because why do you buy Workday? You don't buy Workday for its out-of-the-box configuration. You buy Workday because you want to configure it to be Lenny Inc's HR processes. It becomes Lenny Inc's Workday. It's not Shaun Inc's Workday, it's Lenny Inc's Workday. And actually the longer you have the software, the more it becomes that, the more it becomes less and less like Workday and more and more like your specific company. Which makes sense because it was built to be configured to meet the needs of any specific company, and every company is their own precious snowflake. And as that happens, those configuration pieces, the bit that makes the application native and a fit for your organization makes it a fit for nobody else's organization and also makes it a black box to the point that you don't even understand how it works anymore.\n\n(00:27:20):\nIf you went to, for example, Salesforce and you said, \"Hey, could you define all of the processes by which software was sold inside Salesforce?\" They couldn't tell you that without reading the code of their Salesforce instance. That's not a proprietary secret. That's obviously true because over time, that's literally how sales happened. There is no other way to do a sale other than through their internal tooling. And so what that means is that it's not the UI that matters and it's not the data model that matters, although those are both very useful. It's the years and years and years of evolution of the underlying workflows of the product to support the customers, but also the customers evolving those workflows to make them work the way they do. And so how does that impact AI companies? You could say, \"It's easier than ever to build forms on a database application.\"\n\n(00:28:09):\nAnd so I'm like, \"Yeah, okay, that presumably drives the incremental value of every new one of those to zero, right?\" So probably leads to more power to the existing winning systems of record because there'll just be a gazillion competitors who would just more form some databases. So like, \"How would you ever choose between them? You may as well just go with the winner. Nobody ever gets fired for buying Salesforce or whatever. You may as well start from the kind of the premier vendor.\" That's one element. You could go the other way and you could say, \"I've heard a few people mount this argument,\" which I think is really interesting that at the end of the day, agents are going to take away most of the use of that user interface.\n\n(00:28:44):\nSo let's say for example, your Salesforce with Service Cloud, I've heard people say, \"Well, a lot of those service agents might end up being replaced with agentic workflows. That will mean that there is no person operating the UI. If the UI doesn't even exist anymore, then why do you even need Salesforce? We may as well just have raw database tables on who even needs forms of databases, you can literally just have databases.\" But that also doesn't make any sense either because the agents have to operate against the rules of the system and the rules are defined by the business processes. So think about Salesforce without a head. Imagine Salesforce had no UI, it would still have those business rules that I was talking about. And those business rules are what define what the agent should do. They're almost telling the agent what it should do and how the world can operate, what is possible, what is allowed. And so from my perspective, this idea that this just completely destroys the differentiation of these kind of business process SaaS applications just seems like a fantasy, a crazy fantasy.\n\n(00:29:42):\nThe only way I could really believe it is if you said, \"Well, you could have a new startup that introspected all of the rules that are configured into a Salesforce to try and reverse engineer what your actual business processes are and then kind of operate on top of that.\" But the best place people to do that would be Salesforce themselves or Atlassian in Atlassian's case or Workday in Workday's case. I just can't see a world in which this... I think one of two things could happen. All this moving to AI makes those applications even better, even more unassailable, they basically get stronger. It makes us stronger or it could enable some new level of applications that come from a more platform based thing, so less a domain specific thing like you ACM or ERP or engineering or less of the domain specific stuff.\n\n(00:30:36):\nIt could enable a more platform like play where you have more business objects and business objects have rules. And you could imagine a world in which there's kind of a whole evolution of new more platform like SaaS applications that do more than one business function worth of the business rules and the way things move around in the enterprise, but that doesn't exist today. So you could say that that could exist and it could say it could be way better than we've ever thought of because of AI. Or you could say that the rich are going to get richer. The most likely outcome is that the currently dominant companies are going to get more dominant, but I don't think this idea that it would just cause a spring up of a whole bunch of new apps that will more easily challenge the incumbents makes any particularly, it's not straightforward to me how that would happen basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:18):\nWow, that was extremely fascinating and there's so much there. I can go in so many directions. One is I thought you would actually go in this direction, which is distribution advantages become even more important if it's easy to... Like today, I could sit there and hire team clone. Salesforce might take a while, but I could copy it, but by the time I'm done, they've evolved, they're moving, they're adding features, they're ahead, right? You're skating to where the puck was. And so if that's the case, one of the advantages, one of the ways to get anywhere is to have some kind of distribution advantage. It's one thing to have Salesforce as a product clone, another to get anyone to know about it, to adopt it, to sell it, procurement, all that stuff. Do you have a sense of distribution advantages being even more valuable in that world?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:32:05):\nYeah, I mean, it certainly makes sense. Ultimately, at the end of the day, distribution is always an advantage because the hardest problem is to even be in the consideration set for any given problem. The world is full of problems. It's just when people have that problem, they firstly don't think they're going to solve it at all. And when they do think of solving it, they don't think of you. So distribution is always an incredible advantage. But again, in the world of AI, it seems like distribution is more likely to get hard than easy. So if you think about, for example, diminishing returns on cold email because cold email is getting easier and easier to send even worse spam, it sounds better, but it's effectively causing everybody to become desensitized to everything. I don't know if you've noticed, half the LinkedIn charts now are all basically clearly LLM generated spam.\n\n(00:32:50):\nI mean, to some degree it's actually worsening the signal-to-noise ratio. And so I think that a lot of the breakthrough distribution mechanisms that startups often use seem to be getting more crowded just in general and more expensive. That doesn't bode well for, \"I'm the not as good Salesforce,\" \"I'm the not as good Salesforce, but I'm cheaper.\" It has to be something different. There has to be some angle upon which you are materially better. And what I saw happening and what I've been seeing happening, and I think it's been really interesting is a lot of modern next-gen applications bringing data as a first-class citizen into the workflow. And I think that that's pretty compelling. So if you look at the next-generation of applicant management products that deal with inbound job applicants, a lot of them now like the latest core ones, they include your time to fill data, they include outcome data of who's got the best hiring outcomes, who over what period of time has the worst attrition, literally all the way back to the interviewers and where the interviews were in the interview cycle.\n\n(00:33:58):\nSo basically embeds data into the whole life cycle. So I think that there are these ways in which startups can bring these experience benefits by just bringing a different approach to the world that does enable them to capitalize on traditional disruptive innovation. At the end of the day, this is just disruptive innovation. It means that most companies have overshot the utility like the average utility, so you can win by meeting the average utility and being different, meet the bar and be different. Meet the bar and be different is the way to cut through. So that makes sense if that's a half decent playbook. But even for those companies, now they're going to have all these AI competitors who are using AI to engineer faster, to build a competitor just like them as quickly as possible and start jamming it into the channel. And it's going to be interesting to see how this whole thing evolves. It kind of got race to the bottom characteristics around it. You're probably right, the distribution is still the hardest part in software, particularly when you're getting started.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:00):\nSo if you have some kind of clever and fair advantage, it feels like that becomes even more powerful. Say have a platform of an audience or something like that. You mentioned this ATS product they really like. Is there one you want to give some love to that you think is really cool that you like or you want to keep it anonymous?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:35:16):\nYeah, it's Ashby. It's the one all the cool kids are talking about now. And it's funny because people literally talk about it in comparison to all, even the last generation of modern SaaS ATSs or whatever, and they talk about it in glowing ways because of the way they put data inside the actual workflow. So the actions and its outcomes are directly tieable to each other in the application you're doing the work in. I think that's a pretty compelling user experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:41):\nSo just to maybe close this thread before I move in a different direction, this point you're making about how valuable data is and how that's at the core of being successful and differentiating in the future, especially with AI tooling and products, any advice you'd give to someone that wants to do that? Is it just make sure you have a, is it half proprietary data? Is it like make it a first-class citizen? What's the advice you'd give to founders who are trying to do this, which you're suggesting?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:36:08):\nYeah, I, think at the end of the day, it's kind of all of those things, isn't it? If you have first-party data but you can't bring it to bear, then it's not very much use. If you have third-party data and you bring it to bear in interesting ways, the problem with data is we're all surrounded by data all the time. So the data's everywhere. What really matters is the right data at the right time in the right place because we're all humans. And so to me, there are obviously data advantages and there are even data network effects if you can end up in a situation where you have very valuable first-party data. But in any case, it's still about being able to bring the right data at the right place, at the right time for those users, for them to be able to get advantage from it.\n\n(00:36:48):\nA little kind of segue I guess on that one is I know I spent a lot of my career, weirdly, actually I've been a product person for a long time, but weirdly I've ended up inheriting data teams. So I've actually run data teams at a lot of different companies, which is weird because product managers don't normally own data teams. I think I have just a really massive affinity for data. I used to call myself data-driven, it was kind of my jam. And in hindsight, I look back and I think data is the opposite. Data is more like a compass than a GPS. If you look at data as a way of giving you the answer, you're always wrong. You're always wrong or you're slow. Wrong or slow or sometimes both, because mostly data doesn't give you the answer. It just tells you if what you just said is ridiculous or there's potentially something there.\n\n(00:37:44):\nSo it's more like about disproving whatever you think and you end up being slow because if you try and use data for everything, your brain is ultimately a data sifter or whatever. So the reason your intuition tells you something is because you've seen a ton of data that tells you that this is the most likely answer. And so being data-driven, being data obsessed is it's something you can easily overdo very, very easily overdo. So it's about right-sizing data, having the right data at your fingertips, having the right kind of view on data rather than trying to expect data to give you the answer or trying to use data as a weapon or trying to use data as a way to force people to believe you or to go in your direction. But data is kind of at the center of everything and about how to influence and be successful in products you're building and arguments you're mounting internally and everything else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:34):\nI love that you went there. I definitely wanted to spend time on here. It's interesting you say that, there used to be data-driven, [inaudible 00:38:44] data-driven. You created the Reforge course, data for product managers and also retention, engagement course and Reforge. And by the way, we'll link to these. You're still helping with these courses. By the way, they're still running. They're awesome. People love them.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:38:56):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:56):\nGreat. So we'll point people to those. I love that you're also saying you're like, I think the way you described it to me before, this is your reform data-driven PM. A lot of people say this, they're like, \"Don't just do what data tells you to do. Use your intuition, use it as a guide.\" It's hard on the ground to operationalize that advice. Say to your PMs and your teams when they have data telling them, \"Hey, this experiment is a huge success, or there's a huge onboarding conversion opportunity here.\" I guess just like what's your tactical advice to folks that have data telling them one thing and maybe something else telling them something else?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:39:35):\nI think the first thing I always encourage people to do is to look at a piece of data. If you're looking at a piece of data and the result tells you something that your intuition tells you is insanely wrong, like they probably not right. First, believe your intuition and go and prove yourself right. Don't just take it at first glance because most of the time it's like Occam's razor. The most likely explanation for something that is insanely not intuitive is that it's just wrong, that there's a problem somewhere. Now, occasionally, sometimes you actually will be right. Now those will be paid dirt moments. Those are the moments that make it all worth it. There are times when you do find the negative goal, you're like, you're staring at it and like, \"This is it. This was the problem. This was the thing we were looking for this whole time.\"\n\n(00:40:18):\nBut you have to be very diligent about following it through, really understanding what you're looking at. Is this data representative? Is this data a good sample of the audience we care about? Is it already subject to some sort of selection bias? Oftentimes when I see analysis from different product leaders or even data teams, you can drive a truck through it, literally drive a truck through it. And if you present data with authority and that data is ridiculous or the analysis is just full of holes, you don't just not get benefit for that. You lose a whole bunch of brownie points. It would be better not to show up with an analysis that isn't clear than it would be to show up with an analysis that's dumb. And I see people self emulate on this actually relatively regularly because they just bring a knife to a gunfight or whatever, they did bring in an analysis that is just not, it doesn't hold water and they present it and then get shot down live, which is nobody's idea of a good time.\n\n(00:41:21):\nSo if I give you a little bit of additional tactical things about that, it'd be okay if I'm looking at a piece of data, what was upstream of this piece of data and does that look normal? So this thing happened or whatever, which you're very, very excited about, what happened before that? And does that match what you think should have been right? So what happened before this momentous situation? And then, okay, for that thing that you're looking at, what happened after? If you have an idea of what happened before and after, that gives you some idea of whether or not this thing, is it all worth interesting to talk about? And then go one click above this data that you're looking at. So it's like, these things, let's say I'm looking at onboarding success. Let's say I'm looking at onboarding success to second week retention or something like that.\n\n(00:42:05):\nI'm like, \"I have found this thing that totally crushes it. This intervention crushes it.\" If you go upstream and you find out that this intervention only applies to 2% of the inbound onboarding stream, it's meaningless. It's most likely just a random aberration. But even if it was not a random aberration, it's not a useful tool. And so you've got to go up and then you might go downstream and you might find, yep, they last for two in the second week, but in the third week they all churn. They're basically pointless. Why are we even talking about this? Or then you might step all the way back and go, \"Okay, yes, those people do get retained for longer, but their average ASP is smaller.\" Because what we really care about, we do care about engagement and we care about more customers, but we want to keep the customers at a high ASP to reach a certain revenue goal.\n\n(00:42:46):\nThe final goal is happy customers paying us money. So that's what I mean about going a click up. If you go a click to the left, a click to the right, so before and after and then a click up and you still see the thing that tells you the story that you want to tell, then now you've got something that's very compelling because people want to hear about that. They want to hear, \"Well, what did happen before? What did happen after? And why is that outcome happening?\" But you have to really do your homework and really be rigorous about it to avoid fighting fool's gold.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:15):\nI love that advice. ASP, what does that stand for by the way?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:43:19):\nOh, average sale press, [inaudible 00:43:22] MRR or some other revenue metric.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:25):\nGot it. This point you made about how a lot of times experiments show positive and then they end up not being anything, I had the head of growth from Shopify on the podcast, and they do this really cool thing where they keep holdouts for years of cohorts and then it auto emails them I think a year or two later, \"Hey, check this and see if these cohorts, this is still higher or not.\" And 40% of the time, it turns out neutral after a positive experiment long term.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:43:50):\nInteresting. It's really funny because the last time we did something similar, we had a global holdout group actually that was held out of all experiments. The experiment platform couldn't target that group at all. So 10% of all people never saw anything ever. So that's be really, really helpful because you can always compare them against whatever the experience was for any of the same vintage of cohort. I agree with you. But the other thing is I don't really love some of that thinking process just in general.\n\n(00:44:14):\nIt's like, \"Hey, let's say an experiment does show a temporary benefit. If an experiment shows a temporary benefit, but that benefit does not persist forever, does that mean the temporary benefit was never worth it? Or does that just mean the temporary benefit was an opportunity to reach another level you just didn't capitalize on?\" I don't think there's a perfect answer, is what I'm trying to say. I don't think that the fact that a benefit doesn't last forever means that you failed. But I agree with you that not trying to understand, well, what has the net benefit been, what has the net lift been is also really important too. That's why growth is so hard. Growth is part of product is so especially hard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:49):\nMarketers, I know that you love TLDRs, so let me get right to the point.

Yeah, it makes me feel like an old person, but yes, it was a very long time ago.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:00):\nSlash maybe it's a new thing.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:46:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:03):\nIt's either a long time ago or it's just recently figured out this is a thing that you could do in a B2B is focus on growth.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:46:11):\nYeah, it is. So that was around about 2012, and at that time growth hacking was a thing. People don't really use that term anymore, but in B2C it was a very big deal because people could see Facebook doing their 10 friends in seven days and they could see this kind of thing that was working for people. And they're like, \"Man, that's amazing.\" And at Atlassian we set out to go, \"Okay, well, do those techniques work in B2B?\" And also, it's kind of obvious now that a lot of them do and that it's worth doing. But at the time it wasn't that obvious because for a lot of B2B companies, I mean, you summarized it earlier, Lenny, distribution covers all faults. Almost all ills can be filled in by really great distribution.\n\n(00:46:52):\nIf you have a really good marketing, a really good ground game, and you're kind of jamming your product into the channel, you're jamming your product in front of people and you're papering over the ugly parts with customer success people and services and consulting and whatever, that people will buy almost any software or you can certainly be successful with a lot of different software. But back in 2012, it wasn't clear of like, okay, which instead you went at this differently and you've heard them in software that sell itself, is the juice worth the squeeze? And now I would say that it's pretty clear that the juice is worth the squeeze to the point that lots of think about this all the time, but it was a bit of an interesting time at that time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):\nAnd that was essentially the beginnings of product-led growth. Is that a simple way to think about it?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:47:38):\nBasically it's now called PLG, but yeah, at that time we didn't even know what to call it exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:42):\nJust growth. So based on that experience, a lot of B2B companies now have growth teams through investing in growth, what makes a great growth team in B2B? Any pitfalls you often find folks fall into that you think they should try to avoid?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:47:57):\nUltimately, a lot of these types of endeavors are a matter of balance. So what I mean by that is growth teams tend to go through a set of phases. Their first phase is proving their value at all. So call that the gold rush phase. This thing's probably not worth even doing. Why are we doing this, merry band of people out there trying to prove that there's some growth effect somewhere? So that's the proof of phase. And so the advantage of that phase is life's good because there's usually a lot of growths to be found because nobody's gone looking before, so life's good. But it's pretty random because you're just literally searching across a random search phase going, \"Have we tried X? Have we tried Y? Have we tried Z?\" Then once you get that model going, then it starts to be, \"Okay, how do we scale this thing? Is this just a flash in the pan? Do we just find a little bit of low hanging fruit and there's nothing else here, there? Is this just a project we should have done rather than an ongoing thing?\"\n\n(00:48:52):\nSo you have to make it a system. You have to prove that it can be repeated, and then you have to scale it. It has to become a thing. It has to become part of your DNA. You have to be taking a PLG lens to everything you do, all the way from paid acquisition to activation, retention, engagement, cross product expansion, upsells, I mean, you name it, all the different ways you can grow a product by revenue or engagement. There's many different ways to go about that. And so you end up having to scale out and be able to do all of those different things. And then you have to figure out how you fit in with the rest of the organization because there's other people who build products all day every day.\n\n(00:49:27):\nThere's other people who sell that product all day, all day. There's other people who market that product all day, all day. And so growth organizations are in this interesting space, they're in between everybody else. They're in everybody else's sandpit in a little bit, in a little way, and they're kind of at the edge of everybody's full-time job and they are very valuable, but they can be complicated because of all those relationships, and because of the way they sit amongst all of the other parts of the organization. So many organizations fail because they don't really find much the wins or when they do find wins, it just seems totally random. Or they do find a lot of wins, but they all can't understand them because they seem like they're just a random walk through a bunch of potential opportunities. There's many different ways to fail to fit as you go through your growth phase from trying the ideas to success, to scaling, to operationalizing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:18):\nOne of the biggest memes along these lines is a lot of companies claim there's like just PLG rarely ever works. You always, either you try it and it just doesn't work or it eventually just peters out, I guess. Any thoughts on just what are signs that your product has a chance to work, peel product-led growth versus just go straight to sales immediately and don't even worry about this?\n\nShaun Clowes (00:50:44):\nFirst let's examine the counterfactual, right? So let's start with the opposite of your question and say, \"Hey, how would the world be sadder if we all just gave up on PLG?\" We just said, \"Hey, there's no point in doing it in B2B SaaS.\" The problem is that there is not a natural force that pulls companies towards thinking about the end user's enjoyment and success early in their journey. There is no natural force, there's no natural kind of a link force. Why is that? I mean, 101, the buyer is the most important person. The economic bar is the most economic person. Their needs are the number one thing. They're usually the person driving the RFP. They're usually the person dealing with the sales organization. So the needs of the person who you hear are usually all feature-driven and they're not from the end users.\n\n(00:51:34):\nAnd so you're kind of sowing a seed of your own demise if you don't think about that end user. But it's one thing to say that you should think about the end user, it's a whole other thing to have a system by which you do that because people pay lip service to all sorts of things. But I'm sure you've heard this one before, but in economics, people only do what their incentives told them to do. Broadly speaking, that is what they do, that is what happens. You get what you set out to measure. You get what you give people incentives to do. If there is nobody in the organization whose true incentive is to measure their end user success, their enjoyment, their happiness, their retention, their engagement early on, it will not happen. Or at best it will be a hobby. And so then by extension, if I start from there, then I say, \"Okay, let's say it doesn't exist, PLG doesn't exist and therefore it's a hobby and therefore there will be a bunch of hobby people who care about this.\"\n\n(00:52:23):\nThen you ask yourself, \"Okay, will that mean that there will be many products for which those experiences really suck? And does that mean that that will be an opportunity for competitors of those products to be better at that? And is that a differentiated competitive advantage?\" Yeah, I'd say it is. I'd say it is. And so I just work my way backwards and I go, \"Okay, you can say that your PLG investment might be too high.\" You could be like, \"Well, if I invest more, I won't get any more juice. I can't spend my life just experimenting in the onboarding. That's not the only thing that matters.\" And that's very, very true, but it's very hard to argue it should be turned to zero.\n\n(00:52:59):\nAnd so to me, therefore it's about the balance. It's about, \"Okay, how does PLG fit with the other different ways that I grow in my business?\" At Confluent, for example, we have a PLG function. We do grow with self-serve signups. People who sign up, literally their credit card, lots of them sign up and they're very successful, never speak to us. We also have an enterprise sales team that sells directly to very big companies, some of the biggest banks in the world, the people you would definitely know of. I don't think it has to be one or the other. I think that it's about a balance. It's about getting the motions to work and for really sophisticated companies, the people who really nail this, it's about making both motions work together. If you can get a PLG motion work to feed your sales team and a sales team motion work to feed your PLG funnel when the sales leads aren't ready yet and you can get those motions into playing with each other, you can make a lot of money.\n\n(00:53:52):\nIt can be an extremely successful way to go to build a very resilient business. Why? Because you get a lot of customers and you get a lot of revenue. You can't be that successful as a company if you have a lot of revenue, but a small number of customers because you're captive, everyone knows that. You can't be that successful as a company if you have a lot of customers, but not enough revenue because you shouldn't have enough money to sustain operations. So the magic is in having both, a very large number of customers and a very large amount of revenue, it's very hard to knock over a company like that. If I look back on my time at Atlassian, and I think that they shared their most recent numbers, I can't remember what it was, but it was in the public data or whatever, something 80,000 or 100,000 customers, something like that.\n\n(00:54:30):\nThat's a lot of customers. That's a lot of customers. Let's say you're going up against Jira and you're like, \"Yeah, man, I'm going to pick off 1,000 customers from Atlassian.\" That's a lot, right? That's a lot. Obviously 1,000 customers is a lot. You only have 19, sorry, it's going to be 89,000 to go or 79,000 to go, or however many it is to go. I can't remember their exact number of customers, but it's very hard to assail a company which has a very large number of customers and a very large amount of revenue. And so that's why I think that PLG as a mechanism is incredibly important for almost any type of company, if you can make the motion work. Obviously there are companies for whom the motion just isn't relevant, but for those where it does matter, it seems like the juice is worth the squeeze.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:18):\nThat was an awesome answer. I looked up last year and they have 300,000 customers.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:55:23):\nOh man, I'm so far off. When I left it must have been 80,000 customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:28):\nThey've done good work since then. Also, you're talking about incentives and how the power of incentives. Charlie Munger has this great quote I looked up just to make sure I get it right. \"Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome.\"\n\nShaun Clowes (00:55:40):\nYeah, exactly right. I've seen cases where a sales team was people trying to get a sales team to do a PLG motion, and you can beat them over the head as much as you like, you can get into a meeting and tell them that you really, really want them to do this, but at the end of the day, they're not going to do it. And the same is true for every other kind of function. It's just the nature of things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:02):\nI have some newsletter posts around the stuff of folks want to dig deeper. Also, Elena Verna had an awesome podcast episode talking about product-led sales and kind of the combination of these two things that we'll point to.. Just a whole other topic we can go deep, deep on, but we're not going to do that in this episode. Maybe just one more question. So you mentioned all the companies you worked at, so you've been at Salesforce, chief product officer, MuleSoft, specifically within Salesforce, Metromile, Atlassian, Confluent now, a lot of really interesting and different roles. How do you choose where to go work and how do you choose which opportunities to take? I imagine you have many options.\n\nShaun Clowes (00:56:42):\nI have to think of my career. So in hindsight, looking at it this way, Lenny, so I don't know if forward-looking was obvious to me this way. But looking back, my career has been a little bit like a bingo card. I've always been looking to fill in boxes I didn't have filled because I felt like that would make me a better professional. It's like if I didn't know anything about that specific type of sales model or that type of marketing or that type of product management or that type of product or that layer in the stack or that kind of thing is like, well, if I learn about that thing, I will become more versatile. So actually two things, it's fun, it's fun to learn something new. It's fun to prove to yourself that you can do those new things and then it makes you more versatile because it means that any given problem you go up against, you've seen something that pattern matches to it.\n\n(00:57:29):\nIt kind of feels like you end up bringing a gun to a knife fight in a way because every problem you look at, you're like, \"Oh, I have seen this from the other side. I've seen this from some other angle, and so I know that this is likely to work and this is unlikely to work.\" And so when I joined early on in my career, I was working for a big enterprise software company, sorry, small enterprise software company that sold to the Fortune 100. When I joined Atlassian, and like I shared with you, we had no sales force at all actually at all. Literally nobody to sell the software. It sold itself or it didn't get sold at all. And we grew to have 80,000 customers. It was just pure product. They had growth and just an incredible company. Then it was at Metromile, which was a consumer company that got acquired, made an insurance product for end consumers.\n\n(00:58:13):\nSo they got nothing to do with technology products, like literally a complicated Internet of things device you installed in your car, but ultimately it's an insurance product that you'd sell to grandmothers in Florida as much as you would ever millennials. And then at MuleSoft to totally back end software that's used by IT organizations and a consulate infrastructure that's used by developers everywhere to build really interesting data-driven applications, data powered applications to do all sorts of things in real-time. And you look at across all that and you go, \"It's all a bit random.\" But I didn't see it that way because I learned, I actually was in sales for a bit, so I ran a pre-sales engineering group, went around the world selling software. So when I joined Atlassian, I wanted to kind of understand what it was to sell software at massive scale with no sales team, can it even be done?\n\n(00:59:01):\nAnd so I learned a lot in my time at Atlassian. When I went to Metromile, I'm like, \"Well, I've never built a consumer product before.\" I can say that I've actually built a product that's touched many millions of people because Jira has, so I felt pretty good about that, but I'd never built one that I could say, \"Yep, a consumer, your average consumer can use this thing. It's so simple. Even my grandma can use it.\" I'd never built a product like that. So I got that experience at Metromile, which is really fun. I'd never worked inside an organization as big as Salesforce or an organization with as good a sales motion. You talked about distribution earlier. Salesforce is an absolutely insane distribution machine, just an incredible company with just an amazing distribution network and a fantastic marketing approach that it's like a PhD in marketing.\n\n(00:59:44):\nWhen you spend your time at Salesforce, you're like, \"This company is just one of a kind. It's a one of kind, and it's so outlandishly good at one specific thing.\" And so looking back, all of these jobs have been, when I say bingo card, I've just got an outlandish education in these areas that are not obvious at all. And once you've seen them, they're like superpowers. They're superpowers to be able to bring that same experience to bear on things. And so one thing that I really I'm trying to figure out is why often people don't do that. And oftentimes people stay in a very specific domain. They prefer to stay in a domain or they prefer to stay in a specific kind of type of company or a role that works in a certain way, like companies that have the same operating model or they plan the same way or they try to stay with things that are pretty similar. But it seems obvious that the most likely way to really grow is the opposite.\n\n(01:00:41):\nIt's to constantly be choosing things that are either outside that, not totally outside the lines. Don't jump out of a plane if you've never parachuted before. Obviously you want them to be in some way and adjacency, that you want them to have something in common with what you know, but you want them to stretch you and change you. I had a really transformative experience many, many years ago when I was at Atlassian and a guy called Tom Kennedy, he was our general counsel, so chief legal officer basically, and a lifelong lawyer, very smart guy. I liked him very, very much. But just a lawyer. Just a lawyer, corporate lawyer, corporate counsel, I'm sure you know what they're like. And really great guy. And I remember, so mostly in our meetings he didn't talk that much except about legal things. But I remember in one meeting we were having this vigorous debate about a product strategy question about what we should do. Should we go left or should we go right?\n\n(01:01:39):\nAnd as usual, he's there and he's mostly just staying silent. And then eventually the conversation's been going on for 15 minutes and he is like, \"Hey, everybody, a year ago we talked about X, Y and Z,\" and he proceeds to lay out our product strategy at that time, and he's like, \"Just recently we said the following things, and that was a product strategy, whatever. Now you are saying this. Isn't it obvious that isn't this? What you guys are saying is not congruent with that, and if you really meant what you said back then we should be doing X.\" And again, the room went silent, everybody kind of turned to him, kind of nodded, and then everyone went, \"Yeah, okay, I guess we probably should be doing it differently.\" And so the meeting stopped when the GCE randomly mentioned that he deeply understood our product strategy and he knew enough to be able to contribute in that way.\n\n(01:02:24):\nAnd so the life-changing part for me about that was just this realization that if I'm going to be a really great professional, the type of professional I want to be is that type of person. The type of person who can contribute to the whole company in all sorts of ways, doesn't spend all of their time in everybody else's business, but understands the business and has the mental horsepower and the experience to be dangerous in all sorts of, and I mean, that in a compliment way. I don't mean that in a negative way, but to be dangerous in all sorts of situations. I think that when you have leaders like that behind you and with you, then you're just unstoppable. You're an unstoppable force in business when you have that motion happening.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:06):\nWow, that was an awesome story and an awesome perspective. It's similar to the advice I always give PMs of people always wondering, \"Should I go deep on a specific subject? Should I just try different things?\" And I find just variety, especially earlier in your career is really powerful, not just to help you discover the thing you like, but also to your point, just using insights from all these different parts of the product and internal tools and trust and safety and platform and consumer product side and growth and just core stuff. The more of that you have, the stronger you get. And I feel like another benefit of your approach is if you work at just B2B SaaS companies, if you have too many of that on your resume, it's very hard to get hired a consumer company. And so just having it creates a huge optionality for you if you do, which you did.\n\nShaun Clowes (01:03:57):\nYeah, it's interesting because people used to talk about people who are T-shaped or whatever, and I've never really loved the analogy because it's more like people are scribble shaped. I mean, there's the really best people you've worked with, they're more like scribbles than they are T-shaped because of course you want to be horizontally capable, so you want to be broad and you do want to be deep, but you actually want to be deep in way more than one thing. Now obviously when I say deep, I don't mean I'm not able to do the job of our finance function all day every day, but I'm 100% good enough to go three clicks below the simple financial analysis. I can go reasonably deep in our financials because I want to and because it's partly it matters. It's important to be able to do that. And so maybe a different way to think about that bingo card is I've rarely regretted going deep in something that isn't quite my job.\n\n(01:04:51):\nI've rarely regretted it. The worst case scenario is I've learned something new that I will never use, which I guess at least that made my brain slightly more agile. I don't know, there must be some potential benefit of that. But the very best case scenario is that when I least suspect it at some point in the future it will turn out to be the thing that matters. It will be the tool that I need, but I'm facing some important problem and I will be like, \"Oh my god, this was worth every cent.\" And so if you think about it on an ROI basis, doing things that aren't in your wheelhouse, that aren't the things directly in front of you, the ROI can really be outlandish. It can be off the charts great, but I guess it's speculative. Because you don't know you're going to need it tomorrow. You don't know if it's going to be something that's going to be a regular tool you use.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):\nWhat's interesting is the bingo card is the analogy. Is there a bingo moment at the end of this? Is there retirement?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:05:41):\nOh, you mean you've got everything. You've got the collectible Pokemon?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:45):\nYeah, you collect them all.\n\nShaun Clowes (01:05:46):\nYeah, I was working with somebody at Salesforce and he'd been there a long time, very, very, very successful person. Honestly didn't need to work anymore. And he said something that I found really useful. He's like, \"Well, now I'm at the point of my life where I want to work at the intersection of things that I am good at and things that will be valuable to the company to do.\" So basically it feels like the reward of completing your Bingo card is actually to just get to spend more time doing things that are leverage, that you enjoy and that are high leverage. And so that seems like a good outcome to me. I don't think most people are going to work and hopefully have some sort of great financial outcome and then go, \"Well, that's it. I'm picking up stumps, I'm retiring.\" I think for most people, achieving some sort of financial outcome or some sort of independence or whatever is really just another stage. At that point it will be, \"Okay, well now what do I do? What do I do with my life?\"\n\n(01:06:49):\nAnd so that was why I said earlier that at the end of the day, product management is at times the worst job in the world and at times easily the best. And it's both and it can be both. And so it's hard for me to think about if I think about the things that are the intersection of what I'm good at and are valuable to the world, product management is a pretty fun one to do and it's different every day. So I think we're pretty privileged. For those of you who listen, I mean, obviously your podcast reaches a lot of product people. I think we're pretty privileged to be able to operate at that intersection, but it's not easy because you got to show value. It's a very complicated job to show value in and to demonstrate value to the world, and it's constantly being attacked, like you mentioned, but it's still amazing when it all goes right. When a product is very successful in the market, it's hard to describe the joy you get from that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:46):\nKind of along those lines to close out our conversation before a very exciting lightning round, I want to take us to failure corner. People listen to these podcast episodes and everyone's always just sharing all these wins, everything's always going great. The CPO of this, CPO of that, just moving on up and people will want to hear times when things didn't go right. Because those are stories people don't share as often. Can you share a story when something didn't go right, when you maybe had a failure in the course of your career? And if you learned something from that experience, what you learned.\n\nShaun Clowes (01:08:18):\nI mean, there's a lot of things that didn't go exactly to plan, Lenny. Very early on in my career, I was still a developer and I accidentally deleted one of the core systems of the company that I was working at. So that's going to go down in infamy, but luckily that one's far in the rear-view mirror. That-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:38):\nThat wasn't Atlassian?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:08:41):\nNo, that was far pre-Atlassian, but very bad. Yeah, the one I like to talk about, I wasn't directly responsible for it, but I feel responsible for it. I was at a company and we launched a product. That was one of those products that in hindsight should have been really obvious it was going to fail, but for some reason we were all blinded by the potential. It was a product that was about, it was basically to measure the environmental impact of your company and to help you reduce the environmental impact of your company by doing, think about it as a power management, building power management, managing the power drawer of computers, managing the power drawer of AC and all of that stuff. That was the vision basically. It's like a manage your environmental impact of your business. The idea was pretty cool at the time, and also it was the right time for that, and it's still a thing.\n\n(01:09:33):\nIt's still an area of active research and investment or whatever, but it was one of those things, talk about the wrong company, wrong place, wrong time, wrong distribution. We had literally no right to win, no right to play, just absolutely no business in hindsight being in that business. And I feel really bad because I, again, good idea, wrong company. And at the end of the day, we launched the product. We actually kept the product in market for two years, and the final straw was weird. The final straw was actually when a customer finally wanted to pay for it. It had been in market for two years, and we found ourselves with a customer who wanted to pay millions of dollars for it. They were ready to sign on the dotted line, and that was actually the moment we decided to kill the product because we were like, \"If this person signs this piece of paper, we are stuck with this forever. This one customer will be bound by contracts for however long or whatever.\"\n\n(01:10:29):\nSo we actually ended up killing it. At the moment after two years of failure when somebody wanted to pay his money for it. And I look back on that and I'm just like, \"Man, that was a really big...\" I feel really bad because I'm like, \"It should have been obvious. It was obvious and we should have been able to call a spade a spade and I guess speak truth to power.\" But instead it kind of got through to the keeper and turned out to be a real accidental drain on resources for years and just a big mistake.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:58):\nSo is the lesson there, just be real with yourself? I like that you have this forcing function of like, \"Okay, this is getting for real now.\" Is it like, \"I wish we had an earlier forcing function to force us to make a decision?\"\n\nShaun Clowes (01:11:11):\nYeah. I think if I could do it differently, I might not have necessarily been able to 100% change the decision, but I should have tried. I mean, it was pretty obvious after six months, this thing was a bit of a zombie product walking, and the least I could have done is said, \"This thing is dead.\" We could have called it dead way earlier, but instead we proceeded for another year and a half investing in it. And so that's the bit that makes me feel like real bummer about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:39):\nIt reminds me a recent episode with Raaz who is the CMO at Wiz, and she joined us the first PM and a few weeks into it with doing tons of calls with customers she's like, \"I think I need a quick... Because I don't really understand what we were building. I don't get it.\" And everyone's like, \"I don't either.\" And it just, yeah, the founders just had a vague idea what they're doing, but they didn't really have an idea. And that just sparked a, \"Okay, wait, no one actually does. Let's actually get more concrete.\" And it helped them pivot. And now, I don't know if you know about Wiz, but they ended up being the fastest growing startup in history.\n\nShaun Clowes (01:12:19):\nYes. Isn't that amazing, right? It doesn't mean it's permanently fatal, but asking that question and going through that reckoning turns out that came out stronger.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:29):\nScary, but it turns out it's for the best often. Before we get to very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to mention or leave listeners with maybe a last nugget, something that you think might be helpful before we wrap?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:12:41):\nMaybe a couple of different things that I think are sometimes well understood, but just repeating them I guess because they're very valuable to me. One is that if you let your calendar rule you, then nothing good will happen. I know people talk about that a lot, but it's surprisingly common in product management in particular that people end up ruled by their calendar. And so it's related to that whole look at spend 80% of your time thinking about things going on outside the business. Easy said, very hard to do, and if you don't do it, no one's going to do it for you. And so it is really hard to be successful unless you find a way to force that to happen. So to repeat that, also, somebody said this to me, I never looked up the quote, but apparently Colin Powell said that if you're making a decision with less than 30% of the available data, you're making a big mistake.\n\n(01:13:32):\nIf you're making a decision only after you have 70%, either the 70% or 77%, I can't remember the exact number, when you have 77% of all the available data, you have waited far too long. And I've always found that very insightful and it relates a little bit to what we're talking about about data earlier, but at the end of the day, we get paid in product management to make decisions, good decisions, paid to make good decisions that will deliver business benefit. And a decision with too little data is fatal. A decision that takes too long and collects too much data is also fatal. So everything, it's about trying to find the balance of all of these different things to try and deliver business advantage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:07):\nA great way to circle back to all the things we've been talking about. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:14:15):\nYes. Let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:17):\nLet's do it. What are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:14:23):\nYeah, they oldies but goodies, is probably going to be The Lean Startup that I still find actually really good. And the key lessons in there I still think are very applicable to a lot of people, particularly the cohort analysis bit, which for some reason I still don't see people do anywhere near enough cohort analysis. So there you go, that's my little tip. And then INSPIRED: How to build products that people love by Marty Kagan and the Silicon Valley product group. That's an oldie but a goodie. I think it's got a lot of the key lessons of product management in it, even though it's been around for a long time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:53):\nThose are some classics. Very cool. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:14:58):\nI'm watching a program. I don't get to watch very much TV, mostly at night. I like to watch things that are extremely light, that just don't at all inspire any element of stress and that are very short. So basically short and funny is basically my thing. And there's a new program on Netflix, I think it's called Detroiters.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):\nOh, I've been watching that.\n\nShaun Clowes (01:15:20):\nYeah, it's really funny. I really like that. It's so ridiculous, but very funny. So I like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):\nThe main guy, he's so funny. I forget his name. Tim Sweeney or something like that. Yeah, he's so good. Good one. I've been watching that, I'm loving it. It's very quirky. I think the New York Times quote on there is \"Very weird,\" the quote.\n\nShaun Clowes (01:15:38):\nIt's so weird. In the first episode I'm like, \"What is this show?\" It's not even clear what time it set in, and it's very weird. It's really cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:44):\nYes. Well, good way to describe it. Next question, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:15:50):\nYeah, this one, some of your listeners might be using it, but Glean, it's a pretty well-known startup now. They recently raised a ton of money. We've been using Glean at Confluent for a long time and it's just amazing. It's just amazing. I can't describe how good it is. And I don't say this lightly because I think search, like business search is probably one of the hardest problems in computing. Actually getting it right is one of the hardest problems in computing. Amazing. It's not often I use a product and I'm like, \"This thing is 10 times better than anything that's come before it.\" It's one of those for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:25):\nWhat's the simplest way to understand what it does for you?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:16:28):\nIt searches all of our organization's knowledge. So the thing you were just saying before, you're like, \"What does AST mean?\" If I had that in a meeting, I just open my new tab, it'll automatically take over my new tab or just like, \"What does AST mean?\" And it will summarize back to me what AST means and it'll give me a link to all the documents inside our company that just grab what AST means and then it will tell me who the expert in AST at our company is. It's like having a second brain. It's an insanely cool organization searching.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:59):\nGreat tip. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you come back to share with folks, find useful and work during life?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:17:07):\nI think about this one a lot. When I started off in my career, I was an engineer's engineer. I used to very much about technical correctness and what computers were capable of, and technical righteousness, the right answer rather than there is only one right answer and whatever. It's a long-winded way of saying that I often think about this phrase, which is people don't care what you know until they know that you care. And so I've realized that really being able to influence people, it doesn't matter about whether or not you're right or whether or not you're wrong. And at the end of the day, it's first about trust and about relationships and caring about what each other's outcomes are, what their incentives are, and all good things sit on top of that. Once you have those kind of foundations, then you can build really good partnerships and that's where good progress comes from.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:55):\nWow, that is so good. It connects with Radical Candor, similar in theory of just caring. People need to feel like you care deeply about them before they take your advice. And it also connects with this parenting book I'm reading called Listen, that a previous guest recommended, which is all about how your kids have problems when they feel like your connection to them is weak. And so the solution is to build a stronger connection for them to know that you cared deeply about them. So this is really, connected so much of what I've been reading.\n\nShaun Clowes (01:18:26):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:26):\nGreat one. Final question. You were born in Sydney, folks can maybe guess by your accent. If someone were to visit Sydney, any tips, anything you think they should check out, favorite thing in Sydney?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:18:38):\nYeah, Sydney is a really beautiful city and it's kind of famous for its beaches and it's basically a metropolitan city. People probably be very surprised when you visit it. It's a very big city, very metropolitan, a little bit like New York, but New York with really beautiful beaches, if you want to think about it that way, it's kind of crazy. But there's actually a ton of really cool nature and beautiful things all around Sydney. And so if you want to do something like off the beaten path, you can actually go to, there's an area called the Blue Mountains, which is like an hour and a half drive from Sydney, and you can abseil down a waterfall, which is, well actually firstly you go canyoning through a canyon full of water, and then you abseil off a waterfall at the end. And if you're looking for just a really beautiful, fun kind of adventure like thing, an hour and a bit away from a massive metropolitan city, that's my sort of happy place. Really beautiful outdoors stuff while also next to a beautiful city.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:31):\nAnd you said you sail, what sort of sail off a waterfall?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:19:34):\nAbseil. You might think of it as rappelling. Rappelling, I think. Yeah, lowering yourself down on a rope or...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):\nGot it. Because when I hear sail, I'm thinking a boat just jumps through over the waterfall.\n\nShaun Clowes (01:19:47):\nOh, no, abseiling which is also, I think in the States you guys call it rappelling.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:51):\nRappelling, yeah. Wow. Very cool. Shaun, you're awesome. This was extremely cool. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? Also point folks to your Reforge courses that you created. And final question, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nShaun Clowes (01:20:07):\nSure. Yeah, so my Reforge courses, you can check them all out at reforge.com, as you mentioned, the retention, engagement course and the data for product managers course, so love to see folks get some value from that. Lots of people have been through those courses already and I really get a lot of value from it because like I said, one of my goals is to help all of us be better product people. I think our leverage could be massive. Where you can get in touch with me, obviously on LinkedIn, but also ShaunMClowes on X, if you want to get in touch. And in terms of being useful to me, I mean, broadly speaking, I'm always open to new ideas. If people have ideas about how to do better B2B, PLG, better B2B product-led sales, for example, better ways of going about distribution and product-led sales and product-led growth inside enterprise companies, hey, I'm open to learn myself. We're all in one big journey learning how to do this better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:01):\nSo true. Shaun, thank you so much for being here.\n\nShaun Clowes (01:21:05):\nAwesome, thank you very much, Lenny. It was great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:07):\nBye, everyone.
