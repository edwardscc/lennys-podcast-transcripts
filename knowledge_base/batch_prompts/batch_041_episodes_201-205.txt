If the goal is more lines of code, I can prompt something to write the longest piece of code ever. It's just too easy to gain that system.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nHow do I know if my eng team is moving fast enough, if they can move faster, if they're just not performing as well as they can?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:00:18):\nMost teams can move faster. But faster for what? We can ship trash faster every single day. We need strategy and really smart decisions to know what to ship.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):\nOne of the biggest issues we're going to probably have with AI is learning how much to trust code that it generates.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:00:32):\nWe can't just put in a command and guess something back and accept it. We really need to evaluate it. Are we seeing hallucinations? What's the reliability? Does it meet the style that we would typically write?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):\nSo much of the time is now going to be spent reviewing code versus writing code.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:00:45):\nThere's some real opportunity there to not just rethink workflows, but rethink how we structure our days and how we structure our work. Now, we can also make a 45-minute work block useful because getting into the flow is actually kind of handed off, at least, in part to the machine or the machine can help us get back into the flow by, reminding us of context and generating diagrams of the system.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):\nWhat's just one thing that you think an eng team, a product team can do this week, next week to get more done?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:01:09):\nHonestly, I think the best thing you can do-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):\nToday, my guest is Nicole Forsgren. With so much talk about how AI is increasing developer productivity, more and more people are asking, \"How do we measure this productivity gain? And are these AI tools actually helping us or hurting how our developers work?\" Nicole has been at the forefront of this space longer than anyone. She created the most used frameworks for measuring developer experience called DORA and SPACE. She wrote the most important book in the space called Accelerate and is about to publish her newest book called Frictionless, which gives you a guide to helping your team move faster and do more in this emerging AI world. Her core thesis is that AI indeed accelerates coding. But developers aren't speeding up as much as you think because they still have to deal with broken builds and unreliable tools and processes, and a bunch of new bottlenecks that are emerging.\n\n(00:02:01):\nIn our conversation, we chat about her current, best and very specific advice for how to measure productivity gains from AI, signs that your team could be moving faster, what companies get wrong when trying to measure engineering productivity, how AI tools are both helping and hurting engineers, including getting into flow states, her seven-step process for setting up a developer experience team at your company, how to get buy-in and measure the impact of a team like this and a ton more.

It's so good to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:19):\nIt's so good to have you back. I was just watching our first episode, which we did two and a half years ago. I was watching it, and I was both shocked and not shocked that we barely talked about AI. The episode was called How to Measure and Improve Developer Productivity, and we got to AI barely like an hour in and we're just like, \"Hmm, I wonder what's going to happen with AI and productivity.\" Does that just blow your mind?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:05:41):\nYeah. Because it was just hitting the scene, it was the topic of so much conversation, and at the same time, so many things don't change. So many things are still important, so many things are the same. Yeah. It's also a little wild that it's been two and a half. Where does time go? Time is a social construct?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:01):\nYeah. Most of our conversation was just questions like, \"Well, how might this impact people? How will we change the way we build product?\" It was barely a thing back then. Now, it's the only thing that I imagine people want to talk about when they talk about engineering productivity. That's where we're going to be spending a lot of our time focusing on today. The reason I'm excited about this conversation, it feels like there's been so much money poured into AI tools increasing productivity. The fastest growing companies in the world are these engineering AI tools. And now, more and more people are just asking this question of just, \"What gains are we getting out of this? How much is this actually helping us be more productive? How do we become more productive?\"\n\n(00:06:39):\nYou've been at the center of this world for longer than anyone. You've invented so many of the frameworks that people rely on now. So I'm really excited to have you back to talk about this stuff. I want to start with just this term DevEx, it's something that comes up a lot in this whole space, and we're going to hear this term a bunch in this conversation. Can you just explain what is DevEx, this term DevEx?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:07:00):\nDevEx is developer experience. And when we think about developer experience, we're really talking about what it's like to build software, day to day, for a developer. So the friction that they face, the workflows that they have to go through, any support that they have. It's important because when DevEx is poor, everything else just isn't going to help. The best processes, the best tools, the best... whatever magic you have, if the DevEx is bad, everything kind of takes-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:34):\nWithin DevEx is productivity, and I think the key insight that you had and other folks in the space of that is not just productivity, but there's also engineering happiness. We're going to get into a lot of these parts, but just maybe speak to... there's productivity and there's broader components to engineers being successful at a company.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:07:51):\nYeah. I love that point because productivity, first of all, is hard to define anyway. But if you're just looking at output, you can get there in a lot of different ways. But if you're getting there in ways that are high toil or high friction, then at some point, a developer is going to burn out. Or if it's super high cognitive load, if it's hard to even think about what you're doing because concentrating on the mechanics of... the plumbing of something, then you don't have the brain space left to come up with really innovative solutions and questions. So I love that it's kind of this self-reinforcing loop in terms of, \"You do more work, you do better work.\" And it's better for people, it's better for the systems, it's better for our customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:34):\nI was going to get to this later, but I want to actually get to this right now, this idea of flow state for engineers. I was an engineer, actually, early in my career. I went to a school for computer science. I was an engineer for 10 years. The best part of the job for me was just this flow state you enter when you're coding and building, and just things feel like so fun. It feels like AI is making that harder in a lot of ways because there's all these agents you're working with now, there's all this code that's kind of being written for you. Talk about just the importance of flow state to a developer, happiness, developer productivity, and just what you've seen AI impacting. How you've seen AI impacting that?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:09:07):\nWell, there are lots of different ways to talk about DevEx. One way to talk about it is kind of three key things that have components that are important of themselves, and they also kind of reinforce each other. Flow state is one of them, cognitive load is another, and then feedback loops are another. I think when you touch on this... Your question about flow state is a really good one, and I'll admit we're just a few years into this. We're still figuring out what the best flow state and cognitive requirements are for people in this because, to your point, sometimes we're getting interrupted all the time. You don't just get in the flow and lock down, and write a whole bunch of code and do the typing of a whole bunch of code as much anymore. Instead, you're kind of creating a prompt, getting some code back and reviewing the code, trying to integrate what's happening in the system, and that can really interrupt.\n\n(00:10:02):\nAt the same time though, it can contribute to flow if... I've seen some senior engineers pull together some tool chains that are really incredible, where they figured out how to keep the flow going. The fast feedback loops really, really work well for them. They can kind of assign out different pieces to agents. It helps them keep in the flow in terms of... Instead of details and line-by-line writing, they're in the flow in terms of, \"What's my goal? What are the pieces that I need to get there? How quickly can I get there? So then, I can step back and kind of evaluate everything, and then dive back in and fix some pieces.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):\nIs there anything more you could say about this engineer that figured out this really cool workflow, about just what that looks like?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:10:39):\nI've spoken with a handful of them, and I've kind of watched them work. I haven't built it myself yet. It's on my list. They've been able to set up this really incredible workspace and workflow where... Right now, a lot of us play around with tools and... We'll put in a prompt and we'll get a few lines back or maybe we'll put in a prompt and we'll get whole programs back. Well, what they can do is they can... Many times I'll see them say, to help prime it, \"This is what I want to build. It needs to have these basic architectural components. It needs to have this kind of a stack. It needs to follow this general workflow. Help me think that through,\" and it'll kind of design it for it. And then for each piece, it'll assign an agent to go work on each pace in parallel, and then it'll say and upfront, \"These need to be able to work together, make sure it's architected correctly. Make sure we use appropriate APIs and conventions.\"\n\n(00:11:30):\nThen at the end, they can let it run for a few minutes. They can think through something else that's interesting or they anticipate is going to be hairy, and they come back to something that's probably a little better than vibe coded. Because they were so systematic about it upfront, they're much closer to something that looks like production code.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:51):\nSo what I'm hearing is spending a little time upfront planning, what all these AI engineers are doing, versus just powering through and just figuring out as you go.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:12:02):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:02):\nOkay, cool. Let me get to this quite a core question that I think on is a lot of people's minds. A lot of companies are trying to measure productivity for their teams, \"Is this improving our productivity? Is this hurting our productivity?\" So let me just start with this question, how are people doing this wrong currently when they try to measure their productivity gains with AI?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:12:23):\nI'll say most productivity metrics are a lie. It's really tricky because, historically... Now, look, lines of code has always been a bad metric, but many folks still use lines of code-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:37):\n[inaudible 00:12:37].\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:12:37):\n... yeah, as some proxy as some proxy for output or productivity or complexity or something. Well, now, for many of the systems, that they would sometimes whisper and not super talk about that uses lines of code, it's just blown out of the water because, \"What do you mean by lines of code?\" If the goal is more lines of code, I can prompt something to write the longest piece of code ever and add tons of comments. We know that agents and LLMs tend to be very verbose by definition, and so it's just too easy to gain that system and then introduce complexity and technical debt into all of the work that you're doing. I will say there are some things that we can kind of watch and pay attention to because... So lines of code as a productivity metric isn't great, it's pretty bad. But now, it's kind of more relevant if we can tease out which code came from people and which code came from AI because now we can answer downstream questions.\n\n(00:13:40):\n\"What is the code survivability rate? What is the quality of our code? Is our code being fed back into trained systems? And for that code that's retraining systems later, especially if we're doing fine-tuning and local tuning, how much of that is machine generated? What types of loops is that creating, and what types of patterns or biases might it be inadvertently introducing?\" On the one hand, it's not good as a productivity metric, but it can be useful. I'll even say the same for DORA. I have done DORA metrics, their speed metrics, their stability metrics. If that's all you're looking at, it's not going to be sufficient anymore because AI has now changed the way we think about feedback loops. They need to be much faster. Now, what DORA's meant for, kind of assessing the pipeline overall in terms of speed and stability. Still, that works. But we can't just blindly apply the existing metrics we've used before because we'll miss super important phenomenon and changes in the way people work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:38):\nInteresting. You invented DORA, that was kind of the main framework people used for a long time to measure productivity. And then there's SPACE, there's Core 4, there's probably others. So what I'm hearing here is all these are kind of out of date now, where AI is contributing large portions of code.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:14:55):\nI will say if it is a prescriptive metric, it needs to be used only in the way it was prescribed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:00):\nSo\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:15:01):\nDORA 4, there are four key metrics. There's two speed metrics, deployment frequency and lead time. So code commit to code deploy. There's stability metrics, MTTR and change fail rate. If those are used to assess the speed of the pipeline and the general performance of the pipeline, that's great. If you're trying to use those to understand... Because implied in that is feedback loops, right, because you used to kind of get feedback from customers. But we can't just use that blindly now when we're using AI, as an example, because we have feedback loops much earlier and not even just at the local build and test phase. We have feedback loops throughout, and even sometimes in the middle of some of the pipeline, that we really want to leverage in ways that weren't as useful before. I won't say they weren't possible, but we just didn't really focus there.\n\n(00:15:53):\nSo those are prescriptive metrics. When we think about SPACE, SPACE is a framework. It doesn't tell you what metric to use. So I'll say, sometimes people get real frustrated because I didn't tell them what to measure. But now, I think that's the power of it. We're actually seeing that SPACE applies fairly well in these new emerging contexts like AI because we still want to look at... SPACE is an acronym. We still want to look at satisfaction. We still want to look at performance, what's the outcome. We still want to look at activity. Yes, in some ways, lines of code and number of PRs can be useful for something, or number of alerts or number of things, activities or counts. Seize communication and collaboration, this is also super important and useful because it's how our systems communicate with each other, and also how our people do. \"What proportion of work is being offloaded to a chat bot versus talking to a senior engineer on the team?\" More isn't always better and less isn't always better, it depends.\n\n(00:16:50):\nAnd then efficiency and flow, \"Can people get in the flow? How much time does it take to do things? What is the flow like through our system?\" Here, I would probably add a couple of dimensions. So chatting with some of the early authors to say trust. Not to say trust wasn't important before, but now it's very, very front of mind. Right? Before you build your code, if the compile comes back, you're fine. And that's the way it is. LLMs are non-deterministic. Right now, we can't just put in a command and guess something back and accept it. We really need to evaluate it, so, \"Are we seeing hallucinations? What's the reliability? Does it meet the style that we would typically write? And if it doesn't meet, is that fine?\" So it depends on... Prescriptive. You got to make sure you're using it fit for purpose. Right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:38):\nWe're going to get to your current thinking on the best way to do this stuff. You have a book coming out that explains how to do this well, so we're going to get to that. One thing I wanted to highlight in our last chat that we had, you highlighted that one of the biggest issues we're going to probably have with AI is trust, understanding and learning how much to trust the code that it generates, and also how much... you said this, two and a half years ago, that so much of the time is now going to be spent reviewing code versus writing code. That's exactly what I'm hearing.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:18:10):\nI think it'll be interesting to see how that impacts the way we structure work moving forward. We were talking about flow state and cognitive load. Now that our attention has to focus on things at certain times and it's broken up from how we used to do it, I think there's some real opportunity there to, not just rethink workflows, but rethink how we structure our days and how we structure our work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:31):\nCan you say more about that? Just what is that? What are you thinking will be happening? Where do you think things go? What are you seeing working?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:18:37):\nThis is purely speculative. But for example, Gloria Mark has done some really good work on attention and deep work, and humans can get about four hours of good deep work a day. That's about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:52):\nYeah,. I feel that.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:18:54):\nThat's kind of the upper limit-ish for the most part, and I'm sure people are going to be like, \"Well, I am superhuman and I can do-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):\nWhat if you take 20 grams of creatine?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:19:01):\nRight. What if we microdose?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:02):\nYeah, exact;y.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:19:06):\nYeah. So in the context of knowing we have about four hours of good deep work... I'm sure many of us have probably hit this, right? We have good periods. Maybe it's morning, maybe it's afternoon for folks. And then you hit a time where you're like, \"I'm going to clean up my inbox because that is all I can do right now. I can be functional, but I'm not going to come up with my best innovative, problem solving, authoring, code writing work.\" A lot of times, the way to do that and to get into it is to have these long chunks to get into flow and to get that deep work. Usually, I'm [inaudible 00:19:43] two hours-ish. An hour can be tricky because it could take time to get into that state. Okay. Well, when we think about what it used to be like, back in the old days, three years ago, three and a half years ago, we could block off four hours of time and we could probably get two or three hours of really good work done. Because we were just focused, right? There were no interruptions, minimal interruptions.\n\n(00:20:05):\nNow, the nature of writing code and systems itself is interrupt driven or full of interruptions, at least, because you start something and then it interjects. So how do we think about that? Does that mean that a four-hour word block is still useful? Probably. But does that mean that now we can also make a 45-minute work block useful? Because getting into the flow is actually kind of handed off, at least, in part to the machine or the machine can help us get back into the flow by reminding us of context and generating diagrams of the system and all the things. So I think that's a really, really interesting area that's just ripe for questions and opportunity. And please, folks, do this research and come back to me because... It might not make my list, but it's such a great question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:52):\nThat is so interesting. Essentially, every engineer is turning into an EM, engineering manager, coordinating all of these junior AI engineers. So your point is even if you have a 30-hour block, you can get deep into code, but you can unblock all these AI engineers that are running off doing tasks. Plus, your point is they remind you of just like, \"Here's where you left off. Okay. You can just jump into this code, maybe make some tweaks.\"\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:21:17):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:18):\nSo interesting. Let me zoom out a little bit and... Before we get into your framework for how to approach developer experience, the latest thinking you've got, beyond just obviously engineers doing more is great, what's your best pitch for why companies should really, really focus on developer experience?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:21:37):\nI hate to say return of investment, but the business value is... the opportunity here is huge. In general, we write software for fun and for hobbies, but we also have software because it meets a business need. It helps us with market share, it helps us attract and retain customers, it helps us do all of these things. And I think DevEx is important because it enables all of that software creation, it enables all of that problem solving. It enables the super rapid experimentation with customers that... Before, you'd need a while for a prototype and maybe a little bit longer to actually flight it through an A/B test on a production system. You can do it in hours, right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:21):\nMaybe the opposite end of the spectrum, getting very tactical, before we get into the larger framework, what's just one thing that you think an eng team, a product team can do this week, next week to help their developer experience maybe get more done?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:22:35):\nHonestly, I think the best thing you can do is go talk to people and listen. I love that the audience of this podcast is primarily PMs because they tend to be really good at this. And I would say start with listening and not with tools and automation. So many times companies are like, \"Well, I'm just going to build this tool,\" or, \"I'm going to build this thing.\" Often you build a thing that you yourself have had a challenge with or that is easy to do, easy to automate. And if you just go talk to people and ask the developers like, \"Think of yesterday, what did you do yesterday? Walk me through it. What were the points that were just delightful? What were the points that were really difficult? Where did you get frustrated? Where did you get slowed down? Where was there friction?\" If you go talk to a handful of people, a lot of times, you can surface a handful of things that are relatively low lift and still have impact or you can identify a process that's unnecessarily complex and slow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:36):\nSo the listening to, I hear, almost is you want to help your teams move faster and be happier eng teams. Your advice is just, \"Before you do anything, just go ask them what is bothering you.\"\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:23:46):\nGo ask them, yeah. And trust me, most developers are going to be more than happy to tell you what's broken and what's bad. I'll say, there was one company that I had worked with. I remember they had a process that was really difficult and it was on an old mainframe system, and they were going to have to replat the whole thing and so they never went to work on it or talk about it. Everyone hated it because it was this huge delay. I mean, all they had to do was change a process. Sometimes all you have to do is change a process. And they changed it so that instead of... I think someone had to print it out and walk it down three or four flights, and they get approval. And then someone else had to walk it back up, and so it was just that interim. They didn't replat anything. They didn't redesign anything major. They just sent an email.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:31):\nLet me push on that and... I'm curious just what are the most common things people do. If you're just starting on, \"Okay, we need to focus on engineering experience,\" what do you find are the most... two or three most common improvements companies need to make?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:24:45):\nI'll say, I'll kind of echo that process, there's almost always a process that can be improved and that can be improved without a lot of engineering lift or a lot of engineering headcount. Most large companies, in particular, have something that is several, several steps. It's the way it is because it's the way it is, but that's no longer the way it is. And even small companies sometimes is just a little too YOLO, and you don't know what it is and you're kind of chasing everyone around. So if you can create a very lightweight process, that can also be helpful. That can be one of the best places to start, especially if you have limited exposure to the whole rest of the org. Sometimes just a team process can help.\n\n(00:25:28):\nI will say from a business leader's standpoint, a lot of what you can do is provide structure and support for this organizational change. Communicate what you're doing, communicate what the priorities are, communicate why this is important, to celebrate wins. Because if folks try to do this, just like a one-off side fully-isolated project, it's really challenging to get some good momentum, to get people to care, and to get them stay involved. Because it feels like it's just another internal project that isn't going to matter or that isn't going to get celebrated, but it has these huge upside potential returns for the business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:10):\nIt's interesting, what I'm hearing here is nothing about tools or technologies. It's not like move to this cloud, it's not like install this new deployment system, it's processes and people and org and morale.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:26:24):\nYeah. Now, there will be technical pieces that are very important, especially now with AI, where we're rethinking how build and test systems work. We're rethinking feedback to users so that it's very, very customized in terms of what is shared and when it is shared. There are a lot of technical pieces that are involved, but that's not the only thing. It's necessary but not sufficient, and that doesn't have to be the place that you start.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):\nI have a hard question I want to ask you that I thought of as you were talking. I feel like this is the question that most founders and heads think about. And the question is just like, how do I know if my eng team is moving fast enough, if they can move faster, if they're just not performing as well as they can? What are just maybe smells, signs that tell you, \"Yeah, my team should be moving faster,\" versus, \"This is just the way it works. This is as fast as they can move\"?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:27:16):\nMost teams can move faster, right? Also, given what we know about cognitive load, not all speed gains are necessarily good. Or the upside is going to be kind of limited once you hit kind of a certain point, and most people are not even near that point. I don't know a single team, frankly. But how do you know? You know if you're always hearing about bills breaking, flaky tests, overly long processes, if you have to request a new system or if you need to provision a new environment, or if it's really, really hard to switch tasks or switch projects. So if someone has an opportunity to go work in another part of an org and they don't for reasons that are unclear, and not political, and anyone says anything about the system, that's usually a pretty good smell that there's friction somewhere.\n\n(00:28:20):\nBecause once you finally figure out your system and you're able to get work done, the switching costs can often be really, really high to go anywhere else. So sometimes people will do that. But I've worked with companies where switching orgs within the company, you had to basically pay the same tax as a new hire because the systems were so different and they were so full of friction, and it was so difficult to do so many things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):\nI love the first part of your answer especially, which is you can always move faster. I think every founder is going to love hearing that. To your point though, there's diminishing returns over time?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:28:58):\nYeah. And you don't know about the quality, right? So I think that's the other side is that you can always move faster, but faster for what? Are we making the right business decisions? And I think that's especially where PMs come in. We can ship trash faster every single day. We need strategy and really smart decisions to know what to ship, what to experiment with, what features we want to do in what order and what rollout. The strategy is the core piece, and then think about speeding that up. If we don't have the other pieces in place, I mean, garbage in, garbage out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:30):\nI want to follow that thread, but before I do that, just to mirror back what you shared. So signs that your team... There's a lot of low-hanging fruit to improve the productivity of your team as builds are always breaking. There's flaky tests are constantly incorrect, false positives. It's hard to context switch between different projects. You just hear people talking about the system, it's just really hard to work with. Is that roughly right?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:29:52):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):\nCool, okay. So going back to the point you just made, there's a sense that AI is making teams so much faster because it's writing all this code for them. You're going to have all these asynchronous agents, engineers working for you. It feels like a core part of your message is that's just a one part of engineering work and there's so much more, including figuring out what to build... an alignment internally. Maybe just speak to just... There is a lot of opportunity to improve engineering performance productivity, but there's so many other elements that are not improved through AI?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:30:22):\nYes. Or could be in the future, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):\nMm-hmm.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:30:26):\nI think there are a lot of ways that we can pull in AI tools to help us refine our strategy, refine our message, think about the experimentation methods or targets of experimentation, or think about our total addressable market, but we need to have that strategy and plan fairly well aligned or at least have two or three alternatives that you want to test. Because now, the engineering can go, or at least the prototyping especially, much, much faster. We can throw out prototypes. We can run any tests and experiments that are customer facing, assuming that we have the infrastructure in place, which allows us to learn and progress much faster before. In some places, it used to take months to get something through production to do A/B testing and get feedback. We can do this in a day or two, definitely under a week. But we want to make sure that we're building and testing the right things, \"Are we partnering with the right... Do we have the data that we need?\"\n\n(00:31:24):\nAnd I will say AI can actually be a pretty good partner there if you have a good conversation with it, and then also check with you experts, \"What type of data should I be looking at? What type of instrumentation do I need? What type of analysis can I do?\" Because then, you can also go to your data science team and say, \"I'm planning on doing this. I'd like to...\" Let's not just YOLO A/B tests because that can be... It's a shame to do a large test and end up disrupting users or disrupting customers, or breaking privacy or security protocols and also end up with data that's unusable because you just can't get the signal that you're looking for. But now, I'm also seeing people kind of accelerate that into a few days versus a few weeks. So they can start those key stakeholder discussions from a much more informed kind of filled out space.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:17):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast, it's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs, the documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all-in-one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy-to-organize tab.\n\n(00:33:04):\nLike I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day. And more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time. To try it for yourself, go to coda.io/lenny today and get six months free of the team plan for startups. That's C-O-D-A-dot-I-O-slash-Lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan, coda.io/lenny.\n\n(00:33:33):\nI love that you work with a bunch of different companies and a bunch of different types of businesses. I think very few people get to see inside a lot of different places. What kind of gains are you just seeing in terms of increased productivity with AI? How big of a gain have you seen?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:33:49):\nI'd say it's real, and I would also say we don't have great measures for it yet. We're still trying to figure out what to measure and what that looks like. One of the best is going to be velocity, all the way through the system, how quickly can you get a feature or a product or something through the system so that you can then experiment a test, either from idea to final end or even kind of a feature and a piece through the system so we can test. That's really good. Now, that's also hard to tie back directly to a particular AI tool in the hands of a particular developer. But there are some other things that we can look at and we can see, and that I've seen is, again, this kind of rapid prototyping.\n\n(00:34:36):\nI hate lines of code, but I'm going to use the lines of code. We do see... I know I worked with some folks who had kind of a whole set of companies they were looking at, and they found that AI was generating significantly more code for the people who were using it regularly. But then, they also found that for folks who were regular users of AI coding environments, AI ADEs, the tool kind of gave them more code. And then the engineers themselves, the increase was double what the coding agent had given them. So one, I'd say, probably it's kind of a secondary or knock on or just a smell is it can unblock you. It can speed up the work that you would already do. I know sometimes when I work, the first few minutes, it's hard for me to start. But once I get started, I'm there. So they're really good at unblocking and unlocking that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:32):\nSomething I've seen people on Twitter sharing is how good OpenAI Codex, especially, is at finding really gnarly bugs. And I think it was Karpathy that shared it. He was so stuck on a bug and, no AI tool could figure it out. And then the latest version of Codex spent an hour or something, looking into it, and found it for him.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:35:51):\nYeah. I'm hearing incredible things like that, right? Well, and even also writing unit tests and spinning up unit tests, and creating documentation and cleaning up documentation because I know now people are like, \"Oh. Well, we have agents. I don't need to read the docs because there's the code there.\" It turns out, agents rely on good data because it's all about how they've been trained or how they've been grounded. And better data gives you better outcomes, and some of that data includes documentation and comments. The better documentation and the better comments you have, the better performance you're going to get out of your AI tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:29):\nAnd AI can help you write that documentation. I've been working with Devin a little bit, and it's really good at that stuff.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:36:34):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:36):\nOkay. Let's talk about this framework, this book. So you're publishing a book called Frictionless, which sounds like a dream, \"How do you create a dev team that's frictionless?\" It's called Frictionless: 7 Steps to Remove Barriers, Unlock Value, and Outpace Your Competition in the Age of AI. There's a seven-step process to this. Walk us through this and maybe give us just context on this book, who it's meant for, what problem it solves, and then the seven steps.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:37:00):\nI will say, I also wrote this with Abi Noda who has just... of DX. He has incredible experience in the space. He's worked with hundreds of companies and so it was kind of nice bouncing ideas off of him. Also, thanks to all of the engineering leads and DevEx leads, and CTOs, and engineers that we talked to to make sure that our smells were right. So who is this book for-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:26):\nLet me take a tangent on Abi, and DX, since you mentioned him. This is super interesting, and I think it connects so directly with this conversation. Abi started this company called DX, which is such a great name for a company around developer experience. They just sold the company for a billion dollars to Atlassian. It's a very high multiple on their ARR. It, to me, shows exactly why this conversation is so valuable, just how much value companies are putting into improving developer experience. Atlassian would spend a billion dollars on this. It's an early stage-ish startup. It was doing really well and people loved it, but it was like early stage-ish, a billion dollars. And the idea is they have all these companies working using Jira and all their products. They're all trying to figure out how do we measure productivity. It's worth a lot of money to them. And I know you were an early advisor to them too, so-\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:37:26):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:15):\n... it just shows us how important this is.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:38:17):\nYeah. Well, I think it also shows us how much value you can get out of this. There's so much low-hanging fruit, there's so much unlocked potential, and it's hard to know where to start a lot of times even in... I've been at large companies that have a lot of expertise and a lot of really, really smart people. But if you haven't kind of been in this space and thinking about it this way, it's hard to know where to start or it's easy to make simple mistakes up front that mean you kind of need to start over later. So I guess it also brings us back to, \"Who is this book for?\" It's for anyone that cares about DevEx, so definitely technology leaders, anyone who's trying to kick off a DevEx program, or is working on a DevEx DevEx improvement program. I think it's particularly relevant for PMs because if you're PMing something that involves software building and creating software, improving DevEx will only help your team. And also, you have key skills and insights and instincts that are so important to DevEx that many times, I will say, I've seen engineering teams just miss.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):\nOkay. What's the framework? What are the steps? Where do people start?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:39:35):\nThe book goes through a seven-step process, and then also kind of provides some key kind of principles at the end. Step one is to start the journey. So assuming you're kicking off, you can start the journey. And this involves what we have already talked about. Go talk to people, have a listening tour, synthesize what you learn, visualize the workflow and tools, get a handle on what the current state is. Step two is to get a quick win. So start small, get a quick win, pick the right projects, share out what you've done. Step three is using data to optimize the work. So establish some of your data foundation, find the data that's there, start collecting new data, use some surveys for some really fast insights and may include example surveys. Step four then is to decide strategy and priority. Once you have some data, then you need to know of all the things that are potentially broken. And if you've already gotten your quick win of all the things that are left, \"What should I do next?\" So we walk through some evaluation frameworks there.\n\n(00:40:43):\nStep five is to sell your strategy. Once you've decided, now you have to kind of convince everyone else. So now you want to get feedback, you want to share why this is the right strategy right now. Step six is to drive change at your scale. So here, we address folks that have local scope of control. If you're starting on just a dev team, you want to do it yourself, kind of grassroots effort or global scope of control. If you're the VP of developer experience or something, there are some things that you can leverage for a top down, and then how do you drive change when you're kind of somewhere in the middle, because you can leverage both types of strategies. And then step seven is to evaluate your progress and show value, and then kind of loop back around.\n\n(00:41:27):\nI will say that we wrote this so that you could kind of jump into any step wherever you are right now. If you're kicking off a team or an initiative, you'll probably want to start at step one. You should definitely start at step one. If you're joining an existing initiative, you could jump into picking the priority or implementing the changes. So those are the seven steps. There's a seven steps, there are a few practices that we also recommend. So thinking about resourcing it, change management, making technology sustainable, and then also bringing a PM lens to this, \"How can we think about developer experience as a product, and how do we think about the metrics that we have as a product?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:13):\nAwesome, okay. I have questions. Point people to the book real quick. What's the URL? How do they get it? When does it come out?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:42:18):\nYeah, developerexperiencebook.com. Right now, you can sign up for the mailing list. We'll let you know when it's out on pre-order, and we'll also be sharing pieces of the workbook. So we've got almost a hundred page workbook that goes along with the book, and then it should be out by end of year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:36):\nOkay. So one piece of this is just this term developer experience feels very intentional in that it's not developer productivity, developer work. It's how do we make developer experiences better at our company, which includes they get more done, but also they're happier and things like that. So I think that's an important element of this, right?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:42:55):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:55):\nOkay.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:42:56):\nBecause, again, it's not just about productivity. We talked about this from the frame and the lens of, \"We need to be building the right thing.\" And you want to be productive, but you also want to be thinking about... and this is what engineers are also just really incredibly good at, give them a problem and don't tell them how to solve it, and then they can solve it better. They have the freedom, they have the innovation, they have the creativity so that they can solve this problem. If it's only about productivity, then it's just lines of code or number PRs or whatever. But we really want to talk about value and how do we unlock value, and how do we get value faster. And that involves, yes, making them more productive and removing friction because then, they have the flow and the cognitive load and the things that we kind of talked about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:41):\nAwesome, okay. And then say someone wants to start this team, what does it usually look like. At Airbnb, I remember this team forming. It was just like an engineer or two, getting it started and taking charge. What do you recommend as the pilot team, and then what does it look like as it grows?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:43:57):\nThere are a few ways to do this, right? So if you're doing it yourself, you could do it with a couple of engineers, maybe a PM or a PGM or a TPM to kind of help communicate. Because really, comms plans are just so important here. On a small scale, what we want to do is look for those quick wins, look for things that you can do at small scale. Some folks call them things like paper cuts. There small things that you can do to help people see the value and feel the benefit themselves, \"How can a developer's work get better? How can their day-to-day work get better? Kind of build momentum from there?\" If you're working from a top-down structure and you have the remit, you still want some quick wins, but those quick wins can look a little more global in scale because you have the infrastructure or the backing to make different types of changes that aren't only local.\n\n(00:44:56):\nSo an example of a small local change could be just cleaning up your tests, your test suites. Any team could do that, any team could do that. At more global scale, it might be changing organization-wide process that is just overly cumbersome or throwing some resourcing into cleaning up the provisioning environment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):\nOkay. What kind of impact have you seen from teams like this forming, on the engineering teams at their companies?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:45:21):\nI'll say I've seen a huge impact for smaller companies, hundreds of thousands of dollars for large companies or in the billions. Well, also, we need to learn how to communicate that, \"What does the math look like?\" Many times, we can look at saving time, we can look at saving costs, we can look at a lot of different things. We can look at speed to value as speed to market. We can look at risk reduction, but the gains really are there. I will mention that it tends to follow something like the J-curve. So you'll have a couple of quick wins and it'll look like a big win, and then you'll hit kind of a little divot where suddenly the really obvious projects, the low-hanging fruit are handled. So now, we need to do a little bit of work. We might need to build out a little bit more infrastructure. We might need to build out a little more telemetry, so that we can capture the things we want to capture. And then once we get that done, then we start to see those benefits really compound.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:16):\nSo going back to that measurement number, what do you recommend? How do people find these numbers? Because I think that's so much of the power of this is like, \"We saved a million dollars doing this.\" What do you look at to figure that out?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:46:28):\nI think there are a few different things to keep in mind, like who is our key audience, and we usually have a few key audiences. We really want to be able to speak to developers because they're the ones that are going to be using the systems. They'll be partnering with you on either building them or at least providing feedback about what you're doing. So for them, we often want to frame this in terms of things they care about. So time savings. If something gets faster, they can save time. They don't spend time doing setup when they don't need to anymore, related to status reduced toil. So compliance and security are super important. Also, many times it requires several manual steps that... I don't say they're not value add. They're not value add from an individual human perspective. If we can automate as much as possible, that's great, and improved focus time.\n\n(00:47:22):\nThat's from the developer side of you. Leadership often cares about... They care about those things, but they often care more about other things. So we could talk about usually costs in dollars, \"Can we accelerate revenue? What does our time to value look like? What is our velocity? How quickly can we get feedback from customers?\" And for folks and organizations that are in really competitive environments, that can be really compelling because it's all about speed. We could talk about saving money. Here, we can look at maybe quantifying savings. One example is test and build. If we can clean up a test and build suite to a developer, they really want to hear about time saved and more reliable systems. There's less toil because they don't have to keep re-running tests or kind of go clean up test suites.\n\n(00:48:13):\nFrom the business perspective, cleaning up a test in a build suite can be cloud cost savings because all of those tests are running somewhere on a cloud. And if they always fail or if it's just kind of a waste of spend, that can be useful, recovering some capacity. We can always talk about time and productivity gains, \"How much equivalent developer time are we losing on things that are not necessarily value add?\" And then sometimes we can correlate to business outcomes and correlate is usually the best we can do here, but there can be some pretty compelling correlations in terms of speeding up time to value and increase market share, for example.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:54):\nLet me follow that thread and come back to this, what I think is the biggest question people have right now with AI and productivity, and I don't think anyone has the answer yet, but I'm curious to get your take of just what should people do today? What's the best approach to understanding what impact AI tools are having on their productivity? Because they're spending all this money on there. I don't know, what are we getting out of this? So I guess things are moving faster, but I don't know. So if someone had to just like, \"Okay, here's what I should probably try to do,\" what would be your best advice here for measuring the impact of AI tools on productivity?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:49:28):\nI would say it depends. In part, it depends on what your leadership chain really cares about. We are usually pretty good at figuring out what matters to developers and we could communicate that to them. But if we're trying to just identify two or three data points to really kind of focus on, because when we're first starting with data, sometimes it can be challenging, what do they care about? Think about the messaging you've been hearing. Have they been talking about market share? Losing market share or competitiveness in the marketplace, if that's it, focus on speed. Think about ways that you can capture metrics for speed from feature to production or feature to customer or feature to experiment and what that feedback loop looks like if they're talking about profit margin all the time.\n\n(00:50:18):\nNow, we always talk about money because this is business. But if that seems to be an overarching narrative, look for ways that you can save money and then translate that into recovered and recouped headcount cost. Or sometimes you'll reinvent, change a process, and then you no longer need as many vendors. So reductions in vendor spent can also help there. I say also it depends because sometimes they'll say something, leadership will say something, and it kind of comes up as a theme. If you could solve a problem that they have or it's something that they're focused on, if you can slightly reframe it even, like if they're calling everything developer productivity, go ahead and call it productivity. If they're calling it velocity, and velocity is what matters to them, think about how to frame this in terms of velocity. If they're talking about transformation or disruption, how does this help with the disruption? Because then, it will resonate with them. We don't want to make them work to understand what it is that we're doing and the value that we provide.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):\nThat is such good advice. Just to reflect back, the advice here is if your company's trying to figure out what sort of impact are AI tools having on our company, first, it's just like, what does the company care about most? What do leaders care about most? Could be market share, could be profit margin, could be velocity. We need higher velocity or we need to transform, transformation. So your advice there is figure that out based on words and phrases you're hearing. Then figure out ways to measure that, ways to measure market share growing, profit margin increasing. I love these examples, like time from feature, idea to production or to experiment, so maybe start tracking that. If it's margin, it's money saved by fewer tests, failing or some vendor you don't have to pay for, things like that. And then velocity, I imagine that's where things like DORA come in of just speed of engineering, shipping, or... What would you think about there for velocity?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:52:16):\nI would say it's actually one of those... I would pick as broad a swathe as you can. So if you can go from idea to customer or idea to experiment, how long does that take? How long does it typically take, and how long can it take, and does it take now with improved use of AI tooling and reduction in friction? That's where I will say, we talk about this a little bit in the book, how do we deal with attribution challenges? What was responsible for this? Was it the DevEx or was it AI? Go ahead and disclose that. Say, \"Yes, we rolled out AI tools. We also had this effort in DevEx. They partnered very closely together.\" Both of them probably contributed to this, right? If we had AI tools without the DevEx improvements, we probably would've had some improvements, but not nearly as much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:00):\nIf people were starting to do this today, say they're just like, \"I want to start measuring developer experience,\" are there a two or three metrics everybody basically needs they should just start measuring ASAP?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:53:10):\nIf you're just starting today and if you have nothing at all, talk to people, obviously. After that, I would do surveys because surveys can give you a nice overall view of the landscape quickly so that you know where the big kind of challenges are. I say that because if you're just starting, you might not have instrumentation through your system, all the metrics. And if you do already, it might not be what you think you want. Metrics that were designed without purpose, questionable. Metrics that were designed for another purpose, they might work for what you want, but they might not, so we can't just assume we have them. That's one reason I like surveys, and we include an example in the book. You can just ask a few questions, \"How satisfied are you? What are the biggest barriers to your productivity, or what are the biggest challenges to getting work done?\" and let them pick either from a set of tools or maybe a set of processes and then say... Let them pick three, just three.\n\n(00:54:12):\nOf those three, how often does this affect you? Is this hourly? Is this daily? Is this weekly? Is this quarterly? Because sometimes it hits you every single day, and you're just mad about it. Sometimes it only hits you once a quarter because it's end of quarter, but it's so onerous, and then kind of open text, like, \"Is there anything else we should know?\" That can give you incredible signal because by making folks prioritize the top three things... Let them pick everything, it makes the data super, super messy. But three things and how often, you can just come up with a score or a weighted score if you want, and then go kind of dig into, where should that data be? What data do we need? But also, then you've got at least some kind of baseline. It'll be a subjective baseline, but now you'll know what the biggest challenges are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:04):\nI love how all this just comes back just starting by talking to people and asking them these things, which is very similar to product management and just building great products is, have you talked to your customers? Everyone thinks they're doing this, but most people are not doing this enough.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:55:17):\nAnd I will say one thing that's challenging when you think about getting data, so interviews are data and that's important, surveys are a little more quantified because we can turn it into counts, but that's where we also want to be careful. A lot of folks go to write a survey question and they'll say something like, \"Were the build and test system slow or complicated in the last week?\" You're asking four different questions there. If someone answers yes, was it the build? Was it the test? Was it slow or was it flaky or complicated or something? So it can be really difficult to untangle what the signal is you're actually getting there, and so it is worth the time chatting with someone who's familiar with survey design, having a conversation with Claude or Gemini or ChatGPT around, \"Here are the survey questions. Or can you propose some?\" And then make sure you take a couple of rounds. Is this a good survey question? What questions can I answer from the data that I get? What problems could I solve? If you can't answer a question with data, don't get it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:22):\nAnd you have example surveys in your book for folks that want to just copy and paste and not have to think about this much.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:56:28):\nYeah, example surveys, a lot of example questions. We even recommend what the format, what the flow should look like, how long it should be, how long it should not be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:37):\nOne thing that I was reading is that you don't love happiness surveys specifically, asking engineers how happy they are, is that true? If so, why is that?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:56:45):\nI don't, no. Well, I'll say I don't love a happiness survey because there are too many things that contribute to happiness. Happiness is a lot, right? So happiness is work, happiness is family, happiness is hobbies, happiness is weekends, happiness... There are so many things that contribute to happiness. Now, that doesn't mean I don't care about happiness. I think happiness surveys are not particularly useful here. What can be helpful is satisfaction and people are like, \"That's the same thing.\" It's not because you can ask, \"Are you satisfied with this tool?\" and then ask some follow-up questions. Now, those two are related because the more satisfied you are with your job and your tools and the work and your team, it contributes to happiness. I used to joke... Remember the golf commercials like, \"Happy cows like happy cheese\"?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:35):\nNo.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:57:35):\nI had a Calabrian. That was the best. Happy devs make happy code. They write better programs, they do better work, they're better team members and collaborators. But capturing and trying to directly influence happiness, that's not what we are here for. It's too challenging, it's too all-encompassing. Satisfaction can give us some signal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:59):\nIn a totally different direction, in terms of just tools you see people using, are there any that just like, \"Oh, yeah, this one's really commonly great.\" For people, this is just a tool people are finding a lot of success with. There's the common ones, Copilot, Cursor. I don't know. Is there anything that stands out that you want to share, just like, \"Hey, you should check this tool out. People seem to love it\"?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:58:21):\nI think they're huge, right? Copilot, Cursor, Gemini.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:25):\nClaude Code.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:58:26):\nYep, Claude Code. I love Claude Code.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:30):\nI have a whole post coming on ways to use Claude Code for non-engineering use cases.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:58:35):\nCool. Nice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:36):\nIt's so interesting. For example, Claude Code, \"Find ways to clean up storage on my laptop,\" and it just tells you there's a bunch of files. It's just like ChatGPT running on your computer and you could do all kinds of crazy stuff on your computer for you, like a mini God.\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:58:36):\nI'm going to do that now. This is great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:57):\nIt's so good. Yeah, that's why I'm writing this. I had Dan Shipper was on the podcast and he said Claude Code is the most underrated AI tool out there because people don't realize what it's capable of. It's not just for coding, and that's what I'm trying to explore more and more. Okay. Is there anything else that you think would be valuable to help people improve their developer experience, help them adapt to this new world of AI and engineering that we haven't covered?\n\nNicole Forsgren (00:59:22):\nI think something that's important to think about in general is to bring a product mindset to any type of DevEx improvements that are happening, and also the metrics that we collect and capture. By that, I mean we want to identify a problem, make sure we're solving a problem for a set of users. We want to think about creating MVPs and experiments and get fast feedback, do some rapid iteration. We want to have a strategy. We want to know who our addressable market is. We want to know what success is. We want to basically have a go-to-market function. We need to have comms. We need to get continuous feedback from our customers. We want to keep improving. And, at some point, we want to think about sunsetting something. Is it in maintenance mode? Is it sun setting?\n\n(01:00:12):\nAnd I think that's important in general, but I think it's extra important now because when we have AI tools, we're using AI tools, we're embedding AI into our products, things are changing so rapidly that it can be really important to take half a beat and say, \"Okay, what's the problem I'm trying to solve right here? Is this metric that we've had for the last 10 years still important or should this be sunset because it's not really important anymore? It's not driving the types of decisions and actions that I need.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:40):\nBefore we get to our exciting lightning round, I want to take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. Is there some way that you've found a use for an AI tool in your life, in your work that you think might be fun to share, that you think might be useful to other people?\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:00:55):\nI have been working on some home design and redecorating rooms and stuff. I'm working with a designer because I know what I like, but I don't know how to get there, I'm not good at this. But I've really been loving ChatGPT and Gemini especially to render pictures for me, so I can give it the floor plan, I can give it one shot of the room that's definitely not what it's supposed to look like, and then I can give it pictures of a couple different things, and then I can just tell it change the walls or change the furniture layout or change something. It helps me and it's relatively quick. It helps me kind of visualize the things... Again, I know what I like, but I don't know how to get there, so I know if I like it or not, which is probably a very random use, but it's fun for now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):\nMy wife does exactly the same thing. She's sending me constantly, \"Here's what this rug will look like in our living room. Here's this water feature.\" It's so good and it keeps getting better. It's just like, \"Wow, that's exactly our house with this new rug,\" and all you do is just upload these two photos and just like, \"Cool. How would this look in our room?\"\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:01:57):\nYeah, I've been impressed a couple times. Definitely the machines are listening to us. It's given me a mock-up of a room or something and then it throws in a dog bed, because I have dogs. I'm like, \"I did not tell you to do that, but yeah, that's probably the color and style of dog bed that I should have in this room.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:13):\nSpeaking of that, have you tried this use case, ask ChatGPT, \"Generate an image of what you think my house looks like based on everything you know about me.\"\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:02:22):\nI haven't.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:23):\nBecause it has memory and it remembers everything you've talked about, and it's hilarious. You got to do it.\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:02:29):\nOkay, that's on my to-do list.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:31):\nThere we go. Bonus use case. Nicole, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:02:38):\nAwesome. Let's go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:39):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:02:43):\nOutlive by Peter Attia is fantastic. Another one that's I guess maybe related, I hurt my back so it's not great, Back Mechanic by Stuart McGill is incredible. Shout out to anyone who has hurt lower back. It's for a lay person to read through and figure out how to fix lower back problems. It's kind of a random one. I will say I love How Big Things Get Done. I can't pronounce the names. I think one's... There's Scandinavian, one is. It kind of dissects really large projects through recent-ish history and where they failed and why. And I think it's really interesting for us to think about, especially now in this AI moment where basically all of our at least software systems are going to be changing. So how do we think about approaching what is essentially going to be a very large project? And then, sorry, I'm going to throw in a bonus one, The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis. Matt Velloso recommended it to me, and it's so good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:42):\nYes, I read that-\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:03:44):\nI audibly gasped at the last sentence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:46):\nOh. I was like, \"What?\"\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:03:47):\nI was [inaudible 01:03:48]. Yeah, I was not expecting it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):\nI read that and I do not remember that last sentence. Oh, man. Okay, cool. Next question. Do you have a favorite movie or TV show you recently watched and enjoyed?\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:03:57):\nI'll say I watch Love Is Blind. If I got to shut down at the end of the day, Love Is Blind is fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:02):\nThere's a new season out.\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:04:03):\nYeah, very excited... and Shrinking. Have you seen Shrinking?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):\nNo. I think I started The Therapist and yeah, I gave it a shot.\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:04:12):\nStrongly recommend it. It's cute.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):\nSweet. Is there a product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be some kitchen gadgets, some clothing.\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:04:21):\nYeah, the Ninja Creami is-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:25):\nDid you say this last time?\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:04:25):\nI don't know. I may have. I don't think so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:29):\nSomebody said this and I still remember it. It's like-\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:04:30):\nIt's so good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):\n... you make ice cream and stuff with it, right?\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:04:33):\nYeah, and you can basically freeze a protein shake and then it turns it into ice cream-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:37):\nOh, man.\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:04:37):\n... which is delicious. Another one is a Jura coffee maker. I'd love good coffee and I'm not great at making it, so I can just push the button and it'll give me anything I want, including lattes, cappuccinos or anything. So that's kind of fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:51):\nSweet, okay. Do you have a favorite-\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:04:54):\nJust sugar and caffeine. I just need a power through the day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):\nThere's the engineering productivity 101.\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:05:01):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:01):\nOh, man. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often find useful in work or life and come back to in various ways?\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:05:09):\nYeah, I think one that's come up a couple times, it's not a verbatim thing, I think it's more the vibe, hindsight is 2020, but it's also really dumb. I think if we made the best decision we could at the time with the information that we had available, then it is what it is. If you make a bad decision because you made a bad decision and you knew better, you had the information, not great. I don't think we give ourselves or other people enough grace because we always end up finding more information out later.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):\nHear, hear. Final question. I was going to ask you something else, but as we are preparing for this, you shared that you have a new role at Google. Maybe just talk about that, what you're up to there, why you joined Google, anything folks should know.\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:05:53):\nSure. I am senior director of developer intelligence and core developer. It's super exciting and super fun because of all of these things we've been talking about. It's focused on Google and all their properties and their underlying infrastructure, how can we improve developer experience, developer productivity, velocity, all of these things we've been talking about and, because kind of the numbers person, how do we want to think about measuring it, how does measurement change, how do feedback loops change, how can we improve the experience throughout and then kind of drive that change through an organization in ways that are meaningful and impactful and faster than they've been before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:33):\nNice job, Google, getting Nicole. What a win. I need to get some more Google stock ASAP. Okay, two follow-up questions. Where can folks find you online and find your book online if they want to dig deeper? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:06:47):\nOnline, you can find the book at developerexperiencebook.com, I'm at nicolefv.com, and LinkedIn occasionally. Sometimes it's a mess. I try to wade through all of the noise. I get there to be useful, sign up for the book and the workbooks. The workbooks are free. I'd love to get any kind of feedback on what works, what doesn't. I always love hearing those kind of stories.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:15):\nNicole, thank you so much for being here.\n\nNicole Forsgren (01:07:17):\nThanks for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:19):\nMy pleasure. Thanks, again. Bye, everyone.\n\n(01:07:23):\nThank you so much for listening.

The way that they motivated the dogs was they had these fake rabbits. These tails would go around faster than the dogs, which would then motivate the dogs to go around in circles. And what was interesting is the moment that the dogs, if they accidentally touched the rabbit, they would never run again because there was like, \"Well, what's next? I've achieved what I was looking for.\" So I think this happens a ton, it's like your listeners are spending time focused on like, \"Well, one day I will be X. I will be that vice president. I will have more money. I will have built something. I will have started a company.\" But they don't think about what happens next. What's the second thing? What's your career next look like? How do you ensure that you are always going to have something important and motivating to do with your career? Otherwise, you'll keep working because you know nothing else to do, but you'll be sadder or you'll find ways to create war when peace is needed.\n\nLenny (00:01:05):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Nikhyl Singhal. Nikhyl has worked on and led large teams on four different influential consumer products including Facebook, Credit Karma, Google Hangouts, and Google Photos. Currently, he leads product teams for the Facebook app at Meta, overseeing groups, stories, messaging, and the feed. Before that, he served as chief product officer at Credit Karma and held various leadership roles at Google. Nikhyl has also co-founded three different startups, and as you'll hear in this episode, is extremely passionate about coaching and mentoring, sharing his knowledge through his newsletter and podcast called The Skip.\n\nLenny (00:01:47):\nIn our conversation, we cover all aspects of the PM career and what it takes to be successful at every stage of the journey, including the dangers of thinking too short term, the importance of avoiding what he calls ex-growth companies, why you're probably not getting promoted, what to focus on if you're a new manager, the rise of the senior IC path, also why top leaders often have huge development areas they don't know about and how to catch them, and also why people who make it to the top often run into serious mental health challenges. As I say at the end of this episode, this might be my new favorite episode and I'm really excited to bring it to you. With that, I bring you Nikhyl Singhal after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nLenny (00:02:28):\nThis episode is brought to you by Superhuman. How much time do you spend in email each day?

I'm happy to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:45):\nSo I have a very simple question to start. How many product managers have you been a mentor to if you had to put a number on it?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:04:53):\nGood question. I guess I haven't thought about it from that perspective. I would say hundreds is probably the way to sort of answer the question, and a little bit has to do with whether how we define being a mentor. I know that was supposed to be a simple question and I'm going to give you a complicated answer, but I think that I started out just helping people 10, 15 years ago, trying to help them through their careers. I find the whole area really interesting. And then what happened was just I started to scale because people were always like, \"Hey, can you find time?\"\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:05:22):\nSo now what I do is I tend to help and coach hundreds of folks through transitions. So if they're in a moment where they're trying to decide between another job, if they're trying to decide to leave, if they're having sort of an alert at work, I call them 911 calls. I take a few 911 calls every week and from a relatively large group of people. So I find those are the most substantive times to help people, is when they're in moments of dilemma or forks in the road, and that's why the number is more closer to hundreds.\n\nLenny (00:05:54):\nOkay. Follow-up question: How many of those people you've mentored have been on this podcast?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:05:58):\nProbably half dozen to kind of close to a dozen at this point.\n\nLenny (00:06:02):\nOh, wow.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:06:03):\nYeah, easily half dozen.\n\nLenny (00:06:06):\nAmazing. Okay. Is there any names you want to name or should we keep it anonymous?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:06:09):\nYeah. We'll keep it anonymous because I want people to feel they can always call me in and not feel like that. I don't tend to share the names of most people.\n\nLenny (00:06:17):\nOkay. I know the one person that self-identified was Annie Pearl from Calendly, who is a big advocate of the stuff that you do. So we don't want-\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:06:23):\nYeah. Annie is someone I learned from and helped talk with, and she's also part of a community that I also build on the side where we pulled a bunch of CPOs together and they've been building community. I'm a big fan of community and learning, and she's part of that as well.\n\nLenny (00:06:39):\nAwesome. I definitely want to talk about that, but maybe just set a little context for our conversation. I feel like you're in the very high percentiles of people that have seen a variety of careers in product management, both good careers, bad careers, junior people, senior people. So I want to focus most of our time on talking about just the PM career path and what you've learned about what is important to have a successful, thriving, happy PM career. Does that sound good?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:07:07):\nPerfect.\n\nLenny (00:07:08):\nOkay. So I'm thinking we break up the chat into early career, mid-career, and late career. So within the early career section, you've talked about how people often make a mistake in their early career, specifically being very short-term focused in deciding where they're going to go. And that's a very dangerous way of thinking about it. So I'd love to hear just your take on exactly what does that mean, and why is that actually a bad idea?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:07:33):\nYeah. I tend to be long-term focused in most of my counsel, and maybe to give you an example of what a short-term focus career kind of framework looks like is, \"I really dislike my boss. I feel like this company doesn't have it anymore. There's just too hard to ship things.\" Those are all maybe true statements, but they probably exist in many of the jobs that one would consider if they were to move for one to another. Lateral moves are by definition not forward moves. So what I try to tell people to think about is work backwards from your end state.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:08:12):\nAlmost think of career as a product. So if you're building a good product, you think about, \"Well, here's what a great product would look like,\" and then you break it into version one, version two, version three. Well, in some ways the reason I called my newsletter, my podcast The Skip is because I always think about not the next job, but the one after it. Maybe think about not your boss's job but your boss's boss's job and what do I need to think about to get there. And in many ways you may think, \"Well, okay, if I need to found a company one day and that's my job after next,\" then you want to look at maybe your current job and then maybe the next job in service of that. And that may lead you to saying, \"Hey, maybe I need a grit of doubt and maybe I should stay and maybe I should learn how to deal with some of this ambiguity. That's why I want people to be a bit more longer term and not so short-term focused.\n\nLenny (00:09:07):\nWhat are some other examples of that short-term thinking? You talked about \"my manager sucks, things are moving really slowly.\" What other examples where people maybe like, \"Oh, okay, I see, this is actually short term. Let me think longer term\"?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:09:17):\nI'd say the biggest one in workplace is focusing career and promotion together. I think that there's perhaps a light connection between promotion and career addition, but I feel like too many people are, the moment we talk about career, they're like, \"Well, let me talk to you. I want to have a career talk with you.\" And I said, \"Sure, why don't you find some time?\" We sit down together and they're like, \"Well, what do you think I need to do to get to promotion?\" And then I said, \"Well, promotion is our system at this company to see you moving forward. And it's pretty clear in terms of levels and what you're doing and what the process is and who makes the decision.\" And that's pretty short term because you can ask, \"Hey, it's two years away, how do I make it 18 months?\" It's a classic.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:10:09):\nBut in reality, if you're thinking career, you're thinking about the sort of long term arc and, as I said, maybe the job after next, and then you need to look at the promotion in service because how many people have you and I talked to who said, \"Well then, as soon as I get promoted, I'm going to leave\"? So then I'm like, \"Well, okay, then what's the promotion in service of?\" And you get into that conversation, which tends to be, again, very long-term focused.\n\nLenny (00:10:36):\nThis makes me think about this interesting two-sided challenge with thinking about your future career and where you want to go. On the one hand, it's valuable to think about getting more logos in your resume and working at Netflix and Meta and Airbnb and Uber, all these guys, there's power and value to that. On the other hand, you just keep doing that. And then what is your life turning into? You're just chasing more fancy logos and feeling better about better brands and your resume and stuff. This might be too big a question, but just how do you advise people to think about how important it's to get some of these companies in your resume and build that side of it versus just doing things you actually enjoy and having a fulfilling life and doing things that are meaningful to you?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:11:18):\nYeah. I mean I think collecting labels does feel shallow to most builders because if you're a product person, you probably got into the business because you like building stuff. And frankly, not just product people want to do that, a lot of technical people want to just build stuff. And then the question is, is the things that you're working on in service of building? And then when you ask people, \"Were you happy?\" as they always say, \"Well, when I was able to build this thing,\" and oftentimes they don't care whether it worked or not, which is kind of ironic. So for me, when I see people chasing logos, I think about it as well. I'm actually really a big fan of a diverse set of experiences, that I think learning about pre-product market fit then seeing smoke turn into fire and witnessing and maybe shepherding that and then taking fire and turning it into something great and being an experience set where you can see the movie in these different frames makes you just a better builder.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:12:20):\nSo you can't really go wrong if you're looking at those experiences. And you're looking at inside the building problems and outside the building problems, those are maybe consumer problems and business-to-business problems. The more diverse career you have, the better builder you are. And that usually comes up being satisfied. But the idea of just doing that because you think it's going to make your chances better for the next job maybe scares me and it feels very much in service of some future dream that is not build oriented. And I think that can be leading to sadness.\n\nLenny (00:12:54):\nI love that advice, and I say this often actually on this podcast, the power of a diversity of experiences for so many reasons. Maybe just to close this loop, would you agree there is a lot of value in having one of these FAANG ish companies on your resume? Like a lot of opportunity gets unlocked if you work at one of these companies that people are like, \"Oh wow, okay, this person's interesting.\" Or not? Or do people maybe overthink that?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:13:17):\nGenerically, the answer is yes. I think it's especially important for executives. I think that many executives are hired because they are to bring expertise of the next phase of organization to this company. We're growing, we want to go after the next phase. We want someone who's has expertise. The MAGMA or FAANG companies, however you want to describe them, they really have challenges and expertise at how to build things at scale, how to manage millions or billions of users and customers. So the advantage is, to be successful at that is an endorsement. Having said that, those specific companies, experiences can be substituted for other later stage companies, but if you're coming in as an executive to bring someone to the next level and you've never experienced it, it's very difficult thing to get that executive experience and to be like a C-level for that growth company.\n\nLenny (00:14:26):\nTo point out, FAANG is no longer accurate because Facebook is now Meta. So MAGMA is the term that you prefer.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:14:33):\nI prefer that. I think it unfortunately kicks out Netflix, but it also doesn't pay homage to Adobe and Salesforce and a number of other great companies. So I think-\n\nLenny (00:14:42):\nFAANG doesn't. Okay, I like this. Okay, let's try to make MAGMA the new thing. MAGMA, make that the title of this episode. Just joking.\n\nLenny (00:14:50):\nSo the next area I want to touch on is, you wrote this kind of hot take on something you call ex-growth companies and how it's not good to be at an ex-growth company currently. So can you just talk about what is an ex-growth company and then why is that not a good place to be as a product manager for probably any kind of role?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:15:09):\nI have a pretty strong opinion on this that I think that for 10 years we created the hypergrowth, blitzscaling type phenomenon, and there was a lot of good reasons for that, some of which were just distribution platforms just got so good. You could take out Facebook ads, you could grow with Google, and you could grow in 18 months that maybe took previous companies 10 years. So I think that the idea was that all of these companies could instantly grow when they found product market fit and that birthed all these unicorns. And then suddenly, 18 months ago, it almost like the music stopped. 0% interest rate went away, and it became a lot harder to find growth through just fueling it with capital. And I think that the sudden change meant that not only capital was harder to raise, but companies started to focus on their core products. You've talked about it on this podcast, just how many layoffs and restructuring and managers moving to ICs, and all of that work is happening.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:16:16):\nWell, the one funny pocket was there's these large number of growth companies who have raised substantive dollars. So they're not going to run out of capital in 2022 or 2023. What's going to happen is, they actually have quite long periods of time, so you don't see them raising new rounds, you don't see them laying off, but in some ways they're still hiring or they're still seeking the next product. The sad truth is that many of their contemporary companies that went public are worth 10% or less than what they were worth back then, and these companies are privately held and so they're sort of sleeping in the shadows.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:17:07):\nMy fear is, from a career point of view, so many tech professionals are in these organizations or joining these organizations with the expectation that they'll make money on their equity, that they'll continue to do fine. And my sense is we're going to see, even in the second half of this year, lots of boards pulling back, taking their capital back, companies essentially saying, \"Hey, we're capitalized. We're a scaled ocean liner, and now we need to go find product market fit.\" But doing that with 300 people and expectations of hitting a multi-billion dollar valuation just isn't going to happen. So that's the reason why I'm like, \"Danger. This is not the company to join, this is the company to leave. Find another phase. Time's a wasting.\" And I worry very much that people aren't getting the message.\n\nLenny (00:18:00):\nI know you probably don't want to name any names of companies, but what are some signs that may be you're at one of these companies?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:18:07):\nI think that the moment that you are reframing the core product, trying to find that product market implies that this company's valuation needs to be a pre-product market fit valuation. So the two questions you ask yourself the day after we listen to this podcast is, \"Hey, are we scaling a product? We have customers that love us and we have a tremendous sucking sound? Or are we trying to find that customer sucking sound?\" And if the answer is, \"We're still trying to find it,\" and then you're like, \"Is your evaluation hundreds of millions or tens of millions?\" and if the answer is hundreds or more and you're still trying to find that sucking sound, you're an ex-growth company.\n\nLenny (00:18:57):\nAs a founder listening to this, I bet you're like, \"Damn, we don't want people leaving. This isn't the kind of message we want to hear.\" On the other hand, as an employee at a company, that is your advice, just generally recognize it and then you should probably leave as soon as possible because things are not going to work out for you.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:19:15):\nAs an employee, I think you have almost no recourse because you almost have to start over in terms of it's a new four-year investment. I think that as a founder, you can recap your company. You can reset your stock price, you could reissue. You can make those hard decisions and you can maybe return some of the money to the board and still continue, or you can pull the plug and restart the company that maybe you really wanted to. But I think the founder is in a better position, but they also have a lot more to lose and far more constraints. But employees, they're not... If you listen to this and come to this conclusion, a lot of times, the listeners here, half or more of their compensation is an equity and we just concluded that most of their equity may not be worth anything. In which case, are you willing to take a half pay cut or work for 20% of what you can get on the market? My question is, that seems to be quite concerning, the opportunity cost is just too rich.\n\nLenny (00:20:19):\nAn important variable in this framework/piece of advice is product market fit. This might be too big of a question, but just, what tells you that something might have not have product market fit when you're at a company like this? What are signs to you and smoke signals of like, \"They may not have product market fit\"?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:20:36):\nFor me, it's always around this pull that sort of how much work do you have to do to basically generate pull? So right now with OpenAI for example, we're seeing ridiculous pull, but we may not be seeing, for example, massive revenue or profitability. So that's the reason why I tend to feel like you can kind of tell by how hard it is to acquire your users. When companies are putting very little in marketing and there're people coming into the door or there's such an easy sale, you've got it. I think that this sucking pull kind of concept feels like the most appropriate way to define it as opposed to the sort of unit economics of acquisition and time to pay back. There are lots of mathy ways to do it, but early on you can tell how hard are you working to bring people in the door.\n\nLenny (00:21:32):\nIs there any reason to consider staying at a company like this?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:21:35):\nThere are counter examples. I think the counterpoint is, this is the biggest role that you feel like you could get and you have an appetite to sort of learn like, \"I'm on the executive team, I'm not going to get that somewhere else. That experience is career additive. I want that moment.\" Great. Sometimes I see loyalty come in, \"This was my baby. I feel a commitment to the team, the team that I've made, et cetera.\"\n\nLenny (00:22:07):\nYeah.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:22:08):\nI actually respect that. I think that you have to put bounds on that. I think that you should have that conversation. But the learning position, the loyalty tend to be the primary reasons to maybe delay the decision, but fear of finding another job is a bad reason, but is an often common reason as well.\n\nLenny (00:22:34):\nNow that we've given many listeners an existential crisis, let me move on to another question within the early career phase and then I'm going to move on to mid-career. I guess the question is just, is there any other piece of advice, wisdom for early PMs? Maybe the question is, what do you think they should most get right in their early career?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:22:56):\nThere's probably two answers that I would share. One is, they want to build something that they as much as possible are world-class in. So if you think about the different types of product ambiguities that exist in industry, you can be a great crafter. You could be incredibly strong at market ambiguity. You could understand how to navigate markets and create something new that doesn't exist. You can be great at organizational ambiguity. I know how to take complex teams that have complex goals and solve an inside the building problem. You can be a domain expert. I'm an ML expert, I'm a really strong hardware PM. You can be a team expert. I just really thrive in managing managers and I just know how to get the balance right. So, being a product manager means you're confronted with maybe all five or maybe more of these. I want to know that you pick up one of these as early as possible.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:24:07):\nSo maybe you become an expert in domain, maybe you become a great crafter, maybe you really think through how to manage growth. Growth is another one that I would add to the list. But picking a lane is kind of goal number one. And then maybe goal number two is having a story to tell to that next employer and that next, next. What I worry about is, sometimes when I'm in an interview, and you and I have probably done hundreds, and you're talking to someone and then they talk about those early jobs and they just sort of said they were there, this happened and it's very hard to connect, tell me exactly what you learned and what you did, I want to know that story. So it's just like Amazon talks about building the press release before they start creating a product. Think about the story, think about the skill, then solve your day to day, your week to week, your month to month, your performance review. That's my biggest advice I seize.\n\nLenny (00:25:12):\nI love that advice. It connects to your other earlier piece of advice, of just try to get a variety of experiences because that'll help you figure out which of these things is maybe best suited for what you're interested in, what you enjoy doing.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:25:24):\nYep, absolutely.\n\nLenny (00:25:25):\nAwesome. So let's transition to mid-career. Let's talk about promotions. You mentioned getting promoted earlier. We chatted a bit about that. There's probably no one ever that didn't want to get promoted. It's a common topic in people's career, but a lot of times people don't understand why they're not getting promoted, they're not sure people are looking for to get promoted. You've promoted a lot of people and you've gone through a lot of promotions. What would be your advice to give people who are trying to get promoted and just haven't been promoted? What would you suggest people in that position generally do?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:25:57):\nYeah, it's a great question. I think that we want to kind of understand why, and oftentimes asking your manager won't reveal the answer. So then you'll start with that. I think that the answer of what you do is correlated with what's the real reason. And I think that there may be, I'll suggest four kind of common things I've seen that really hold people back. And then depending on your environment, you have to decide how many of these apply.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:26:25):\nSo I think the number one is that you just don't have advocacy. You need someone to see the magic in you to be promoted. There is many of your listeners who have that magic but maybe have a manager or a promotion team, it doesn't always have to be the manager itself, who doesn't see said magic. And in that case, if you have the magic, you're in a bad setting and you just need to change. That could be a shift within the project. You could find a manager who sees it. It could be leaving the company. I think the second that's very common now, Lenny, and I think it's coming up a ton, is the next role doesn't exist.\n\nLenny (00:27:10):\nMm-hmm.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:27:11):\nSo this is not as present in hypergrowth because the next role always did exist. There was always growth, there was always hiring, you're always hiring people above you, below you, et cetera. Now, I think there's lots of examples of people who are really qualified and working at the next level, but the job doesn't exist. So you can't really create that job and ask them to be working at that next job if their position is mostly the previous one. Again, I feel like it's not that satisfying because it means you're still being held back, but it's radically different than if you're unqualified. These two are sort of more, the system is not in a position to advocate.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:27:58):\nThe third is when you are being impatient. And I think the hardest ones that I think I've worked with is, the highest performers have succeeded because they have set their goals to be more aggressive than what was essentially average achievable. By default, we expect you to be two years in this role. They're like, \"Great, I'll see you in a year.\" And then they get frustrated when they can't do that, and leadership takes longer to absorb. It's more soft skills, it's more subtle. Oftentimes it's based on impact, which is a lot of times lagging, and that tends to be frustrating. So if listeners are like, \"I know I'm used to being promoted annually and now I'm a leader and I'm not moving as quickly, it's time for me to go,\" I'm like, well, maybe that's working as intended. So impatience is a number three.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:28:54):\nAnd then the fourth one I think is about 50% of the cases where it's really, there is a development area but it isn't quite connected to the individual. The listener has a development area, it's substantive. The manager is poor at identifying it, perhaps even doesn't see it, but the promotion committee does, the individual refuses to hear it, which is a very common one. Or they hear it and they just don't want to change it. And they don't do it because they're arrogant, they do it because it's like, \"This is who I am. You want me to be X and I'm Y, and that's what a Y is and I don't want to be X.\" This is the hardest one because this is where coaching and development and self-awareness come in.\n\nLenny (00:29:46):\nAmazing. This super resonates. So just to summarize the four reasons you may not be getting promoted: One is, there's no advocate that sees your magic and understands that you're awesome. Two is, there's no actual role that's available and so there's nothing to get promoted to. And that's so true right now, there's just not. Everyone's laying people off, they're getting rid of manager layers. I totally see that all over the place. Three is, you're probably just not being patient. Four, you actually have some work to do and you shouldn't be promoted. Maybe to follow a thread on that first one, if someone doesn't see your magic, I see a lot of people just complaining that like, \"Oh, I'm doing so well, I'm so great and nobody understands it. No one gives me credit. No one really appreciates me.\" I don't know if there is an answer to this, but is there a way to help people see that no, you're actually not doing great versus you are and people just don't see it? What's a sign maybe? Maybe you're not as great as you think you might be.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:30:41):\nThe cheap answer is you have to get real feedback, not formal feedback. I think that the more scaled the company is, the more they have these systems in place which provide formal feedback. But honestly, we've run experiments where we said let's ignore the formal feedback, let's have a real conversation with my peers on how our teams are doing. The signal that comes out are dramatically different than the formal feedback. So what you're looking for when you feel like you're in this situation where you're not being seen, and it might be because there's a real issue, what you really want to dial into is, \"Let me get the ground truth as to what people are thinking,\" and you have to have very strong listener skills where we all have been in the discussion, where you're giving feedback to someone and the next thing that they tell you is they justify how you're wrong, that you missed this. \"Let me tell you about exactly why that situation that you're using wasn't...\"\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:31:43):\nYou have to be great at pulling feedback, listening to it. You have to triangulate it from people that don't see you all the time, that do see you all the time, your peers. But you have to create an environment of safety where people feel like there is no worry about retaliation or concern, et cetera. And the more comfortable people are about giving feedback to you and the more you have the skills to pull it and you don't trust formal or you don't trust manager, the better shot you have of truly understanding what that real issue is and solving it.\n\nLenny (00:32:16):\nThis reminds me of Jules Walter who's on the podcast. He gave a bunch of advice. I don't know if you saw that. I've had to accept feedback and get people to give you feedback. And one of its pieces of advice is, ask people for real feedback. And no matter how much you're melting inside hearing it, just be like, \"Thank you so much for that.\" Because then, people feel like, \"All right, he's listening.\"\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:32:34):\nI think Jules is a great, probably one of the world's best people in pulling feedback in my experience. I think that the one that even ones up it is, when I talk to Jules, Jules will look for feedback, then he'll repeat it back to me better than even I presented it. And then I'd say, \"Well, let me now feel safer to even provide.\" Because anyone who's explaining it to a place that they all not only internalize it but they can articulate clearly understands and values it. And that's the really powerful way is, \"So what you're saying is I just interrupt far too often and some ways it's almost to a point that it's annoying. Is that a fair assessment?\" \"Oh, that's actually not the words I use,\" but that's what really gets people comfortable in sharing with you what's really going on.\n\nLenny (00:33:24):\nAmazing. I think we're discovering some of these people that have worked with you that have been on the podcast slowly. Maybe while we're on this topic, I didn't expect to go here, but in terms of other tips for getting good feedback, is there anything else that just comes top of mind of how to get better feedback from people? Because it's hard to do. Most people talk about getting feedback and then don't, or they just don't know how. So one is just, you said repeat back exactly what they told you and be like very appreciative. Is there anything else?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:33:51):\nI'd share out feedback. It's a little easier when you are a manager, but for example, most managers that are listening have a staff discussion. Maybe it's sort of awkward, but maybe you have a standup and you are giving notes to people. So as a manager, someone will come to me and they'll give me a piece of feedback. The next Monday when I have my staff meeting, I'll make a comment about something and I'll say, \"Well, lot of this came because I got this great piece of feedback from...\" and I'll name the person, and I'm like, \"It really helped me see this challenge.\" Now, that feedback could be about me or about this project or about the team. And it might be positive, it might be constructive. People hear that and they're like, \"Wow, I get recognized for giving this guy feedback. Sign me up.\" You're always trying to find way to break down that barrier.\n\nLenny (00:34:45):\nI love that tip. You talked about managers and how often managers are not great at managers. Maybe they don't identify development areas, maybe they're bad in other areas. So maybe just a question here of just, why are managers often not great? And then two, if you're a new manager, I think a lot of listeners are maybe transitioning to management or about to transition, what's your advice for being successful as a new manager?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:35:12):\nI'll start by saying that, in a hundred years when the archeologists look back and they see tech in the sort of early years of tech, the first 34 years, they'll say that the biggest surprise was how much we thought it was okay to not train managers. The military probably didn't make that mistake for very long before they corrected it. And most immature industries really train managers, but boy, if you're a good coder, you are ready to manage. That's the way the industry works. If you can talk, you are ready to product manage. If you can product manage and ship something out the door, you should definitely tell people what to do. I think that there's such a loose coupling between the skills to be successful at building things and teaching people how to build. It's the difference between if you can make a good car, you must know how to make the factory that makes the car. I don't think that's true at all.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:36:18):\nI think that this is a massive epidemic, that I think there's the thousand challenges that stem from this, whether it's challenges around bias, challenges around enabling coaching and teaching and solving development areas. My hope is that one day as an industry we find ways to improve and fix it. But podcasts like yours are actually quite meaningful steps. I would say that your podcast might be more meaningful than most L&D departments in most organizations today. So that's powerful because you're having a tremendous amount of impact, and I think learning is essentially a lifelong opportunity and I think that is the type of resources that just didn't exist a decade ago.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:37:03):\nI think to answer your question around what are the common pitfalls, if you're a first time manager listening or maybe someone who's considering it, I think there are probably two quick things that I would say you have to get bravely thoughtful about as you enter into this journey. One is, your challenge is going to be to share the steering wheel with the person or the set of people you are managing. And I think that there's this three modes that people have in their head. They're like, \"Oh, management is divide and conquering. You go there, I go there, we meet up.\"\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:37:39):\nOr they'll say it's like riding a bike, or teaching to ride a bike, I should say. Someone starts out on the bicycle, I hold your hand, I let go, and then I hope that you fly. I think it's more like the sidecar on the motorcycle, where person's driving the motorcycle and I'm on the sidecar and whether I like it or not, I'm attached, but I have this relatively specific role of giving counsel. I think that that model of how do you share the steering wheel, not just say you got it or I got it or I got it for a while, and then I hand it to you is the key question.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:38:15):\nAnd then I think that the second miss that people tend to have is they tend to, because they have power, by the way, organizational power, not because they've earned that power, they start managing whatever they define that to be. And what I find is that you're more like the vampire knocking on the door of someone. You have to be invited in. You just can't walk through the threshold. And I think that no matter how senior the person that is the manager, you have to earn the right to be the person's manager. So maybe to be specific, well, if I start managing someone, the thing I'd like to understand is like, \"Hey, well, what can I help you with?\" And they can invite me in. Oftentimes, the answer is, \"I don't need you. I actually wasn't excited about you as a manager. I don't need another layer between you and the CEO. Get out.\" And I'm like, \"That's cool,\" because anything I say after that is just going to be annoying and it's going to backfire.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:39:20):\nNow, one day they will need help, and I will be in the sidecar waiting to say, \"Perhaps I can assist.\" And then when you finally get to that moment where you're invited in, you pick an area or two, and then you really partner with that person on that area. I can give examples on that, but I generally think that it's this invitation picking specific and then making sure we're sharing the responsibility is the key set of notes that I would share with you.\n\nLenny (00:39:51):\nWhat's your take on the IC path, senior IC path, something that a lot of companies talk about? I know Meta is big on this right now, the layering managers and things like that. I find a lot of times there's a lot of talk about it and there's not really a real career opportunity there. I guess, what's your just take on as that is a real option for most people trying to basically avoid the manager out and staying in IC, PM long term?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:40:17):\nYeah, I think that it's a little bit more acute now because of the backlash that we talked about between growth where management was perceived. So in this case, management was perceived as a way to drive expansion. So if you're in charge of expansion, you're managing the people that are doing the build and now we're doing a lot fewer things. So I think that's what's mandated this sort of growth in the IC track, for lack of a better term. I think it is one of the best things that happened to our industry because what's happened is, in the last 10 years, and you can tell I'm particularly hard on our managers here, they've basically been promising ICs that early promoted into management. They didn't get taught, and now they're sort of average managers and promising ICs. But now the story that they tell and what they've built is not awesome.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:41:22):\nIf I'm looking to hire, if I'm in a growth company and I'm the next hottest thing and I'm looking to hire someone and someone walks into the interview and said, \"Look, I've managed two people before and then I was in the charge of this thing, but they really did the details. And then by the way before that, I was early in trying to get this thing out the door and then they picked me to be manager,\" I'm like, \"Okay, that's an interesting set of experiences. I'm looking, for me, in my company to build something.\"\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:41:47):\nThe next person walks in, it's like, \"I've been an IC for that whole time. And during that time I went from learning something to demonstrating it to really being able to take it forward. And I got one of these ambiguities master. I'm an expert in domain. I'm an expert in managing organizations,\" I'm like, \"I don't need a team ambiguous expert. That's not my hard part. My hard part is actually cracking the code on this complex market or this very complicated organization where we have two teams that have different goals. You're the type of person I want.\"\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:42:19):\nSo I think Lenny, to your question, I think the IC track is one of the best things that's going to happen for people career. But to your point, those tracks, from a promotion and from a industry, how we perceive it, they're not in cement yet. They're tender. You wait six months, you wait nine months, they'll become very, very strong and solid. And I think then, we'll be able to lean very hard into them as a real promising crack for builders.\n\nLenny (00:42:54):\nYour sense is, this is going to become more and more real as these layoffs have happened and kind of pullbacks on growth have happened.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:43:00):\nYeah, I mean, if you think about it, it's the reality in engineering and design. So in engineering, you can be the sort of VP of engineering or CTO, and in a design, a lot of designers become design managers, a lot of them stay as crafters. And then for whatever reason in product managers, maybe because they were managers in our title, we just all became managers. What about the product? What about the other side? So I actually think it's a bug that has existed for a long time that actually we're going to correct permanently now.\n\nLenny (00:43:33):\nI wonder if part of it for PMs is, once you become a manager, this happens to me, I didn't want to be an IC anymore. It's like, \"I'm done with that. I really enjoy this management layer.\" And I imagine with engineers, maybe they'll enjoy the coding. When I was an engineer I was like, \"Oh, I don't want to just sit around and manage. I just want to code.\" So I wonder if there's any part of that.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:43:52):\nBut a lot of your listeners like to build. And actually, when they talk to their managers, they're like, \"I don't know if that job is awesome. It feels like you spend all your time writing docs and telling your boss's boss what to justify resources and headcount. I just want to build stuff. You don't build stuff.\" So I think there might be some of that. I think that it's not perfect, but I think hopefully builder and IC will become more synonymous.\n\nLenny (00:44:19):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.\n\nLenny (00:44:46):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

And 10X your experiment velocity.\n\nLenny (00:45:27):\nComing back to the manager life and how many managers are not great and also just how do you get better as a manager, what have you found actually is effective in helping new managers become better?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:45:37):\nI think I may have come across kind of hard on managers and I think I kind of said, \"Hey, your manager and your manager's manager isn't really doing much teaching. Find the right podcast, good luck.\" And I think that that's a pretty soulless answer. So maybe the way I describe it is, well, I think learning is changing, and there's the self-service tools that are getting better and then there's the structured teaching which I think is weak. And then there's community, which I think whether it's within your company or outside of company, I think is the answer that we'll see more and more. I think community as a way of creating safety, having authentic conversations, feeling that you're not alone, that others are going through the same thing, and then sharing best practices is so powerful. And what social software has done is it has really empowered community.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:46:46):\nAnd now the tools are awesome. How many great communities have Slack channels or Discord channels or Zoom calls? And we do a lot of that in the CPO community that I created. Whether you're a new manager or whether you belong to a diverse group, whether you are new to a company, I think that all of your listeners should be part of an active community where they can be very authentic and very safe. Sometimes it's hard to do that with your coworkers, and so you need to find another community. Unfortunately, those communities are not the easiest to find today, but I believe that the notion of community as a powerful propellant for learning is the critical ingredient and hopefully many people are creating these communities so that new managers can find the right services.\n\nLenny (00:47:40):\nCan you actually talk about this community that you've built? This could be a good time to talk about it. It's called The Skip. Is that right?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:47:45):\nYeah. It's funny, it's all kind of fun products. They were always a reaction to something. They weren't really intentional. I, as you opened the podcast, did really enjoy teaching and coaching. I learned just as much from coaching others as they learned, I think. And yet I couldn't really scale. So I had this summer where I had just come off of being a head of product, and more and more of my people I was talking to were also head of products. What would happen is, I would have these conversations and they would ask me a question. I would say, \"Well, that's the same conversation I answered on Tuesday.\" What you realize is, it's a very lonely job. Being lonely at the top is not just an adage. Really, everyone's so busy now. It's like, how do you have time to connect? Everything's a single player, you don't really have community.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:48:39):\nSo I thought, \"Well, what if I took the half a dozen people I talked to this month?\" And I just said, \"Hey, all of you are all interested in talking through how to navigate this crazy world of year one, year two, chief product officer. I think you would really gain. I know all of you and I think you can be safe with one another. Why don't we spend some time together?\" So we did a WhatsApp channel and we brought a Zoom call. This was during the pandemic, so you really couldn't meet up. And we started talking. We started talking every month, and people were so empowered by the fact that the problem they were hitting was not just them. It was, \"My crazy CEO is telling me this.\" And the next person is like, \"Oh yeah? Let me tell you what my person said.\" And then they would say, \"Oh my gosh, that sounds worse than my situation.\"\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:49:33):\nBut then, we would sit down and say, \"Hey, the third person said I actually kind of had this and now I figured out a way out, and here's what I did.\" And you're like, \"Wow, that's amazing. I'm going to try it.\" The next day they come back, they're like, \"It works.\" And we started to connect and we built this trust, and community building is interesting and powerful work. So six went to 12, and then 12 went to 15, and now we have 28 members. A lot of folks are interested in these types of communities, but I'm so worried about scaling it because it's the enemy of trust and authenticity. So for all of you that are building communities, it's like tree balancing act. But I do think that the goal is to find ways to take all of this sort of like-minded folks that are in these same situations and connect them together. Late stage chief product officer happened to be one of the ones that had some of the most substantial importance to me because of all the coaching I did for that group.\n\nLenny (00:50:35):\nIf someone's listening and they're like, \"Oh, I need to join this thing,\" how do they find out about it? How do they potentially apply and try to join?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:50:41):\nWell, we have enough members now. There's a LinkedIn area called The Skip CPO Community, and you should contact any of the members that you know and ask them to join. My request and my requirement is that they are, number one, product leaders in their organization and a company that's not early, but that's mid to late. And the reason being is, those sets of problems tend to be the most similar. To be honest, I think this is not the only community that I want to be part of and help create, but this one happens to be the preexisting one. I think there are lots of powerful communities that can be created, but this particular one is very much focused on The Skip CPOs.\n\nLenny (00:51:28):\nAwesome. I'll mention the community around my newsletter just so folks are looking for a community join. I try not to promote these sorts of things, but it's a good time, may as well. If you're a paid subscriber to my newsletter, there's a Slack community you get access to. There's about 12, 13,000 people in there. There's meetups happening all over the world every month. It's amazing. Very proud of it. People are getting a lot of value of it, and it's basically open to any level of product manager. Other functions are in there too. So it's a very different sort of experience, but willing to add that also in the show notes if you want to check that.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:51:59):\nI think that that would be my put, because so many of the managers will say, \"Hey, I'm an IC,\" here's a greater one, \"I am not being told I have the next job. I just was told to become an IC and I was a manager. I feel like my learning opportunities are stuck, but this is a bad time to look for a job.\" They should be in your community. They will learn more from that community than they will learn from managing one random person that they were attached to managing in some project that may or may not see the light of day, yet that's how our society is programmed. Our industry is like, \"No, no, go manage that person because that's going to make you closer to the top. Forget learning.\" And I'm like, \"Well, learning isn't happening. Learning's happening in your community. Learning is happening in our communities in general.\" That's why I'm pushing so hard on this.\n\nLenny (00:52:54):\nThis is a good segue to talking about the third bucket, which is kind of later career CPOs. That's the segue in my mind there. Something that I've heard you talk about is that a lot of really senior leaders have real development areas, but they're hiding behind these superpowers that they have. Plus, people don't like to give real feedback to senior people. So I'd love to hear just what you're seeing there and how maybe people can work through that and what we can learn about that issue that you've noticed.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:53:27):\nThis came from my notes as I was talking to a therapist on this. They talked about the shadows of superpowers. And I thought it was an incredibly powerful phrase that everyone focuses on your superpowers, but no one ever thinks about what shadows they create. Shadows of superpowers to me is the story of a lot of executives. There's an adage that's thrown around, which is, what gets you there isn't what got you here. It's sort of the tools that have made you successful today, you need to almost rebuild or relearn to get to the next phase. And I think both of these sort of speak to the same point, that oftentimes people have a great superpower. They go into a performance review, person says, \"You're getting some feedback from your peers that you struggle in collaboration.\" And the manager even sometimes is puzzled, but the individual will say, \"Are you kidding me? My last five performance reviews told me that I was one of the best collaborators in the company. How in the world is that possible?\"\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:54:42):\nAnd then what you realize is that, \"Well, you're collaborating as long as people agreed with your point of view. Now as a leader, we're asking you to be opinionated, and because you just think you're an amazing collaborator using the exact same tool set. And it turns out that when you're dealing with senior people, that may not even be in your function, they may not be product, they may not be tech, they recoil, but you're moving so fast because it's your superpower. You would never think that this needs to be rebuilt.\" Sometimes it could be more extreme. Great collaborators sometimes are very reticent to present their own opinions because they're so good at assimilating others. Or people that are amazing at growth struggle to be innovative. People that are world-class storytellers struggle to get in the details. People that are very taste maker, they are always the first to have point of view. They don't necessarily introduce change particularly often. You're strong politically, but your decisions are unprincipled. You're a structured thinker, but blue-sky innovations are very tough. You're an amazing listener, but you're very weak to be decisive. I can go on forever.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:56:10):\nAnd what I would say to you is, sometimes even in a 30-minute conversation, walking into the room, just knowing what I know about the person, I can unlock their development area faster than anyone ever before, simply because my secret is, I'll bet you, because of this person's world-class here, these are the three things they're going to hit. And they don't even realize it because it's their identity. This is what got me here. If you make me work on that, you will make me change my superpower. And I'm like, \"That's why you're stuck. That's why your career is plateauing.\" And then they get sad and then they take a long time to process, and then the work actually begins and then they solve and they go. Almost everyone, once they have the name and the face, they're able to solve. But facing the name is hard when it's sitting in the shadows of superpowers.\n\nLenny (00:57:08):\nWow. That is an incredibly important point. For someone to recognize this, do you find that they need someone like you that's like a coach, mentor, person to come in, and be like, \"Here's what I see\"? Or is there a way, I guess, as someone that's a peer or an employee to help them recognize this without them shutting down and being like, \"No, shut up. No problem'?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:57:28):\nNo, you don't need a coach. What you do need is to listen to contradictory feedback. So what was the premise here is you're being told that something that you hold as your strength is actually in your way or a development area. Do not dismiss that. Recognize most likely you're doing it correctly. You just have gotten to the next level. So what I'm hoping the listener does is it goes back through all the feedback that they may even have and then looks at all the discard stuff. What's on the discard pile? Things that were discarded are anomalies because they're artifacts of my strength. And often, your managers are the ones that do the discarding, \"Oh, that was just a weird... That person, they were just into it. They have it out for you. They got reorged or they were upset.\" I'm like, \"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Perception's reality. Talk to me about that one. That might be it.\" That's what I'm looking for.\n\nLenny (00:58:29):\nFascinating. This makes me think about companies that have the same issue, companies strengths, like say Meta for example, move fast and break things and then, \"Oh, that ends up being the biggest Achilles' heel.\" Uber, similar. Airbnb has similar challenges like that.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:58:43):\nAbsolutely. This exact thing applies to relationships. This applies to companies, this applies to a lot. And I'm so happy that I was able to learn about it. Frankly, it was a critical unlock for me because I was stuck on something for years and I just could not understand how, for me, it was, I was very opinionated about something. And then I realized being loosely held on my opinions didn't mean that I became a weaker executive, but it was my opinions that got me to be so successful and it required me to rewire who I was as an executive. And that took a lot of time and a lot of energy. But it came from this realization and then I started to apply it for other strength areas. And now, every time I have a strength area of myself for those that I coach, I immediately talk through all the things that I bet you exist and most of the time were right.\n\nLenny (00:59:46):\nSo what is it for you that you said was your superpower and your shadow?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (00:59:50):\nI think that I was, as an entrepreneur, very opinionated about using small amounts of information to make decisions. And then I was very good at driving those things. So when you become an entrepreneur, you're great at grit, you're great at opinion, you're great at being decisive. And then as an executive, you spend a lot of time making sure everyone has context, everyone is heard, your opinions are actually edited for good reason. And it's not just to placate, it's actually to improve. But as someone who's basically been right a lot, that requires almost a complete and you're like, \"Well, that's not who I am.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, you start with the sentence like that's not who I am.\" You're definitely doing it right when you hit your leadership.\n\nLenny (01:00:40):\nWhat was the process like for you to work through that? You said it took a long time. What made it effective for you? Was there a coach involved? Something else?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:00:49):\nI got a lot of setback. I get a lot of negative feedback. I had a lot of abrupt challenges at work where folks would say, \"You're not collaborating well. Your peers don't have the same level of respect as they should.\" And I was like, \"Are you kidding me? That's not who I am. These things that are being said about are completely ironic.\" I was very much struggling and that's when I said, \"You know what? I can struggle and blame others, but what if they were right? I'm going to be doing this for 30 more years, it's kind of worth it to figure out if they're right. If they're wrong, then you don't lose.\" And that's what kind of forced it. And then the tooling starts, then you start talking through. My self-awareness was strong enough that I was able to say, \"Okay, now I understand it.\" I had some peer feedback that helped bring it home from someone I trusted. So that was a kind of linchpin to this, but these are tough, tough things to break through. And oftentimes they don't come nicely, I guess, is the point.\n\nLenny (01:01:53):\nI was going to ask what that turning point for you was, and it sounds like it was direct feedback from someone you really trusted that's like, \"Oh, I really need to take this seriously.\"\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:02:01):\nYou got it. You got it. Because I had a lot of feedback that I was dismissing and then I had feedback from someone, I'm like, \"That person I should listen to because they're giving me the feedback for the right reasons and they have the right language.\"\n\nLenny (01:02:13):\nComes back to the power of getting feedback and getting good at that.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:02:17):\nAnd making people feel safe and giving it.\n\nLenny (01:02:19):\nMm-hmm. That's a good segue to maybe the last question. You told me once that a lot of the people that you work with that have kind of made it have a lot of mental health challenges, that they didn't expect their life to be the way it is necessarily when they got there. Can you just talk about what you see there in that group?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:02:39):\nYeah. This is a story that I don't think is told very well right now, and partly because it's such a luxury problem, it's almost a little embarrassing to discuss it openly as so many people struggle with so many basic needs, going through layoffs, going through all these challenges. I mean, these are real issues. But I think that what I've noticed is that if you kind of break career as we've done in this podcast between sort of act one, act two and act three, if act one is sort of learning and being that sort of builder and then maybe building the car, and then act two is building the factory, act three is like, what's after that? What do you do after that? And I think that act three in the past wasn't as long as it is now. Before, people would proverbially retire in their 60s when they used to actually physically work.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:03:35):\nNow almost all your listeners sit at a desk all day, so they don't need to retire by any means. And health is getting better. You might see folks work until their 70s or 80s. So that means that their careers are potentially 60 years long. So even if you're 20 years or 30 years in your career, you're only halfway through. So this act three could be a thing. And I don't think we talk about act three enough. What often happens is, and this is what I've been watching for people that are at my age, is they sort of succeed and then they become lost. They almost goes hand in hand.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:04:14):\nSo when I was a kid and I was growing up in the Midwest, entertainment was going to the dog tracks, and not even the horse tracks, we didn't have horses. So it was the greyhound dog tracks. So people would bet on a dog and greyhound would go around the ring and then you would see. I bet on number three and I'll make a buck or something. The way that they motivated the dogs was they had these fake rabbits, which sounds kind of cruel and horrible, so I don't want the SPCA to come after you. But the point is that they'd have these fake rabbits. And what was interesting is, the moment that the dogs, if they accidentally touched the rabbit, the sort of the tail because the machine broke, because these tails would go around faster than the dogs, which would then motivate the dogs to go around in circles. Sometimes the machines would break, the dogs would actually catch the rabbit, they would never run again.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:05:17):\nThe reason why they wouldn't run again is because there was like, \"Well, what's next? I've achieved what I was looking for.\" So I think this happens a ton. It's like, your listeners are spending time focused on like, \"Well, one day I will be X. I will be that vice president. I will have more money. I will have built something. I will have started a company.\" But they don't think about what happens next, and when it happens, when they succeed, their North Star, their entire way of wiring their career, themselves, it has been around getting to that place. And I think that if you're going to get there 30 years in and you have a 60-year career, a lot of the discussion I've been having with myself and with others has been, you probably need to start working on that North Star now.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:06:08):\nWhat's the second thing? What's your career next look like? How do you ensure that you are always going to have something important and motivating to do with your career? Otherwise, you'll keep working because you had no nothing else to do, but you'll be sadder, or you'll find ways to create war when peace is needed, or you'll spend money in an attempt to earn more, or you'll find habits that are bad. And I really want us to have long 60-year, 70-year careers, not just 30-year or 10-year, which is why I enter this into the vocabulary out there.\n\nLenny (01:06:51):\nThat is really resonating with me. I had a similar experience. I had a startup, and my whole goal was just like, \"I just want to start a company.\" That's my goal. That's all I got in life. I want to start a company and then maybe sell it, maybe go somewhere with it. So I did and then we sold it to Airbnb and then I got to Airbnb and I was just like, \"What the hell do I do now? I don't have any other goals.\" And it was pretty sad. Exactly how you're describing. It was just like, \"I guess I'll just work here and I don't know, maybe I'll start another company, but I already did the thing I wanted to do.\"\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:07:21):\nYour story is I think very inspiring because what you did is you said, \"I think the thing that I want to do is give, but I want to do it in my own way and I want to create something, but I want to do something that I think I can do for 30 years and I want to do it.\" It has lots and lots of spokes to it. So you reinvented yourself professionally, but you created a new North Star.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:07:48):\nMy sense is, for every one of you, Lenny, there's a hundred that could do that, that could do giving, that could do things that could scale, but that end up falling into what got them to be successful in act two and they get stuck. So this is the reason why when you hit your skip, keep looking for the next skip, is the point I'm trying to make. And I think you're an inspiration for a lot of folks who have seen you transition and realizes life after just being a tech professional entrepreneur, there's got to be ways to do more of this for all of your listeners. And I think it's never too early to start thinking through. It's actually quite powering to think that you have such a long career. You can make mistakes and you can do some amazing things down the road.\n\nLenny (01:08:34):\nYeah. This is my fourth career, is what I realized. I was a engineer, then a founder, then a product manager, and now whatever this is.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:08:43):\nWhatever this is.\n\nLenny (01:08:45):\nWhatever this is. I guess, just to give people something inspiring, productive, what are maybe some examples of North Stars you've seen that people can evolve into? I guess one path is this path of content creation, helping people learn stuff. What else have you seen that might work out for people?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:09:00):\nI think that all variations here come into two categories. One categories are ways to drive more scaled economics. I've made millions. My North Star is to now make it tens. I've made tens. My North star is to do hundreds. That's what drives people from, it's not entrepreneurship, it's investing; it's not investing, it's private equity, et cetera. Whether we describe that as a bad quest or a good quest is a decision for your listener. The other arc is around giving. Eastern philosophies that have been around for thousands of years talk about this as the sort of end state of happiness. I think that maybe to be provocative, I think that it's okay for you in act one and act two to not predicate yourself around the notion of giving to others because this is maybe the time on the planet where you need to take and you need to create.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:10:11):\nBut boy, if you're going to work on an act three and you have 30 years, regardless of where you are economically, if you feel like you can take that off the table, if you can find ways to give, whatever that means to you, however that translates to you, is that content, is that volunteer, is that starting a company that is more mission based, that is not my role, but I think that if you are able to do that for 30 years and be giving, not only is that going to be more fulfilling than your act one and act two, but it's tremendous for society, very empowering. And that's where I commend you because you're giving through your passion but also making a livelihood. And I think that that's a very powerful blend that is hard to achieve in act one and act two given constraints. And that's the liberation that act three provides.\n\nLenny (01:11:08):\nWhat do you think your act three plus ends up being?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:11:12):\nMany have asked me about this. I would say that I'll use the word, and then I'll tell you I won't use that word. So it is around my passion around coaching and giving to others. But because I'm a product person, because I've seen success in building products, thinking about scale, thinking about community, I definitively plan to devote my act three towards coaching and giving to others and lifting up those that with the right advice at the right time can change their trajectory. But scaling that and doing that in a way that is very authentic is really the hardest part and it's product problem. So that's what I'll devote 30 years to and I look forward to that every day.\n\nLenny (01:11:59):\nThat is beautiful. That feels like an exactly correct fit for you, and I'm here to help you on that journey any way I can.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:12:05):\nThank you, my friend.\n\nLenny (01:12:06):\nAbsolutely. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:12:11):\nNo, I just appreciate your genuine offer to have me attend and participate in this wonderful podcast that you created.\n\nLenny (01:12:18):\nIt's absolutely my pleasure. And it's not over yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:12:25):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny (01:12:26):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:12:30):\nSo two, and both business books. Sorry, I'm going to come across boring. But one is this sort of little bit of an old school book called Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore. I don't know if other speakers have spoken about this, but it's a book that Geoffrey Moore wrote, and it's a book that really talks about how to get your first product on base. So it's this concept of creating a beachhead. I like that concept. Marketing is something that we don't talk about in enough and product.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:13:02):\nAnd then the second one is a book that none of your listeners have actually probably heard of called Leadership and Self-Deception. It's a six-hour audio that I highly recommend. It's a story about a person who has hit a wall and who's getting all this feedback that they don't know what to make of, and it's around their mindset being stuck in a box. That was very powerful when I listened to it in my late 20s. So I encourage all of your listeners to grab that one. It's not one that anyone normally would hit, but it's a fun story. It's a good ride, and I think maybe you'll get something out of it.\n\nLenny (01:13:41):\nI have not heard of that second one. I'm excited to check it out. I have Crossing the Chasm back behind me on that shelf somewhere. And you talk about how marketing isn't something product leaders and managers think about enough, and I have many marketing-oriented guests on this podcast and those episodes do the least well, but I'm just going to keep doing it because I totally agree with you. I think there's so much to learn from marketing. It's connected to growth, which is connected to product. So I agree.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:14:07):\nYeah, and I think that marketing is a language of connecting products with people. That is what a product manager does, but we often lack the language. We lack the thinking around how to explain it, and yet we spend all our time on data and features for that. The diversity of having both playbooks can make one of just a much more powerful builder. So I agree with you. Marketing folks is probably some of the best content and the least listen to. So maybe that's a plug for people to go back to those episodes.\n\nLenny (01:14:39):\n100%. That's what everyone should do. I don't know if you know this, but actually, at Airbnb, the product manager function has been renamed to product marketing. So all the product managers are product marketers because Brian is so big on, you're not just building product, your job is also to make sure people use it. We'll see how that experiment goes, but that's a bold move I thought.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:14:59):\nVery much so. Very much. But it's an homage to this concept.\n\nLenny (01:15:02):\nExactly. Okay, back to landing ground. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:15:08):\nI'm a huge sports fan, so I have tickets to the Warriors and 49ers, and I am a big Bay Area sports fan. Giannis is my son's favorite player. He's a basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks, and they have this Disney+ story called the Rise story, and it's a story about his childhood and how he struggled to find notoriety and how he made it into the professional leagues. It's a great Disney+ family show and it's a great kind of zero to hero type thing. So I love that story.\n\nLenny (01:15:41):\nI feel like you're going to have a really good answer to this next one. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:15:47):\nI like the format of, what's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate? Sometimes I'll ask a manager, \"Look, you've managed hundreds of people in your career, what's conventional wisdom that you bet against that you have found is actually inaccurate?\" And you can do that for what do people think about AI, that's inaccurate, that everyone believes you could do that for domains, you can do all kinds of things.\n\nLenny (01:16:18):\nI love it. Is there something you specifically look for there, or is it just depends on what you hear?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:16:25):\nI'm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset. Everyone always prepares for interviews and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say. And as a result, you can have high-quality people that you dismiss because they weren't genuine. There's no way to answer that question without being genuinely opinionated because it starts with, \"What is the thing that you think I want to say here? And then tell me why it's inaccurate.\" So when I break that wall, I'm testing, is this person authentic? Because sometimes I'm dismissing them because they told me nothing new, but I don't want the interview process to penalize them. And this was my save question, but I can't use it now that I've told everyone.\n\nLenny (01:17:27):\nIt's going to be all over TikTok soon. Everyone's going to know this. Next question, what's a favorite recent product that you've discovered that you love?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:17:35):\nThe geeky answer in me is the Arc Browser, which I think probably a lot of folks are starting to use and your listeners. Part of the reason is, I think it's just great for folks that have hundreds of tabs, and if you work at a scaled organization, you just have lots of tabs. But I think it's also, as a product guy, I thought Chrome was pretty good. They've got gajillions of people using it and billions of installs. So at some point, you kind of come to the conclusion that this is probably good enough. And then you see a product obviously built with a much smaller team and you're like, \"Huh, there actually is opportunities to innovate.\" And any time you see a innovation on something that's mature, as a product person, I think that's just fascinating. And I was just blown away at how they created something that's better than something I hold as a true set.\n\nLenny (01:18:33):\nYeah. We had Josh on the podcast, we talked about a lot of their philosophies. And on the tab thing, I think the key there is it closes your tabs after 24 hours unless you put them in a specific place, which I love because I was like, you think you would do that, but you don't. And then it's broke so beautiful, you wake up in the morning, everything's gone, but you can save stuff that you want. The other thing I'll mention with Arc, by the way, also huge fan, that's all I use, and I'm not an investor, just a fan, is the onboarding experience is the best onboarding experience I've seen. I was just like, I did it and I got a tweet about this. This is so good. And actually, if you go to that episode, there's a link to get past the wait list and just-\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:19:11):\nOh, that's right. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:19:12):\nYeah. You gave me many thousands of invites. Okay, keep going. What is something relatively minor you've changed in the way you develop products and your team that's had a big impact on the team's ability to execute?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:19:26):\nA little bit of this is just because of scale, but oftentimes we think a lot about the products and the features and the decisions that we're working on, and then we think that meetings are a nuisance or a must-have necessary evil to be able to deliver. Sometimes I realize that at a scaled organization, the meeting operating system is as important as the products that we're building because it sort of speaks to how we scale and how we ensure we have the right degree of delegation, the right conversations, and then the right acceleration on the right decisions.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:20:11):\nSo what's interesting is every quarter, in my current teams, even in my past teams, I talk about our meetings like a product. We're on version seven in my team, and so we're like, \"Hey, version seven, every 90 days, these are the meetings, these are the discussions, this is how we organize, these are the attendees, and then here's how we make decisions. This is the cadence of the week. This is when people can work from home, hybrid, whatever it might be.\" And then I take feedback two months in and then every three months we make another route.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:20:44):\nWhat it finds is that people then can plan and they can make meeting time effective. And meeting time is such precious time. It's the most expensive time in a company. So when I was in a startup, I couldn't imagine doing this, but now this is like my bread and butter as a leader. It's the process part. And frankly, for new folks that are new in leadership positions in a new company, it's the one thing you can do when you have low context. When you don't know how the product works, you can look at things with fresh eyes and see inefficiencies when everyone that's been in the system can't see it. I'm a huge fan of rebooting meetings first. So process first, then people, then product, then strategy is sort of the notion I make, and this is this first thing I always do.\n\nLenny (01:21:29):\nFinal question, what is one thing every PM listening should do to help their career?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:21:35):\nEnsure that the story you will tell about the work you're doing today is meaningful for your skip job. So if you sit down and you write down, \"In six months, in 12 months, in 24 months, when I achieve or finish this role, here's the paragraph I'll write. Here's a problem I solved. Here's the skill I built. Here's the headwind I faced. Here's what I did to overcome it.\" Use I in the sentence, do not use we. We will do good things. You are who we are thinking about, your career. We're not looking for we. Master the story now. Understand the story. If the story sucks, you probably should be thinking through how to make the story not suck. But that to me is a very good career decision and I think everyone is building their story today. I want to know that story. I want that story to be incredibly compelling because whether you promote it or not, that story's compelling. You'll be promoted in career. And that's what we're here for.\n\nLenny (01:22:48):\nNikhyl, this is the first time we've ever met. I'm such a fan instantly. This might be my new favorite episode. I'm so excited for people to listen to this. There's so much value here. Two final questions before we wrap up. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more? And also, talk about maybe various community, The Skip, and all that stuff that people can check out. And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:23:09):\nI'm building this brand around The Skip because I'm so passionate. There's two outlets that people can easily connect. One is the podcast, which much like yourselves is available on Apple and Spotify and others. So I'd love for people to join my podcast and hear. What I'm now moving my podcast to is almost like coaching calls. Because I have so many of them, I'm saying like, \"Hey, 30 minutes, let me walk you through a problem and hear how I'm thinking about it, whether that's a transition discussion or compensation discussion, et cetera.\" And then the other one is this sort of newsletter that I have on Substack, which is a bit of a mirror of the podcast. It's different forms of the same topic areas. So, would love for your listeners to connect with that.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:23:54):\nI think as far as getting in touch with me, LinkedIn is where I spend most of my time professionally. So between Twitter and LinkedIn, my presence is relatively easy to find. And then how listeners can help me, I mean, one, you can build the most fulfilling career story and be your best, but also give back and pull others forward. Whether that's through your act three or whether that's just helping others, I mean, I think that would be the most fulfilling to me. I think feedback from your listeners to me on things they wish I would spend time talking about is incredibly empowering for my content because then I can deliver more meaningful content. It's very different from yours, but I think it's all around the arc of trying to help people gain forward and be more effective tech professionals. So I would love to hear from your listeners.\n\nLenny (01:24:48):\nJust to make sure people know where to go to do this. For feedback, do you recommend LinkedIn?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:24:53):\nYeah, LinkedIn is the ideal, but you can also find me on Twitter if you are just trying to add a quick... If you're trying to follow me, follow me on LinkedIn. If you're looking for feedback, just tweet me.\n\nLenny (01:25:03):\nAnd then for The Skip newsletter, what is the URL to go check that out?\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:25:06):\nIt's theskip.substack.com.\n\nLenny (01:25:09):\nAmazing. And you don't publish often, but each issue is incredibly valuable, so we'll definitely link to that all in the show notes. Nikhyl, thank you again so much for being here. I will let you go now. This was amazing.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (01:25:21):\nYeah, thank you, Lenny. Appreciate it.\n\nLenny (01:25:23):\nBye, everyone.\n\nLenny (01:25:25):\nThank you so much for listening.

Honored to be on a product management podcast for a person who doesn't believe product management is real.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:07):\nWe're already getting into the hot takes. You launched tbh, went viral, you end up selling it to Facebook. What was the insight that helped you come up with this is a big idea that we should try?\n\nNikita Bier (00:00:15):\nI looked on the App Store and the number one app in the United States was an app called Surah, but the entire app was in Arabic, like the strongest signal that you could ever have that people want something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):\nThis is insane. I did not know this full story.\n\nNikita Bier (00:00:30):\nWe launched this app, it immediately took off, servers started crashing. I looked at our numbers and I'm like, \"We will be number one in the United States in six days.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):\nA tip that you're sharing here is look for latent demand\n\nNikita Bier (00:00:43):\nWhere people are trying to obtain a particular value and going through a very distortive process. If you can actually crystallize what their motivation is, you can have this kind of intense adoption.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):\nI didn't know you're actually a product manager at Facebook.\n\nNikita Bier (00:00:59):\nThe thing I didn't realize as a product manager in a large tech company is there is very little product management that you do. They're mainly just writing documents and then being the team secretary and running around getting approvals, but products live and die in the pixels. You should be designing the hierarchy, the pixels, the flows, everything. That's on you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:21):\nAt some point you started tweeting like, \"Hey, I'm working on new app. Everyone was going nuts.\" I saw a stat that you made $11 million in sales, 10 million downloads.\n\nNikita Bier (00:01:28):\nThe thing that is hard to really understand is it is absolute chaos to keep the thing online. I was sleeping three hours a day for three months. Our team was also relentless though. They would come over to my house, 9:00 AM, stay until midnight and just do that seven days a week.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:44):\nIs there anything else that's just like this is something that is probably going to help you with your app?\n\nNikita Bier (00:01:48):\nWith certainty, if you're good at your job, you can make an app grow and go viral. Over the years of building all these apps, I've accrued all these growth hacks that still nobody knows about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:02):\nToday, my guest is Nikita Bier. Nikita has built, launched and helped get more apps to the top of the app store than any human I've ever come across. He sold his first big hit tbh to Facebook for over $30 million. He sold his second big app Gas to Discord for many millions more. He did this all with a tiny team and very little funding. He's also helped dozens of founders and apps, and as an advisor or investor to companies like Flow, Citizen, BeReal, LOCKit and Wealthsimple and many more. Today, he spends his time advising companies on viral growth strategies, design feedback, structuring their product development process and a lot more.\n\n(00:02:38):\nWhat I love about Nikita is that he has very strong opinions about how to build successful products that are rooted in him actually doing the work over the past decade to see for himself what works and what doesn't. Nikita has been the single most requested guests on this podcast, and you'll soon see why. This episode is packed with tactics and stories and lessons that I am sure will leave you wanting more. If you want to work with Nikita on your app, you can actually book his time at intro.co/nikitabier.

With that, I bring you Nikita Bier. Nikita, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nNikita Bier (00:03:26):\nThanks for having me. I'm excited to dive in. I feel honored to be on a product management podcast for a person who doesn't believe product management is real.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:38):\nWe're already getting into the hot takes. We're definitely going to chat about... Wait, and you said not real. Okay, I thought you were going to say not useful. This is good. Let's put a pin in that. I think we think this, I think everyone already feels this. I think this is going to be a very special conversation. I've been looking forward to chatting you for a long time and there's so much that I want to ask you. The way that I'm thinking we frame this conversation is we go through the story behind the apps that you've built or helped build that have hit the top of the app store, and basically here, the inside story of what it took to build those apps and to make them successful. Then through that, try to extract as many lessons as we can about what it takes to build a successful viral consumer app these days. How does that sound to you?\n\nNikita Bier (00:04:22):\nSounds amazing, and a lot of it was luck, but a lot of it was very, very tactical work that went into it all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:32):\nThis episode is brought to you by Webflow. We're all friends here, so let's be real for a second. We all know that your website shouldn't be a static asset. It should be a dynamic part of your strategy that drives conversions, that's business 101. Here's a number for you. 54% of leaders say web updates take too long.

That's vanta.com/lenny. First, I want to start with something that I think very few people know about you. The first thing that you built, the first product that you built was very different from what you do these days, and it's a product called Politify, which something I actually really want. It helps you decide who to vote for based on how it would impact your life. Can you just share a bit about just that part of your life and why you decided to pivot away from that into consumer apps?\n\nNikita Bier (00:06:36):\nWhen I was in college, I was really interested in this kind of thing that American voters do, which is they vote against their own financial self-interest, like people in New York and San Francisco vote for Democrats for higher taxes. People in Kansas vote for Republicans for low taxes and they make less money, and so fewer government benefits. I wanted to build this tool that would help communicate the financial impacts of these policy proposals of presidents. I built it in my last year of college and it was just a web app that we put out and it would calculate their tax proposals, the government benefits that they were proposing, and you would enter in your basic personal information, how many kids you have, your age. Then it would just tell you in dollars what the impact would be. It'd also tell you, we simulated those policies also against the tax returns of every zip code so you could see how it impacts your community.\n\n(00:07:40):\nWe went super viral. I think very few people thought of politics that way and I think we got 4 million users on it during that season, during that election. It was just like a project that we raised some grant money for, but it ended up feeding into this company that we spun up and that was called Outline. Because we had a bunch of governments reach out to us asking, \"Can you build this for our budget?\" The governor of Massachusetts actually reached out and I flew out there to meet with them and that was going to be our first customer. We raised some money, we won a government contract and we joined Techstars, the accelerator. We got a contract in the pipeline with the Obama administration and then we got this contract and we started building it and the government shutdown happened in the middle of like, as we were building it and we had one of our contracts canceled.\n\n(00:08:51):\nI realized I actually really don't like selling software to governments and my core competency all along was making things that go viral on the internet. That was what we had built, not this policy simulation tool. We went to our investors and we said, \"Look, this isn't actually what we're excited about doing anymore.\" We offered to give the money back and said, \"We're going to be building consumer apps and here's a few ideas that we have.\" None of them took the money back. Then we spent the next four or five years building a variety of different kind of consumer apps. We had a few mild successes during the course of those four to five years. One of them was an app called Five Labs that ingested your Facebook posts and determine your personality based on the language you use. It used this exact same model that Cambridge Analytica used, and that was super viral. I think we had tens of millions of profiles in it and it went viral in like three days.\n\n(00:10:09):\nWe raised some more money based off the success of that and we started focusing a lot more on mobile after that first app, Five Labs. We launched basically every type of app you can imagine. We launched mapping apps, chat apps, event meetup apps. Basically, every consumer app on mobile that you could think of. That actually helped us build a muscle to understand what people want and how to actually make things grow and how to test them. Over time, we started focusing more on teens. A lot of people ask why Silicon Valley is so fixated on building apps for teens.\n\n(00:10:55):\nOne of the reasons is their habits are pretty malleable. As we get older, we get fixed into our habits of using certain communication products and we don't really adopt new things. Then the other thing that we discovered was that adults don't really invite people to new apps. We found that as a user got older from age 13 to 18, the number of people that they invite to an app just declines almost exponentially. Finally, and the most important thing is they see each other every day, and that is so critical. Consumer app developers sometimes say smokers are great for targeting an audience because they actually hang out serendipitously a lot outside of buildings. Not to say social apps are cigarettes, I don't really like that metaphor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:50):\nJust on the note of you talking about why teens are important, I have this quote actually from you that I love where building on the point you made that for every social app I've ever built and the number of invitations sent per user drops 20% for every additional year of age from 13 to 18. If you build for adults, expect to acquire every user with ads, and I love that you have a very clear heuristic of per year, the amount of people they invite to the app is 20% lower.\n\nNikita Bier (00:12:18):\nIf your users aren't inviting people to your app, you're going to have to find another way to acquire them, and that most likely means ads. If you're targeting older cohorts like adults, you're going to have to raise a huge amount of venture capital to finance that user acquisition pipeline and it's going to be extraordinarily expensive. As a seed stage up, it's going to be basically impossible to grow that user base, especially to get density if you need actual network effects among users.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:56):\nBasically, you're building this help me decide who to vote for app that turned into a real business with government contracts coming to you trying to help you, pushing you to build something that you end up realizing I don't want to be doing this. Why am I building this app selling government contracts. What you did is you, and this is a really interesting lesson to take away, is you just realized, I don't want to be doing this. Investors don't force me to be working on this. I'm going to stop this. I'm going to go work on some other stuff that I'm actually excited about that I think has a bigger chance of success. That's where you transition to this startup studio where you're just trying a bunch of apps and I think it was called Midnight Labs, you said, something like that, right?\n\nNikita Bier (00:13:34):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:34):\nAwesome. Basically, I think that's a really interesting insight of just like if you're working on something you don't enjoy, you can change that, you can pivot, you can tell your investors I want to work on something else. Is there anything there that you want to add along those lines?\n\nNikita Bier (00:13:49):\nIt was really hard for us to pivot to mobile. I think that was one of the most challenging things for me personally because it was a completely different paradigm. I actually have been building web apps since I was 12 years old. I built a full e-commerce business selling pirated games on the web, and I knew everything about growing a website. As we pivoted to mobile, I had to recalibrate my whole brain on how to do that. Mobile apps have such a low margin for error when it comes to designing them. Because I have this dogmatic view that every tap on a mobile app is a miracle for you as a product developer because users will turn and bounce to their next app very quickly.\n\n(00:14:46):\nIf you actually sit behind someone and watch them use their phone, they actually switch between apps at a pretty high frequency. Every tap that you get, every single one is so scarce that you should be optimizing everything. I had to change my whole brain when we started pivoting to mobile and building these mobile apps, and it took a lot of failures. 14 of the apps that we launched were basically duds, and then we started fixating on teens and building apps for them. Eventually, we figured out an interesting heuristic for identifying consumer product opportunities that ultimately led us to tbh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:27):\nYou spent four or five years trying a bunch of different ideas. I think people see this headline and we'll get into tbh of just like nine weeks after launch sells for $30 million to Facebook and everyone's like, \"Oh, okay, that's amazing. I want that for my life.\" Nobody knows there's this four or five years of trying, you said 15 different apps before you got there, learning the things that actually work and don't work.\n\nNikita Bier (00:15:49):\nWe built 15 apps over the course of that pivot to consumer, and we built apps for every single app, map apps, chat apps, to-do lists. We just built every type of consumer app you could possibly think of. Also, we built for every audience too. We built for college students, we built for post-college. It was always very difficult to get the flywheel spinning for anyone after like 22 years old. That was the cutoff of when people just give up on adopting new products. It took us a few years to really internalize that, a lot of failures to realize no one needs another app after that age.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:44):\nThe thing that you found there, which is really interesting because most people are building for people older than 22, that's a profound insight you had there. Every consumer app I see is trying to build for adults, and your lesson there is basically if you're trying to do that, you're probably going to need to raise money and spend a lot of money on paid ads.\n\nNikita Bier (00:17:04):\nMost likely, you'll never get network effects. There's actually an interesting study many years ago that some academics in Spain did, I think it was in Spain, and they looked at how many people you text per year of your life, and it goes up very quickly from 14 to 18. It peaks around 21, so it's growing. The number of people you text is growing up until about 21, and then it just falls, it collapses, and then it comes back up at end of life. There's a few reasons all this happens, but basically, once you exit college, you reduce the number of contacts, your daily contacts.\n\n(00:17:48):\nOnce you get married, it's even fewer. Then as you get older and your kids start having kids and you become a grandparent, you start texting again more or you join a retirement home. If you're building a product with network effects that's a communication tool, you want to be on that upward curve of adding connections to your social graph because then the urgency to connect is higher. If you really want to actually innovate at the edges of communication products, you really have to target that cohort that has the highest urgency to communicate, and that's teens.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:28):\nI love that you found these things out, not through just research and not through just thinking, it was through actual trying things over and over and over and trying different audiences, trying different experiences. A lot of people see your advice and they're like, \"How does he know?\" It's just you've done all these things yourself. You've seen them, you're sitting there watching teens use these apps. I think very few people actually do that, and they just come up with these theories that aren't based in empirical evidence.\n\nNikita Bier (00:18:55):\nWe got pretty good at building these apps. I think our first mobile app took us about a year, and then our last one took us about two weeks. We also got very good at testing apps. The most important thing that I often instruct teams to do is to develop a reproducible testing process, and that will actually influence the probability of your success more than anything. It's so unpredictable whether a consumer product idea will work. If you actually focus more on your process for taking many shots at bat, that's what actually reduces the risk more than anything. We figured out ways to seed apps into schools. We also, during the course of that company, we figured out how to seed it into affinity groups, hobbyists, things like that. We were on app number 15, a lot of failures during the course of this company, and I remember a lot of our team members were like, \"I kind of want to leave. I think this is it for me.\"\n\n(00:20:08):\nOne of our key team members actually put in their two weeks' notice. The day before we launched our final app, we were getting kind of low on money. I was tired. I called our lawyer to ask, how do you dissolve a company? I messaged a few mentors saying like, one people that have been through it, and I said, \"What are the steps to do this?\" Then I had a conversation on the way out with that team member that wanted to leave, and I said, \"I understand, but what if the app actually starts charting on the App Store?\" He said, \"What are the chances of that? You know that's not going to happen.\" I said, \"Sure, okay.\" We launched this app and it was a polling app, tbh, and it immediately took off in the school that we seeded it into, in Georgia. We picked the one school that had the earliest start date in the United States because we needed to launch as soon as possible, given the state of the company.\n\n(00:21:26):\nI think it spread to 40% of the school downloaded it in the first 24 hours and it rapidly spread to the neighboring schools. Suddenly, I was like, \"Oh, we might have something here.\" Servers started crashing and watching it climb the charts. I looked at our numbers and I'm like, \"We will be number one in the United States in six days.\" Then I looked at our Amazon bill and it was like 120,000. I looked at our bank account, it said 150,000. I'm like, \"Okay, these two numbers don't really...\" I quickly had to put together a funding round and I told my team, \"Can you guys just pause for two months and just really focus on this? I think I could probably sell this thing.\" It turned into a pretty competitive bidding process, actually. There was a really, really great moment where there was one of the acquirers, or one of the bidders was based in LA, had told me to fly down, and they told me to fly down that day.\n\n(00:22:40):\nI got on a plane, went to the airport without a ticket, showed up. When we were rolling out this app, we were doing a state-by-state rollout strategy where every state was geo-fenced. We hadn't launched California until that morning. I arrived at this company, this founders in LA's house, and he said, \"Show me the metrics. You guys are like, what? Number four or something?\" Since we just launched California, it's a big state. I said, \"No, we're actually number one. We're the number one app in the United States.\" He said, \"Show me the metrics.\" Our CTO, Erik Hazzard, is a published author in mapping. He created an amazing dashboard that could show real-time installs on a map. It was around 4:00 PM and school had just gotten out, so I zoomed in on the block that we were having that meeting, and the entire block was lit up with installs all around us. Then that's what got the ball rolling on a... It was a really, really like, cinematic moment of showing something that you created that literally just took over the entire neighborhood around you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:02):\nThat's insane. That's going to be in the movie of Nikita Bier in the future. A couple of questions here. One, you predicted the chart, you would hit number one. What does it take to hit number one? What is the number you're looking at? Is it some number downloads to get to number one in the App Store?\n\nNikita Bier (00:24:17):\nIt fluctuates. It used to be like 80 to 100,000 installs, but now you have these companies that are just spending extraordinary amounts on ads and or injecting it into one of their other apps. Between Threads, Temu and all these other apps that are spending on acquisition and all that, some days it's up to 300,000.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):\nThat's per day?\n\nNikita Bier (00:24:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:42):\nOh, man. Amazing.\n\nNikita Bier (00:24:43):\nAt the peak of tbh, we were getting 360,000 per day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:50):\nThe other two things I want to spend a little time on here before we move on to the next app is, what was the insight that helped you come up with this is a big idea that we should try? Then what was the insight into how to spread this so virally? I know that one is really close.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):\n... to how to spread this so virally, and I know that one is really clever.\n\nNikita Bier (00:25:04):\nAfter building all these apps, we had these kind of lingering users that stuck around and would share feedback with us on our next app. And so there were a couple, like there's a senior in high school that I would send screenshots of our products. He told me about this trend called TBH that kids were playing on Snapchat, where they would post an image of a bunch of emojis and it would say like, \"I like you. Your smart. Your style is great.\" And you would just reply to the story with the emoji of what you felt. And I was like, \"This is kind of weird. You post this on your story and then people send you feedback.\" And I'm like, \"So teens are looking for this vehicle for disclosure essentially.\" And I'm like, \"That's kind of cool. I wonder if you could make that into an app.\" We had sketched some things out. As we were sketching things out, I looked on the app store, and the number one app in the United States was an app called Sarahah. It was for sending anonymous messages by adding a link to your Snapchat story.\n\n(00:26:17):\nBut the thing that was most interesting was the entire app was in Arabic. The number one app in the United States was in Arabic. And that was one of the most strongest signal that you could ever have that people want something. And so when I meet with founders, I often tell them like, \"The way you should be searching for product ideas is this concept of latent demand where people are trying to obtain a particular value and going through a very distortive process to obtain that value.\" And if you can actually crystallize what their motivation is and build a product around and clear up what they're trying to actually do, you can have this kind of intense adoption.\n\n(00:27:11):\nWhen we saw what people were doing with Sarahah, I also looked at some of the tweets and comments on it. A lot of people were receiving negative messages. And so what I saw with the game that kids were playing on Snapchat TBH and then Sarahah, I realized just people want to know good things about themselves and that they don't want these bullying messages that they're getting on these anonymous apps, and I was like, \"Well, what if instead of actually typing what you wanted to say about somebody, you just answered polls and we authored those polls so that we ensured everything would always be positive?\"\n\n(00:27:51):\nI mean, in the back of my head, I always knew anonymous apps go viral, but they always lead to these awful news stories of kids committing suicide, self-harm and all that. And so I was like, \"I'll never build anything like that.\" But when we came up with this new mechanic where you could only say positive things through polls, who has the best smile, who's most likely to be president, and then you receive it as anonymous, but your name is selected, what we discovered a couple of things is it made users feel a lot better. It actually solved what they were trying to do and they also sent a much higher volume of messages. And so it was literally explosive adoption.\n\n(00:28:35):\nOne school I was looking at, they sent 450,000 messages in the first seven days of adopting it. And when you look at day one volume of messages sent on a messaging app, you're lucky if people send three or four or something, but we were sending 60 and we couldn't even handle it, so we had to geofence the app because we needed to scale our servers, which is actually a pretty controversial decision inside of our company, because why would you turn off something that's working? But at my core, I knew if it's working at this many individual schools, we could just relaunch it any time and it'll go viral. So let's regroup and figure out what's happening here and then relaunch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):\nSo you keep talking about how went viral and crazy, grew like crazy. I know that there's a little trick that you came up with to help it spread. Can you just briefly talk about what you did there and to help it spread so quickly within a school?\n\nNikita Bier (00:29:37):\nI think you're referring to, there's a memo that was leaked to BuzzFeed while I was at Facebook. The main thing we found was like, to be convinced to download an app, you need to see it. You need to see the marketing message three times or so. So you basically need to saturate an area with every kind of marketing you can. So we ran ads targeted at a particular school to when we were seeding and testing these apps. And we also followed people creating a dedicated Instagram account that went to that school, because we learned that high schoolers identify their school in their bio, so it says RHS on their bio. And so that was how we tried to get the entire school to adopt synchronously. We'd follow them and then accept the followbacks.\n\n(00:30:36):\nBig misunderstanding though, and I get this DM a lot of people are like, \"I'm trying to replicate your strategy. We've just done it at 15 schools and it's not working anymore.\" This is not the way we grew the app. This is how we tested apps. Really, it's a little bit nuanced there. That's an important nuance because you need to get enough intensity of adoption and density for a social network to start to get the flywheel spinning, but the app should grow by itself after that. And people think we just went from school to school following every kid on it. You can't, that's totally unrealistic. But for the first 100 users, yes, that's how we got them. And that allowed us to know whether the product was working or not. We could get enough people on it and then we could, with conviction, say that whether the app had legs and we wouldn't have this kind of uncertainty like, \"Oh, did they add enough friends? Did we get enough people on it? Did they reach the aha moment because you need friends to get on?\"\n\n(00:31:41):\nSo we wanted to eliminate that confounding variable, and so we figured out a way to just get a bunch of people to adopt at once. And that's one thing I encourage a lot of founders to do, is figure out a way to eliminate all those potentially confounding variables so you can know immediately whether something's working or not. You never want to walk away from an experiment or test and say, \"Well, maybe the execution was bad because it takes a lot of energy to mobilize a team to test something,\" and you really want to make sure your tests actually provide signal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:18):\nSo your advice here is when you're testing something, test the best possible version of what that could be, whether it takes manual work or something that is never going to scale, test the ideal. Because that'll tell you, \" Even if this could be the best possible version, do people actually care?\"\n\nNikita Bier (00:32:34):\nYeah, we would try to get an entire school to adopt, just to know if everyone had 10 friends, would they actually derive value from this app? We also did other things, and I recommend all companies do this, is put live chat customer support in your app 24 hours a day. It sounds insane. It's like the whole point of tech is you don't need to do that. That's the whole point of a software. But then users get this white glove experience, and that eliminates another confounding variable, like did they think their problems were solved or they were treated well? But most of all, one of the reasons I actually recommend people put live chat in their app is it's the best vehicle for getting feedback and doing user research because users will literally tell you the problem they're having. So we had our person that was running this. He's name is Michael Gutierrez. He's done it for all my companies actually. He's the community and customer support rep. He would paste any interesting feedback into Slack and then we would be like, \"Oh, this user has a great idea. We should consider turning that into a feature.\" So you really want your finger on the pulse as you roll these things out so you can get a sense for what's working, what isn't, and also make users feel great and make sure at the end they promote your app positively to their peers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:09):\nI love that piece of advice.\n\n(00:34:11):\nOkay, so to close out the TBH chapter, is there anything else that you think is important for people to know or any other lasting lessons from that part of your journey that you bring with you to new apps that you're building today?\n\nNikita Bier (00:34:25):\nI think the thing that is hard to really understand for first-time founders that hit breakout success with a consumer product is how draining and how spread thin you get, because everything breaks. Everything that you built needs to be substituted almost every three days.\n\n(00:34:52):\nI can just give you an example. We were just talking about this customer support system that we had. The first system broke after three days. The next one broke seven days later, we had to replace it with a different one that could scale even better. And if you think about that on every dimension of the company, it is absolute chaos to keep the thing online as it scales up. And so you have to be ruthless with prioritization as something scales up and put out the largest fires first, because that was something that I didn't really fully understand, is how many things go wrong. And if we didn't geofence the app, there would be no way we would've been able to keep that thing online because that gave us some slack to control growth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:55):\nThis is a good example of when people ask like, \"Hey, does my app have product-market fit?\" I think this is an example of this is what it looks like when things are breaking every three days when you have to geofence it to keep it from crashing.\n\nNikita Bier (00:36:06):\nA lot of people ask me like, \"What's the benchmark for product-market fit?\" And this founder that I'm friends with, his name's Roger Dickey, he told me this one time, \"If your product's working, you'll know. And if there's any uncertainty, it's not working.\" And it really is a binary when it comes to consumer products. People are going to be fighting to get into it and you'll find new measures that you've never heard of like, \"Our metric was hourly actives per day.\" Not daily active users, hourly active users. So you'll start seeing that and it'll be abundantly obvious what product-market fit is. You'll know it when you see it is the bottom line.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:59):\nOkay, so you launch TBH, it goes viral, start getting offers from companies. Nine weeks later after launch, you end up selling it to Facebook. What was it like selling your company and then what was it like working at Facebook? Which you worked at for four years. I was not expecting that when I was looking at your LinkedIn. So yeah, what was it like selling? What was it like working at Facebook?\n\nNikita Bier (00:37:22):\nSelling your company is one of the most draining processes you could ever go through as a founder. When we met with Facebook, they told me they have 80 people assigned to this deal. And I'm like, I have one person, it's just me. They were like the SWAT team of M&A.\n\n(00:37:45):\nThe funniest part was they wanted to meet the team as well. And so they came out to our office in Oakland, which is a dingy old office that I got for $1,800 a month. That was our rent for the office. They arrive and they walk in. There's two engineers and one designer and me, and they're just like, \"This is the whole company? This is the number one app in the United States?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, this is it.\" And when we went there, when we arrived, we joined the youth team, which was about, I don't know, 150 people just for this one division of Facebook. It was my first job effectively that I've ever had.\n\n(00:38:31):\nWhen they told me my title, they said I would be a product manager, I was like, \"Okay, I don't know exactly what that is, but yeah, I guess that's what I do.\" I arrive and then I get access to a workplace system where people post all the things they're working on, and I realized it's kind of like this almost academic environment for social networks, like social network development. It's like the Harvard of social networks. I was reading all these studies that people were doing on like, \"Oh, if we change that, this is the impact to retention and DAU.\" I was so impressed, like, \"There's a whole science here.\"\n\n(00:39:20):\nA lot of the stuff that we did was learned from first principles, but then we saw it actually turn into systems and processes here. But the thing I didn't realize as a product manager in a large tech company is there is very little product management that you do. You're actually not as involved in the product as I had assumed. I thought, \"Oh, you're the person who gets in the pixels and designs the flows.\" Absolutely not. You're completely detached from the design process. There's a design vertical org that does all that and they don't really want you working on that. So that was very difficult for me because when people ask me like, \"What do you think you're good at?\" At the core, I'm a designer. I don't consider myself a product manager. I'm great at growing things, looking at mixed panel and then designing the things that make it grow. But there's a rift between those two things inside of a large tech company.\n\n(00:40:27):\nAnd so I loved the academic approach to growing, but it was really hard for me personally as I became disconnected from the design process. I think that a lot of my skills atrophied over those four years. But I did stick around. I went through multiple orgs. Favorite one at the end was new product experimentation where I worked with other founders, a bunch of legends in Silicon Valley, building zero to one products, standalone apps. I mean, I was building standalone apps my entire time at Facebook. I think I built probably eight apps while I was at Facebook.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:11):\nWow.\n\nNikita Bier (00:41:12):\nBut it is much, much more difficult to build apps at a large company. A lot of the insights that you have are not things that you can necessarily present or put in writing in a VP meeting, like, \" We're building an app for teens to flirt.\" That probably is not what you would present to a bunch of McKinsey consultants at. So I think that makes it really difficult to be completely intellectually honest about what you're building. And when the team isn't honest about it, then it's really hard to iterate toward the right thing in that context. Having said that, there's a lot of things you don't have to deal with as a product... I don't have to deal think about money, I don't have to think about paying legal bills or doing finance and accounting. So all that's abstracted away, but there is regulatory stuff that you have to deal with that I had zero exposure to as a founder of a small company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:20):\nAn insight you're sharing there potentially is the reason a company like Facebook isn't amazing at launching completely new product, zero to one stuff, is they might be a little too risk averse and it's hard to talk about stuff that people actually really, really want deeply. Is that kind of the sense there?\n\nNikita Bier (00:42:37):\nIt's hard to really verbalize some of the things that motivate us as people. There's a tweet I put out that's kind of dogmatic in terms of how I view why people download apps and it's very simple. It's like people download apps to make or save money. Examples of that might be like WhatsApp, where free texting. And then the other reason is to find a mate, so maybe like Tinder or Snapchat, find love. And the third is to unplug from reality maybe like Netflix or Fortnite. There's a bunch of other kind of subcategories that are very utilitarian like movement, Uber or Airbnb, like shelter. And so I think putting that in a framing document and the particular nuanced reason why people are going to adopt is difficult when you're presenting that to people that are seasoned professionals and care about how something might reflect on them personally.\n\n(00:43:51):\nAnd so that's really difficult inside of a large company. You'd certainly have distribution advantages. If you want to just inject your app into one of the parent apps and get density within a community, you could do that. But that part I think is probably solvable for a startup if you just want to pay for ads. Getting your app into a dense friend graph is overall trivial. As a founder, you should be able to pull it off after enough tries. So that advantage that a big company brings, I mean it makes it easier, but it's not something that I think is something that a founder can't solve for themselves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:38):\nSo an interesting takeaway it sounds like is many people feel like, \"I'm going to build a social app.\" They probably often hear, \"Facebook's going to do that. Instagram's going to copy you. Snap's going to do that.\" And what I'm hearing here is it's not as easy as many people think, that it might be actually a lot harder for them to try something.\n\nNikita Bier (00:44:54):\nIt's not only harder for them to identify these opportunities and to verbalize it internally and align the company around it. It's also hard to respond to signals in the market. A lot of people think these incumbents are going to steal your ideas. And for the most part, it takes a pretty long time for them to respond to even the number one app or charting in the app because it'll start charting in the app store, a PM will make a post about it. And then the market's strategy or market research team might do a study to follow up on it. It'll kind of float around for a few months. They might put together a framing deck saying, \"Hey, we should go after this opportunity. Let's put together this team. It'll go through VP reviews. And then it'll start development. Development might take six to 12 months.\" Realistically, I think most companies, large companies take 12 to 24 months to respond to competitive threats in the market.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:03):\nDo you think this is solvable? Is there something a company can change to get better at this? Are there companies that are good at this in your experience, or is this just as you grow, this is just what happens?\n\nNikita Bier (00:46:13):\nThe incentives within large companies make this very difficult, because you don't want to present something that you have a hunch about being a good idea because if there's not market signals already, then it's hard to defend. People in companies are focused on getting their yearly bonus or they're focused on their performance reviews. It's hard to show up into a framing meeting saying like... And a framing meeting is a meeting where you are positioning the opportunity and everything, \"Here's what we should go after.\" It's hard to just say, \"Okay, by first principles, this is a good idea and here's some very vague market signals.\" In reality, you need to walk in and say, \"Here's the number one app in the United States and we don't own it.\" If you present something like that, that's pretty defensible if you fail because there was market evidence. But if you fail about something that's more based on kind of vague abstract...\n\n(00:47:19):\nSo you have to, generally, the only path is to copy existing products if you want to really get momentum inside of a large organization. And for completely new concepts, it's I think very difficult to present a lot of those ideas, either to verbalize them into a document or to even get rally the organization around it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:42):\nThat's a really interesting insight.\n\n(00:47:45):\nThis episode is brought to you by Explo, a game changer for customer facing analytics and data reporting. Are your users craving more dashboards, reports, and analytics within your product? Are you tired of trying to build it yourself? As a product leader, you probably have these requests in your roadmap, but the struggle to prioritize them is real.

That's E-X-P-L-O, .C-O/Lenny.\n\n(00:48:57):\nBefore we move on to the next chapter, I want to come back to the very first thing you said where product management is not real. Is there anything else that you can say about your insight there? Or is it basically what you described where PMs aren't actually involved in design and a company like Facebook in your experience?\n\nNikita Bier (00:49:14):\nThe functional organization structure of big tech has kind of separated product managers from the product development process in many ways. They're not looking at data because data scientists are doing that. They're just parsing some of the reports that they get back. They're mainly just writing documents and then kind of being the team secretary and running around, getting approvals from each cross-functional team, legal privacy, everything like that. And yeah, you're actually very much separated from the product itself. And so I think what Snapchat has done, and I think Apple too, to the same extent, is that designers run the show. And I think that's led to some very novel-\n\nNikita Bier (00:50:00):\nAnd I think that's led to some very novel products coming out from both of those companies. But I mean that is its own host of problems because actually rolling out a product inside of a large organization, it requires a sheer force of will because it's a lot of work. I mean, there's a lot of regulatory scrutiny, scaling it up. You do need someone to project manage. And so I don't know if it's the silver bullet as to give designers the reign to run the show, but I also don't think the current traditional like Google, Facebook style of being team secretaries is also the best solution.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:44):\nTo defend product managers, I think many product managers spend a lot of time in design, spend a lot of time with data science. I think probably what you saw is like the extreme big, big, big tech version of product management. I know even PMs at Facebook can if they want to spend time with design. I think it's just obviously very different from a startup world where you're just, that's all you're doing.\n\nNikita Bier (00:51:05):\nYeah, it's certainly an exaggerated view, but it's particularly relevant I think for all the zero to one initiatives because if you're a product manager on a standalone app inside of a large, like you should be designing the hierarchy, the pixels, the flows, everything. And then yeah, it should be cleaned up prototype by a technical designer, but that's your idea. And products live and die in the pixels, like consumer products, so that's on you. And that's where I think for maybe larger growth initiatives, yes, you can be a little more detached from the pixels.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:43):\nI love that advice. Okay, before we move on to the next phase of your journey of starting Gas, I heard there's an interesting story around where you were actually put within the Facebook office physically, where your team was put. Is there something there?\n\nNikita Bier (00:51:57):\nYeah. When we joined the new product experimentation group, we were actually seated I think at basically the same desk as Mark Zuckerberg. And that was pretty cool to see how the machine runs from Zuck's view. But we had a few artifacts that we had kept with us from our old office when we were running tbh, and one of them was this kind of pop art painting that I bought on the street when I needed to get something on the walls for our office. And it was this giant painting of Tim Cook. We had been carrying it between our orgs at Facebook just because it was a funny painting. And I kind of got it because it was kind of symbolic of who actually controls our destiny, is Apple. And so when we relocated to the area where Zuck was sitting, I put up the painting on the wall and it was basically a giant painting of Tim Cook was overlooking Zuck. And eventually one of the EAs there said, \"Actually, do you think you could take that home?\" And it kind of made sense because you can't really have a painting of another big tech executive overlooking us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:20):\nWhat does it look like? Do you happen to have it?\n\nNikita Bier (00:53:22):\nYeah, I actually do. Let me go grab it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:26):\nAmazing. Oh, wow. That's artistic. So that's Tim Cook. What is the idea there that he's peeking through this darkness staring at you?\n\nNikita Bier (00:53:36):\nYeah, yeah. He's the real boss of all of us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:41):\nI could see why Zuck would not want that staring at him all day. That's amazing. And I like that you still have that with you.\n\nNikita Bier (00:53:49):\nYeah. One of the artifacts of that chapter of life. So good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:54):\nOkay. So that was your Facebook journey, those four years. That's wild. You left Facebook. At some point, you started, I remember this, you started tweeting like, \"Hey, I'm working on new app.\" Everyone was going nuts. \"What are you working on?\" And at this point, I think you probably in your mind thought, I am this one-hit wonder, I haven't shown that I can do this again and again. And so I think you probably have this motivation. Maybe talk about that, just like this drive of like, hey, I want to do this again. Is that where your mind was at?\n\nNikita Bier (00:54:19):\nWhen that meme started, my intent was to start a venture-backed company and build something that would scale to be a big team and this durable thing that lasted many years and everything. And so I just made post that I was leaving Facebook and looking for some teammates. And I shared a couple of ideas with some people privately and there were some really crazy ideas that I shared. I'm not going to get into them, but then people started posting, \"Oh my God, I just saw Nikita's app. It's crazy.\" And what happened was others saw that and then they started memeing it and it became this massive meme where they're like, \"Oh, I just tried Nikita's app, it saved my marriage. Oh, I just quit drinking. My kids returned home after all these like,\" and it turned into this massive meme. And at the time, I didn't even have an app or anything. I wasn't even planning to launch it. It wasn't even an app, some of the ideas I was looking at. And so it just turned into this viral moment. I wasn't even committed to starting another company at that point. This was an exploration process.\n\n(00:55:48):\nBut what happened was the market had crashed shortly thereafter, there was kind of the end of the Zerb era. The Fed started hiking rates. I think my portfolio was down like 30% or something and I was like, \"Damn, this sucks. Maybe I should think about how to make money today.\" That's the reason we're in startups is to make money. And so there was always in the back of my head this question that I had, which was what if we had monetized tbh? Because the number one support message we received was can I pay to reveal who sent me polls? It was the number one question. And it was like, would it have made even more than the acquisition if we just monetized it? And I'm like, we could probably build this pretty fast, like probably in a month, month or two. Ended up being a lot longer, but we started rebuilding it. It was a new team. It was one of the engineers from a company called Paparazzi. His name's Zay Turner, and he started building it in my house and we had tested it to see would this new version of tbh actually resonate with kids five years later? That was actually the thing I wanted to know most of all was like would an anonymous polling app actually still be relevant five years later? And so we dropped it into the school just the same way I've always done it in-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:36):\nWas it the Georgia School again?\n\nNikita Bier (00:57:38):\nYes, actually. We launched at the exact same school that we launched tbh on the exact same day five years later, in fact. And people sent a lot of messages, but it wasn't growing. So let me pedal back here a bit. So tbh grew through variety of things, people sharing their messages to Snapchat and text invites, and that was 2017. And the way you invited your friends on tbh was that you tap their name, your contact name, and there was a button that said Invite and then we used Twilio to send them a text message. And the regulatory environment actually had changed a lot over those five years. You really can't send texts from a server anymore. It has to be sent from the user's device. And just the point of clarification is a lot of people clone tbh over the years and they think that when you voted on people in the polls, it sent them a text. We never did that. That's egregiously illegal to do and also unethical at a user experience level to send texts when people don't even know what's happening.\n\n(00:58:57):\nBut anyway, we couldn't send texts over Twilio anymore, and that led to people not sending as many invites when we created Gas because they had to pop the Compose window and hit Send. They're going to just tap Invite on five names. So we actually had to reinvent all the growth systems and it took about I think like nine launches including renaming the app, including features that just never existed on tbh. So it was actually just in many ways like yeah, the concept on the surface was the same, but it was very much a zero to one development cycle of figuring out how to grow this thing again in this climate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:47):\nI know that point is really important to you. I think a lot of people are like Nikita just sold the same app twice. What a guy. And the point you're making here is not only was the infrastructure completely different, the team was different, you had to rethink the entire flywheel of how it worked and how it grew.\n\nNikita Bier (01:00:05):\nYeah. And there were so many layers of like we validated one thing and then the next thing we got stuck on. Like, okay, people send a lot of messages. Cool, great. The next thing was will it spread within a school? That took us a while to get right. Will it hop schools? Each of those was a very, very challenging problem in light of the new climate that we were operating in. And I always do things by the book when it comes to operating legally within the compliance framework. And that's something when I meet founders and they tell me some growth thing that they're doing, and I'm like, \"You can't do that. That's going to cause way more trouble down the line. It's going to burn users too.\" And so we always wanted to make it abundantly clear how our growth system, how you are inviting friends and all that. You can kind of go on a whole diatribe on that because the thing that I see a lot of founders do is they in the background use user data in ways that it shouldn't be used. They invite people on your behalf and all that.\n\n(01:01:21):\nAnd I have this kind of crazy view that the internet is this living and breathing thing. There's Wikipedia article called the Gaia Hypothesis, which is about biology. And it's basically like the earth is kind of living and breathing and can respond to threats. Okay? And when you enter the rainforest too deep, Ebola virus will be released. Okay? So I think the internet operates on a similar paradigm here where if you do the wrong thing by users, the internet will come back and get even and defend itself. And so whenever I design products, I try to do right by users because it'll always come back much worse and I think you should always operate above board with how you design your growth systems. And with Gas, we had to do things the right way and we had to figure out at each particular moment or problem that we solve, will it spread within schools? Will it hop schools? Will people pay for it? All of these things was a whole reinvention of the original product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):\nI love that you shared that because I think a lot of people see you from the outside and they think you're doing all kinds of these skeezy growth hacks and making teens do things that aren't really mentally healthy for them. But it's clear that that's the opposite of how you think about it, that you're trying to stay very positive, like you only allow positive communication. You do things that as you just said, are going to be good long-term, the internet's not going to come and try to shut you down.\n\nNikita Bier (01:03:00):\nThe point you bring up here about wanting to build a positive thing, some people, sometimes I get criticism. It's not actually that often, but they say, \"Oh, you're building an app that makes teens feeling insecure or anything.\" But with Gas, I think we received a message every single day from a user telling us that they reconsidered suicide or other forms of self-harm. The app sent you positive messages and affirmations. It made teens feel really good. And I think that is lost on a lot of people. Instagram can make you feel jealousy and a lot of other social networks are a mixed bag in terms of impact. But we were entirely focused on making teens feel better.\n\n(01:03:49):\nAnd some people might say, \"Oh, what if someone doesn't get voted for something?\" We actually built a system to ensure everyone got a vote. And what we did was we put your name in polls at a higher frequency if you weren't being voted on recently. So we wanted to spread the love in every way possible, and that's what really motivated me to grow this thing was watching how it was impacting 10 million kids in such a short period of time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:20):\nI really appreciate you adding that. I didn't know all those things about the way you thought about these apps. Interestingly, I don't know how much you can go into this, but there is a lot of stuff going on with Gas around human trafficking and all this stuff where people thought people were being kidnapped through Gas, which is yeah, talk about that whatever you can because that's pretty crazy.\n\nNikita Bier (01:04:41):\nWe had this hoax started where people were saying the app was used for human trafficking. And I was like, \"This is so strange.\" This is a anonymous polling app without messaging and the only thing you could do is send compliments to your friends. And I researched into it and I saw that this is actually plaguing a lot of apps and any app that has gone viral in any way has actually had this hoax started. And part of the reason it happens is it gets you attention if you say that about an app. As a teenager, if you say, \"Oh, this app is dangerous,\" and then you get a bunch of followers and who doesn't love followers? So it's actually a really viral piece of content if you put it out. And so we had this hoax started and we were like, \"This could kill the company.\" And I talked to a bunch of founders that it happened to them and they said, \"Yeah, we had to shut down because of that.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:40):\nWow.\n\nNikita Bier (01:05:40):\nAnd I was like, \"Is this it? Is this the end of the company?\" And I remember it hit number one when we started getting a few of these reports in our support channels. And I was like, \"I'm just going to plant the flag on posts that we hit number one in the App Store because this thing's probably going to shut down soon.\" So I make this announcement on Twitter, \"I just made the number one app and I thought it would just be dead in a week.\" And then I just had this sudden burst of energy and I was like, \"I'm going to win. I'm going to fight this. This is not true. It makes no sense at all.\"\n\n(01:06:20):\nAnd so we fought it at every vector possible, this completely made up hoax. We met with journalists, reporters to make sure that the number one match every time you search Gas app human trafficking was Gas app is not for human trafficking. And so that ended up being The Washington Post headline. We insisted that that be the headline if we do the interview. So that was the first thing that showed up on Google anytime someone searched it. There were schools and even a police station that posted that this app is used for human trafficking. I called those superintendents, I called those police chiefs and have got them to publicly retract it. And we had some of the reviews on the App Store. We asked Apple to remove them because we got review bombed.\n\n(01:07:07):\nBut the thing that actually was the most impactful was my girlfriend made a video, a TikTok video explaining that it's not true. And anytime someone deleted their account, they could watch this video explaining it's not true. And at the peak, we had 3% of users deleting their accounts per day. So it was like a catastrophe for an app and we got it down to 0.1% through relentless, relentless effort. And it was really just an unusual thing that happens when you grow really fast is this human trafficking hoax that starts. And you don't understand how crazy it is until it happens to your company, but it was kind of hilarious to think about. This app was the most harmless benign thing you could think of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:01):\nThis is insane. I did not know this full story. And you were doing all this while you were trying to scale the app and trying to keep the servers up and try to grow it, right? What was that like to try to manage all these things at once?\n\nNikita Bier (01:08:13):\nI was sleeping three hours a day for three months. It was extraordinarily difficult to do it all. Our team was also relentless though. They would come over to my house 9:00 a.m. stay until midnight and just do that seven days a week. So yeah, it was definitely one of the most physically draining things ever, but we were just so tactical. I remember investors were asking to meet with us and I said, \"If you can't get a celebrity to post that this isn't true, then we're not interested.\" But yeah, we went after it on every vector and it ended up being okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:59):\nI love how you took your brain to this other completely different problem and thought about all the levers you could use to change the conversation around the app.\n\nNikita Bier (01:09:09):\nYeah. I remember we had these TikTok videos that were made that were saying it was true and I networked my way all the way to the CEO of TikTok and I said, \"Can you delete these?\" And we got this information deleted. Yeah, so it was really a whole new test of our team's capacities was fighting. The key thing that you have to know though when you have a hoax spreading about your app is you really have to make sure the hoax is less viral than your app. And at a few points, the hoax was more viral than our app and we had to take this-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:49):\nThe K-factor of the hoax.\n\nNikita Bier (01:09:51):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:51):\nThat's absurd. Okay. So broadly, you built this app. Again, a big success. I saw a stat that you made $11 million in sales through the app, 10 million downloads. Is that right?\n\nNikita Bier (01:10:03):\nYeah. It was a blowout success in terms of like it grew bigger than tbh. We monetized it. We ran almost entirely on startup credits, so it was basically-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:17):\nLike Cloud Credits? Like AWS Credits?\n\nNikita Bier (01:10:20):\nYeah. AWS Credits, Mixpanel. I remember when I saw the early data, I'm like, \"Okay, now it's time for me to negotiate every bill down to the last cent of margin for every vendor.\" And I got credits everywhere, and so we really were tactical with that. And so we ended up being all just pure cashflow for the team. We had no investors. And it was just so interesting though that the way that I started posting about it on Twitter was it kind of captured the zeitgeist of the internet. And we didn't intend on selling it. We were just going to let this thing run its course and just be this app that kind of lives in the background of our lives. But once it started capturing the zeitgeist of Twitter, I was like, \"Wait a minute, we could probably sell this thing.\" And that's when we started engaging with some of these, we ended up getting three companies that wanted to buy it. I won't be able to say them, but ultimately we ended up selling to Discord and we joined Discord.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:29):\nAwesome. So before we move on to the next part of the journey and some of the other insights that I want to get into, is there any lasting lessons that you took away from Gas as a product that you take with you to advising startups in terms of building the product design? I know there's many, but any that stand out most that you think are really interesting to share?\n\nNikita Bier (01:11:50):\nI think I kind of touched on this before, which was trying to validate things in a sequence of like, will people use the core flow? Will people spread it within their peer group? Will it hop peer groups? And what I think the most important thing that I learned is that's actually a really great way to do zero to one product development is execute at 100% for the thing you're trying to validate at that specific stage of the product development cycle. And then you can kind of half-ass the rest just so you can get 100% signal on that one part.\n\n(01:12:25):\nAnd so we made the polling experience just perfect. The questions were great. Push notifications, everything worked. And then the next stage was getting sharing and virality working. And so compartmentalizing those things because ultimately you'll have too much scope creep if you try to solve everything at once and validate. And also you're not going to get signal too, like you're trying to test one thing at a time. So the way that now I approach a lot of consumer product development is if this is true, then what next needs to be true for this thing to work out? And these layers of conditional statements. And the more layers you have, the higher risk your product is, so you should try to condense it to about like four things that must be true for the thing to work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:06):\nAnd this comes back to your advice of the thing you need to get good at is testing and learning and making it really quick.\n\nNikita Bier (01:13:13):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:13):\nOkay. Maybe one last thing along this thread. I'm just really curious how this hoax came to be, like who's behind it? How does this happen?\n\nNikita Bier (01:13:20):\nWe got a original support message, which was a screenshot of a story on Snapchat and it said, \"Do not download the Gas app. It's for human trafficking.\" Okay? And it was a screenshot that had like that mirror effect where you have like 10 people that screenshotted it. More, like 40 people because it had all the usernames. So I was looking at this and I'm like, \"How many people have seen this?\" And it looked like a viral thing on Snapchat. And then I went to the App Store page and I saw a review that said this app is for human trafficking. And I went to my team and I said, \"This will probably kill the company. This will kill the product. I've seen this before with consumer apps and it's evident to me this is going to be 10 times bigger tomorrow.\" And they were like, \"No. It's just one message. What do you mean?\" I'm like, \"No, no, it's been screenshotted 40 times and now it's on the App Store page.\" And we got another message four hours later.\n\n(01:14:35):\nAnd the next day, it was our entire App Store page was just covered with reviews saying that the app's for human trafficking. And we actually had to rebrand the app. We relaunched it once and we're like, \"Let's just call it something different. Just relaunch it on the other side of the country.\" We did that, started going viral again. And the craziest-\n\nNikita Bier (01:15:00):\n... again. And the craziest thing was it re-emerged and what happened was one user was friends with another person in another state and they got an invitation. And that user told them, \"Oh, that was in my state. It's actually for human trafficking.\" And then it just completely started again and then it was too late at that point to relaunch again. We just realized, \" We got to fight this thing.\" And ultimately, I don't think we'll ever know the true origin, but it was definitely a living, breathing like hoax.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:46):\nThat is insane. The story just gets more and more interesting. What were some of the previous names, by the way? Is that something you can share?\n\nNikita Bier (01:15:52):\nYeah, we went through a bunch. One of them was called Crush, one of them was called Melt, and another was... The interesting thing about Crush is we got a great domain. We thought this would be the name. This was between some of the re-brands. We tested it and we saw that invitations dropped significantly under the Crush name and we were like, \"What's going on here?\" And we found that actually when you invite someone to an app, regardless of the app, you generally... Boys invite boys, girls invite girls to apps. And boys didn't want to invite their friends to an app called Crush with a pink icon.\n\n(01:16:35):\nAnd then we looked at the data and the app. I mean this was true TBH too, which was the app indexed about 60 to 65% women. So we were just like, \"Let's make the app more masculine and see what happens. We need balance on this.\" So we made the icon black with a flame, called it Gas and the invites rate jumped. And you think a name doesn't matter, but right at the moment of sending an invite... So that was one of the interesting insights on the naming process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:07):\nMan, there's just endless stories that we could keep getting into, but we've also gone very long, so I'm going to try to move on to another topic. So I ask people on Twitter what to ask you? Just that question got a thousand likes just me asking, \"What should I ask Nikita?\" And the most common question, I'm sure you get this a lot, is just people wondering, do you ever want to build a durable consumer app? Is it possible to build a durable consumer app?\n\n(01:17:30):\nScott Belsky asked this, Robert at Figma asked this, and Scott actually had a really nice way of describing it about why are so many quick sensation consumer apps proving to be more akin to summer songs than enduring standalone products and businesses? So there's kind of two questions here. One is, do you aim to build a durable consumer app? And two, how possible is it?\n\nNikita Bier (01:17:54):\nA lot of the fundamental tools for communicating with our friends either messaging or broadcasting one-to-many like on stories or the incumbents have built pretty large motes in terms of network effects and to provide true an order of magnitude better experience is non-trivial because they've been actually improving these products so much over the years and there's not that many entry points.\n\n(01:18:31):\nNot to say that it's not impossible. Snapchat was showed that there was style of messaging that people wanted that the incumbents weren't serving. But I think there's these kind of edges that you can go after with a much higher probability of success and they might not actually be something that's durable necessarily. And I think finding durability for a communication or social product, that's a black swan event. Retention for consumer social is there's a tremendous amount of randomness. There's one every decade. If it was simple, I would just be printing $1 trillion companies.\n\n(01:19:15):\nI be printing Facebook's every time I sat down. But I think it's actually a lot of it is pure randomness. On the other hand, growing a product can be a science. With certainty, if you're good at your job, you can make an app grow and go viral. Now why haven't I tried to take the viral part and build something that has been durable or long-lasting? I'll tell you a little bit about my motivations. My favorite part about product development is you make this thing through the night. You build it and you watch it take over the internet.\n\n(01:19:54):\nThat is the most thrilling drug I think you could ever experience. And just watching it spread all over the country is like you drop an app in the deep south in Georgia and then you look on your analytics dashboard and 40% of the high school down your street in Los Angeles has downloaded it one week later. That's a really profound feeling. It's crazy to have that sort of impact as a three-person team, and I live for that.\n\n(01:20:26):\nWhen I joined Facebook, here's an interesting connection. So I joined Facebook and I saw that many of my peers were looking up to VPs and they're like, \"That's what I want to make it to one day. I want to run a large organization. I want to have lots of reports.\" And then I met with VPs and they were actually jealous of me because my quality of life was actually pretty cool. I got to build something high impact that made many teens feel better about themselves, made a decent amount of money. And then I wasn't in charge of this becoming a people manager that has to run this large organization for many years.\n\n(01:21:11):\nI think one day I will run maybe a venture scale business, but I will say that I kind of like the way that I've been doing things so far in terms of quality of life and being fun. Financially, it's been great. So I think that part is what motivates me. And yeah, I don't think running a large corporation is necessarily what I described as fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:40):\nThat's amazing, man. I am really happy we went here. So much of this resonates with the way I think. And obviously, a big part of this is also just it's very hard, as you said, to build a consumer app that grows first of all. Second, that actually lasts. But that is interesting that you do hope to one day build a venture funded business.\n\nNikita Bier (01:22:03):\nI mean TBH was venture backed, but I just don't... I think I'm going to have to... Do I want to sign up for 10 years? And if you actually look at some of the numbers on the actual proceeds that some of these founders get after an IPO, after seven rounds of dilution, a lot of them are pretty comparable to what we get from our apps for 90 days of work. So yeah, the trade-offs there are pretty faithful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:36):\nActually, just on that note, so what would make you actually decide to go venture funded? You talked about how if you're going more mainstream, non-teens folks after 22 years old, is that why you would go that route?\n\nNikita Bier (01:22:47):\nI don't think that it's necessarily that part. I think if I could keep the team lean and scale up... I think there's some actual founders that actually operate very lean teams and have reached very large scale in terms of the valuations of the company. Actually the most iconic example is Elon Musk. His teams are actually pretty thin overall and he's in the weeds doing product development. And so I think, yeah, if I was to ever do it, I would do it under very specific set of operating principles versus turning it into a big tech company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:34):\nQueue investor is emailing you right now with term sheets. Okay. Nikita, this has been amazing. There's one last segment I want to spend a little time on, which is just kind of a rapid fire of pieces of advice you've shared that I think is incredibly insightful about how to build a successful consumer app. And so I'm thinking I'll just go through three to five and see what you think and see what you can add to the advice. How does that sound?\n\nNikita Bier (01:23:59):\nSounds great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:00):\nOkay, cool. So the first is just contact permissions in iOS 18 changes the game and how people can grow apps basically makes it harder to invite your friends. Thoughts on how people should be thinking about this in their products.\n\nNikita Bier (01:24:15):\nWhen I first saw it, I was really concerned.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:19):\nI saw your tweet about it. You're like, \"That's the end. Game over.\"\n\nNikita Bier (01:24:23):\nJust let me frame things up for you. The contact permissions screen, you average about 65% approval rate across all apps. It's higher for teens, lower for adults, but if you have a 65% consenting to contacts access, then the next step on this new iOS 18 change is you select which contacts you want to allow the app to access. And it's an alphabetical list. And that alphabetical list for me, I have 550 contacts or something.\n\n(01:24:55):\nThe first 10 contacts are punctuation symbols from whatever dirty entry I put when I was driving or something. So you have to scroll down and find that name. So I have to find Lenny. I have to add you. And what if you're not an app user? So I just added you or three others. Assuming users are willing to even do that. You and then the three others never sign up, but maybe three of your friends do.\n\n(01:25:24):\nBut I never get connected to them because there's no over... So my expectation is it's going to be very difficult to find friends on apps going forward to invite friends on apps going forward. And that founders will need to rethink how they do it. And of the companies, I'm working with on intro, we are looking at ways to reinvent what contact sync is or what purpose it served. It's not promising, but we have some good leads and I think we'll have a whole new set of apps emerging as a consequence. But if you're betting on contact sync as a company right now, you better start thinking about plan B.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:14):\nSo what I take away here is just it is now much different and there's an opportunity to think of something really clever that would give you a huge advantage if you can crack it.\n\nNikita Bier (01:26:23):\nYes, but most likely I think most apps will not have social graphs going forward and this will entrench incumbents even more. I don't think Apple acknowledged that. I think the person that designed the feature probably has never built an app or done contact sync before because the flow is egregiously bad and it doesn't actually even, I think, benefit the user's privacy because it just completely eliminates the feature altogether.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:53):\nOkay, next topic. So you helped this product called Dupe succeed. It's doing incredibly well from what I can see. And I saw you tweet about one of the key things that you helped them through, which is to invert, I'm reading this quote, \"Inverting the time to value so that the user experience is the aha moment in seconds.\" Talk about that insight and how important that is to building a successful consumer social app.\n\nNikita Bier (01:27:18):\nThis kind of concept of getting users to the aha moment is something I recurringly bring up to every company I work with. And you have to understand that in 2024, people's attention spans are like three seconds. It's really sad, but we are spread thin through so many notifications, products, everything that if you can't demonstrate value in the first three seconds, it's over. And this also leads back to the contact sync question that you talked about was you have to sign up and then the first night you have to see all of your friends on the app and experience it, otherwise you'll churn.\n\n(01:27:55):\nSo this idea of inverting the value, when I was working with Dupe, they had this kind of shopping app that had a bunch of different features and there was one feature that I saw that was interesting called Deal Hop and it allowed you to just put in a product page and it would find the cheapest version of it online. Something I already do through a bunch of duct taped methods of Google image search, Google Lens. And I was like, \"That should be a whole company. But how are we going to teach users to do it and how do we expose them to that aha moment as fast as possible in a memorable iconic way?\"\n\n(01:28:38):\nI had this product I built a while back where you just type the domain in front of an existing URL. So I told them, \"You should try this. It's very marketable, but you need to get a very short domain that matches what you're doing.\" And so he went out and bought Dupe.com for I don't know how much, but when he bought that I was pretty excited. I'm like, well, if this doesn't work, I'm going to feel terrible, but if it does work, it's going to be a blowout success.\n\n(01:29:05):\nSo we put out a couple videos about it and then it was iconic, went viral, the videos. Users remembered to do it, to type dupe.com in front of a URL. Now I think they're making millions in ARR in a matter, and I think under 60 days of launching. And that was a blowout success. And of the companies I work with, I would say it happens about 50% of the time we hit that much success, but we hit success. I think 50% of the time it's outright failure because consumer is so random.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:41):\nAnd so what I'm hearing is a big insight is just ideally get to three seconds time to value. Is that the advice?\n\nNikita Bier (01:29:50):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:52):\nSounds great. Easy peasy.\n\nNikita Bier (01:29:55):\nYeah. You really have to craft onboarding everything to ensure that that's where the design part comes in of being a great product person.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):\nI imagine a big part of this is just cutting things you think... Like killing your darlings, cutting things you think people need and just being really ruthless with that,.\n\nNikita Bier (01:30:20):\nReally ruthless, but also being extraordinarily creative with how you use the tools available to activate a user. I think extraordinary product people are deeply aware of every possible API and how it can be used in non-traditional ways. Like this URL trick was something that I think was non-traditional that people adopted very quickly. I have a whole laundry list of iOS mechanisms that people use for a certain way today, but you could invert them.\n\n(01:30:59):\nContact sync is a great example because you sync your contacts and then it finds all the friends and then ranks the people who are not on the app yet but have a bunch of friends on it. So there's a bunch of ways that you can one tap, expose a ton of value to users that I think founders often neglect. A lot of founders will go and say, \"Oh, they can just exchange usernames and that's how they can add each other.\"\n\n(01:31:27):\nThat is the most unrealistic thing ever because that means you have to see the username, type it into the app. You have to do that what 50 times to get a 50-person friend list. So we're looking at 10,000 taps versus one. So that's what I mean by trying to get people to the activation moment, the aha moment and get them to value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:53):\nI love that advice. So maybe as just a last question along these lines. When you come to a founder, a relationship that you're a startup, you're trying to help, is there one more thing that you find often ends up being really helpful to them? Any common piece of advice that's like, \"Oh, this is probably what's going to help you.\" You talked about this aha moment step, the contact sharing stuff. I guess is there anything else that's just like this is something that's probably going to help you with your app?\n\nNikita Bier (01:32:20):\nRight now, I think I advise around 35, 36 companies and all of them are at different stages of challenges they're facing. Some of them are pure at the product concept stage. Some of them are venture backed billion-dollar companies and each of them faces different problems. The first thing I often do is I ask them to show me the analytics. We look at how people are distributing the app today, what is the milestone that a user must hit to become activated and what's getting in the way of that?\n\n(01:33:03):\nI also take a very deep look at every funnel that users come through. And I think a lot of founders separate marketing and product growth, like top of funnel growth from the actual products growth mechanisms, but they're both the same. They both should be treated as the same. If you're targeting a community and you want them to all adopt and get saturation, you need to build marketing that shows imagery of that community or whatever. And then when you get in the app, you have to be able to join that community.\n\n(01:33:48):\nWhen you invite people from that app, that community needs to be mentioned. You need to actually cover everything from the ads to the in-app experience. All of that needs to be aligned for a user acquisition and flywheel to spin. A lot of people really screw that up. That's my initial rough approximation of what I do when I come in and try to fix or try to help with some of the challenges these companies are facing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:15):\nSo this is actually a great segue to the final thing I want to make sure people understand is you help companies through this. Talk about how you work with companies where they can find you, what kind of companies you're looking to work with and how all that works.\n\nNikita Bier (01:34:29):\nSo I work across the gamut. Most of them are consumer mobile companies and there certainly are web ones too, but I work with companies across stages. Typically, I recommend that you don't book me unless you're venture backed because it's a little expensive. But my main goal when someone does seek my advice through intro is I try to make them 10 times back their money in the first 30 days. And so far I think I've managed to do that with anyone who's met with me. And that means get all the table stakes, grow things out of the way, at the minimum.\n\n(01:35:11):\nThen identify two to three step function changes that could change their growth trajectory. And these are higher scope fundamental changes to the product. So I try to couple both, explain to them which direction I believe they should go, and it's a conversation and we talk about it. And then once they settle on a direction, I tend to get in the pixels. I go into Figma and we do a live session together and clean things up. I identify, \"Oh, that's going to convert at this percent.\" And then I just manage all that. But yeah, it's generally post-series A.\n\n(01:35:49):\nSome seed stage companies, and it's been really fun. It's kept my mind sharp on where the market is headed. I've also, over the years of building all these apps, I've accrued all these growth hacks that still nobody knows about. And so I share those when it's relevant for the company and it's been great. Dupe was one of them. I was advising Saturn. I rebuilt their Friend Finder. I think believe they're number one in the productivity section above ChatGPT as of today. But I think I've generally invested in about maybe 10% of the companies that seek out my advice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:31):\nAmazing. Well, I know it feels expensive to some people, but if I were a company with cash, it feels like the best deal I could find someone like you to come in and actually help me think through deeply in the pixels how to make my thing work. So I think you're still undercharging and I hope you keep raising your prices because clearly there's a lot of demand. Nikita, this was incredible. I feel like people see you on Twitter and they're like, \"Oh, this guy, he's such a jerk sometimes.\" But meeting you in person and talking to you, it's very clear. You're really a kind dude, really thoughtful. All your advice is based on real things you have done. It's not just you sitting around pontificating and I think that's incredibly valuable and I'm excited. People are tapping that knowledge and you're sharing it with people in a wider scale.\n\nNikita Bier (01:37:15):\nIt's been a pleasure. Thanks for having me. We covered a lot and there's plenty more. I hope to come back after the next viral hit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:26):\nOh man. So I was going to ask you, is there anything you're working on now or stages, what can you share? [inaudible 01:37:33]. Stay tuned.\n\nNikita Bier (01:37:26):\nStay tuned.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:34):\nHere we go. Amazing. I always ask people how can listeners be useful to you? So let me just ask you that as a final question, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nNikita Bier (01:37:41):\nFollow me on Twitter and enjoy my shit posts. And I hope you have as much fun as me on Twitter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:49):\nI do, man. I love your tweets. Nikita, thank you so much for doing this and for being here.\n\nNikita Bier (01:37:54):\nYeah, thanks a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:55):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

Everyone was, \"Outcomes, outcomes, outcomes,\" which is right. You want to make sure you're doing the right thing with the right goal, and that's fine. And some folks, myself included at certain points, swung way too far on the outcomes train and forgot that output is an indicator of that. So if you have a team that's doing all of the ideation and figuring out how to make decisions quickly and getting the right documentation and setting up the right product briefs and design briefs and experiment briefs, all the things that we know go into to successful product development, that's great, but if you're also not shipping a lot of things to market quickly enough, then it just doesn't matter that much.\n\nLenny (00:52):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Nikita Miller. A huge thank you to Camille Ricketts for recommending Nikita and for connecting us. Nikita is senior vice president and head of product at The Knot Worldwide. Before that, she was VP of product at Dooly, and before that she was head of growth and retention at Trello for over five years. In our conversation, we dig into how product managers and people getting married are similar, a bunch of advice on getting into product management, a really cool framework for how to align roles and responsibilities within your cross-functional teams, a bunch of advice for working effectively as a remote and distributed team, and the one question that Nikita asks constantly to get the most out of her teams. Nikita is amazing and I am excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Nikita Miller after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(01:51):\nThis episode is brought to you by wealth fronts. Anyone paying attention to the stock market over the past few years knows it's been a wild ride. Many people who made risky stock bets during the bull market are now facing big losses and wondering how to make better informed investments going forward. That's why I'm excited to tell you about Wealthfront's new stock investing product, which is specifically designed to help you make better stock investments. It has all the features you'd expect, including fractional share, zero commissions and $1 minimum. But what sets it apart is a unique feature called Stock Collections. These are groups of stocks created by Wealthfront's investment team that are designed around unique investment opportunities. You can think of Wealthfront Stock Collections like Spotify Discovery Playlists, but instead of helping you find new songs, they help you discover new companies and themes to invest in.\n\n(02:38):\nFor example, some popular collections right now are dividend to blue chip stocks, semiconductor leaders, and rising interest rates, and each collection includes a summary of the opportunity and trade-offs to help you make more intelligent investing decisions. To start investing with just $1, visit wealthfront.com/lenny. And note, I'm a Wealthfront client and they arranged for me to share this product with you. Important disclosures and details can be found in the show notes. Are you hiring, or on the flip side, are you looking for a new opportunity? Well, either way, check out lennysjobs.com/talent. If you're a hiring manager, you can sign up and get access to hundreds of hand curated people who are open to new opportunities.\n\n(03:21):\nThousands of people apply to join this collective, and I personally review and accept just about 10% of them. You won't find a better place to hire product managers and growth leaders. Join almost 100 other companies who are actively hiring through this collective. And if you're looking around for a new opportunity, actively or passively, join the collective. It's free, you can be anonymous and you can even hide yourself from specific companies. You can also leave anytime and you'll only hear from companies that you want to hear from. Check out lennysjobs.com/talent. Nikita, welcome to the podcast.\n\nNikita Miller (03:59):\nHey, Lenny. Thank you. I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (04:02):\nI'm excited to have you. So I don't know if you know this, but I'm actually having a kid in a couple months and I've been doing a lot of reading, as you do when you're going to be a parent. And I was reading a lot of stuff on The Bump, which turns out I realized was something that it was in your umbrella of products.\n\nNikita Miller (04:15):\nIt a part of The Knot Worldwide. Yeah.\n\nLenny (04:17):\nAnd then I realized y'all have that for pregnancy, you have a site to help you with proposals, you have a site for obviously wedding planning and vendors and just party planning in general. And so is the general strategy to be there for every adulting milestone in life? Is that the plan?\n\nNikita Miller (04:34):\nYes. That's a nice way of putting it. We talk about it as being there for the big celebrations in life. We have these celebratory moments that mark adulthood, and so to be part of that journey, we primarily focus in the wedding space but yes, across the whole journey.\n\nLenny (04:52):\nIt feels like the two pieces you're missing are divorce and funerals. Is that the plan or do you want to stick to happy things?\n\nNikita Miller (05:00):\nI think we're sticking to celebrations. I think we're leaning on the world needs a lot more celebration right now, so helping folks do that.\n\nLenny (05:07):\nYou're here. Okay, cool. It's a really smart strategy. It makes a lot of sense, once you get someone with their wedding and then they expand from there.\n\nNikita Miller (05:15):\nAnd their friends too.\n\nLenny (05:18):\nInteresting, right, because they register on The Knot and they'll know what's going on there.\n\nNikita Miller (05:22):\nThat's right. You register.\n\nLenny (05:24):\nGenius. So we're going to talk about some of the things you've learned along your time there, but I wanted to start with your previous gig at Atlassian and specifically leading growth and retention at Trello. Many people listening to this podcast either use Trello and love Trello or are thinking about using Trello, and so I thought it'd be interesting to hear just who do you find Trello is the most ideal for? When is it good and smart to go with Trello versus Jira or Linear or Asana or something like that?\n\nNikita Miller (05:53):\nA few things. So I think Trello initially started out as being the task management or planning tool for anyone as opposed to the others you just mentioned, which tend to be in software in our industry, and that's who we're geared towards. Trello when it first started was very much on being simplicity of design, being easy to use, tactile, easy to onboard. You don't need customization, you can use it in single-player mode or multi-player mode. And so that meant that at the beginning, we got a lot of people using the product that were small businesses, that were families, that were people planning their weddings potentially. \n\n(06:32):\nAnd then over time, as our users became more sophisticated or had more problems to solve, that's how I think we evolved and grew with them. So some of it's around this concept of progressive disclosure where you start with a small problem and as it gets more sophisticated, Trello grows with you, whereas I think some of the other products, they start with complexity and if you want something simpler, you kind of have to pull things away or tease things apart. And that was definitely something that helps Trello stand out. I think now, many years later, you'll find that Trello is very fully featured and fully powered and they now lean into that a lot more, but that wasn't always the case.\n\nLenny (07:14):\nSo it sounds like Trello broadly was meant for a lot more than just software teams building product?\n\nNikita Miller (07:18):\nYes. It started off I think being inspired by software teams and wanting to understand how to move and manage tasks easily. That was the origin story, but then very quickly became the kind of tool that anyone could use to manage anything. And now I think we're back more the product is way more towards the software development and that's a lot more of the competitive advantage, but I think the people that are excited about Trello and the ones that made Trello really impactful weren't necessarily software.\n\nLenny (07:50):\nGot it. When you think back to your time helping grow and retain folks on Trello, is there a big win or something you're really proud of that you think back to that was a huge success in that time to help Trello grow more or be more successful?\n\nNikita Miller (08:07):\nThat's probably not what you'd guess. So when I started Trello, I actually joined to build out Trello's enterprise business. And so a lot of our growth and retention was actually about how to get more teams into the product and then spreading it throughout the org, so not only software teams but sales teams or marketing teams. And so the big push there was around collaboration. How do you create a shared perspective for everyone working on a project, not just a software team?\n\n(08:38):\nSo we had a good time thinking through what's the customer experience, but obviously in the context of enterprise, which for Trello at the time was really tricky because it's such a customer first product, I think shifting our mindset to understand enterprise and teams specifically as a cohort was very different. And I think we've done a pretty good job of that or the team did a good job of that, and I think being a part now of the Atlassian suite definitely leaned into that even more.\n\nLenny (09:09):\nWas there a specific feature that unlocked a lot of opportunity or is it just broadly, there's a bunch of little things you have to add?\n\nNikita Miller (09:15):\nI think it was broadly a bunch of little things. So all the enterprise features that you can imagine that all products need to operate at the enterprise level, smaller features around labels like how do you color them? How do you name them, when do they appear? When you invite people, do you invite individuals or do you invite teams? So a lot of the work was around going from single player or two, three player mode to 5, 10, 20 people.\n\nLenny (09:41):\nGot it. Coming back to the question of Trello versus Jira, because I think this might be interesting to people. Just if you're trying to decide should we use Trello or should we use Jira, what's a simple way to think about which way to go as a founder maybe or as a product team?\n\nNikita Miller (09:55):\nI think that smaller teams, especially folks that are ideating, when you haven't landed on what you're going to build yet, I think Trello's a great product for that. For pulling ideas, for prioritizing them, for tracking how we're progressing through discovery, I think Trello's really great for that. For things that have been decided and are ready to go and are really in the breakdown these tasks and assign it to people, then something like Jira is probably a better use case, but I'm sure there people that'll disagree with that.\n\nLenny (10:29):\nCool. Building for PMs is what you were doing while you were working in Trello. I imagine that's kind of a bittersweet experience. I imagine in some sense they're an amazing market to sell to, on the other they're probably really annoying. What's a surprise maybe or a lesson about working on building products for product managers?\n\nNikita Miller (10:46):\nI think you're right, it is a bitter sweet place to be. I think I less thought of it as building for product managers and just thought about it in the context of productivity overall. And productivity software in itself is really what's bittersweet because there are a lot of trade-offs and when you're dealing with a software team, for instance, how you measure productivity or define it for a PM or a designer or engineer and a data scientist is probably really different. And so the impossibility of solving for all of those use cases I think is always what's challenging, and we know that no one product is actually going to solve all of those use cases, no matter what the marketing taglines are out there.\n\n(11:29):\nAnd so it was really challenging to figure out what are the core things that a product manager might need to see or a designer or a developer, and how do you make sure that that core is there? So you get the 80% and then you spend time on the 20% that you know a very small segment of users are going to use, but they're probably your core, so maybe you spend some time there. But the answer is no one's going to be happy, and with Trello in particular it was challenging because for a while we built a product that was easy to use for everyone, and so then trying to really narrow in on well, what is a software development use case and what do we really need for that? And that might be very different from what a mom-and-pop shop is going to need or someone planning their wedding is going to need.\n\nLenny (12:15):\nThat's a good segue to something else I wanted to ask about. You used to build for product managers and now you build for people getting married. I'm curious what is similar about those two groups and what's maybe most different?\n\nNikita Miller (12:26):\nA lot of similarity. So folks planning their weddings, think of it as an emotional, high stakes thing that you're hopefully going to do once, and so the pressure is really there. The pressure and expectations are really high, not unlike product managers or other folks in software, and ultimately wedding planning is this huge project where you have a bunch of stakeholders, friends, family. You need to manage multiple vendors, and the time horizon for a wedding once you're engaged is anywhere from 12 to 18 months, so it is a longtime project. I think there's a lot of similarities there. \n\n(13:06):\nSome of the things that are a little bit different in terms of how we're building the product is the amount of decisions probably that need that go into wedding planning are far more than you'd imagine. So one of the reasons being at the Knot is so interesting is we go all the way from planning tools, so actively, how do you help people find inspiration and plan their wedding day-to-day to two-sided marketplace. We have our e-commerce business that's supposed to be registry and paper and obviously our affiliate businesses and the ads businesses, so it's a little bit different from a SaaS productivity tool, the business that we're in, but a lot of the problems that we're solving for users are actually really simpler.\n\nLenny (13:48):\nWhich one's more, I don't know, stress inducing.\n\nNikita Miller (13:51):\nThat's a great question. I think that couples, it's such an emotional thing for people, for individuals and their families and their friends, so I personally feel like I empathize with that in a way that I don't do the same for product even though I'm a product manager, because there are many projects and there're always things that we need to manage and that's just part of the gig. Whereas planning your wedding, for couples this is for many the most meaningful time of their lives, and everyone does this differently. So we have folks that are planning their multi-hundred person weddings and then there are 10, 15 closest friends weddings, but the emotional side of it is the same and you don't want to let them down because most aren't going to do it again.\n\nLenny (14:38):\nYeah, okay. That's what I would've guessed. It feels like wedding couples are more stressed. I just had an idea. I imagine you think about this. We're doing a baby shower right now and it feels like you're missing a opportunity to do the baby shower invite platform.\n\nNikita Miller (14:51):\nYes, we've thought about it.\n\nLenny (14:54):\nAnd also registry, a registry platform.\n\nNikita Miller (14:56):\nYes, also that.\n\nLenny (14:59):\nOkay, okay. So many opportunities.\n\nNikita Miller (15:00):\nAll the life moments.\n\nLenny (15:01):\nOh my God. One last question about Trello. Do you have any just tips for someone using Trello and may not be aware of something they could do with  Trello?\n\nNikita Miller (15:09):\nI think the biggest that people probably know about but are often underutilized are Power-Ups, which is basically our integrations. And Power-ups are folks that are usually doing things that are more complex, often. But Trello, when you think about it with other products like Asana, as you mentioned, Linear, some of what people are worried about is that it's just not powerful enough, and Power-Ups are a way to do that. And there are dozens and hundreds of integrations that you can use it for. So that's worth checking out.\n\nLenny (15:39):\nAwesome. Great tip. Shifting a little bit and zooming out, you've worked at a lot of different companies at a lot of different levels, also a lot of different geographies and I want to chat about that last piece. But maybe just broadly, what are a few of your biggest lessons about building successful and impactful teams?\n\nNikita Miller (15:59):\nThis is kind of my jam.\n\nLenny (16:01):\nExcellent.\n\nNikita Miller (16:02):\nIt's kind of what I spend a lot of time thinking about, and I think every company go into you approach it slightly differently. For me, it usually starts with individuals identifying very clearly early on roles and responsibilities, like what are the expectations of a role? So in software, for most of us one of the things that I think I've seen done well or contributed to and multiple companies is the triad, product, design, engineering, data. And what does it look like for these roles and data science that's like other?\n\nLenny (16:38):\nI see you put data in there.\n\nNikita Miller (16:42):\nI'm trying pull that in. That is my mission. I love that. My mission is product, design, engineering, data.\n\nLenny (16:47):\nIt's not a triad anymore though, but I love it.\n\nNikita Miller (16:50):\nI know. It's a quartet something.\n\nLenny (16:50):\nIt's just a chair.\n\nNikita Miller (16:53):\nIt's a chair. Great. So I think about that a lot. What are the roles? What do you expect for each of them and how do you define the responsibilities that we have to each other? I know it sounds maybe on the softer side, but I think a lot of what we can solve for in creating strong teams is exactly that. The exercise that I often do is I generally have an idea of what I think the roles and responsibilities are and the expectations across these four roles, but the exercise especially with leaders in an org is to have them sit down and write them for each other.\n\n(17:29):\nSo Atlassian has some of this that they do in the form of playbooks, but it's basically I as a product leader, I'm going to write down what I think the expectations and the role and responsibilities of my engineering manager, of my designer, of my data. And then we look at it together and then we arrive at essentially a contract with one another about what we think that looks like and what that responsibility is to our teams, and from there, we cascade it throughout the org. This is very time-intensive, as you can imagine, and often leads to a lot of debate because depending on the kind of orgs or people's backgrounds, our expectations might differ, but I think that contract early on is really important.\n\nLenny (18:08):\nThis is super interesting and I want to go two levels deeper. Is there a template that you have? Is there specific questions you're answering? Is it freeform? How do you actually know what to write in one of these?\n\nNikita Miller (18:21):\nThere is a template. There are templates we can probably share after this-\n\nLenny (18:24):\nAwesome. Great.\n\nNikita Miller (18:25):\n... to run the roles and responsibilities, and it usually comes in a couple of forms. It's what the expectations as an IC? What's the expectation as a manager or with your team? And then what is it to each other and what are the things that are shared? So when we're running an experiment, a product manager's likely to write a product brief and go into the details of what that means. The data scientist is likely to help write the actual experiment brief, but we're all putting inputs into it. But then when it comes to data and analysis, my expectation is that both of you are doing that together.\n\nLenny (19:01):\nAnd is the idea the PM writes, \"Here's what I'm planning to do,\" is it the data scientist writes on behalf of the pm, \"Here's what I expect you to do?\" Who's taking the charge in each of these?\n\nNikita Miller (19:11):\nYou write your own. So I as a product manager, I write what I think my role is and also what I think what my expectations of my counterparts are and they do the same, and then we review it together.\n\nLenny (19:23):\nAnd you encourage every team within your domain to do this amongst themselves. \n\nNikita Miller (19:28):\nYes. \n\nLenny (19:29):\nThat is very cool. If there's an example you could share that we could put in the show notes or a template, that would be great.\n\nNikita Miller (19:35):\nYeah. We'll do that.\n\nLenny (19:36):\nWhat have you found as impact that comes from doing this a before and after? What kind of difference do you see having done this on team?\n\nNikita Miller (19:45):\nSo I'd say recently, I'd say in the past maybe five years, one of the things that has shifted and has caught some people by surprise, I don't know if it should or not, is around project management. So I think 10, 12 years ago, everyone expected that they would have Scrum Masters, and Scrum Masters have largely in many companies just disappeared. But then you think well, where did that responsibility go, because someone has to do project management? And this is different from program management internal to a team. \n\n(20:18):\nAnd from my perspective, a lot of that now sits with engineering managers, which is a little bit different from how it was when I started in product where actually, a lot of that was put on PMs. And some of you might recall, it caused a lot of issues with product managers because they were the ones that were constantly like, \"What's happening in the sprints? What didn't make it? Why didn't it?\" Doing a lot of that work. And I think PMs are still responsible to keep track of that, but engineering managers are increasingly expected to be the ones that are actively making sure that sprint goals, for instance, are met. And that's a shift that I've seen recently that we do have to debate often.\n\nLenny (20:57):\nI think one of the most interesting elements of this approach is that the product manager role is so I ill-defined and so different in every company, and so I imagine much of the benefit here is just what the hell is the PM's responsibility?\n\nNikita Miller (20:57):\n100%.\n\nLenny (21:10):\nIs there anything that you find is surprising about what teams end up taking off the PM's plate or putting on the plate that maybe other companies don't?\n\nNikita Miller (21:18):\nI think a lot of people end up putting a lot on the PM's plate because of that misunderstanding. And so you end up looking at something as a group and saying, \"Well, no one human can do all of those things all the time, so let's talk about what the shared responsibility looks like.\" And what I think is really powerful about the triad is that it's a recognition of there are shared responsibilities. Who's responsible for making sure that everyone understands what we're doing and why, the PM leads that, but evangelizing that is something that would be expected of designers and engineering managers and data scientists as well.\n\nLenny (21:57):\nOn the data scientist piece, you talked about how you're trying to embed that more and more into product teams. At Airbnb, data scientists were embedded in every team, so I totally get that.\n\nNikita Miller (22:05):\nIt's not everywhere.\n\nLenny (22:07):\nYeah, exactly. What more can you share there of just why you found that to be important and how you're approaching that?\n\nNikita Miller (22:13):\nFrom my experience as a product manager, it was always a blocker. Getting your hands on the data, maybe having someone to troubleshoot with if as a PM you couldn't kind of understand or figure it out yourself, it was just always a blocker. And so then you'd also then have to go and negotiate with other teams about getting someone's resources to look at this problem, so that's one. The other is just that data scientists, as with most humans, we get better the more focused we are and the more in depth we are in understanding the product itself. So if you have someone that's dedicated to a zone or an area of the product, then it's much easier for them to spot patterns as opposed to attempting to understand what's happening every time a ticket comes in.\n\nLenny (22:58):\nAnd so the shift you push for is instead of a centralized data team that you convince to give you resources, you embed the data scientist into the team.\n\nNikita Miller (22:58):\nRight.\n\nLenny (23:07):\nAnd do you call them data scientists, do you call them analysts? How do you think about that?\n\nNikita Miller (23:11):\nThat also varies per company. That depends on the organization and the work. Some teams require data scientists, not all. Some require analysts, so that just depends on what the team's working on, what's needed.\n\nLenny (23:27):\nGot it. Coming back to the roles and responsibilities framework, do you encourage teams to revisit that every once in a while or is it like this team's done this thing and we're good for a while?\n\nNikita Miller (23:36):\nI encourage them to revisit it and it's usually because something's fallen off the rails. I think if they were really great at it, I'd say every three months or every six months, let's have a look and see how this is going. But often it happens because there's some conflict or tension or something was missed and someone thought it was theirs or not and we have to do a quick retro.\n\nLenny (23:59):\nWhat do you find is often that thing that is maybe missed or often causes tension?\n\nNikita Miller (24:04):\nExecution. It's usually around execution and velocity.\n\nLenny (24:10):\nNot moving fast enough?\n\nNikita Miller (24:11):\nNot moving fast enough.\n\nLenny (24:13):\nWhat do you find often is a way to help with that as a leader of teams?\n\nNikita Miller (24:18):\nWell, one, just identifying what the velocity issue is. It can vary, so for PMs it's often around the velocity of decision-making. How long does it take us actually from saying we need to do a thing to defining it potentially, and then deciding are we actually going to do it or how? And that I think takes a long time for most companies, most people. So velocity of decision-making, so I think that tends to fall on the PM most often. The actual execution of it, the development tends to fall on both PM and engineering. So in engineering I find that depending on the org, some folks understand breaking up tickets into small pieces and why that's valuable and how to do it, and that's something that I think everyone in industry probably needs a refresher on, why that's valuable and how it works. And some of that is also shared by the PM because if you haven't articulated clearly or well enough what we're trying to do, then it is hard to break that apart. So those are the two things that are on my mind a lot.\n\nLenny (25:27):\nIs there anything else along the lines of what you've learned about building successful teams? I really love this roles and responsibilities approach.\n\nNikita Miller (25:35):\nOutcomes and output also comes up a lot, and many of the companies that I've either worked with or advised, coached over the past few years, it was all about outcomes. Everyone was, \"Outcomes, outcomes, outcomes,\" which is right. You want to make sure you're doing the right thing with the right goal and that's fine. And some folks, myself included at certain points, swung way too far on the outcomes train and forgot that output is an indicator of that. \n\n(26:10):\nSo if you have a team that's doing all of the ideation and figuring out how to make decisions quickly and getting the right documentation and setting up the right product briefs and design briefs and experiment briefs, all the things that we know go into to successful product development, that's great, but if you're also not shipping a lot of things to market quickly enough, then it just doesn't matter that much. So that conversation is one that I think we often have to revisit on all the teams I've ever been on that yes, outcomes are important, but also the indicator is around execution and velocity. So if that's not in line, then a lot of the other things don't matter that much.\n\nLenny (26:50):\nAnd so when you say outcome, you're saying here's the goal they're achieving or the impact they're having, or is it just the idea we know what our outcome will be but they're not actually shipping anything? When you say output and outcome, what are you referring to specifically?\n\nNikita Miller (27:04):\nThe outcomes are understanding what the goals are and what we might do to get there. So OKRs is one way to talk about that. Great. But embedded in that is and how are we going to get there? And the fact is, the more tries you have at it, the likelier you are to get it right. So we're not actively monitoring how fast does it take us to ship things to market.\n\nLenny (27:28):\nI see. So if I can rephrase it, a lot of teams know and talk about what they should be doing. They have a strategy, they have a goal, but what you're finding is that there's just not a lot of action a lot of times and there's a huge opportunity just to get a team to actually ship more often and move faster.\n\nNikita Miller (27:46):\nYeah. There's not a lot of understanding of our role and urgency. It's urgent, and software in particular. You probably can't forget that because someone else is likely doing something similar or better and faster.\n\nLenny (28:02):\nMakes me think of I think Frank Slootman is his name, the Snowflake CEO. He wrote this book called Amp It Up, where he talks about how to build thriving software companies and businesses in general. One of his three most important recommendations is always have urgency, to never let off the gas of urgency. That things always need to feel urgent.\n\nNikita Miller (28:22):\nI'll check that out. But I think product managers, I consider product to be the ones that really need to drive urgency.\n\nLenny (28:33):\nSay more about that. What have you found helps in creating that sense of urgency and continuing to increase output?\n\nNikita Miller (28:39):\nMostly reminding people often. And I don't think that's a question of, \"Well, show me list of everything you ship. That's never going to work.\" Well, that doesn't make people feel good about the work that they're doing, but let's talk about our experimentation backlog. What do we have in there? How quickly are we getting those things out? Those are the kind of conversations that I think help. I think that having a good pulse on competition helps as just a friendly reminder that there are others out there doing this and thinking about things very similarly, possibly, to how we're thinking about it, so how do we differentiate ourselves? And a lot of that is about how quickly are we getting many ideas to market? Small tangent. The competition side is interesting to me because I've worked at a few companies where I've worked with founders who are like, \"We don't have competition, we're the only ones doing this,\" and then fast forward a few years and you're like, \"Here are all the companies that were your competition that you didn't recognize then that are shipping great product now.\"\n\nLenny (29:52):\nThis might be a tough question, but I think there's always a sense of we can move faster. It's rare that no, we're moving fast as we can. Do you have any kind of heuristic or I don't know, gut feeling of knowing and sensing where this team's doing fine versus this team isn't moving as fast as they can?\n\nNikita Miller (30:09):\nHow much time do we spend on what I'd consider optimizations versus bigger bets, and how long does does it take for that to happen? Right? Because you know you've talked to the folks or been in the companies where you talk about something that by most measures is pretty simple. Someone goes heads down for a week or two and gets it done and you talk about it and then two quarters later, someone mentions it again and you're like, \"Oh, okay. So what are all the things we did in between that time to now why that seemingly simple thing didn't get done?\" And I think that's hard to say as a product manager because everything we do is all about prioritization, and I'm sure there are a bunch of other things that were prioritized, but they're these little things that come up periodically, or bug fixes. Something is broken. How long does it take us to recognize it and actually fix it?\n\nLenny (31:03):\nDo you have a heuristic, speaking of big bets versus optimizations, of just how much time/resources to put into each bucket?\n\nNikita Miller (31:11):\nUnfortunately, the answer is it depends. If you're working on a business that is 30 years old and has many acquisitions, it is very different from a startup or a growth stage company.I think it just varies.\n\nLenny (31:27):\nYep. That's often what I find. One last question along these lines that was on my mind as you were chatting. When you're finding that a team is not delivering as much output as you would think, what have you found works in helping them recognize that and not get defensive and not have all these excuses for why it's happening, just help them see what you see?\n\nNikita Miller (31:46):\nI'll tell you what I do. I don't know, I think folks might get defensive sometime.\n\nLenny (31:52):\nYeah, I think.\n\nNikita Miller (31:53):\nBut I'll tell you what I try. For me the biggest thing is just if folks are working on a sprint, it's very simply, \"What did you deliver this sprint?\" That's it.\n\nLenny (32:04):\nJust asking questions.\n\nNikita Miller (32:05):\nJust ask a bunch of questions. \"What did you deliver?\" And more questions, \"Okay, fine, but what did you deliver to production? Great. And how long have you been working on that? How long? What was the cycle time?\" So these questions that are really just I think seeking to understand because I understand complexity and so that exists everywhere, but maybe helping folks see that as they're reviewing their own work or their team's work goes a long way.\n\nLenny (32:35):\nAnd it comes back to your approach of just focus on the output, not what they're planning to do, what they've actually done.

Shifting a little bit, you've been a PM for a long time, since 2010 I believe, and a lot of people move out of pm and so it's really cool to talk to someone that's been in the field for a while. What have you seen in terms of how product maybe has changed? The role of product management, the role of product leadership, and also maybe other functions like designer engineering?\n\nNikita Miller (33:51):\nI think the biggest change for product at macro is how mainstream it is. I still find fascinating getting degrees in product management and going to business school to transition into product management and the whole discipline. And there's a whole business, honestly, around the business of product management, which I find really fascinating and it didn't exist. And I think for better or worse, that comes with a lot of good and in some ways might have removed some of the quirkiness and creativity that probably is required of product, but that's probably a different podcast. So that's one, just macro. In terms of the roles, I think that what we were talking before about roles and responsibilities and defining those for product managers, I think product managers are increasingly I think a bit more technical or expected to be. I think there was a moment where they were technical and then it was, \"No, no, we're all generalists,\" and now I think we're going back to PMs need to be more technical.\n\n(34:54):\nI think designers, the expectation is that they'll be more business-oriented, design as a means, honestly, to an end. I think that's trending and probably for the better. I think the best designers I've ever worked with are also exceptionally savvy business people. And I think engineers are increasingly becoming what more product-focused, more user-focused. So product engineers is something Trello I think did really well. This idea that great ideas can come from anywhere in the org at any function I think is really magical. So as you're seeing PM's becoming more technical, I think designers becoming more business-oriented, engineers are becoming a lot more product/user-focused, to me that's amazing because it means that we're getting closer to what I'd consider really deep collaboration. And it's not to say that we're not experts. There are expertise within that that we expect of folks, but that care for other disciplines I think is where a lot of magic happens.\n\nLenny (35:57):\nThat's really interesting. When you say PMs  getting more technical, when you're hiring, interviewing, what are you looking for? Do PMs need to learn to code? How technical do you find they need to be?\n\nNikita Miller (36:08):\nI don't think so, necessarily. I think a lot more PMs are. A lot more PMs are taking boot camps or coding classes, which I think is all to the good. I don't know that it's a requirement, but there is more of that and I think is very helpful. Similarly, a lot more PMs are taking more classes or digging more into data analysis, also really valuable. I don't think it's a requirement. I am not a technical PM, I don't have a tech background. I think I've been doing it long enough at this point to do okay, but I think it's a benefit.\n\nLenny (36:42):\nYou said that the PM is becoming more of just a thing with training classes and courses like that? \n\nNikita Miller (36:47):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (36:48):\nI did a search once on LinkedIn for how many product managers there are. Guess many PMs there are in the world, that have the title PM in their LinkedIn profile?\n\nNikita Miller (36:57):\nA lot. I'm guessing a lot.\n\nLenny (36:59):\n2 million.\n\nNikita Miller (37:01):\nThat's wild. \n\nLenny (37:02):\nThat's wild. And there's 800,000 just in the US.\n\nNikita Miller (37:05):\nWow. \n\nLenny (37:06):\nThat's a large group that I didn't expect.\n\nNikita Miller (37:10):\nBack in my EdTech days, a friend of mine, her kids were in school and she came in one day, her son was in grade school at the time, in elementary school and he had this match to what careers, what you see, and they had a person at a computer, this image, and it was product manager. There was an option for product manager. And that's when I knew, I was like, \"Okay, this is mainstream. We're about to become consultants.\"\n\nLenny (37:37):\nI always used to joke, no one grows up and is like, \"I want to be a product manager when I grow up,\" but I think that's starting to-\n\nNikita Miller (37:41):\nIt's a starting. It's a thing.\n\nLenny (37:45):\nWhile we're on that topic, I imagine people often ask you for advice on how to get into product management. Do you have any advice there for folks that are listening that maybe want to get into that?\n\nNikita Miller (37:54):\nThere are many ways now. I think there are a lot of the typical programs that a lot of the big tech companies have, I think is one way. I think getting into startups as a product manager is a pretty awesome way to get into product because it's just a lot of problem-solving. The problem with that is you don't have anyone to teach you the right way, but the product will teach you the right and wrong way if you're with a team that is moving quickly. I still think working on smaller products and companies is a way great way to get into product management in part because you'll get to touch all of the functions that are required parts of the product discipline, and I think it's hard to get that experience otherwise.\n\nLenny (38:40):\nThe PM role, we haven't talked about this, it's just very hard and very stressful and mostly sucks in many ways. \n\nNikita Miller (38:48):\nYes.\n\nLenny (38:48):\nAnd we could talk about that if you want, but it was more of a segue to work-life balance, which I know you have some strong opinions about. So I don't know, you could take it either direction, but just thoughts on work-life balance/how hard the PM role is.\n\nNikita Miller (39:01):\nThe PM role is really hard. I feel especially now that I'm managing a lot of teams and PMs at a lot of different levels, I do find that periodically I remind them with the core of my being that, \"I know this is hard.\" It is hard. There are a lot of expectations. You're expected to be competent across many areas all the time, you're expected to have an answer and you're expected to keep your calm and not lose your shit, and that's really hard. It just is. It's stressful. So I think I spend quite a bit of time with my team, my PMs, helping them understand that I understand that. And so when we're problem-solving, let's probably not solve for everything. Let's focus on one of many things that are expected. It's really hard. On work-life balance, as I mentioned to you I think about this a lot, I'm currently a mom and as you can imagine, that's a lot to manage at any given time.\n\n(40:05):\nAnd so recently, when I think about work-life balance, I don't use the word balance, I use optimization. It's this question of what are you optimizing for right now? Whether it's today or this court or this year, with the understanding that I don't think you can have it all at the same time all the time. And so I'm increasingly coming to peace with that. Where that's been interesting over the course of my career, I was chatting with my husband about this yesterday and was thinking about, early in my career I remember when we had big releases, folks would just work nonstop for a couple of weeks. We would stay in the office late, we would come in early. If it was international, we just probably wouldn't sleep because we wanted to make sure we QA'd everything before we released it, and that was an expected part of the product development life cycle.\n\n(40:55):\nAnd that was a lot of my early product years and I just did it and it was very exciting and I quite enjoyed it, but even then, the flip side of it for me was I also was a runner back then, so if I was training for a half marathon or a marathon, then the next week I'd probably do my long run in the morning and not start work until 10:00 AM. That was my version of balance. And I think many of us are lucky enough, especially in tech, that a lot of companies get that form of flexibility. So now fast forward 13 years, it is very similar. I don't do all of the drop-offs and pickups for the kids, but there are some weeks where I'm like, \"This is the week I'm going to do all of the drop-offs and pickups,\" or, \"This is the day,\" and that's felt much healthier for me than this expectation that I'm somehow going to balance it all and everything is going to be equally great or cared for all the time.\n\nLenny (41:56):\nI think what I'm hearing essentially, which I really like and agree with, is sometimes you're just going to have to go sprint and go hard and work really hard and go long hours and then that doesn't need to last forever. And then when it's not, enjoy that extra time and build and recharge and do the things you got to do.\n\nNikita Miller (42:18):\nYeah. That's about right.\n\nLenny (42:18):\nI find the same thing. I find that just working hard is very correlated with success, and a lot of times that's just a lot of long hours and sometimes you can't balance it for periods of time.\n\nNikita Miller (42:30):\nRight. And it can also be at different points in your life, right? So right now at this particular moment in my life, I'm probably not going to go hard at a super early stage startup because I believe that you probably need to be in person and working really hard together for long periods of time. And not everyone feel this way, I know that. I've had these conversations with lots of friends and colleagues. So personally for me, that's probably not the decision I would make at this moment in my life.\n\nLenny (43:02):\nI get that. Another area I wanted to touch on is remote work and distributed work. I believe most of your career, you were remote or you worked with remote teams and distributed teams and that's such a on-trend thing now where a lot of teams are working hybrid, working remotely, working with distributed teams. What have you learned about being successful working with distributed and remote teams?\n\nNikita Miller (43:23):\nYes. My entire career has been with remote or distributed teams. That's right. When I started early my career, I lived abroad for a while. I lived in Shanghai. I had a core team there, but also worked for the distributed team in Europe and Latin America, which meant all kinds of crazy hours and lots of sprints like we just talked about. Things that worked well, one, documentation. It's a thing. Asynchronous communication, everyone just has to get used to it and better at it, so increasingly just being better communicators, whether it's on a video or written.\n\n(44:00):\nI think that's just really important, and everyone building up that muscle is really important. For all of the roles I've been in, this notion of what does it mean to have really meaningful and valuable in-person time that can sustain you for the remote and distributed time is a really important. I think a lot of what's happened now in COVID and even now, a lot of teams have never met their coworkers. They don't onboard in person, they don't have events or offsites as frequently. And I think flexibility is really great, but I think that really, that makes it really hard, and to me, what I've figured out I think is that it especially makes it hard to solve hard problems.\n\n(44:43):\nSolving a hard problem remotely with folks that you haven't spent in-person time with, that you haven't broken bread with, that you haven't disagreed with in person and built that trust is just really hard. In fact, it's much harder. So some of the things I've done even here at The Knot Worldwide is periodically when there's a really gnarly problem, I wave the flag and I say, \"Hey everyone, why don't we try and get together for two days and hash some of this stuff out, and then we can go back to our remote lives?\" And I think folks have been maybe unsurprisingly very open to that because I think they see not only the efficiency but the camaraderie that can happen there as opposed to what was happening potentially on a Hangouts or a Zoom call.\n\nLenny (45:28):\nWhat does that event look like? Where do you do it? What's roughly an agenda?\n\nNikita Miller (45:32):\nOne, the agenda is pretty tight before we get there. Myself or someone else are responsible for making sure that that's a well-articulated agenda that we all kind of agree on before we even get there, so I think that's one. I think 48 hours, two nights, and that's important to me because it tends to still just be hours in a conference room or a meeting room during the day, but you do need to build in the, \"And let's go have dinner since we're all in person anyway, or let's have an extended lunch and maybe an extended day.\" I think that's just really important. And even early in my career when I was working more internationally, the company I worked for was pretty amazing because two or three times a year, the entire company globally came together for a week or two and it made a huge difference, and many of the folks that I worked with there are still friends and mentors.\n\nLenny (46:29):\nAre you able to share what was the challenge you're trying to overcome in one of these times? \n\nNikita Miller (46:34):\nI can speak about it generally, which was just we had a change in strategy and we needed to land a couple of core decisions about what we might build. And there were lots of documents and lots of conversations, and back to the velocity of decision-making, remotely that can be really hard because with time zones, someone sends a doc, you comment on it, you get to the other day by the end of the week. And so days and days have passed and we still haven't landed it, and people have really strong opinions obviously that's something that big, so it's like, \"Nope. Okay, great. Wave the flag.\" And not everyone could make it. Most people could, and the folks who could not were, yes, on a screen.\n\nLenny (47:15):\nWas there anything specific in that offsite that helped you get to a resolution?\n\nNikita Miller (47:21):\nIn that particular one, it was one, very cross-functional and the unlock there was giving the data person the space to educate all of us. That was it. It was like, \"You have the floor, educate.\"\n\nLenny (47:40):\nI find that's often the solution is people just don't have all the same information that they're basing their decision on, so make sure everyone starts with the same foundation. Awesome. And that comes back to your push to get data integrated into every team and make that part of the four quad triad.\n\nNikita Miller (47:57):\nThat chair. It's the chair.\n\nLenny (47:59):\nAnything else around remote work or distributed work that you found to be incredibly impactful or important?\n\nNikita Miller (48:04):\nWell, the flexibility of it that I'm sure you've talked about with others, that is really important. I do think that Trello and Atlassian did this really well, is having standards around a couple things. The biggest one I think was overlapping work hours. So everyone had general flexibility, but there were some set of hours where everyone needed to be online at the same time for the most part every day, and that made a big difference. Onboarding happened in person. I think that in-person onboarding for new folks is really important for everyone. For any new person to an organization, I think how we work culturally, having a contact that you can reach out to, all of that I think is really crucial. I'm definitely of the so much of my early learning was in person and I have no idea how we're going to replicate that in a non-office setting. It's just really hard.\n\nLenny (49:04):\nHow long do you try to have that person in the office for onboarding? Is it a week? Is it a few days?\n\nNikita Miller (49:09):\nA week.\n\nLenny (49:09):\nAwesome. Shifting a little bit, just a few more questions. You mentioned you worked in China, you also worked in the UK for a while, obviously in the US now. What have you found to be some of the biggest differences in maybe the product culture or just culture in general working in these different areas?\n\nNikita Miller (49:26):\nThe confusion around what product management is is universal. That's not specific to US I think, and the fact that it's changing, that I think was the same. I don't know that I've found that many differences in terms of how we approached goal-setting, all very similar. The need for urgency, all those principles I think this are the same no matter where you are. Part of what I experienced when I started in Shanghai was the feeling that the product manager was expected to have all the answers, which as you can imagine was really overwhelming. And so I remember because I was young and I didn't know that much about product management, and I definitely did not have all the answers, I spent a lot of time helping the team help me get answers and that was a little bit of a culture shift in our team at the time. \n\n(50:25):\nAnd I actually think that's kind of carried me through my entire career, which is trying to figure out how to share the product management load so we're equally responsible for what we're building. So that was a good unintentional learning that I think has been really important for my career. I think that part of that learning that I've had obviously here and in London as well was the figuring out how to make room for creativity. So in Shanghai and also in London at the time, this was a decade now so many things have changed since then, there just didn't seem to be as much room for ideas to come from anywhere, which I think is also related to what I've seen before. \n\n(51:13):\nSo making space for people across functions to share ideas and then across geographies to share ideas, especially in companies where English might have been the primary language but most of the employees were not native English speakers, there was a lot of time I think that I felt that I wanted to spend, and I did, on just creating space for people to comfortably share their ideas honestly. And that for me was really formative because I think it's really impacted how I've approached my entire career and I don't know that I would have, had I not had those experiences.\n\nLenny (51:52):\nI was browsing through your LinkedIn post and you said something just like that on LinkedIn of just how formative that experience was for you. I know it's not something people can just say, \"Hey, I'm going to go to China and work for a startup,\" but it sounds like you recommend working at companies of different cultures because it feels like it is a lens.\n\nNikita Miller (52:10):\nYeah. I do. I also think my family, I'm Jamaican, I'm a Jamaican immigrant, and so all of our experiences inform how we perform our jobs and how we think about problems. And being able to expand that, yes, I would recommend it to every and anyone that gets the opportunity. And I think it's really important as product managers because I think it's really hard to be a product manager if you cannot empathize with the people and problems that you're solving for, and being out of your comfort obviously is one way to learn empathy.\n\nLenny (52:50):\nI love that. One final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round, not to not count those questions. Are there just any frameworks or processes or methods that you found to be very valuable in your career as a product leader that you would want to share?\n\nNikita Miller (53:08):\nThe question I ask myself and I ask everyone in my life probably, whether it's on my team or when folks, friends talk to me, I always ask, \"What are you optimizing for?\" That's the question, it's what are you optimizing for? And it's the short, medium, lon-term in product, but it's what are you optimizing for today, this quarter, this year? Whatever time horizon. And I think that can be just a really illuminating way of thinking about obviously just how are you spending your time? And I think it works for product as well. Every time we talk about OKR or goal-setting, ultimately it is what are we optimizing for some period of time. And I think that always for me, whether personally or in product, is very illuminating.\n\nLenny (53:53):\nI love that. I'm pretty sure I've asked that question 1,000 times myself. One thing I find though is people get annoyed with you just like, \"Okay. You're such a PM.\"\n\nNikita Miller (54:02):\nI know, but it works.\n\nLenny (54:05):\nIt does work. What are some instances where you deploy this question? Is it in a meeting where someone's asking a question where you're just like, \"What are we optimizing for here?\"\n\nNikita Miller (54:14):\nI ask this question all the time. I ask this question to my husband. What are we optimizing for?\n\nLenny (54:17):\nI'm sure he loves it.\n\nNikita Miller (54:19):\nHe was a PM too, so he gets it.\n\nLenny (54:20):\nOkay, okay. That's helpful.\n\nNikita Miller (54:23):\nI ask this to my five-year-old, honestly. We talk about it a lot. Now we're going to quarterly planning, all of us, and now we have information from Q1 so let's look at it and say, \"Given what we know now, what are we optimizing for? Because it might not be the same thing we did before with new information or it may be,\" and that's usually just then helping us get better at figuring out obviously how we're doing trade-offs-\n\nLenny (54:55):\nThat's awesome.\n\nNikita Miller (54:56):\n... because if the first point isn't clear, then the trade-offs aren't going to be clear.\n\nLenny (54:59):\nYep. The other question is what problem are we trying to solve here? I feel like I need to make mugs and put these some mugs for product managers. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nNikita Miller (55:13):\nYes. I don't think I prepped this, but I'm ready. Yes.\n\nLenny (55:16):\nOkay. Well, it'll be the most fun then. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nNikita Miller (55:23):\nThese are not product books. I recommend Anna Akhmatova's You Will Hear Thunder, a book of poetry that is excellent. I recommend almost anything by James Baldwin, The Fire Next Time I most recently reread, and back to software, High Output Management.\n\nLenny (55:43):\nWhat are some favorite movies or TV shows they've recently watched that you really enjoyed?\n\nNikita Miller (55:49):\nI am really into K dramas right now, and actually-\n\nLenny (55:52):\nIs that Korean?\n\nNikita Miller (55:53):\n... Korean dramas right now. Crash Landing on You, it's great. It's a love story.\n\nLenny (56:01):\nThat's wonderful. Very out of the box. I love it. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask?\n\nNikita Miller (56:08):\nFor product managers, we think about product in the context of artist, scientist, general manager. Where do you spike?\n\nLenny (56:15):\nArtist, scientist, general manager. Interesting. And is there one you ideally look for the answer or it depends on the role you're hiring for?\n\nNikita Miller (56:23):\nIt totally depends on the composition of my team.\n\nLenny (56:26):\nInteresting. Cool. I like that. And a different triad. What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nNikita Miller (56:33):\nArc by The Browser Company. I think they're a product that's clearly having a lot of fun and you can feel that in the product. When I first opened it, they have an unveiling experience, which isn't something you'd expect of a browser, and there was something really delightful about it.\n\nLenny (56:51):\nYeah. I imagine you've heard the interview with Josh. \n\nNikita Miller (56:55):\nI did.\n\nLenny (56:55):\nWhat a guy. What a cool product. I love it. We have a whole hour and a half on it, so check that out if anyone wants to learn more about Arc. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a tremendous impact in your team's ability to execute?\n\nNikita Miller (57:11):\nHelping product teams try and use product, design, engineering and data to understand their shared roles and responsibilities.\n\nLenny (57:19):\nAwesome. Call back to our previous discussion. And final question. What's a pro tip for someone trying to use The Knot and or one of the other properties?\n\nNikita Miller (57:29):\nOoh, good question. Two things, but the big one is probably checking out The Knot Worldwide marketplace. It is the most comprehensive two-sided marketplace to find your wedding vendors to create your wedding team, and you'll find that they're really cool small businesses on there.\n\nLenny (57:47):\nAwesome. I'm going to go check that out. Nikita, thank you so much for being here. I'm going to go and ask my wife what she's optimizing for and read some stuff on the phone.\n\nNikita Miller (57:56):\nGood luck.\n\nLenny (57:57):\nWish me luck.\n\nNikita Miller (57:58):\nYou said she's pregnant, right? She's optimizing for creating a human probably.\n\nLenny (58:02):\nYeah. That seems right. Okay. I'm not going to ask. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and learn more about what you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nNikita Miller (58:13):\nYou? I'm on Twitter and LinkedIn, easy enough to find me. I am very responsive actually, or at least I try to be when folks reach out on anything product related. And ask me questions. I think that's always helpful. If you have other ways of doing things, I'd love to hear about it.\n\nLenny (58:29):\nYou mentioned also that you're doing some angel investing. Is there anything you're looking for specifically that you'd want people to ping you about?\n\nNikita Miller (58:35):\nI am doing some angel investing, maybe a little bit less so recently, but I'm starting to ramp that up again. So if there are any early stage seed or pre-seed companies out there, you can ping me.\n\nLenny (58:47):\nAmazing. Nikita, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nNikita Miller (58:50):\nAll right. Thanks a lot, Lenny.\n\nLenny (58:52):\nBye, everybody.\n\nNikita Miller (58:52):\nBye.\n\nLenny (58:55):\nThank you so much for listening.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:03:32):\nThanks for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny (00:03:33):\nSo you're chief product officer at Wise, which I don't know if you knew this, but I'm a very happy weekly active user of. To give folks a little bit of context on Wise, could you just explain, what does Wise do? And also share maybe a few stats to give people a sense of the scale that Wise has reached at this point.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:03:51):\nWe're looking to solve the problems associated with cross-border money movement, which is that moving money across border is pretty slow. It's actually really expensive, and it can be really hard to do. We solve it with three products, our money transfer product, which is what we started with, our account, which would be like, think of trying to solve the problems of international banking with our account for people, and for businesses. And then finally we've also got an enterprise product where we take the underlying infrastructure that's powered those products that we've built, and embed them in the banks, and products that people use every day, and then zooming into the numbers. So, we've got to come a little way on the journey. So today we're now moving about $12 billion a month, growing between 30 to 40% year on year. We take about 0.65% on average across all our routes as price, and we've been profitable for about more than four years now, with 20% EBITDA margins.\n\n(00:05:05):\nBut probably the stat I'm most proud of, and the hardest thing to make happen out of all of that was we acquired 70% of the users that found out about Wise last month through word of mouth. So, contextually, we have 16 million customers, and we're acquiring about a million a quarter, about 10 million actives, and yes, so out of a million that joined Wise the first time, 700,000 found out about Wise from a friend.\n\nLenny (00:05:36):\nThere's a couple stats there that really stand out to me. One is you're gaining a million new users a quarter, which is insane. Just like a million new people joining Wise every quarter. That's an astounding number. The other number is what you just shared around word of mouth, that basically more than two thirds of people are discovering Wise and joining Wise through word of mouth. Mouth. I want to spend the bulk of our conversation on this topic of word of mouth. I think it's extremely rare how you've been able to increase word of mouth, and just how much of your growth comes through word of mouth.\n\n(00:06:08):\nYou've essentially developed a system for how to drive word of mouth, and how to basically structure your team, your goals, your priorities and things like that in order to lean into this growth channel. And so, I just have a million questions around how you think about word of mouth, and the first is just, how do you measure word of mouth? How do you know that say, 70% of your growth is coming through word of mouth?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:06:28):\nWe ask customers, is the short answer. So, we have an attribution model, as you can imagine, and we've had one from the early days, and it overlays all the referrer data and cookie data you have on visits comes to the website. So you kind of know that. And then you obviously have the soundtrack stuff, and we sample, and ask customers a set of questions on this, and then overlay that onto the... What turns up in your web tracking as direct traffic to give us a sense of how big that word of mouth number is, and that's what gets us back to the 70% stat.\n\nLenny (00:07:05):\nAnd very practically, how do you actually ask people? Is there a little pop-up on the website?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:07:09):\nIt's actually integrated into the flow. So when we built it originally, we thought it's quite cool, marketing and acquiring customers is part of the product, and we should actually stitch that into the experience seamlessly so that we're able to do this more effectively going forward.\n\nLenny (00:07:26):\nThat's actually, at Airbnb, exactly how the team did that, to understand what percentage of growth was word of mouth. It's just a little interstitial popup when you visit say, airbnb.com, \"How'd you hear about us?\" You think there's some fancy ways to understand the stuff, but it's just like, just ask people, they'll tell you how they heard about it.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:07:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:07:41):\nAwesome. Okay, so just to kind of dig into the meat of it, what has been the biggest shift in helping you significantly grow word of mouth, and make it such a huge lever of growth for Wise?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:07:53):\nYeah, before I launch into this, let's just also take a step back, and why even focus on this? So in the early days, when I met the founders, Kristo and Tyler. It was quite funny, I got introed to them when they were just the founders, and without a team really, and with the beginnings of a product, and they said, \"Nilan, you've got to meet these guys, they've got a great product, they just don't have any customers.\" And I sat there with them, and we kind of launched the first Google ads, and in the early days you try everything, hoping that something works. But taking a step back, think of money as the ultimate commodity. It's pretty hard to build an expensive business that moves your money somewhere, and it costs a lot, so there's less of it afterwards.\n\n(00:08:48):\nSo building a brand led money transfer business, the brand's got to be pretty damn good, right? You're going to feel pretty special afterwards, in order to have less money afterwards. So what we're looking for always, but what channels out there are super scalable, and can reach our entire audience, but have an incredibly low distribution cost. So, that's one thing that led us to word of mouth and the other bit, when we get on to talk about marketing later, the other challenge with marketing which is unique is because we are lower price, but a superior product, we have less margin to spend on marketing than others in certain paid channels. So that's another reason why marketing is inherently hard. Our marketing team does amazing work at Wise, in order to work within those constraints.\n\n(00:09:36):\nBut back to your question, which was like, what's the biggest thing we've done to shift word of mouth. When I joined Wise, and started wrangling with word of mouth, I spent a bunch of time with friends of mine in the US and around the world, Andrew Chen, some of the other growth gurus, this is going back 10, 12 years. It's like what mouths, who's done it? What's the system? What do you measure? There wasn't really anything out there. So we kind of had to figure our way out. So, first step was asking it, and the second step was kind of figure out how do you know what's driving it? And the best proxy we found for this was something that most people have heard of, that we actually used quite a lot is net promoter score.\n\n(00:10:26):\nSo from the very early days we'd start asking customers, and you probably have seen this survey, \"Would you recommend Wise to a friend?\"\n\nLenny (00:10:34):\nNever seen that ever in my life. Never been asked that question.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:10:39):\nExactly. There's [inaudible 00:10:41] you said. And then in the end you've got the scale, zero to 10, and the theory is nine to 10 there are promoters, and zero to seven are detractors. Zero to six, detractors, and seven to eight are kind of neutral on your product. The intriguing bet was when we overlaid this... So we have word of mouth, it's about 50 odd percent, and then we have a referral program. When we overlay the referral data over the NPS survey data, we saw something really interesting.\n\n(00:11:13):\nThere's very low invite rates at one to six, and not just invite, conversion rates of users that joined for invites. But when we've got people from sixes to this seven and eight group, they doubled the number of people they told. Eight to nine, they doubled again, and nine to 10, they doubled again. So, this is pretty crazy when you see it for the first time. I'm going to get back to your question in a sec, but it's quite core buildup to it, because when you are a product manager, like you've been in your career, one of your jobs is to figure out what metric are you going to optimize for? What are you going to try to get the business to ground behind? And if you optimize for something like conversion, rate and you move conversion rate with 10%, you kind of get this one-off hit.\n\n(00:12:00):\nBut if you move the NPS from 30% to 50%, you increase the viral coefficient of your customer base. So every customer that goes through tells X many more. When you model this through, the ROI on NPS increases is absolutely huge. So, it's got to say, \"Okay, this is the thing to zoom in on, so how to move it?\" So, then the second magic of NPS is you get the numbers, but you also get the comments underneath it. I remember in the first year we built the NPS survey, and we emailed out every week all the comments to the whole company, which was pretty small, and we kept doing that, I think up till about three or four years, everyone got the NPS comments.\n\n(00:12:51):\nAnd when you read the comments, and now obviously we've got all kinds of fancy models sitting on top of these things, customers kept telling us the same things, \"Make it faster, make it cheaper, make it easier to use.\" Do you know at the beginning, when I said, \"Price, speed, ease of use,\" we kind of figured this out by thinking hard about this question. How do we make this product so good that people will use, it but they'll recommend it?\n\n(00:13:20):\nAnd customers were pretty clear, the ones that were evangelical, is the word we use, are the ones that had a much... Had this cheaper experience, the ones that were talking about it had a fast experience. So it's about price, about speed, it's about ease of use. And when you generalize and take a step back, and look at consumer product companies, they have these product pillars they call it, and they usually have KPIs around them. The second insight we got, found, is when we entered markets, like when we entered the US for the first time, if we entered with a product that was priced at say 5.9%, and the alternative was six, customers would use us, but they wouldn't talk about us. We only got the advocacy when we were eight to 10 times cheaper. That's when people started talking about it.\n\nLenny (00:14:11):\nLet me actually interrupt you here a bit, just to kind of set a little frame around this, because this is extremely interesting, and I think people may miss, I think, some of the really interesting insights here. What I'm hearing is essentially there's this clear sense that you had to grow through word of mouth because of the business model. You didn't make a lot of money per user, and you didn't have a lot of money to spend thus, to help grow. So essentially it's like. \"How do we grow the word of mouth?\" And then it's, \"Okay, what do we need to convince people to share this product?\" And used NPS, which I think a lot of people use, and also a lot of people probably know, \"Let's make our product more awesome so that people talk about it.\" Those are kind of like, \"Oh yeah, of course.\"\n\n(00:14:49):\nBut I think what I'm hearing is that you did that's really unique, is one, you found this huge delta between these detractors, and even seven or... I guess it was six and below, and then seven or eight, and then nine, 10 kept kind of doubling. So one is just this focus on, how do we get someone from there to there? Two is this really big focus on the comments of the NPS survey, not just like, \"Oh we have this percentage of detractors.\" And then also I love how you just create these pillars, essentially, of like, \"We're going to work on these three things. These are the three levers to help grow word of mouth for this product.\" Does that sound about right?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:15:25):\nThat all makes sense. Obviously at the time, it is also way more chaotic.\n\nLenny (00:15:33):\nYeah.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:15:33):\nSo, at the beginning, everyone thinks it's 20 different things, and then over time, slowly, you understand that it's these things again and again. And a lot of building a successful businesses kind of building conviction that these are the things that matter. So, now I'd say price, speed, ease of use, it sounds... Like, but yeah, go back to seven, eight years. But we were arguing with each other around what, \"Is it trust? Is it this? Is it this?\" Trying to get clear on what are the things we missed there.\n\nLenny (00:16:00):\nThat would be useful actually to know. It sounds like, of course, it's going to be price and speed, but what are the things you kind of realize you don't need to focus on as much, based on these surveys?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:16:09):\nOh, wow, that's a really hard one. So, then the challenge, is as you know, everything is important.\n\nLenny (00:16:17):\nYeah.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:16:17):\nYeah? And that things that we use... We have a bucket called convenience. And inside the convenience bucket, there are many, many things hiding in there. And actually, you can measure this on contact rate, conversion rate, whatever, many different ways, and get many slightly different answers. So, I think I've learned there isn't... I haven't got a good answer on things we haven't-\n\nLenny (00:16:42):\nWell, as you said, trust, which is interesting. Obviously trust matters, but maybe it sounds like-\n\nNilan Peiris (00:16:47):\nTrust certainly matters. Yeah, trust's a good one. Let's talk about that one bit. I'll talk to you through the trust problem. So I ran into the trust problem hardest in marketing. So, just imagine, you just started out, you've got a money transfer company, it's good, your product's really good, it's really cheap. So, you put an ad out, and it says, \"Move money with Wise, and really cheaply,\" is anyone going to click that? People did, right? Is anyone going to use it? Yeah, people did use it. And you did work all the usual trust elements. But the bit I found that really helped, the way I got my head around this, was what people trust is their friends. And this really was way stronger a trust signal than anything I could put on a landing page.\n\n(00:17:40):\nAnd even when people came in through marketing, they'd been told. So marketing can aid recall, and all kinds of things, because people are told by their friends. They'd have a use case later on, then Google, and like, \"Ah, I remember, this guy used this.\" And we do definitely get users, especially today as we've got a larger brand, through marketing direct. But trust in isolation is a really hard problem to solve. You need to get under the skin of what it means. People don't think my money is safe. \"I don't know if this company is reputable,\" to unpick each of these problems and figure out systemically how to solve them. And we've done this to some extent, but really there's a massive shortcut, which is if you deliver your customers a good experience, then figure out, how do you make it so good they'll recommend it? Then that kind of shortcut a lot of really hard trust problems.\n\nLenny (00:18:28):\nWhat did you find most helped increase trust in that way? Is it just get more people using it and then they'll share with their friends, or is there something you did there to...\n\nNilan Peiris (00:18:36):\nNo, it was literally get more people using it, and they'll share with their friends. There's obviously a bunch of learnings we've had around what specific trust sentiments matter, especially geographically, but less powerful in the macro than get more people to use it.\n\n(00:18:52):\nSo coming back to that, and I'd love to get your thoughts on this one. So, as you said, lots of people go up to NPS, and they kind of heard people talk about it, heard people talk about recommendations. So my learning on this is you've got to work really hard to get recommendation. So, to get a nine or a 10, so our NPS is 70%, so it's really, really high. So it's kind of higher than the iPhone, and Google search. So really, really high, so off the scale high.\n\n(00:19:25):\nAnd when we launch a market, or at the beginning it was much lower, so 20s and 30s. So instead it in context, like banks and financial services NPS is -30. So, most people don't recommend banks. So it's like, comes from a low base. But, what I've found is when you build a product, most founders, and most teams kind of stop when it works. As their next step, some people focus on conversion rate like, \"I'm going to make this really, really slick,\" and that's cool, you get a bit more growth.\n\n(00:20:02):\nBut to get to recommendation, you're going to blow your users' socks off, and the phrase we use is, you have to give them an experience they didn't know was previously possible. And when you are in that place of doing something that no one has ever done before, that's where you get it.\n\n(00:20:24):\nSo the bar is all the way up there. And to put that in context, that means figuring out how to move money instantly. That means figuring out how to drop the price all the way from six all the way down to 0.35. And that's because there are systemic infrastructure issues in moving money around the world, which some people haven't solved before. And these problems are just really hard to solve. They take years to solve, but they have huge kind of returns when you do it.\n\nLenny (00:20:52):\nI love that just as a framework, is how do... We need to blow our users' socks off. And again, it just comes back to how you can get people to want to share this product, and drive word of mouth, blow their socks off.\n\n(00:21:02):\nI want to dig into how you actually just figured out what these attributes are. Obviously you talked about this NPS survey highlighting things. How did you decide it was instant money movement, and some of the other things? Is it just basically looking at these survey results, and picking the things that come up most often?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:21:20):\nYeah, it was talking to customers, and looking at the survey results, and then through that, in many different ways, price will come up, speed will come up, ease of use will come up, and they kind of aggregate up to that.\n\nLenny (00:21:31):\nI think a lot of people listening are still going to be this like, \"Okay, we're just going to make our product awesome, and it's going to grow.\" And in a sense, yeah, in another sense what you're sharing is essentially kind of a really simple framework for how to actually do that. To kind of go a little deeper there, when you see other people trying to drive word of mouth, trying to drive virality, is there anything you think people often do wrong? Is there other missteps you've taken in trying to drive word of mouth?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:21:59):\nIt's this thing around growth rate. So, especially product net growth, which is what we're talking about. So you can imagine, we're going to open a new market to Indonesia, and the fastest way to do it is to take... Someone else has figured out how to move to Indonesia. We take that infrastructure, and we'll plug it into Wise,\n\n(00:22:18):\nYou know what? We can do this, we'll get some users. But it doesn't grow like a hockey stick. It doesn't grow like a hockey stick because we haven't fundamentally changed the problems in moving money internationally. So, got this mantra, you've got to build a 10x better product than what's there. And if it's 10x product better, basically it doesn't exist already. So if you're plugging in something else, that's kind of a misstep.\n\n(00:22:45):\nSo it comes from a very logical place, how do I get users quickly? I can take a shortcut in doing this, but that, you kind of realize is wasted effort. So the step then becomes this much harder question of these types of questions. Like what is the theoretical minimum cost for moving money into a market? What is the theoretical maximum speed? Not just make it instant, make it cheap, but what actually is the lowest it could possibly be? And instead of incrementally going, doing a jump to make it a little better, a little better, a little better, you can never get there. How do we take two years, and end up there?\n\nLenny (00:23:24):\nI love that. It's something that I talk about a lot. Something I learned at Airbnb is this idea of working backwards from the ideal, instead of working forwards from how do we iterate and make this better, and better, and better. It's like, okay, if we could start again, and we could create the ideal experience, what would that look like? And then work backwards from what would it take to get there?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:23:44):\nAnd what's an example of that at Airbnb? What was an ideal that you guys went for and then built?\n\nLenny (00:23:49):\nThe ideal was, there's this whole process where the founders hired this storyboard artist from Pixar to draw out the ideal experience of a host and a guest. So, there's these storyboards sitting in the office. I think there's 12 kind of... They call them key frames of, it's just like the booking experience being really seamless, arriving in the home, and being really amazed. Going out and finding things to do.\n\n(00:24:13):\nSo, this became essentially the vision of the company is let's make each of these frames, these key moments of a journey for hosting a guest as incredible as possible. That was one, and that became essentially the strategy for a few years is just make each of these frames awesome.\n\n(00:24:29):\nAnd then there was another project that they were working on around booking at Airbnb. I don't know if you remember this, if you used Airbnb much, but most of Airbnb back in the day was you request to book with a host, you're like, \"Hey, can I stay in your home?\"\n\nNilan Peiris (00:24:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:24:42):\nAnd turned out 50% of the time the guest was ignored, or rejected, and the host was just like, \"Nah, no thank you.\" Now, over 80% as far as I know of bookings are instant bookings, where you just book and it's done, just like every other place you book online. And so that was a huge transition that I worked on, and that came from, if we were to start Airbnb again today, or if someone were to disrupt Airbnb, what would it look like? And obviously it'd be you just book. You're not sitting around hoping someone is cool with you. So, that came from that idea of just like, what would be the ideal Airbnb experience?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:25:15):\nThat is incredibly inspiring. I'll try and share a couple of stories, analogies from Wise. I'll talk about two things. Let's talk about price first. So, it's a good question. So, Moneytrans has been around since the [inaudible 00:25:32]. How does a few people get together? And it's evolved towards moving trillions around the world, and generally retail consumers paying about six to 7% around the world to do it. How do a small team in Europe start out and figure out how to move it? We launched at 0.5%, and now we're down to about 0.35%. So what changed?\n\nLenny (00:25:57):\nYeah, I was going to ask, how did you do that? That sounds like everyone would want to do that.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:26:02):\nYeah, so let's try to unpick it a little bit. So, first question you'd ask is, \"I know what you're doing, you're losing money on every transfer.\" It's like, \"Especially what you're doing,\" but we've been profitable for five years. And one of the magical things here was we're actually profitable in every transaction. So it's probably about four or five years ago, I led this project to start to pull together our pricing.\n\n(00:26:30):\nSo, every month you get bills, and they turn up in your P&L, but every single bill we got, we allocated the cost back to the customer, or the transaction that generated it. And then we add our margin on top, and that's our price. And when you look at this and you analyze it, you'll find obviously there are 20% of customers generating 80% of the costs. And what you do is you get those 20%, you give them a raise, because they should cover their costs, and you drop the price to everyone else. And then the team works really hard on reducing these costs down, and then you move into a different segment in the market as the price costs come down. Does that make sense, Lenny?\n\nLenny (00:27:13):\nYeah. Essentially charge the heavier users more to counteract less frequent users. And essentially that drives word of mouth.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:27:22):\nTotally, but it's down to this level of, if an Australian customer calls up asking, \"Where is my transfer?\" That cost of that call gets allocated back to the AUD/GBP route. If a Brazilian business needs like 20 documents in order to be verified before we can give them an account, the cost of verifying check those customers goes back there, so that at a very atomic level starts happening. So yeah, as you said, the more expensive customers end up paying what they cost.\n\nLenny (00:27:51):\nAnd it sounds like the more expensive markets.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:27:55):\nIndeed, and the more expensive, systemically expensive markets. But let's get to that. So, what are the costs? So if you look at our P&L, there's just three costs at transaction level. You've got people costs, you've got the cost of risk, realized risk, and then you've got partner fees.\n\n(00:28:16):\nAnd so if you've got this mission of moving the world's money for almost nothing, or zero, as close to zero as you can, you've got to invest as much of your cashflow in engineering to try to engineer away these three problems. So just to take them through briefly a bit, and remember, we're trying to do this 10 times better than anyone else. So how do you really change the experience on each of them?\n\n(00:28:40):\nI'll cover a couple with you. So let's do the risk one first. There's two risks we have. We have have FX risk, you come to Wise you see your rate, and then you may send us the money a little later. If you're moving a million dollars, you can't usually move it instantly. It might take you two to three days to move it. The rate's locked, could move against us, we'd lose some money.\n\n(00:29:01):\nSo that cost, if you look back, so we've halved that cost over the last few years, and you can imagine through understanding the bits of the product, they generate exposure, and limiting it, and a bunch of algorithms behind that. But the more inspiring stuff is the people costs, and the partner costs, go through each of these one at a time.\n\n(00:29:25):\nSo the people costs are our customer service team, operations teams. But I like to think of that as the cost of poor quality. So you bring up customer support if the products are clear, you hire lots of people in the back office. If you haven't automated it. We get like 20% improvement year on year as we're doing that. But come back to your question, how do you step change that? How do you do a 10x better experience?\n\n(00:29:49):\nI'll share with you a story from Singapore. It's quite a fun one. Because we went to Singapore about six, seven years ago, and [inaudible 00:29:58], we asked for a license. We had 20,000 people on the wait list, or so, saying, \"Wise, please come to Singapore.\" And we went there, we asked the regular, \"Hey, can you give us a license?\" They gave us the license, but they said, \"You have to physically meet every single customer.\"\n\nLenny (00:30:13):\nGreat.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:30:14):\nFace-to-face. And this happens, this is... Remember, they're banks that people use. So people go into banks usually, and you get face-to-face verified when you open a bank account. We're like, \"You don't need to do this in Australia, in the UK, in other countries around the world.\" They're like, \"In Singapore, for your license, you need to do this.\" So we actually sent a small team out to Singapore, and we opened an office through [inaudible 00:30:43], and customers... You went through this really slick flow, and then you got invited in to come see the team.\n\nLenny (00:30:49):\nAmazing.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:30:50):\nAnd customers hated it, and it was really expensive, obviously.\n\nLenny (00:30:56):\nYeah.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:30:57):\nBut the magic was we got the customers not to complain to us, but to complain to the government. And it took a year of lobbying, and a year of building, doing something unscalable effectively, before we got the world's first EKYC license in Singapore. So you could take a selfie, picture of your ID, and then you could get verified.\n\n(00:31:21):\nAnd that's what I call a 10x better experience than anyone else in the market, and that led to advocacy and word of mouth off the back of it. And that loop of getting your customers to help was also one of the learnings of word of mouth.\n\nLenny (00:31:35):\nWas the product team involved? Were you involved in that on the ground stuff? Or was it like [inaudible 00:31:40]?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:31:39):\nYeah, yeah. Generally when we go [inaudible 00:31:43], we're running cross-functional teams, but this is a verification team. The team actually would verify the docs when you sent it to us. They went out to Singapore, verified them onsite, face-to-face.\n\n(00:31:54):\nSo the fun bit here is why would customers help a company? And this is one of the other learnings on word of mouth. The way I think about this is that there are the rational reasons why people recommend, which we've covered. But there's these emotional ones as well. Softer ones people would call brand. I prefer to call it on the mission.\n\n(00:32:19):\nSo we do our mission, which is to make the world's money move instantly at the touch of a button, for almost nothing. It was a very personal thing, it was like an internal company thing, to think our customers cared about it. And then we rebranded like eight, nine years ago, our first rebrand, and we wrote our mission and sent it to our customers.\n\n(00:32:41):\nWe got more new customers from that email being forwarded around than any other kind of marketing. And I show this when I talk at conferences. This email broke all the rules of marketing. It didn't have a call to action, it didn't have a button to sign up, it didn't have anything in it, but people just forwarded it around saying, \"You should check out Wise.\"\n\n(00:32:59):\nAnd it's not all the customer base, but there was a proportion of the customer base that this resonated in. And I think it's the authenticity within which they could see that we were genuinely trying to.... Trying to bring the prices down was a scheme to help us grow faster, which is kind of where it started out, was actually genuinely because founders, they were really upset about how much it cost to money.\n\n(00:33:27):\nThey found good ways to solve that problem, and they're still really passionate about solving that problem. And they could see that authenticity flows through the whole company, because we got a... When you look at Wise, we're full of people on visas, and immigrants, and people that have worked, and live around the world, and struggled with this problem, and are passionate about solving it. And so they wanted to help us solve it. So the second part of this word of mouth engine is for us, we managed to get this mission thing to work.\n\n(00:33:53):\nSo somehow we emotionally connect our cause, and then I see going, taking a step back, getting 10x better on price is through our customers helping us do it, which gets us even cheaper, which then brings more customers, that then creates this flywheel that's spins around.\n\nLenny (00:34:11):\nWhat a flywheel you guys have built. This reminds me of a lot of different things. One is you talked about how there's the reality of the things people need, and then there's this soft, fuzzy stuff that's harder to quantify. I actually is the framework just like that on that product I talked about of instant booking.\n\n(00:34:27):\nI kind of built a roadmap around the reality of what people actually need in order to feel comfortable, guests booking instantly. And then I call it the perception, what are their fears about letting guests book instantly? And there's a lot of work to just convince them, you think you're going to get all these guests that are really scary or whatever, but in reality it never happens. It's really rare something bad happens, and if it does, we're going to cover it.\n\n(00:34:50):\nSo, I think that's a really cool framework when you're trying to get people to adopt something, is think about what do they actually need? And then how do you convince them of the things that are just in their head? And it sounds like the win there was kind of this sharing your mission and your values as a business.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:35:05):\nYeah, it just sounds, again very tweedy, right? Tweedy, like sounds very corporate, sounds like it's never going to work, but I think it's also... I mean, Airbnb, the authenticity is there. People are passionate about making that experience work for both sides of the marketplace. It's kind of clear. So, I'm kind of taking a step back, personally very passionate about customer-led growth, and how that turns into shareholder value.\n\n(00:35:32):\nSo, taking a step back, where every business I've ever worked in, it's always got these two lists, a list of things to do for your customers, and then it's got a list of things to do to make money. And you generally do everything you need to do to make money, and you do two things with the customer list, and you go, \"Customer led business.\" And then, neat thing about wise, and I'm pretty sure you'll see the same thing on Airbnb is, we just had one list, which is this list of things that you need to do to make customers happy, and it's prioritized by impact on the really hard things. And if you do these really hard things, they have an incredible impact for customers, but hence on your growth, and on your shareholder value.\n\nLenny (00:36:11):\nThat is really interesting. Airbnb is not quite like that. It's actually become more like that with a lot of just like, \"Let's build awesome products and not focus on experiments as much.\" So that's really interesting that prioritization basically at Wise came from, \"What are people telling us?\" I guess let me ask actually, how did you know what the impact would be on customers? How did you decide? Is it frequency of how often people request it? Is it, \"We need to lower the cost, and so we're just going to prioritize the things that will lower prices most?\"\n\nNilan Peiris (00:36:37):\nDefinitely on the journey at the beginning, you are into split testing, right? Let's try to take apart a split test on price. So, you've systemically dropped the cost. Imagine we drop the cost. The question is, do we drop the price? Do we pass that all on to customers? And do we keep some of it? And split testing on the price thing, if the split test is going to mean you end up with more revenue, it means you drop the price by 10%, and there happened to be that day, more than 10% more customers in the market who, they saw the price at one pound, but they see the price at 90p, at 10% lower, and they're like, \"I wasn't going to shift at buy at one pound but I'm going to buy it 90p.\"\n\n(00:37:23):\nSo this is pretty hard to do this. This word around conviction is one I use a lot, where you build this conviction that price is what matters. And through this incremental split test, you will take a long time to go there, but at some point you kind of go, \"Actually I've got enough conviction.\" So there's one kind of strategic bet at the heart of Wise. That is if we have the lowest cost platform, and it's really fast, and really high quality, the world's volume will switch to us. And just marginally getting there step by step by step, and trying to track the incremental return is actually slower. And there's a point that comes that you go, \"I feel really comfortable investing in price. I feel comfortable investing in speed, because I know it's going to pay back, and not necessarily this month, but eventually it will, and I need to make gains on all three levers in order to get there.\" Does that make sense?\n\nLenny (00:38:13):\nYeah, absolutely. So essentially, in that track of work, instead of everything that you did to reduce price, there wasn't an experiment to see, \"What impact does this have on growth, or revenue?\" Instead, it's just, \"We know reducing price is going to help us grow, and so we're just going to track how much we're cutting price.\" And that's essentially the goals, I imagine, were just cut the price by some amount, find a way to make it this much cheaper every, say, quarter, or year.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:38:37):\nYeah, that's it. You got it. And that conviction is core. That extends to our product management approach on the UX. So this is a great line for use internally, I'm sure you've heard it, \"You can't split test your way to love.\" So, this experiment led product management approach, where you throw a bunch of things on the wall, and then you kind of see what sticks, and generally we don't advocate this. Obviously there's a bit of it that happens, but generally don't advocate it. Mainly because engineering is expensive, and you can actually figure out what matters to customers through other means. Some of the techniques we've talked, and build it.\n\n(00:39:21):\nThere's a story I like to share. I had a product manager join our refer a friend team, viral growth team, and invite team, and after a quarter, I said, \"So what are you going to build?\" And he's like, \"I'm going to test everything. I'm going to test the landing page, I'm going to test the subject line, I'm going to test the program so I don't know yet till run through all the tests, then I'm going to come back and tell you what I'm going to build.\"\n\n(00:39:47):\nI said, \"You're not going to do this. I'm going to give you three weeks and you're going to pick one thing to change, but you're going to go talk to people, and get quantitative insights, and build your own gut feel around what matters, and then launch it, and submit, test it, and see if it works.\" But this thing of building conviction on what matters, and I watch how teams slowly build this and you need the data there to make sure it doesn't become a hubris, right? That enables you to make much bigger changes than just experimenting away, and it forces you to get clear on what actually is the problem to solve here, and how do I solve it really, really well? Does that make sense, Lenny, Do you disagree? It's a bit provocative there. Some people are pretty strong in the expert led approach.\n\nLenny (00:40:30):\nNo, there's many ways to do it. There's no right way, and it's working. So I'm not going to argue.\n\n(00:40:35):\nThis episode is brought to you by Masterworks, the premier art investing platform, where some everyday investors have earned a 35% net return. Yes, a 35% net return alongside 16 other exits, including 10 and 17% net returns. Contemporary art has outpaced the S&P 500 by 136% over the last 27 years. Citibank and Deloitte have reported that contemporary art has performed well as an inflation hedge, and the appreciation is almost entirely uncorrelated to other financial markets. Even the CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, has said it's one of the greatest stores of wealth internationally. However, there's never been a way to invest in it practically without spending millions. But now Masterworks allows almost anyone to invest in works by artists like Banksy, Basquiat, and Monet.\n\n(00:41:22):\nIn fact, Masterworks latest exit just last month delivered another double-digit annualized net return for their investors since the New York Times first reported on them in 2019, they've grown to over 800,000 users, and had some new offerings sell out in literal minutes. But you get special access and can jump the wait list queue at masterworks.art/lenny. As with any investment, past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investing involves risk. See important regulations and disclosures and aggregate advisory performance masterworks.com/cv. Again for special access to skip the wait list, go to masterworks.art/lenny.\n\n(00:42:00):\nSo, what I'm hearing essentially, the experimentation culture at Wise is instead of just run, test everything that you're thinking about, throw out a bunch of ideas and see how they go, it's more, \"Let's just decide we believe in this idea, and let's go bigger there, and run an experiment. Maybe not even.\" Is that roughly how you think about it?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:42:18):\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And is that something that you've seen yourself in practice elsewhere?\n\nLenny (00:42:23):\nIt's interesting how many parallels there are to Airbnb, because this is what Airbnb is doing now. There's been a shift recently, where instead of everything is very data experiment driven, it's very just like, \"Let's build really great products that the founders are really excited about, and that the execs are hearing from people. Let's just build things that are awesome and launch them, and we believe things will grow.\" And Airbnb is doing great.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:42:47):\nYeah, the challenge of this is because it does become this risk thing of where it's like, okay, it's someone's opinion, so I think it's X, right? And everyone thinks they're kind of Steve Jobs type thing.\n\nLenny (00:43:00):\nYeah. That's right.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:43:01):\nYou have some way of using data to get this conviction, and show why this is what we should do, but try to learn how to build that faster CME, slight difference. So, it's less product managers or me saying, \"Hey guys, I think it's X.\" It's generally data driven, and qualitative insights driven as well.\n\nLenny (00:43:23):\nPersonally, I would always index towards running experiments just to put this out there, but I think in this case, it makes sense, where you just know, \"We need to do these three things, just make it cheaper, make it faster.\" You don't need to AB test every idea there. Probably the main downside of not testing everything is you may be hurting things along the way, and you may not know it.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:43:42):\nI mean, yeah, so we definitely do... So you're right. But there's a very different thing to when you look at the... From a sample size perspective, you want to do a beta, and understand the negative impact. It's a holdout group that's smaller, than a test to get a significance. It's quite define the criteria to know whether something is breaking, is generally a different thing to say, is this a material result in a test? Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:44:09):\nAnd along those lines, the other benefit of experimentation is you know the impact. And so, team members can understand, \"Here's what I did this quarter, this year.\" How do you think about just like performance reviews, and people's impact, and that kind of thing?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:44:21):\nYeah, that's a good one. This one is definitely an ongoing debate. So, I generally ask teams what's their impact? So, every quarter, every team, what... [inaudible 00:44:29] or Kristo will ask, \"What did you ship?\" And I generally ask, \"How many people used it? What was the impact on volume?\" Et cetera. And we have analyst teams that can answer this either with pre-post analysis, all kinds of techniques, or all through split tests. We generally have this, the debate is where the analysis slows us down, and we wouldn't make a decision off the back of the analysis.\n\n(00:44:54):\nAnd then, this generally is what you said, where the team needs a validation, mainly for themselves, and maybe a little performance, but not too much. And so, there were ways in which you can maybe get some read on it that isn't quite as strong as a split test, which we'd use in these things. It's more just getting some... You can understand that people worried when you do split tests that slow down the release of something, but in order to get impact, if you know you're not going to roll it back, then okay, you should just roll it out, and try to reduce the need for that validation.\n\nLenny (00:45:31):\nI think that there's an interesting correlation between products that grow through word of mouth, and less need to experiment with everything. Airbnb is also actually 70% of growth is word of mouth from the last stat that I heard. And then you think about all these social consumer apps, they mostly grow through people sharing with their friends, and a lot of them come from just the founder's intuition of what a great product's going to be. I think about Snapchat, and the recent mobile social apps. And so I think maybe there's something there about just as a founder, trusting your gut more often. But then it becomes difficult as you grow. You have to delegate, and then you have to trust people on your team making the right decisions. I guess, is there anything there that you've learned about just trusting individual product teams to make decisions that you can't for sure know are positive or negative without running experiments?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:46:23):\nSo, as I say, almost everything we do, we have some way of understanding the impact. So, that's always there. We definitely have things where the team does something where Kristo or I will say, \"This is just crazy. There's no way they're going to use this.\" And then we have a culture where people are encouraged to do these things, if they believe in it.\n\nLenny (00:46:48):\nIs there an example of that?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:46:49):\nYeah, a couple. So the one [inaudible 00:46:52] that my head of SEO always talks about is a currency converter. So, the Wise homepage is a pretty good currency converter. It's got a decent one on there. There's tons of traffic on currency converter. So, if you click Wise link, now it's a little bit hidden on send, it's there. It's pretty cool. Currency converter.\n\nLenny (00:47:10):\nOh I see it at the bottom there. Yeah, it's like [inaudible 00:47:13].\n\nNilan Peiris (00:47:14):\nBut if you Google currency converter, there's tons of traffic, and that converter on the Wise homepage obviously includes our price, and lets you sign up. And so, should we build a currency convertor? Should we try to capture this traffic? Is it more effective to try to push our own product there? And you can kind of understand why it was Kristo, actually not me, that was like, \"This is a crazy idea.\" And the founder, and the SEO team went out and built it, and it's huge now, in terms of visits. I think we've got a currency convertor app out there. I think we've got [inaudible 00:47:51] out there, and yeah, people discover wise through that, as an example of off-topic traffic, but that's a good example of one of those things where yeah, the founder said, \"No,\" or, \"That's' a bad idea,\" and we kind of went ahead, and did it anyway.\n\nLenny (00:48:07):\nAwesome. I'm just thinking about broadly all the things we've been talking about. There's a couple of things that were floating around in my head. One is, reminds me of Amazon, where Jeff Bezos realized there are things that are going to be always true with Amazon. People always want cheaper prices, they want faster shipping. And I think there's something else. And it feels like you guys found the same sort of thing. What are the three things people always want with a money transfer product? And let's just make those as incredible as possible, and in your eyes, make them 10 times better than what anyone else has out there.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:48:40):\nYeah, totally. The business one example is relevant, and use it a lot when we talk to investors in the market, [inaudible 00:48:49] public helps validate this low cost, cutting price story. What's interesting is what changed though. So we started with transfers, but we got to account, and then we got to enterprise. Just what changed was we realized with account, if you just have to move $10, you're not going to download an app and do it. If you do it once, you're just going to do it in your bank. And so, that was a little bit of the insight behind building the Wise account, and we kind of focused on, there's a real problem with international banking.\n\n(00:49:22):\nSo, really good example is for businesses. So if you are a business, say, in... Say a business in Europe, you've got a customer in Australia, and you want to get paid, you send them an invoice in Euros, and someday, some money's going to turn up in your account, you're like, \"I don't know.\" They paid you an AUD, it got changed by three banks on the way through. You don't know what it is. What you'd love to do is invoice them in AUD, and get AUD in your bank account. You might even have people who need to pay in AUD, so you have to call to keep it there. But to get an Australian bank account, I found out, you need to fly to Australia, you need to incorporate a business in Australia, you need to go to a bank with all those papers, and then they will give you an Australian bank account number.\n\nLenny (00:50:06):\nGreat.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:50:07):\nSo with Wise, you can get an Australian bank account number with three clicks. Anyone can, and any business can, and you get an Australian balance, and a US, and a UK, and a Swiss bank. And this is killer for businesses that receive money internationally. And then the next big jump we did, and for consumers, so there are plenty of people, if all your banking is in the US, you probably shouldn't use Wise, but if you're somebody who uses another currency a lot, then you probably should use us as your primary bank.\n\n(00:50:37):\nThere's some people, for example, who live in one country and get paid in another currency, and this is... Wise is great as an account for managing that. And we found with that, we got about... As we launched the account in markets, it was about a 20 to 30% more volume, cross-border volume coming into Wise from that market. Just a good example of how, while it's not price, not speed, you could argue is kind of ease of use, but we had to evolve it in order to get to the next tranche of the market. Does that make sense, Lenny?\n\nLenny (00:51:07):\nAbsolutely. And it all just comes back from what would be the theoretical ideal situation for people transferring money, say from Australia. And what I'm hearing is just find all the little friction points that get in the way. In this case you're like, \"Okay, we'll create you an Australian bank account, and you don't even worry about it.\"\n\nNilan Peiris (00:51:25):\nYeah, that's exactly it. And so now then you have all these other problems, because we've got about $12.5 billion in deposits now, which is like a time. And the next problem customers are at is, \"I want a return.\" And we quite deliberately don't have a banking license. You have to figure out, how are we going to solve that? We now put customers money in government bonds, US bonds, and when you pay with your card, it dynamically sells those bonds. And that's how we give you an interest rate, in roundabout 5% right now, given where bond rates are.\n\nLenny (00:51:58):\nYeah, interest rates are quite high, for better or worse. Zooming out a little bit, for folks that are starting to... Their wheels are turning, they're like, \"Okay, I want to think about word of mouth, driving word of mouth. I'm going to go look at my survey results. I'm going to figure out these pillars that are driving word of mouth. I'm going to think about how to make things 10 times better.\" Just broadly, for someone that's starting to approach this, what would you say to them? How should they approach this? Any major learnings at a higher level, of just how to drive word of mouth for a product?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:52:30):\nI think it just comes back to talking to customers and this is the question we've kept coming back to. What would it take to make it 10x better? And then you get clear in your head what it would take, and then it's usually the thing that everyone's looked at before and thought, it's the thing that's impossible. One more example is on the partner side. So, rather than find a cheaper bank for a banking partner, you think, well, the cheapest banking partner is the central bank. And imagine you're a startup. How the hell do you get a bank account at the central bank?\n\n(00:53:08):\nBut that kind of thinking, and we now have a bank account at the Bank of England, the National Bank of Singapore, Bank of Australia. And each of these was as hard as getting that face-to-face verification thing in Singapore. It took years of lobbying, and all kinds of stuff, in order to make it happen. But it's setting your goal all the way up there. That's what enables you to build a 10x better product. That's what gets you to the word of mouth. So, the first step is getting super clear on what's the problems that my customers are caring about, worrying about? And then once you're clear there, as you said, how can I solve that completely, and what's the best it could possibly be? And then the hard bit is figuring out how to move that.\n\nLenny (00:53:48):\nA lot of these things you're talking about are just, they sound like they are either impossible, like no way we're going to achieve that, or really, really hard. And a lot of companies, and a lot of founders, teams are just like, \"Okay, we're not ever going to create a bank here. We're not going to be able to create an Australian bank account for everyone.\" What is it about your culture, or approach to these problems that you think that's unique to Wise that's like, \"No, we're going to spend three years figuring this out, because it's that important?\"\n\nNilan Peiris (00:54:16):\nI think it's two [inaudible 00:54:17]. So one is, definitely the founders have this philosophy that unless you're doing something hard and new, it's kind of a waste of time. So, I think that also kind of runs through the culture. So, it's quite a rude awakening when people join Wise, because they're like, \"Okay, I'm going to come, and just play around with a few things.\" You're like, \"No, actually, the culture of the product team is we're super incentivized to do the hard things, and that's what's rewarded.\"\n\n(00:54:46):\nAnd that's quite hard to create the air cover. You can imagine like then in the early days and months when growth was slow, and people turned on the money taps in marketing, and you're trying to keep focused and plugging your away up these hard things, it's quite hard also to get the management cover in order to let the teams keep doing this. And then it's also hard just to turn up to work and really keep... You can imagine being in Singapore, verifying customers face-to face, thinking, \"This is going nowhere, this is going nowhere, this is going nowhere.\" And then suddenly it changes. So that's what progress very much feels like at Wise. And we try to recognize that, and create a culture that enables that.\n\nLenny (00:55:21):\nIt feels like there's also just a lot of patience for these things. There isn't like, \"We need to hit this quarterly goal. Why aren't we creating banks in Singapore yet?\"\n\nNilan Peiris (00:55:29):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:55:31):\nAwesome. The other kind of metaphor that's rolling around my head is something Seth Godin talks about. I don't know if you've heard of this guy, he's a marketing guru, and he has this concept that you want to build something that's remarkable, because if something is remarkable, it'll spread. And if you think about the word remarkable, it's something worth remarking about, which essentially is word of mouth.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:55:49):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:55:49):\nAnd so that's his kind of mission and his, I don't know, advice to people is build something remarkable, something people will want to remark about. And clearly, you all have been doing that. And that's actually a good segue to where I wanted to go, which is around how you structure your team, and how you incentivize the team, organize teams, to achieve all these sorts of things. So, maybe just broadly, is there something unique to how you think about work structure, incentives, goals, things like that, in order to achieve these really hard things?\n\nNilan Peiris (00:56:17):\nThere's two unique lenses on this. One is in the macro-structure and one is in the micro-structure. So at the macro level, if you look at actually international banks, they don't really exist. I'm not sure if you've moved around between countries, but say you open a bank account with Citibank in the US, and then you go to Citibank in the UK, your Citibank account doesn't exist in the UK. You have to go to Citibank in the UK, and open a Citibank account. And actually, turns out, with some of these banks, to move money between your bank accounts is an international transfer. It's crazy.\n\n(00:56:53):\nSo, when you take a step back, and look at how the market looks, you have at one end, international banks which are local tech stacks. So there's a core banking system in the US, and one in the UK, and one in Europe, say for Citibank, or for HSBC, but they have deep local integrations, so they're directly integrated in the payment system. Citibank in the US has got relationships, say, with the Federal Reserve, et cetera.\n\n(00:57:20):\nOther end of the spectrum you've got something like PayPal. So it's a tech company, it's got a single global tech stack. It doesn't run a additional version of PayPal in Australia than to the US, but it doesn't have deep connections. It hasn't got five central bank accounts, it hasn't got any of that. And I'd like to think of in the middle, you've got Wise, where we have a single global tech stack, and we have deep local infrastructure.\n\n(00:57:45):\nNow, from a technological perspective, just take a step back and think through this. This is actually non-trivial to figure out how to design. So, let's take something like the onboarding flow. So, we have global product teams, one part of product teams called global product teams. So we have a single onboarding flow that will give you a Wise account, and it's the same code that runs, whether you are in Brazil, New York, or Australia.\n\n(00:58:17):\nThe regulation in Australia and Brazil is really different, and it isn't black and white in any country. So, there's a bunch of... You get a bunch of things you just shouldn't do in terms of letting people get so [inaudible 00:58:31] people who shouldn't get access to accounts. And then you can need to check these people aren't using it, and different jurisdictions have completely different requirements. Example is Japan, you have to take a picture of that front of the ID, the back of the ID, and the side of your ID. It's the only country in the world that you have to do this.\n\nLenny (00:58:47):\nWow.\n\nNilan Peiris (00:58:48):\nAnd imagine you're the product manager for onboarding, and someone tells you, \"Design the onboarding flow to give somebody a bank...\" Just imagine gathering all the requirements from every country in the world, because there's very little similarity. You can't just say, \"I take the US,\" and copy it somewhere else. It's very, very, very different.\n\n(00:59:05):\nIt'd take forever to try to get that, and then normalize that into the main model, and try to figure out how you're going to structure the data around this. So, it then becomes like, what is the organization structure that enables us to discover what the domain model, let's call it that, for the onboarding flow should look like. And you end up with a global product team that owns overall KPIs around conversion rate, et cetera. And you have local, regional teams that own the conversion rate, and the cost to do KYC for their market, and they contribute to the global product code base.\n\n(00:59:44):\nSo we have weak product ownership, where anyone can make code change, and pull requests, and these guys owning the vision in the center. But the only way that vision can evolve is by getting the feedback from these guys in the market, as they're constantly pushing stuff forward. And through that process, artifacts start emerging, where other markets are like Japan, and so you start splitting off that, and creating subtypes for it, and slowly the model emerges from there.\n\n(01:00:09):\nAnd so with this structure, the thing to optimize for is a really hard one. That problem that every global business has, is how do you get this collaboration to work between the local and the global? But unlike every other business, most businesses solve this probably as you know, is you usually have the US, and then you have international. And international is usually a bump site, where everyone's arguing to get their thing prioritized, right?\n\nLenny (01:00:29):\nThat's right.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:00:30):\nWhereas here, you're kind of letting the local teams commit directly to the code base, and then this global team's got this challenge of doing this, and we over time create sub-teams around parts of the regionalization of the structure, around different objects as they emerge. But that broadly speaking is the first problem, the global problem. And the other bit with us is this is quite unique to us, because most fintechs out there are usually in one market. Like you take Robin Hood, it was in the US, it came to the UK, they went back to the US. You take Monzo, only the UK, N26 only in Europe, Up in Australia, China, and the US. And that's because their home markets are so big, and one regulator is a ton of work to manage. And the second complexity we have is we have all of these markets we have to be in, because we're international by default. So a lot of our thinking is where do we take that, turn that into competitive advantage, and which customer base really needs that? Which is what zooms us into that positioning on the international account.\n\nLenny (01:01:32):\nIt just comes back to again, and again, again and again, doing the hard thing, knocking peoples' socks off, and it feels like that's the formula for Wise.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:01:41):\nI think yeah, you more or less got it. So that's one bit on structure. So this global local thing, and the second one has been a bit more of a journey. So when we started early on, we ran in autonomous independent teams, all focused on KPIs, and these KPIs rolled up to make it cheaper, make it faster, make it easier to use. You can imagine like a KPI tree, and teams around bits of their KPIs, and every quarter they talk through how they move their KPI, et cetera, and this kind of worked. And the way we ran our planning is, every quarter every team would stand up and talk through its plan, get feedback from other teams, and then move on. This worked till we got to 30 teams, and then you go from doing this in the afternoon, to doing it in two days and it's just like whoa.\n\n(01:02:27):\nSo, we started heading towards the Spotify model, where we group the teams in squads, and into tribes. Today, I think that autonomy is at the squad level. So the squads are around products. So, we'll have a Wise account squad, a business squad, a Wise platform, our enterprise product squad, you'll have a North Am squad that looks after the North American product, and Lat Am squad, et cetera. And then financial crime fighting, et cetera.\n\n(01:02:57):\nAnd inside those squads you've got the teams, and the squad... Imagine you're the director for the Wise account, but you don't have a vision for the account. You've got to say where it's going. You've got to keep your teams on track against it. The teams aren't off doing whatever they want. They kind of need to be on track, versus the overall vision, and you're accountable for the results of that squad. And squads are in tribes, the tribe provides overall leadership, and a slight, light touch strategy on the squads. And that's more or less our structure, and how we've evolved towards it.\n\nLenny (01:03:26):\nIs there anything else along the word of mouth concept that you think would be useful for people to share? Either how you think about it, team structure, anything else?\n\nNilan Peiris (01:03:34):\nThere's one tiny bit I'll share, which was around marketing and referral. This was super interesting for me. So, we've been running it, like Airbnb, we've been running referral program for now 12 years, and after 12 years, you've kind of tested everything anyway. And like I said, by this point you have literally tested everything. So when somebody comes up with something that has a 300% increase, you're like, \"Whoa, that's super interesting. What just happened?\"\n\nLenny (01:04:03):\nWow, I'm excited for this.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:04:05):\nAnd yeah, I'll share this one, because it's interesting. So we run many variants of refer a friend, where you'll get different kinds of benefit. We tried chocolate, we tried money, we've tried $200, $500, $10, you get some, I get some money, all kinds of things. More or less headed towards three for $100, generally it's a sweet spot. Anyway, it's a pretty creative PM there. And he was again talking to customers, and he spotted this thing, which is pretty cool, which is when you do a transfer with Wise, at the end you get this email, the email says, \"Well done.\" Then it says, \"Your money's there in the other person's account, and you saved $10 on this transfer.\" And he got this insight, which was pretty awesome, was he realized that people believed they saved money, but they didn't believe the number. And he then thought, what would it take to get them to believe the number?\n\nLenny (01:05:05):\nThat seems right.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:05:07):\nAnd so the fun bit was the approach. So then him and a designer sat there and they sketched out an alternative email, and they went down to the coffee shop downstairs, and they showed it to people, and they said... Just asked them what they thought, and they kept iterating it until they got to a graph. And this graph is like this... When you go through a money transfer thing, it pops up in places, behind the compare button. And this graph shows with your bank, when you send, how much is in the rate hidden as... This is how much you're sending, this is how much they're taking in the rate in a fee, and this is how much you can see in the fee, because the fees are hidden in the rates with banks. And then this is with Wise.\n\n(01:05:45):\nAnd they iterate this graph to the point that people looked at like, \"Oh my God, I'm never using my bank again. This number... This is crazy.\" And then they put this graph on the success page when you did a transfer. Saying, \"You saved this.\" And put a share button in there, and invite your friends button, and that's what really drove it. And when you fast-forward to today, we've now got... So it's actually quite hard. So, we now have I think about 70 bank accounts around the world. So, I think the top three accounts, banks in the world, where we log onto every day, and then we log the price and the quote for a bunch of different routes into a file. You can imagine how hard is. I think I personally have about 17 of these still in my name, that I've opened up around the world to help the team get going. But that's kind of one of the biggest word of mouth growth, or referral insights. I've got to this comparison thing, made into our marketing, made into our homepage, just went everywhere up from that insight.\n\nLenny (01:06:46):\nAnd you said that that like 3x'd the sharing rate?\n\nNilan Peiris (01:06:50):\nYeah, that 3x'd the sharing rate. So we always had the share button after you completed a transfer. But putting that there with this graph, and that kind of got me to this, I'm curious on your take on this, on this definition of product marketing, where customers use the product, and they think they got this value, but when they actually know the value they get. So we got this on speed as well, where we're doing instant transfers, and customers wouldn't know it was instant.\n\n(01:07:21):\nSo when you get an instant transfer, there's like this wizzy animation at the end, and you kind of know the money's in the other person's account, ready to spend. And again, you see this big jump in referral rate when that happens, but people need to know it's happened. And closing this delta between what you've done, and what's perceived to be done is what I call product marketing within the product. And that in its own right is a discipline, I've learned.\n\nLenny (01:07:43):\nThat's an awesome insight. It comes back to this framework we talked about of reality and perception, in a flip way, instead of getting people to adopt something, it's to appreciate the work you've done to make it remarkable, to make them understand how remarkable it really is.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:07:56):\nYeah, that was it. And that's something I'm continuously learning about yeah, as we go, as well.\n\nLenny (01:08:01):\nThat is extremely interesting. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, I know you also do a bunch of charity work, and I wanted to give you a chance to share what you're doing there.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:08:12):\nThanks, Lenny. So, less charity, essentially came out of angel investing, is probably the way to say it. So I invest in startups, generally fintechs, mission led founders, word of mouth type stuff, all the stuff we've been talking about, that I'm passionate about. It is less investing, more helping, and yeah, just getting through the angel route. And then over time, I realized the thing I'm most passionate about is market failures. So generally I find that the invisible hand means most human needs get fulfilled by the market, but there are a few things that don't, and there's a couple of exciting startups out there who work really hard in this space. A couple are Beam in the UK, working on homelessness, Affinity and Neobank in Ghana. And so, this type of thing is stuff I'm most passionate about. So, if any of your listeners out there know anyone doing anything of that kind, trying to solve these kinds of hard problems, definitely reach out, always keen to talk.\n\nLenny (01:09:14):\nAwesome. And we'll link to those two you mentioned in the show notes just in case people want to check them out. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nNilan Peiris (01:09:22):\nLet's go for it.\n\nLenny (01:09:23):\nLet's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nNilan Peiris (01:09:29):\nTwo, one's at the other ends of the spectrum. So one is... This sounds terribly pretentious Crime and Punishment, and the other one is Midnight's Children by Salman Rushdie. I read a lot, I'm very passionate about reading, fiction, mainly. I don't read... Nonfiction is too much like work. And so, I generally need to read before I go to bed to decompress my brain. It's generally escapist type stuff. But I'm curious what you think of this, but for me authors are people that create people with words.\n\n(01:10:03):\nLike you say artist is a good artists if it's... Makes a good likeness to somebody, but imagine that you create somebody with words, and that person feels real, so they have some insight into the human condition. And what's amazing is if you learn something about what it means to be human from reading that. So at that end of the scale, Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment, where this guy kills somebody, and it just eats him up. It's a pretty amazing book. It's not as heavy as it sounds, but books like that are pretty awesome. So, I recommend that a lot.\n\n(01:10:37):\nAnd the other end of the scale is sometimes you read a book and there's a single sentence where each word has been just stitched together, and it's like, again, a work of art, and there, Rushdie is probably the pinnacle for me, of Midnight's Children, which is about partition in India, which is pretty... Through a metaphor, it's pretty amazing.\n\nLenny (01:10:57):\nIt's a beautiful answer. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nNilan Peiris (01:11:02):\nOh gosh, I am not... I don't love [inaudible 01:11:05] got TV, but we had rented Barbie for the kids. That one, probably the last movie.\n\nLenny (01:11:12):\nI just watched that too. So good.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:11:13):\nGood.\n\nLenny (01:11:15):\nYou can actually stream it now. I don't know when this comes out, but it just-\n\nNilan Peiris (01:11:17):\nOh wow.\n\nLenny (01:11:18):\nYeah, you can watch it at home. But it's not cheap. I think it's like 20 bucks in the US.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:11:23):\nOh geez.\n\nLenny (01:11:24):\nWhat is a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them?\n\nNilan Peiris (01:11:28):\nYeah, so I only ask two. I got down to asking just two questions over time. The first one's probably my favorite, which is, what is it that most frustrates you about... Instead of why you're leaving, what frustrates you the most about where you're working right now? And this is as people always tell you why they want to join Wise, or join whatever company you're coming to, and that's not that interesting. But what's interesting, trying to figure out, is what they're running away from. And usually there's something broken there, that's really wound them up. But what's more interesting is they've been unable to fix it. And so, in asking this question, and probing, you kind of get quite good at getting a sense of what is their limit, what's the thing they found, and what did they get stuck with? And you kind of think, \"Okay, you're going to run into that here every day, every week? Or... You should be fine.\" And that's kind of why I ask that question.\n\nLenny (01:12:24):\nI love that. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nNilan Peiris (01:12:29):\nI recently switched to Arc Browser.\n\nLenny (01:12:29):\nThat's what I use.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:12:35):\nAnd yeah, the onboarding flow was mind-blowingly good.\n\nLenny (01:12:37):\nThat's exactly how I felt. I had to tweet about it. It's like, [inaudible 01:12:41].\n\nNilan Peiris (01:12:40):\nYeah, I sent it to my onboarding team, and everyone. And what I loved about it is, it's clearly like if you could try to use Arc with the same way you use Chrome, you just get really frustrated. But if you use it the way they want you to use, it'd be amazing. So, for figuring out how to get people to engage with, you need to use this fundamentally differently. They manage to almost get me to use it the right way. Still struggling a little bit with it, but that I thought was really clever.\n\nLenny (01:13:12):\nAwesome choice. We had Josh, the CEO of the Browser Company of New York, it's called, on the podcast. And if you're interested in learning about Arc's story, definitely check out that episode. All right, next question. What is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat most to yourself, that you like to share? Anything come to mind?\n\nNilan Peiris (01:13:30):\nThe thing that defines success is the speed at which you pick yourself up.\n\nLenny (01:13:37):\nI love that.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:13:37):\nAnd that's the thing that I hold onto most, because you get knocked a lot, high growth company, and it's obviously quite... Obviously knocks you, when someone says no to an offer, when somebody leaves the company, when a product doesn't work as you think it should, when you get pushback from a partner. But yeah, if you lose four hours spinning around it, or you trying and figure out, \"Okay, this happened, how do I move forward?\" And just learning how to shorten that time has probably been one of the most important journeys for me.\n\nLenny (01:14:11):\nThat was an awesome answer. One final question, is there a fun cultural ritual at Wise that has stuck around for a while?\n\nNilan Peiris (01:14:20):\nThis one, my team would love to say. So, from the early days, we got everyone together from all around the world once a year. Oh, I actually did it twice a year. And the founders are from Estonia, and we have 5,000 people now, so we still have about 1,800 in Estonia. So it's cheaper to flavor on Estonia. So in the old days when it was winter, winter in Estonia is not fun, but summer in Estonia is amazing, and we still do this. And the funnest bit about this is, I have a side hustle, DJ, so I get to DJ there, and it's quite fun, and embarrassing for my kids because technically I've now DJ'd in other countries.\n\nLenny (01:15:03):\nInternational DJ.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:15:05):\nThat's it. That's my side hustle.\n\nLenny (01:15:07):\nAmazing.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:15:08):\nThat's how I introduced myself to my 17-year old's friends. So, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:15:12):\nDo you have a DJ name? Is there... Can we check you out on Spotify?\n\nNilan Peiris (01:15:15):\nNo, no, you can't check me on Spotify or anything, but yeah, it's all private. [inaudible 01:15:19].\n\nLenny (01:15:19):\nAll right. Maybe Burning Man, you could see your performance next year.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:15:23):\nMaybe.\n\nLenny (01:15:24):\nNilan, thank you so much for being here. We talked a lot about word of mouth. I feel like this episode is going to spread 100% through word of mouth. Can't wait for people to listen to it. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nNilan Peiris (01:15:37):\nYou can find me online on Twitter, nilanp, and always love to hear product feedback by email, by tweet, by LinkedIn. Generally by tweet is best, easiest for me to pick up, and my team to reach into directly. So, hit me up that way. And most useful for me, yeah, product feedback, and as I said, other people working on hard problems that need help, do reach out.\n\nLenny (01:16:03):\nAmazing. Nilan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nNilan Peiris (01:16:06):\nThank you for your time. Take care, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:16:08):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
