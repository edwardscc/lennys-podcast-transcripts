This is just how it is.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:15):\nNot only is, but how it was and how it will be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):\nThe Seven Rules of Power, get out of your own way, break the rules, show up in a powerful fashion, create a powerful brand, network relentlessly, use your power, and understand that once you've acquired power, what you did to get there will be forgiven, forgotten, or both.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:32):\nThis is not about personality. These are skills they can be mastered.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):\nPeople might be hearing this and they're like, \"I don't want to be this person.\"\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:38):\nWell, you already have done a fabulous job of illustrating principle one. That is one way to get in our own way. If I think power is dirty, the first thing that's going to happen is I'm not going to do what I need to do to be successful in my career.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):\nThe opening quote to your book that I have here, if you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:58):\nThat's exactly right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):\nToday, my guest is Jeffrey Pfeffer. Jeffrey is a Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford's graduate School of Business, and teaches one of the two most popular and oversubscribed courses in all of the MBA program, called the Paths to Power. The other class, by the way, is Touchy-Feely, which we dove into last month. In his class and in his recent book, the Seven Rules of Power, Jeffrey teaches the things that you can do in your life and in your work to build your power, and through that get things done and advance in your career. As one student described the class, it's the cod liver oil of the Graduate School of Business. You know it's good for you, but you feel a little nervous about it. In our conversation, we dig into each of the seven powers, why it's important to build these skills even if you feel uncomfortable.\n\n(00:01:48):\nWe talk through a bunch of examples of the power in action and the impact it has had on people's lives, why it isn't as cringey or scary as you may think. I was actually nervous to have this conversation and I ended up being a huge fan of Jeffrey and the work that he does. We end the conversation with what you can start doing today to start building your own power. This podcast is basically for anyone that wants to advance in their career, whether you're an IC or a CEO, and I'm really excited to bring it to you.

It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jeffrey Pfeffer. Jeffrey, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:02:36):\nThank you, Lenny. I am honored that you invited me on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:40):\nI'm even more honored that you decided to come on. We're going to be talking about something that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. I think it's going to make me uncomfortable. We're going to be talking about how to grow your power in life and in business. Let me just start by asking why does this stuff make people uncomfortable, and why is it still important for people to learn how to do this well?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:03:02):\nWell, it's important because a guy named Gerald Ferris developed a scale of political skill. And he and a bunch of his colleagues over the years did a lot of empirical research that demonstrates that political skill is associated with a lot of positive outcomes, salary, getting promoted, being happy in your career, being happy in your job, being less stressed. So the reason why you should pay attention to this is because it leads to a lot of good things. The reason why it makes people uncomfortable. You said it made you uncomfortable. Maybe I should ask you the question, why does it make you uncomfortable?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:44):\nThere's a lot of things here that are probably not how people want to live their life necessarily, or want other people to act.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:03:51):\nYeah, so I think it makes people uncomfortable because the realities of what it takes to get power bear almost no resemblance to what you're taught in Sunday school or the mosque or wherever, how your parents raised you. They bear almost no resemblance to how we think the world ought to be. They bear a little resemblance to our aspirations. And I think we look around the world and we see people who have acquired enormous amounts of power and have used it for bad. But I tell people, I see people with hammers hitting other people on the head. That does not mean that a hammer is not a useful tool. You can take a screwdriver and stab it into somebody's belly. I have a very dear friend who we'll probably talk about later in the podcast. Laura Esserman is a breast cancer surgeon, and I tell people, Laura has a knife. She uses it to cure cancer. Muggers have knives. They use it to rob people. So I think we've confused the tool for how it has been used.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:56):\nYou also have this quote that the people who need to understand power and build their power skills are people who come from backgrounds or characteristics who would normally put them at a disadvantage.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:05:04):\nI think that's exactly right. I will go this Sunday to Nashville Tennessee to talk to a bunch of people of color in the NFL who are trying to rise up the ranks. Stanford runs a program because the NFL is serious, I think, about trying to make more opportunity for people, underrepresented minorities. But these are folks who will not succeed unless they learn power skills, because the world is stacked against them in lots of ways.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):\nThis episode is brought to you by Uizard, empowering product leaders to ideate and iterate faster than ever before with the power of AI.

We all know that your website shouldn't be a static asset. It should be a dynamic part of your strategy that drives conversions. That's Business 101. But here's a number for you. 54% of leaders say web updates take too long. That's over half of you listening right now. That's where Webflow comes in. Their visual first platform allows you to build, launch, and optimize web pages fast. That means you can set ambitious business goals and your site can rise to the challenge. Learn how teams like Dropbox, IDEO and Orange Theory trust Webflow to achieve their most ambitious goals today at Webflow.com.\n\n(00:07:51):\nAnother element of your course that you try to make clear in your syllabus is to teach people not to be as judgmental. You also have this whole huge bold phrase, \"This class is not for everyone.\" Can you just talk a bit about maybe why it's not for everyone and then why being less judgmental is important?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:08:07):\nThe class is extremely popular. I have a long waiting list. It's kind of mythical. And because of the principle of social influence, we are influenced by what other people do. We're influenced in our choices of restaurants, we're influenced in our choices of music. I'm not sure I like Taylor Swift, but I certainly want to go see Taylor Swift because everybody else is. And many people sign up for the class. And one year in particular, there were some people who sat in about the third row up, directly in front of me, and they looked every day like they were having some terrible thing put up some horrible orifice or something. They looked literally in pain, and so I decided, and of course they learned nothing. If you come to the class and you're in that much psychological discomfort, you're not going to learn anything.\n\n(00:08:55):\nAnd so what I try to do is tell people that in order to benefit from this class, you have to be open to learning the material. And if you're not, and by the way, this would be true for any class. If you go to physics and you say, I don't like physics, I hate physics, I don't believe in physics, I don't believe in the theory of physics, whatever, you're not going to learn anything. And so I'm trying to get the class, given those huge waiting lists, I'm trying to get the class to have people in it who are in fact going to benefit from it rather than sit there and look like they're in pain. And the judgmental thing, if Matthew 7, \"Judge not that ye be not judged.\" The Koran says, \"Only Allah can judge people.\" The American poet, Walt Whitman said, \"Be curious, not judgmental.\"\n\n(00:09:46):\nMother Teresa said, \"If you judge people, you have no time to love them.\" Judgment, if I need to build a positive relationship with Lenny because you are on my critical path in my job, and jobs necessarily entail a reasonable amount of interdependence, I get things done through and with other people. If I decide that Lenny is whatever set of bad adjectives you want to use, dumb, incompetent, immoral, whatever, my ability to build a positive relationship with you, and you remain on my critical path, becomes almost zero unless you're a better actor or I'm a better actor than I think most people are.\n\n(00:10:32):\nSo therefore, you should suspend judgment in the sense that if somebody is on your critical path, the only judgment you should make is they're on my critical path. If I want to get something done, I need their collaboration and cooperation, and the fact that I may not like them is in fact irrelevant. And as I have taught senior executives over the years, it is absolutely clear to me that one of the skills that they have mastered is they have a skill that you cannot tell what they think of you. And that's important because I need your collaboration, I need your cooperation. And if I leak out in ways that say I don't respect you or I don't like you, I don't admire you, whatever, my odds of getting you to work productively with me goes essentially to zero. So that's a judgmental story. Does that make sense?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:21):\nAbsolutely. And I have a quote from your syllabus along these lines, \"Not everyone we encounter in Paths to Power is someone you're going to want to emulate. This is a class about how to get things done, how to build and wield influence, and there are multiple ways to accomplish these objectives.\" So I've had two friends actually go through the course. One I asked about the course of the impact it had on her. She's actually a founder now. And she told me that your class was her single most favorite class at all of Stanford Business School, because it was realistic and applicable to life as a founder. Because it didn't sugarcoat business, didn't sugarcoat life. It told her how the world really works and it is helping her succeed with her startup right now.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:12:00):\nThank you. There's no higher praise than that. I actually don't read, I shouldn't probably say this on the public, but I don't actually read my course evaluations because the impact I want to have is not to have people like me, but to have that kind of impact. To make people more successful, more effective in their lives.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):\nThat is a good segue to one of your rules of power. So let's just talk about your Seven Rules of Power. I actually have your book right here and if folks want to learn more, here it is, Seven Rules of Power. This is your fourth book about power, and this is your best book about power, because it basically summarizes everything you've learned in a really cohesive way. So let me first share the Seven Rules of Power and then I'm going to dive into a few of them. Does that sound good?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:12:44):\nThat sounds perfect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:45):\nOkay, so the seven rules, one, get out of your own way. Two, break the rules. Three, appear powerful. Four, build a powerful brand. Network relentlessly. Use your power, and success excuses almost...\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:13:01):\nEverything, correct.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:02):\nOkay, success excuses everything almost. Got it. Okay. So let me start with power four, which is around personal brand. And the reason I want to start here is I have a friend that's actually in your class right now, Ralph, and I saw that he started a podcast. And he told me that he did it because it was part of the homework that you give students. You call it Doing Power. Is that the name of the homework assignments?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:13:25):\nYeah, I have. So we give them a bunch of assignments throughout the class, which are self-reflective assignments, but their big thing for the class is they have to do power. They have to do something during the quarter to take the principles of the class, and what they're learning, and put them into practice. And that is because everything I do, I do for a reason. That is because if you don't use what you learn, the learning will disappear. So if you go to a French class and you learn French, and you never speak French, in about a relatively short period of time you'll forget everything you learn. And so I want the learning to stick with them, so I try to get them to do something with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:06):\nWhile we're on this tangent, I wanted to talk about this whole, you have a book, the Doing Knowing Gap.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:14:10):\nKnowing-Doing Gap.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):\nThe Knowing-Doing Gap. So let's just spend a little time there. I think that's really important. What are some examples of things that have come out of people doing these homework assignments, things that maybe led to something interesting?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:14:22):\nLet me take my most extreme example. My most extreme example is probably Derek Kan, K-A-N. And Derek Kan was a little bit older when he went through the MBA program. And in 2012, his Doing Power project was to get appointed to be Mitt Romney's, it was Mitt Romney was running for president, to be head of economic policy for the Romney campaign. Believe it or not, he was offered the job. Believe it or not, he turned it down for reasons which we could go into if you want, but aren't that interesting. He wound up relatively soon thereafter as number three in the transportation department, working for Elaine Chao. And I have a picture of him when he comes to the class, I introduce him. I tell students, I give them a trigger warning and I introduce him. He wound up, at the end of the Trump administration, as the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. And since typical of the Trump administration, by that time there was no director. He essentially ran the $6 trillion US budget. This is six years out of business school.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):\nI was thinking whether he got that during his class. Amazing. Okay, so this is a success story of Doing Power. Let's talk about this first power of building brand, and I think this is where people start to feel uncomfortable. They're going to be like, oh no, I don't want to be doing this. This doesn't feel good to me.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:51):\nWhy?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:52):\nSo let's talk about it.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:53):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:54):\nLet's see. So talk about this power of building a personal brand.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:58):\nThere are by definition fewer positions at the top than at the bottom. The world, we might not like this, and I know people, the late Tony Hsieh, the Zappos tried to do holacracy or whatever, but the world is essentially hierarchical. The animal kingdom is hierarchical. It is better to be at the top than at the bottom for a number of reasons. Okay. If that is true, if there are fewer positions at the top and then at the bottom, then your job to advance your career is to figure out how to get promoted. There are many ways to get promoted, but I will guarantee you one thing, no one is going to promote Lenny if they don't know who the hell you are. So it is not sufficient for them to know who you are. They have to know that you're smart and personable and have whatever skills you've got, but they have to know you.\n\n(00:16:52):\nIf they don't know you, you cannot choose what is not in your head. You know that better than I do. So therefore you have to do something to differentiate yourself. You have to build a brand. So when I think of Lenny in your podcast, I think of something. Not just 25 billion podcasts. When I think of somebody in McKinsey or Bay or BCG, one of the consulting firms, a gazillion people start off as front-line consultants. What are you going to do so that somebody knows who you are? What are you going to do that creates value for the firm and for you? So my friend Keith Ferazzi, when he started at Deloitte Consulting, did not do the spreadsheet stuff that he was, by the way, not very good at and didn't like. He started the Lincoln Quality Award. He decided to try to take Deloitte's brand recognition from about one or 2% to 30%.\n\n(00:17:54):\nHe was appointed, though he left before he actually took the job, to the position of partner and the first chief marketing officer at Deloitte. I have another friend, Tristan Walker, who wanted to get hired at Foursquare. He sent emails to the founder. The founder ignored him. So Tristan Walker did something I think very bold. Tristan Walker began signing up partnerships. So one day the founder says, holy God, he signed up Starbucks. Maybe I ought to hire this guy. So you have to do something that causes people to know who you are, and that is what building a brand is about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:36):\nIt sounds very benign put that way. When people hear, I need to build a personal brand, it sounds like I need to post on LinkedIn, I need to post on Twitter, start a newsletter, start a podcast, which I know is kind of a part of it. But what are some examples you've seen of ways to build a personal brand that are effective?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:18:50):\nSo I have a friend who I bring to the class, a lovely tall Asian woman named Laura Chau, who made partner at a venture capital firm after four years, which is fast. Laura works for Canaan Partners, C-A-N-A-A-N. Laura said, I do not work for Andreessen Horowitz, I do not work for Sequoia, I don't work for Greylock, I don't work for any of these very visible large VC firms. So if I am going to get deals in the consumer space, that's her domain of expertise is consumer and consumer tech, somebody is going to have to know who Laura Chau is. Because again, you're not going to get the deal if nobody knows who you are. And so she basically did everything you talked about. She did writing. She started a podcast in which she invited influential people on. She contributed to a book. She helped people out.\n\n(00:19:55):\nShe did networking dinners. She did everything she could so that people would recognize and know Laura Chau. And one of the things she did was she's tall. In general, Asian women are not tall. She decided to play up the fact that she was, in the words of some people, the tallest Asian woman they'd ever seen. She wears heels. In her heels she's six feet one inches tall. She also, when she comes to my class, many people come to my class with hoodies, God knows what. She has style and it's a unique style. So she thinks about very strategically, how am I going to dress? How am I going to look? How am I going to show up? How am I going to do what I need to do so that people know who I am? Obviously there's substance. If you have visibility without substance, people will know you're useless. But if you have substance without visibility, no one will know the substance that you got.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:56):\nYou also talk about how you can reframe this idea of not being self-promotional, but it's amplifying the impact of the team that I work with, or it's me scaling myself by sharing things I know and pointing people to it.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:21:11):\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:11):\nAwesome. Okay, let's move on to a different power. Let's talk about power one, which is getting out of your own way. Talk about what that means and how someone can work on that.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:21:20):\nWell, you already have done a fabulous job of illustrating principle one by talking about how this is the topic that makes people uncomfortable. And when something makes people uncomfortable, in general, they're going to shy away from it. So if I think power is dirty, if I think power is evil, if I think power is something I want nothing to do with, the first thing that's going to happen is I'm not going to do what I need to do to be successful in my career. So that is one way in which we get in our own way. Another way in which we get in our own way, many people suffer from what is called in the psychology literature, imposter syndrome. They believe that they were the admissions mistake at Stanford. They were the hiring mistake in whatever company they're working for. That somehow they got to this job, but they don't really deserve to be there because they're surrounded by people who are smarter and better than them, and therefore they will do things.\n\n(00:22:18):\nI can't even believe that this goes on. So I will have students, not many, but a few. Now raise their hand, I'll call them, and the first things out of their mouth will be, I don't know if this comment is going to be useful. This is called pre-emptory apology. If the comment is not going to be useful, don't say it. That's number one, but number two, don't apologize. Pardon me for interrupting. Pardon me for taking up your time. Stop all this apologizing. If you got the job you're in, you probably are not only qualified, you're probably overqualified. So don't use descriptors of yourself that disempower you. Don't think of yourself as not deserving of the job that you hold, because that attitude will leak out and other people will say, if Lenny doesn't think he deserved the job, then maybe I shouldn't think he deserves the job either.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:19):\nSo basically the first power is you're shooting yourself in the foot by worrying too much about whether people like you. This friend of mine who's now the founder that I read some quotes from, she said her number one takeaway from your class is if you want to be liked, get a dog.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:23:32):\nThat's correct. That is a quote from my dear friend Gary Loveman, who for many years ran Harrah's, which then became Caesars, the casino company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):\nYou also talk about this. Yeah, there's this quote I have. \"Acknowledge that others are often no better than you, because that makes you feel better about the story.\" So for people that actually want to be liked, I like being liked. I don't know if it's a flaw in my upbringing. Is the lesson you're capped on your power if you worry about if you want to be liked?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:24:05):\nAt the end of the day, you don't want to be intentionally disliked. You don't want to violate my dear friend Bob Sutton's book The No Asshole Rule and gratuitously be an asshole. But you are hired to get a job done. It's interesting. I unfortunately am now too old. In the words of my chiropractor, I'm suffering from too many birthdays. So I have a lot of doctors who are doing a great job. Trust me, when I choose a doctor, I have a, unfortunately he retired, a neurosurgeon who did two surgeries on my spine. He's considered to be one of the top 20 in the country. If you go on Yelp, you read about his personality and his office furniture. As I said to somebody, he's doing microsurgery on my spine, I can wind up permanently paralyzed. I really don't care about his personality. I don't care about his office furniture.\n\n(00:25:01):\nThat's an extreme example, but it makes the point. When you are put in a role, you are put in a role because presumably you are supposed to perform in that role. If you get appointed to be a head coach, if we make you a quarterback on an NFL team, or we make you center on a National Basketball Association team, you did not get that job because people thought you had a cute personality. You got that job because you have the skills to make your organization successful. And if you do not use those skills because you're worried about what everybody else is thinking, you are not only harming yourself, but you're harming them because you are not doing what you were hired to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:46):\nSo a simple way of thinking about this, which makes me feel better about. As we talk through this, I'm becoming less uncomfortable with these, which is a good sign. It's don't actively try to be disliked. Don't prioritize being liked, prioritize competence and respect.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:25:59):\nCorrect, absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):\nAnd doing the thing that needs to be done.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:26:03):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:04):\nOkay, great. Let's talk about rule number two, which is break the rules. So basically again, these powers are ways to grow power, and you're saying that if you break the rules, you get more power. Talk about why that's the case, what that looks like.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:26:18):\nWell, for many reasons, number one, when you break the rules, you stand out. You become memorable when you do something that's unexpected. And being memorable is of course important, as we've already discussed. That's number one. Number two, the rules were made mostly by the people who are favored by the rules in place. So if we were talking about business strategy, we would talk about a word that is probably now overused. We would talk about being a disruptor. That you would disrupt an industry. And how do you disrupt an industry? By doing something that is different from the other industry incumbents. In Southwest Airlines, you don't do hub and spoke. At Amazon, you provide an incredible level of customer service. Whole Foods, you don't optimize on the cost of the stuff in your store, but you optimize on fitting local taste, whatever. You would be a disruptor, you would do things that are different.\n\n(00:27:14):\nThe same principle holds for you, that if you are going to be successful, you have to do what number one, plays to your strengths, to use the title of a Gallup book. Number two, you have to do things again that cause you to stand out, and you have to do things that basically will make you more successful. One of the conventional wisdoms that people I think adhere to way too much, is don't ask. Don't ask, don't ask for help. You need to show self-sufficiency. So my colleague, Frances Flynn, Frank Flynn, wrote an article with Vanessa Lake entitled, If You Need Help, Just Ask. And it turns out people overestimate how many people they're going to have to ask to get help, and it turns out that asking for help makes people uncomfortable.\n\n(00:28:03):\nI was married, if you read the acknowledgments in Seven Rules of Power. For more than 35 years I was married to Kathleen Francis Fowler, who I could send you a picture. She looked literally like a supermodel and I never have been any particularly better looking than I am now. So somebody said to me, how'd you get her to go out with you? And the answer of course is, I asked. I asked, I asked, I asked. No one, well, maybe not no one. But few people are going to go out with you if you don't ask them out. Few people are going to marry you if you don't ask them to marry. Few people are going to do anything if you don't ask. And what is the worst that could happen? If you ask and they say, no, you are no worse off than had you not asked in the first place. If you don't ask, you're not going to get it. If you ask and they say, no, you're not going to get it. Get over your ego, ask.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:59):\nIs there another example that comes to mind of someone breaking the rules say in business, that ended up being really successful as a result, or just someone that is really good at this in business?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:07):\nI can give you many examples. One of my favorite examples would be Jason Calacanis. I don't know if you know Jason.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):\nOh yeah, I know you did a case study on him. I know him well. Yeah.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:18):\nSo I think Jason, I think consistently breaks all kinds of rules. First of all, when he comes to my class, nobody likes him, but that's okay. Almost nobody likes him. But...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:30):\nThat's power number one. He's not worried about.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:33):\nYeah, that's number one. But also I think there's a conventional wisdom in the venture capital industry which he defies almost completely. He makes a lot of little bets, not a few big bets. He runs a very lean operation. He doesn't have a lot of partners. He doesn't have actually any partners, so he can't be fired by his partners. He began his career in journalism, which is interesting. Being a journalist is a wonderful job because you get to ask people all kinds of questions. And if you ask smart people questions, and you have some reasonable level of intelligence yourself, at the end of that process, you're going to wind up incredibly smart and incredibly insightful. And he wound up incredibly smart and insightful around aspects of the internet industry.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:23):\nAnd he definitely has a lot of power. I think I am going to link to the case study in our show notes where you basically walk through how he went from nothing to a very powerful person.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:30:31):\nAnd by the way, a very rich person as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:34):\nLet's talk about another power, power five, networking relentlessly. What does that look like and how do you get better at this?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:30:42):\nWell, I think there's research that shows that many people find networking dirty, and that's because I think they think about it in the wrong way. My friend John Levy, who has written a fabulous book, You're Invited. Which is a book about how to put on events that people want to come to. Is a fabulous human being. Will tell you that the first principle of networking is in fact generosity. It's generosity. What can I do for you? How can I be helpful? Who can I introduce you to? Either a company or a product or a person who can be helpful to you in your career.\n\n(00:31:20):\nBut in order to be able to introduce you to someone who's going to be useful to you, I have to know people. If I don't know anybody, I can't introduce you to anybody. And the more people I know, the more likely it will be that if you say, I need to know somebody in X, I will know that person. So the broader your social network, the more people and the more things you will know. If knowledge is power, networking is a fabulous way to get knowledge about people and about ideas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):\nIt's funny to hear this where it's like, yes, obviously this is right, but connecting it to if you want to become more powerful, more successful, you need to do this. I think that is a powerful point that we're all making here, is just like this actually is necessary if you want to acquire more power.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:32:10):\nOf course. I have a funny story about networking. So we have a thing in Stanford called View From The Top, in which these fancy people come in and give a talk. And one of the people came in and give a talk and made my class instantly popular, because he's an extraordinarily wealthy person. His name is Omid Kordestani, and so I reached out to him and I said, \"Omid, let's have breakfast.\" So I can understand because during the thing, when somebody asked them what class was the most important in his success, he said mine. So I said, \"Tell me your story.\" He said, \"Well, I graduated from Stanford. I'm Persian in background, immigrant background. An engineer, HP, all the things that would make you kind of a nerd or something.\" He said, \"I went to work for a couple of startups that didn't do well. Then I found myself in the mid-nineties at Netscape.\" The browser company, big deal. Anyway, Marc Andreessen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:07):\nOh yeah.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:33:08):\nOkay. \"So I found myself in Netscape in marketing and business development. I was not making any progress. One day I decided to take your class to an extreme. I decided to stop doing my job.\" So I said, \"When people gave you projects to do or assignments or tasks and you didn't do them?\" He said, \"It turns out that I spent my time, not obviously at the bar, but in networking first with people inside of Netscape. And it turns out if you're well-connected to the senior leaders, they don't really care if you do your job or not. That's number one. Number two,\" he said, \"oftentimes I can find other people to do the work I was doing. So instead of basically spending time doing my job, I networked first within Netscape.\" But Netscape was not that big of a company. So after a while he decided to go through, which is by the way, his job anyway, in marketing and business, he decided to basically drive through the Silicon Valley talking to people. And this is the rest of the browsers are just beginning.\n\n(00:34:14):\nNobody knows what a browser is, nobody knows what the internet is going to become. So he's having all these fabulous conversations. All right, so he now knows basically everybody. It's 1998 and a little tiny company decides 10 engineers, typical Silicon Valley company. 10 engineers, all engineers. I have a friend who went to work for a company, run a company that had 26 people. He didn't have one sales and marketing person. Anyway, the company now has 10 engineers. They decide they need to hire their first business person. Being an analytically oriented company, they say, we're going to do this very analytically. We are basically going to ask everybody we can think of, and a few people we can't. Give us a list of the best technically oriented business people that you know. And there is of course one name that appears on every list. It is Omid Kordestani who becomes employee number 11 at Google and makes two and a half billion dollars.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:13):\nGreat success from networking. Well done. When people hear about networking, it just feels like you said, very cringe. I don't want to go to these networking events and try to pretend to talk and care about people. Do you have any advice for just how to make networking feel less cringy?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:35:28):\nOne of the exercises I give my students is I say, write a list of 10 people who, if you knew them and if they knew you, would be important for whatever you're trying to accomplish in your career. So maybe you're trying to get into biotech, you need to know 10 executives in biotech or whatever. Make a list of 10 people. Then for each person figure out how you are going to meet them. By the way, not necessarily in a network event. Maybe you want to do what John Levy does, which is hold dinners. In which by the way, the guests do the cooking, which is a very interesting idea. That of course taps into the IKEA effect. You always like something better if you participate in creating it. Maybe you want to hold dinners, maybe you want to try to reach out to them at lunch.\n\n(00:36:21):\nMaybe you want to reach out to them and say, here's an article I think you'd be interested in. Here is somebody who I think you'd benefit from meeting. So recently, I'm not a particularly good networker, though I'm better I guess than some people. I recently met Esther Wojcicki, I'm sure I killed her name. She's considered the grandmother of Silicon Valley. She's Susan Wojcicki's mother. And she is interested in depression, particularly depression among teenagers. And I said, you should know Leanne Williams, who's in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Science Department, who has done probably 300 articles on depression and has invented something which is called Precision Psychiatry. So I connected them to each other. Just send an email. I think you ought to know each other. They got together. I get credit for knowing people and connecting them, but I also benefit them. Leanne needs to raise money. Esther's got money. Esther needs to understand the cutting edge research in depression and biomarkers of depression, which is what Leanne's specialty is, so they benefit. So this is not some icky thing. This is connecting people who benefit from being connected.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:38):\nThat touches on something you teach in the book is, in your networking you want to become a broker, you want to be central. That's kind of what you want to work on. Can you talk a bit about what that means?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:37:47):\nWell, that means you want to connect people. So many people with benefits, and many groups with benefits for being connected, and they're not connected. What does a venture capitalist do? Connects people with ideas to people with money, and takes a fee for doing it. What does an investment banker do? Connects people trying to sell businesses or raise capital with people trying to buy businesses or who have capital. What's a real estate agent do? Connects buyers and sellers of houses. There are all kinds of examples where the person's entire job is connecting people. But even for the people whose job it isn't, you benefit from knowing people. The more people you know, the more things you know. As I sometimes say in my class, if leadership management, call it what you will, is getting things done through other people, it seems like common sense that the more other people you know, the more you'll be able to get done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:45):\nAs someone that has become central to a lot of things in the product world, and has built a large network as a result of this podcast newsletter, I can tell you a thousand percent. This creates a lot of opportunity and power, you could say in quotes. So I've seen it happen.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:39:00):\nOf course.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:03):\nThis episode is brought to you by Heap, the product analytics solution that shows you everything users do on your digital product, website, mobile product or other digital services.

That's H-E-A-P dot I-O slash Lenny.\n\n(00:40:10):\nAnother lesson I guess you teach is to pursue weak ties. Talk a bit about what that means. What do you mean by that?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:40:14):\nWell, the people to whom you are strongly tied, your family, your spouse, significant other, your friends, the people who work with you at work will probably, because they are close to you, know the same things and the same people that you do. So to the extent that you build ties with people who are more different from you in every dimension, you are more likely to learn non-redundant information, and come in contact with people that you don't already know. This again seems common sense. There's a lot of research behind it. Mark Granovetter, a sociologist who still teaches at Stanford, wrote a book entitled The Strength of Weak Ties.\n\n(00:40:59):\nAnd basically, no, actually, pardon me. He wrote an article called The Strength of Weak Ties. His book was called Getting a Job. And he did a study, I guess it was at that time in Boston. He did a study of job seekers in Massachusetts, and he looked at people who got jobs through applying to ads, through more formal means. And then he looked at people who got jobs through referrals from their network. And it turns out, of course, the jobs that you get through your network referrals are much better jobs. And oftentimes the best jobs that people got were referred to them by people that were not particularly close to them. Because they had a view, that's the word I was looking for, a view into the ecosystem of the Boston labor market, that the other people didn't have because they weren't in the same place as the other people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):\nI love that lesson. Let's talk about another power, which is using your power. So when people think of using your power builds more power, that's not intuitive. You talk about how it creates this self-perpetuating growth of power the more you practice power. Can you talk a bit about that?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:42:16):\nSure. So when you are given, it's interesting, my friend Deborah Gruenfeld, who wrote a book called Acting with Power, talks a lot about people's ambivalence to power. So sometimes people are put in a job. Herminia Ibarra who teaches now at London Business School, at one point taught in Seattle, at one point taught at Harvard, has an article in the Harvard Business Review in which she talks about a woman in a drug company who gets a promotion, and says to her colleagues, to whom she's now overseeing, that she's not sure why she got the job. She's not sure she deserves the job. Needless to say, she didn't do very well in this job because she got in her own way. But part of this is you are put in a position of power. You're put in a position of authority in order to make things happen. So to the extent you mobilize your resources and get things to happen, you'll get more resources.\n\n(00:43:14):\nPeople want to be associated with success. To the extent that you become successful, more people will want to work with you. To the extent that you get more stuff done, you'll get more promotions, more opportunities. Nobody's going to give you a job to do if the last five jobs like that they gave you, you couldn't get done. So the more you are able to do, which oftentimes of course requires power and influence, the more you're able to do, the more you'll be asked to do. But better yet, the more resources you'll be given to help you get things done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:48):\nAnd I think there's interestingly you teach that just showing that you have power creates more power. People see that you have this power and they start to follow your lead more, right? That's a part of this.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:43:57):\nYep. I just saw over the weekend the movie, the latest movie in the franchise of the Planet of the Apes. When Jim Collins left Stanford, he gave me a book called Chimpanzee Politics, which is of course not based on the Planet of the Apes, but it's based upon the study of chimpanzees. We are the same. People are attracted to power, you know that. By the way, that will account for a lot of what is going to happen in the presidential election.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):\nLet's save that for the end, because I think that's an interesting piece of your book, of the connection to Trump. So let's save that for a bit. I think that'll be really interesting. Kind of along the same lines of the area we're just talking about. And another rule of power is to show up in a powerful fashion. So look powerful, talk about what that looks like.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:44:43):\nSo my colleague at Berkeley, Dana Carney, C-A-R-N-E-Y, is writing a book called Tell, which is about the importance of body language and how to master body language. There is some evidence that suggests we respond mostly to how people look, secondarily to how they sound, and by far the least important to the content of what they say. You can see this by turning on your TV and turning off the sound. Watch the presidential debates with the sound off. They'll be much better. I have another colleague in marketing by the name of Baba Shiv, who talks about people's freaky mind, or the idea that we are in fact descended from primates, and that we are controlled in lots of ways by our emotions. And so we respond affectively to other people. We respond to how they look. There's evidence in economics that suggests tall people earn more salaries, control, earn more money, controlling for lots of things, attractive people.\n\n(00:45:46):\nAs long as you're not too attractive, you earn more money. Optimal level of attractiveness because people respond subconsciously to how people look, how they sound, how they show up, how they present themselves. In my class, I take the example of Tony Hayward of BP, the Macondo oil spill, and Lloyd Blankfein who was accused of shorting the securities that he was selling, which by the way, Goldman did. And before I let them hear Tony or Lloyd, we show about 60 seconds. And Lloyd's case 34 seconds with no sound. And even if you did not know who these people were and I asked you to make a bet, who's going to keep their job and who's going to lose it? You would know just from their physical appearance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:37):\nI love that.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:46:39):\nAnd by the way, what Dana Carney will tell you, and what common sense will tell you, is that these are skills that can be mastered. Robert de Niro was not born Robert de Niro, in the sense of acting skills are learned. How you show up, how you command the room. There's a guy named Regis McKenna who is older than God, who's famous for running a very, very, very fancy public relations firm in the Silicon Valley. And his biggest contribution to life, as well as by the way to his personal wealth, is that he made Steve Jobs Steve Jobs. When Steve Jobs began, Steve Jobs couldn't convince you to buy water if you were dying of thirst. He could not give a presentation to save his life. And Regis McKenna and his team took Steve Jobs under their wing and created Steve Jobs, a man who could sell anything to anybody. These are skills. This is not about personality. This is not about undergoing some kind of cosmetic surgery or whatever. These are skills, everything we've talked about, networking, showing up, all these things. These are skills that can be learned.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:55):\nI have a list of some of the stuff you actually recommend for looking and appearing powerful. So I'll read a few and I'm curious what else comes to mind. So do not read from notes. Make eye contact. Keep it brief. You say that anger can be a signal of power because it's outside the norm. It's kind of breaking the rules. Don't apologize. It's kind of the opposite. More gestures, which is interesting. Open body posture. Louder voice. Okay, I'm going to speak louder now. I like this. Okay, what else comes to mind as ways to appear powerful?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:48:26):\nInvading people's personal space. So gentle touching, standing close to someone. We're not talking about sexual touching, we're talking touch on the arm or the shoulder, shaking people's hands. That's a way of I think being more powerful. But you've covered the main ones. Eye contact. One of the problems with Tony Hayward of BP is that he's been given a statement to read. You cannot read something in front of you and make eye contact at the same time. So he looks like he's scripted. He looks like he's insincere. Jack Valenti, who I had the privilege of knowing, who for 38 years was the head of the Motion Picture Association of America, and typically rated one of the number one or number two most effective lobbyists in Washington DC, said to my class when he came to my class, which he did, \"I never appeared before Congress with notes. I wanted them to believe, which was by the way, true, that I was in complete control and complete mastery of the material, and that I did not need notes or a bunch of assistants around me to help me.\n\n(00:49:40):\nThat I, as the head of the MPAA, understood the motion picture industry.\" And then he would give you a little aside about how it was the one industry that consistently had a budget surplus in trade. He would talk about how many jobs he created and he had all this stuff at his fingertips. But basically his command of the material made him more powerful. It's interesting, Jack Valenti was five foot two inches tall and he came, talked to my class, and the next class I said to people, \"What are your reactions? What are your thoughts?\" And a woman raised her hand and said, \"He feels taller than he is.\" And I thought that was an assessment that was both true and insightful. When the five-foot-two Jack Valenti appeared, because of his presence, because of his body language, because of his Texas drawl, because of how he moved on the stage, he felt bigger. You would not say he did not feel five-foot-two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:54):\nLet me read a couple more because this is a good example of stuff he did. Other ways to appear more powerful is more speaking time, longer gazing time, more disinhibited laughs. Is that just you laughing and feeling like you're just...\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:51:08):\nWell, humor. Humor. The famous author, Salman Rushdie said, and I quote Salman Rushdie, it's a fabulous quote. \"If you can get people to laugh, you can tell them anything.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):\nYeah, stand-up comedy is a great example that. So again, I think here people might be hearing this and they're like, I don't want to be this person. I don't want to be talking all the time. I don't want to be pretending like open posture. Is the advice here just you don't need to do all these things. Just know this makes people more powerful. Don't necessarily judge people, do some of these things maybe because it'll add to your power? How do you think about just people that are turned off by this sort of thing?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:51:45):\nThat's a wonderful question. So I say to my class, on the very first day of class, that we will go through four stages. We'll go through the stage of denial. It doesn't work in my culture, it doesn't work in my organization, doesn't work for me, it doesn't work in my religion, whatever. Then we'll go through anger. When they get angry at me, how can you teach us this stuff? Then they'll go into sadness. I actually believe this and I'm depressed. And if we're successful, they will go through acceptance. And the process I have, again, I do not have the most popular class at Stanford Business School because I am good-looking, because I'm the smartest person at Stanford or anything else. I am strategic about thinking about if I have someone who's going to come into this class, I have to get them from denial to acceptance in 10 weeks.\n\n(00:52:38):\nAnd how are we going to do that? The easiest way to do that, if I said, Lenny, I want you to become a better tennis player, or a better roller blader, or a better ice skater, whatever, a better piano player in 10 weeks, what would we do? If we have practice and coaching. And that's what I do in the class, practice and coaching. I have executive coaches who work with the class and I give them assignments that ask them to practice what they're learning. And therefore, by the end of the class, most people have made this transition because it is true. If you've never... I had a dinner the other night, this Israeli woman who's like, I've done amazing stuff. Amazing. Which is fabulous. And she said at the dinner, she said, \"I would've never done this before taking your class.\" And the way you get them to do this is I don't say, Lenny, you're going to swim the English Channel tomorrow.\n\n(00:53:38):\nIf I want you to swim the English Channel, we're going to start by swimming in pools and make every day a little bit more challenging. That's what we do. I don't start by saying, you're going to network like Keith Ferrazzi or John Levy, or you're not going to be as bold as Jason Calacanis, who trust me is extraordinarily bold. You're not going to necessarily do what I did. You're going to begin where you can begin, and push yourself out of your comfort zone. Because, and again, this is common sense.\n\n(00:54:13):\nThere's also a ton of research behind it. If you always stay in your comfort zone, you'll never do anything different or better than what you're currently doing. This is true. If I said to you, I want you to, at the end of 10 weeks, lift a hundred pounds, I can't do that by on the last day saying lift a hundred pounds. We have to work up to it. And that is, it's the same principle here. So don't do something that looks so off the wall or so out of character for you that you can't conceive doing it. Push yourself a little, push yourself a little.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:49):\nThere's an interesting connection here too. What some say is kind of the opposite of your class at Stanford, which is Touchy-Feely. We had Carole Robin on the podcast and she has a framework, the 15% rule where you push yourself 15% beyond your comfort zone. Where it's just a little bit, but it's not too far, and it feels like you try to do a similar thing.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:55:07):\nYeah, absolutely. So you begin by doing what you don't think you can do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:12):\nLet's spend a little more time here around the homework assignments, and this kind of Knowing-Doing Gap that you talked about. So you shared a couple of homework assignments you give already, find 10 people, think of 10 people you want to meet that'll help you with your career and then try to meet them. And then there's this, I guess my friend started a podcast, I don't know which homework it was. What other homework assignments do you give?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:55:30):\nSo we begin, there's a literature on goal setting that says if you set goals, you're more likely to achieve them. This is, again, not some huge insight, but there's an enormous scientific literature about this. And so I begin the very first homework assignment is, which is by the way, on the very first day of class, why are you here? Why are you here? It is now the end of this class. What would success look like to you? What would you like to accomplish in our 10 weeks together? Second assignment, I give them a reading from the Power book, which is the book before Seven Rules, which talks about the seven attributes of power. Go out and get people to rate you on these or rate yourself. Set for yourself a development plan, energy, focus, being willing to tolerate conflict, all these qualities. What are you strong on? What are you weak on? What do you want to build during our time together, and how are you going to do it?\n\n(00:56:35):\nSo we begin with goal setting. One of the assignments I give them, which is the class that Jason comes to, what resources can you create? You're at Stanford Business School, elite, fancy Stanford. What can you do in your 10 weeks here? I have people who created awards. A woman who created an award gave it to Karlie Kloss, the model. Got in trouble with the school. It turns out it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission. So what can you do to create resources that will give you some leverage? That would be a third assignment. The networking is a fourth assignment. The acting with power. I show them the videos and I tell them in advance of the class, and I tell them they need to become Tony Hayward. They need to do a better job, which is, by the way, a low bar, representing BP. And give me a 60 to 90 second video and then share it with colleagues and get feedback on it. And then we're going to call on people in the class.\n\n(00:57:47):\nIn other words, for every idea, I try to think of something. And this is all, by the way, this is all front-loaded. And by the end of the class we're not doing this so much. But I try to give them an exercise that causes them to actually take that idea and implement it. Find people, oh, for branding. Write a personal brand statement, get some feedback on it, then write it again. How do you want to be known? Which is by the way, useful to you because you're a second-year MBA, you're going to go in the job market. What do you want people to think about you? How do you want people to respond to you? How do you want to be known? So I basically take for every topic and have them do it. And then the coach, their person, their coach, who is responsible for 23 of these people, give them feedback on this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:44):\nI could see how this makes a big impact on someone's life.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:58:49):\nYeah. And so at the end, I had a student a couple years ago said to me, \"It is not that I got more feedback and more useful feedback from your class than I did in any other class. I got more useful feedback in your class than I did on every other class I took combined.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:09):\nI can see why. Let's talk about the last power. So we've talked through six already. We have only one more to go, which is maybe the one that probably upsets people most, which is that once you have power, people will forget what you did to get there. Talk about what that looks like and is that a power or is it more just like this is what you should know about.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (00:59:28):\nAnd I put in rule seven for the following reason. In spite of everything that you and I have been talking about, many people in a stage of, I don't know, denial or something, say, I'm worried that if I do this, at the end... People believe that the world is homeostatic. It is not. That it's going to adjust, but whatever. At the end I will be brought low. They have the myth of Icarus in their head. You fly too close to the sun, your wings are going to melt, you're going to be brought down. And so I try to convince them, partly through a lecture and partly through rule seven. And some of the principles that I talk about in rule seven. That, in fact, life is not homeostatic at all. That life is actually self-fulfilling. If I believe you're powerful, you will become more powerful.\n\n(01:00:26):\nIf I believe you have no power, you will wind up with almost no power, and that therefore it is all forgotten and forgiven. And I begin, I believe I begin. But if not, I could begin with the story of the South Carolina Senator who says nasty things about Trump, and then Lindsey Graham, and becomes Trump's biggest acolyte. And the New York Times, of course, is fascinated by this. How can you say all these horrible things about Trump and now be his, basically have your lips affixed to some part of his anatomy? And Lindsey's answer is, I want to be relevant. He's the President of the United States. This goes back to the judgment. I like him, this, that, the other thing. He's the president. If I want to get legislation passed, he, by the way, has taken over the Republican Party.\n\n(01:01:22):\nIf I want to get stuff done, I need to have him on my side. And like many narcissists and egomaniacs, it is not a good way to get them on your side by saying nasty things about them. So this is the pragmatics. People forget that Bill Gates stole the code on which Microsoft has built. People forget that Jeffrey Epstein, after being convicted of sex offenses, was still having dinners with members of the royal family and members of the New York media elite. People forget that Martha Stewart, who served time in jail, has a brand that's never been more valuable. People forget all this stuff.\n\n(01:02:19):\nI still remember sitting in the office of someone whose name I won't use, but I'll use enough that if somebody wanted to search it out, you could. So I am sitting in this guy's office and he's, by the way, a Jewish man. He's got pictures of him with the Pope, he's got pictures of him with Ronald Reagan. He's got pictures with him, with all these people. What is his secret? He, by the way, took a company into bankruptcy. People lost literally billions of dollars. He was fined. He lost money, but he walked away with about $700 million. It turns out, $700 million makes you a big deal. Lives at the biggest house in Los Angeles or one of the biggest houses in Los Angeles. I can't keep up with the construction of the big houses. People want to be close to money, power, and success, and they will overlook your flaws to be close to you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:18):\nAnd again, you talk about this in the book. You're not describing how the world should work. This is just how it is, and this is how you can be successful in the world that we live in.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:03:28):\nAnd by the way, this is how the world not only is, but how it was and how it will be. Because these ideas are not something that I sat down one day and made up or something. These ideas, everything that I talk about, including this last one, has social science and logic behind it. So you can explain not only what is, but why it is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):\nSo, let's talk about Trump for a bit. At the beginning of your book, you say that basically you were going to write a book about why Trump is so successful and what he's done so well. And your realization is no one's going to pay attention if here's how to be like Trump. And essentially, if you think about all these rules, it's clear he is very good at all of these things.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:04:16):\nThat's correct. By the way, not because he read the book, but because he does it through trial and error or something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:22):\nSo when people hear that, they're like, I don't want to be Trump. I don't like how Trump is. I don't want to be seen that way. Do you have any thoughts on just how to make people feel comfortable following some of these powers and building power, knowing that, oh wow, maybe he's the epitome of some of this stuff?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:04:38):\nI will tell you a story. In 1993, a woman named Laura Esserman, who's a doctor, took my class. She claims publicly that this is the only class at Stanford for which she did all the reading. By the way, while she was getting her MBA at Stanford, she was having her first child and practicing medicine full time. Laura Esserman said to me one day, \"You have a case. You have cases on all these people doing evil things. Why don't you ever write a case about somebody doing good things?\" And of course, I wrote a case about her. So she comes to the class. Case was published in probably 2003, 2004.\n\n(01:05:31):\nShe comes to the class and the students are, what is the right word? Hard on her? That would be a modest thing. The students eviscerate her because she is incredibly smart, incredibly well-intentioned, but she will not network. She says, \"I don't have time for schmoozing.\" She will not do almost any of the stuff that we talk about today. So she and her husband, Michael Endicott, two of my closest friends in the world, and I go out to lunch afterwards. And smoke is coming out of her ears and she is pissed off. And this is a very accomplished woman and a very smart woman. And she's pissed. I said to her, \"Laura, you have boundless energy and boundless intelligence. You're a force of nature. Let me discuss something from the past subject of physics.\n\n(01:06:39):\nYou are creating friction. With enough force you can overcome the friction. If you reduce the friction, just think how much more you could accomplish.\" And she looked at me and changed. And I will tell you, and I've said this publicly, because I get to introduce her for all the awards she's won, and she's now won a ton of them. Including Time Magazine 2016 list of a hundred most influential people in the world. And I say to people, and I say it with pride, that of all the things I've done in my life, the thing I'm most proud of and most proud of is creating Laura Esserman.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:20):\nThat is an awesome story and a really good way of thinking about this from a different angle.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:07:24):\nYeah, no, and I said to Laura, I said, \"You want to make profound changes in the drug development process. You want to make profound changes in whether or not we learn from the treatments that are being given to people. You want to make profound changes in the connection between research and teaching, research and practice. You want to do all these things. If you are going to accomplish any of these things, you need to cross the bridge.\" And she hasn't crossed the bridge completely and she and I joke about it. But she crossed the bridge a lot and she has accomplished incredible things. She's won every cancer award that can be given. And by the way, she's won all these awards for the American Cancer Society, who she fought with. She's won these awards from the Susan Cohen Foundation, who she fought with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:20):\nThis is an incredible example of the opening quote to your book that I have here. \"If you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power.\"\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:08:28):\nThat's exactly right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:30):\nAnd I like the, it's like a quote attributed to me, is how you...\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:08:34):\nYeah. Well, I don't remember saying it, but somebody said, I said it. I'll take credit for it. I said to Laura, \"You want to change medicine? Medicine is not going to change without the application of power and influence.\" If change was going to happen, it would've happened already. You have to take on entrenched interests. She has a whole thing, which we need not go into because it's pretty technical, on screening. She said, everybody's getting a mammogram every year beyond a certain age, which is stupid for a variety of reasons. You can read, she was on the PBS NewsHour about this. This is what got her in trouble with the radiologists. The radiologists, of course, are selling screening. She said, there's some people that need to be screened every month, and there's some people that need to be screened never because of their genetics. She wants custom tailored screening or precision screening. Anyway, she fights everybody.\n\n(01:09:29):\nRichard Blum, Dianne Feinstein's husband, both Dianne and Richard Blum are now deceased, was at a thing where she launched the Athena Project. The Athena Project, she's now, with her collaborators, collecting data on the diagnosis and treatment and outcome for 150,000 patients in the University of California Healthcare System. So I'm supposed to give some opening talk to provide entertainment. And Dick Blum is there. Dick Blum, of course is wealthy. He's Dianne Feinstein's husband. I said to him, \"Dick, how did Laura get you here?\" And I still remember, I think this is a quote in one of the books I wrote. He said to me, he said, \"Look.\" He said, \"I've learned that at the end of the day when Laura asks you to do something, you may say no, but at the end of the day, you're going to do it anyway. Save yourself the aggravation.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:20):\nOh man, I feel like you're just endlessly full of good stories that we could just keep going on and on. Let me try to summarize the rules of power real quick and see if anything else emerges. And then have just a couple more questions. So the Seven Rules of Power, get out of your own way, break the rules, show up in a powerful fashion, create a powerful brand, network relentlessly, use your power, and understand that once you've acquired power, that what you did to get there will be forgiven, forgotten, or both. Let me ask you a question, maybe half in jest. You teach people how to acquire power. Why aren't you the most powerful man in the world?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:10:57):\nAh, that's a very good question. To which I have a very good answer. I have a colleague who's unfortunately now deceased, by the name of James G. March, who was a very, very distinguished scholar. And James March said to me many, many years ago, something which is completely true. You can have power or you can have autonomy, but you cannot have both. And I have chosen to live a life of freedom, autonomy. I could tell you stories that would bring tears to your eyes. I'll tell you one. We had a dean of the Business School whose wife was dying of cancer, and she was projected to die in the fall. So the Business School goes to him and says, we'll give you the fall off to be with your wife. She lives until June. It's now winter.\n\n(01:11:46):\nYou have responsibilities as the Dean of the Business School. You have to meet with alumni. You have to go around and raise money. You have to show up at events, university events. I do not necessarily think that is how he wanted to spend the winter and spring quarters, but that's what you have to do. When I wanted Jack Valenti to come to my class, I did not call Jack Valenti. I called Judy Dickey. Judy Dickey was his assistant. Judy Dickey controlled his schedule. I meet Jack on such and such a day. He can't make it on that day. Fine. I can adjust the schedule. Can he make it on this day?\n\n(01:12:24):\nWhen I wanted my friend Gary Loveman, who ran Harrah's and Caesars and then was the number two executive at Aetna, I want him to come to my class. I called Reggie Kirk. I didn't call Gary Loveman. And that's all you need to know. I do not have an assistant who controls my schedule. I control my schedule. You will not find my Outlook calendar on any website, on any computer. I want autonomy. If I said to you, \"Lenny, I will give you $1 billion, or for that matter, $10 billion if you can buy-\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:01):\nYes.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:13:02):\nWait, if you can have last week again. You can't. You can't. Time goes in only one direction. I want control of my time. It is much more important to me, being a Dean or an Associate Dean, a job that I was asked to do. I took one academic administrative job. I'm actually memorialized, believe it or not, in the Stanford Record, as having led, and this is according to my expenses, the Nobel Prize winner who was Dean at the time, that I led the biggest and most successful transformation in the history of higher education. I did it. I did it once. I didn't like it. Life is too short. I want to do what I like.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:52):\nThat's a really profound point that I think people don't think about, is there's always this drive to acquire power. And your point is that there's a big downside, which is a lack of autonomy. Yeah. You think about the, as I was trying to get Satya Nadella on the podcast, and I talked to his comms people, and they're like, every hour for the next three months is booked already. We know what he's doing. He's extremely booked. And you think about the president, obviously at Elon. I totally get what you're saying.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:14:17):\nIt is true, and I don't want to do that. And by the way, power also comes with enormous visibility. Donald Trump has done, for 40 years, what he's now being accused of doing, the tax stuff, all this stuff. He's been a grifter all his life. But when you become President, people are going to look at things that in the past they would not have looked at. You become president of a university, you're going to have scrutiny as the President of Harvard Law and the President of Stanford Law, when they both had to resign, in one case because of plagiarism, in another case because of research misconduct.\n\n(01:14:55):\nPower comes. You're going to be put under a microscope. People are going to look at what car you drive. They're going to look at who you go out with. They're going to look at how you spend your time. They're going to look at how you associate with, you'll have no privacy. You'll have very little control over your life. Everybody will feel completely free to dissect you in public, in private, whatever. And you'll face the trust dilemma. When you are rich and powerful the question will be, are people praising you, are people associating with you because of you or because of the position you hold?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:41):\nYeah. Do you spend any time, just to follow this thread in your class, convincing people stop being so obsessed with power, stop being so obsessed with becoming the top of everything? Is that a part of the class?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:15:52):\nNo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:52):\nOr is it just...\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:15:53):\nNo. I teach them, they see we have a class on the price of power. I bring out Rudy Crew. Rudy Crew was the New York School's Chancellor under Rudy Giuliani. By the way, he tells many interesting stories about Rudy Giuliani, who did not just become the joke that he is overnight. He's worked hard to become that. But in any event, he tells. And one year, one year, because his daughter at that time was living in the Bay Area, when I asked him about the effect of the positions he held, Head of Miami Dade County Schools, Head of New York City schools.\n\n(01:16:29):\nHad Hillary ever won, he would've been Secretary of Education. Literally. There's Lauren in the room. And he said to the class, Jeffrey asked me the question, \"Why don't we let Lauren answer it?\" By the time she was finished, there was not a dry eye in the room. What is it like to be the child? What is it like to be the significant other of these people? And you know the answer to that because you can see the suicides, the divorce rates. There is a price that not only you pay, but a price that your family pays.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:09):\nI think that's a really good balance to the entire conversation. Maybe just as a last question, what if we give the audience a homework assignment to work on these power rules? What's something that you'd recommend someone try to do? I know it's probably dependent on what they're good at, not good at. What's something that they could do to start moving towards one of these rules?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:17:28):\nSo what I would say, and it comes from something that you talked about in our conversation at several times, which is this is uncomfortable. Okay. So if I want you to do something uncomfortable, I could say, \"Lenny, go do this uncomfortable thing on your own.\" Or I can say, \"Lenny, I want you to do this with help, with social support.\" And so the first thing I would say to someone is, if you think this is uncomfortable, or if you think you're not skilled at this, get coaching. Get a coach.\n\n(01:18:03):\nI send out regularly the list of the coaches who work with my online and on-campus classes. Happy to do it. And they're happy to have the business. Get a coach. Get a personal board of directors like they talk about in the Wall Street Journal. In other words, get people who will give you advice, give you social support, and hold you accountable. That's the very first thing I would tell people to do. It's hard to do anything on your own. If I said to you, \"Lenny, I want you to start an extraordinarily successful podcast and I want you to do it without any help.\" You would not be where you are today. So that simple principle, get help.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:48):\nIt feels like a part of rule number one. Get out of your own way. Ask for help. Jeffrey, I was nervous for this podcast because I thought this was going to be super uncomfortable stuff. It turns out all of this makes so much sense, and there's a really nice way of framing all of these rules, and there's so much reason to actually invest in these skills. So I really appreciate you putting in the time being here, sharing all these stories and insights. Is there anything else you want to share as a kind of a final note or something to leave listeners with before we wrap up? We did it. We covered everything?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:19:19):\nNo, I'm happy. I'm happy you're a very good interviewer, which is why your podcast is so successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:24):\nI appreciate that.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:19:25):\nI'm happy to spend the time with you, and I hope whoever listens to this will, I hope, first of all, there'll be a lot of listeners, but I also hope that they will find it useful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:32):\nI know they will. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they, or find your book, I guess, if they want to learn more? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:19:41):\nSo you can find my book anywhere where books are sold. Don't look at a physical bookstore because nobody carries it, including actually Stanford bookstore, where they run out of it if people... And you can find it on Amazon. Seven Rules of Power. So that's how you can find the book. By the way, at the end of the book I talk about, I have a personal website, jeffreypfeffer.com. If you go to that website, you can find my course outline. So you can take the course on your own if you want, or get somebody or take it in a group of people.\n\n(01:20:13):\nYou can find research, you can find articles, you can find columns. You can follow me on LinkedIn or I don't do Twitter anymore, but you can follow me on LinkedIn. So there are a lot of resources available for this. A company was once thinking of hiring me to give a talk in their organization, and the woman who wound up hiring me said, \"When I was discussing you and arguing that we should hire you for this presentation, one of the people in the committee said, is he a good presenter?\" And her answer, I love this. I remember this. Her answer was, \"He's a fabulous educator.\" My job is to educate. That is why I have done what I have done for now more than 50 years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:03):\nHoly moly. I didn't even realize that.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:21:06):\nFor more than 50 years, I have been in the business of education. Not just about power, but about many other things as well. But I'm in the education business, so I'm happy to provide people with the resources, with the readings. The Seven Rules of Power is well footnoted. It talks at the end about we could reach out for the coaches. You can go to the website and get the book. But I think consistent with what you and I have talked about, if all you do is read, you're not going to make very much progress. You have to do it. You cannot learn tennis by reading about tennis, or by watching a movie about Serena or Venus Williams. You have to actually get out on the court and do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:51):\nWhich is a good plug for your other book, the Knowing-Doing Gap, which actually helps you with the skill, which you can also find all your finer retailers. Jeffrey Pfeffer, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer (01:22:04):\nThank you for having me on your show.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:06):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

The founder is the product. You have studied. You have experienced something that most of the market hasn't even had a chance to maybe see or visualize yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):\nA billion SaaS tools emailing me constantly about their product. How do you get someone to even want to talk to you and be open to learning about what you're doing?\n\nJen Abel (00:00:25):\nSo if you can focus the messaging in a way that speaks to something that is a bit of shock value or is counterintuitive, you'll get them to continue reading. When a problem is truly being felt by the market, people will get on a call, people will respond.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):\nThe next step I imagine is you're on the phone with them trying to convince them to actually care. What do you do there? How do you get them to engage further?\n\nJen Abel (00:00:45):\nYou need to be vulnerable. I would be very open and honest with where you are. Hey, I'm an early stage startup. We have a lot to learn. Can we kind of gain your insight into how this problem is manifesting on your side? Founder led sales is not about revenue on day one. It is about learning as fast as humanly possible to get to that pulse, so that you can earn the right to sell.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):\nToday my guest is Jen Abel. Jen is the co-founder of Jellyfish, where her and her team help early stage founders learn how to sell, do early customer discovery, and set up a repeatable sales motion. Prior to Jellyfish, Jen was an enterprise sales director at the Muse and a general assembly, and she's obsessed with helping founders in the zero to one stage of their journey. In our conversation, we get extremely tactical and in the weeds on how to actually do sales as a founder. We talk through each step of the sales process, and Jen shares what you should be doing and saying at every step. We go through how to find your first set of leads, how to reach out to them, what to say in your message, how to structure your first sales call, how to get through procurement, and how to get that final signature.\n\n(00:01:55):\nShe shares actual words you should be using, and phrases and structures, and pitfalls that most people run into at each of these steps. I've never heard a podcast episode with this much advice that you can put into practice tomorrow, and I am very excited to hear how it goes for you. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jen Abel.\n\n(00:02:24):\nJen, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nJen Abel (00:02:27):\nThanks, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:28):\nWhat I've always wanted to do is to create a very tactical episode on how to do sales, like how to actually have sales conversations, how to find leads, how to close deals. Especially with a focus on founder led sales, where founders are doing the early sales versus hiring salesperson. Which one, I know you're a huge advocate of and we'll talk about this. And two, you basically spent all your time working with founders and founding teams, helping them learn how to do sales, how to set up their go-to-market motions, how to scale teams, sales teams, how to hire sales people. So I'm very excited to have you here to create a very in the weeds, hands-on episode on how to do sales. How does that sound broadly?\n\nJen Abel (00:03:07):\nThat sounds awesome, and thank you so much for having me, Lenny. I mean, it's a true pleasure to be here with you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:12):\nIt's my pleasure. Many people have recommended you come on this podcast. I'm excited we're doing this. Let me start with just this kind of question, our founder led sales. Maybe just briefly explain what that term means and then talk about why this is so important, why this is the way you recommend companies start doing sales?\n\nJen Abel (00:03:29):\nFounder led sales is really that first milestone that a startup goes through on the commercial side, which is, how do I go out and get my first few customers? Some people might say zero to one, which is, how do I get my first million? Others might say, how do I go out and get my first 10 customers? It's all kind of in the same vein. And founder led sales is really, really, really important because in the very, very, very early days, when there is no brand equity, when there is no marketing engine running, when there is limited to no reference ability, the founder is the product, right? Because the product is still, could be abstract, could be an MVP or in it's really early formation. So the founder is the product. When people say, well, what does that even mean? It means that you are a subject matter expert on something highly specific.\n\n(00:04:23):\nYou have studied, you have experienced something that most of the market hasn't even had a chance to maybe see or visualize yet. So you have this novel insight that you are building a business around. And it's that novel insight and the way you see the world that gets the market excited, in absence of a product. And that's actually happens even before you even show the product. So founder led sales is how do you bring the founders vision into the world and have the market, and understand what part of the market accepts it, and then what part of that vision are they accepting? So it's aligning the founders vision with the market reality.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:01):\nThis episode is brought to you by Brave Search.

I'll build the thing, I'll wait for them to find deals. And this is like a lot of people think this way. And founder led sales is the movement of just like, no, no, you should be doing the sales for a long time as a founder.\n\nJen Abel (00:07:06):\nAbsolutely. I mean, it is the competitive advantage. I don't think people realize how much of a competitive advantage the founder led sales motion is, for three specific reasons. One is that the founder is the visionary. No one's going to be able to speak to it like they can. No salesperson, really no non-founder. The second is that they are the highest order in the hierarchy of the startup. It's the founder. So the market is excited to talk to a founder because they usually know something that the market doesn't know. And they want to learn and maybe they want to experience something differently. So being able to speak to the person that's running the vision, speak to the person that's crafted the vision.\n\n(00:07:50):\nAnd then that third piece is that the founder can see something budding in a conversation that a salesperson won't be able to see. And it's those budding moments that's where all the gold lives. And I don't think a lot of founders realize that. Their day one market vision is never the same vision that takes them in a product market fit. And I say that all the time. It's these little budding moments where it's like I was able to get to that budding insight because I went deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper through these calls and these conversations, to fully refine how we want to go out and sell it. And only a founder is going to be able to see those things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:26):\nI love this because this connects really well with an episode I just did with the CMO of Wiz. And the founders went through this exactly. They had 10 to 15 conversations a day for weeks, and then they're like realizing people keep telling us they like it, but no one's buying, no one's excited enough to want to actually move forward. And that was only happening because the founders were on these calls.\n\nJen Abel (00:08:49):\nYeah, I mean, the other thing too is that it becomes a game of telephone. It's like, hey, this salesperson says that no cares about this. What do you think the first thing the founder's going to say is? It's the salesperson. So much easier to say that than, is it me? Is it my vision? So it also kind of brings the accountability closer to the pulse where decisions are made.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:10):\nIt's interesting how similar this is to product building, where there's this idea that a founder top down can tell the team what to build, and it's this very waterfall cycle. When in reality the idea of the product and feature is just like step one, and then there's actually building it, testing it, talking to customers about it, that actually turns that initial seed of an idea to the real thing that people will want.\n\nJen Abel (00:09:33):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:34):\nOkay. So the catch 22, I don't know if that's the term here. The challenge is, okay, so great, founders should be doing sales. Most founders have never done sales. They just want to build product. They're mostly product people, design people. Sometimes there's founders that are salespeople. Rarely is that the case in my experience. So doing sales is very hard, not something that comes naturally to a lot of people. A lot of people are very afraid of it. So with that, let's get into how to actually get better at the sales process. I think a nice framework for how we can go through this is basically first let's talk about the sales cycle, the steps, the key steps of a sales cycle. And then we'll just go through each step and help people learn some tactics to get through each of those conversations.\n\nJen Abel (00:09:35):\nSounds great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:22):\nOkay. Yeah. Cool. So what's the simplest way to think about the steps of a sales cycle?\n\nJen Abel (00:10:26):\nThe traditional sales stages that most CRMs are even set up as is you have your intro call. You have your second call, which sometimes could be the demo depending on the stage of market you're selling to. Then you have your third call, which is going to be more about walking through a proposal, a scope of work, maybe going deeper into the demo to contextualize it to everything you've learned. The fourth call is going to be getting their feedback and kind of co-authoring that scope of work even further. The fifth call is going to be around probably an introduction to procurement. And then selling into procurement in itself, it's its own little sales cycle, but we could talk about that in a sec. And then post-procurement, it's going to be obviously getting that signature and knowing who the actual signatory is. Sometimes it's not even the business unit, it's sometimes legal, CFO, procurement themselves. So just understanding who that is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:23):\nOkay, great. So let's walk through each of these steps. So I love that each call has its traditional goal, demo, proposal, then co-authoring, and then procurement, and then post-procurement. I love how consistent everybody is.\n\nJen Abel (00:11:39):\nYeah, well, it's also, it's interesting because it's also predicated on their buying process as well. So if they're really used to buying, if they're very mature in their buying process, they actually might guide you to what the steps are. But most startups are turning non-consumers into consumers. So that's why this kind of fits well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):\nGot it. So there's this intra call step. So kind starting about where it begins. I think where a lot of people struggle most is getting anyone to even pay attention. You don't want to talk to them. A billion SaaS tools emailing me constantly about their product. So maybe we start there of just like how do you get someone to even want to talk to you and be open to learning about what you're doing?\n\nJen Abel (00:12:19):\nYeah. And this is why that founder led sales piece is so important. One is when it's coming from the founder, it's an entirely different weight. You're like, oh, interesting. This founder is reaching out to me. Okay, I'm going to seek to go a layer deeper, knowing who is sending me this note. The second piece is this is why that novel insight, that technical insight, that business model insight that you've uncovered needs to lead here. People are inspired by a new way of thinking, usually something counterintuitive, something that's really different. I really try and stay away from better, because that's really hard to define, and better means something different to everyone. So if you can focus the messaging in a way that speaks to something that has a bit of shock value, or is counterintuitive, you'll get them to continue reading. So first and foremost, I usually like to open it with, which is why is this relevant for me in my role?\n\n(00:13:20):\nWhy are you reaching out to me? So first and foremost is relevancy. I think that matters even more so than personalization right now. I think it's so easy to personalize anything, and it can also come across as really stressed when you're like, hey, I noticed you were on such and such podcast, and that was when they were previously two roles behind. So I always say relevancy. If you can get to relevancy, that's the most important piece. The second most important piece is really getting to that level of differentiation or counterintuitive nature. So say something that would literally make them say what? Or that makes no sense. Maybe not that makes no sense, but what or how could that be? Or I've never thought about it that way. Or I actually don't fully understand what they're saying, but there's something there that's interesting. Get them to pause for a minute.\n\n(00:14:13):\nAnd the most important piece is getting this done where, if they get it on their mobile phone, which everyone is looking at their mobile phone and on email, they don't have to scroll. So usually three to four sentences max. That also, that's how a founder writes. That's how an executive writes if you're selling top down. But most importantly, leave them wanting more. Don't say everything, don't even talk about the solution. Talk about the problem that you want to solve, and why it needs to be solved or why it's not good enough today. So those are the four main components. Just to reiterate, relevancy, bring some level of counterintuitive or really different approach to the conversation, focusing in on a problem that's predicated to them, and really concise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):\nI love this. Is there an example you could share that helps make this even more real? Maybe an email you helped with. And by the way, this is email and LinkedIn, I imagine is where you're communicating mostly?\n\nJen Abel (00:15:11):\nLinkedIn, email, you would be shocked to hear this, but cold calling. I never used to do this. It is one of the most... The interest rates on cold calling are a lot higher than email in many cases.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:26):\nSo it's calling, email, cold email and LinkedIn DMs, is that the three channels generally?\n\nJen Abel (00:15:31):\nYep, those are the three, yeah, the main ones.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:33):\nCool. Yeah. Is there an example? It doesn't have to be word for word which you've done or people done, but just how do you... Yeah.\n\nJen Abel (00:15:38):\nActually our first three years were built on cold email before we actually had clients, before we got word of mouth from the founders we worked with, I cold emailed the first 20 customers we had at Jellyfish. And the line I used in there was zero to one sales talent doesn't exist. That's why I want to have a conversation with you. So that was kind of that leading, wait, what? What does that even mean? And what I would do is tie that to them in some respects. If they recently raised the seed or series A, where they are in that journey. But I would lead with that and then tie it into like, hey, I noticed you're looking to target X, Y, and Z based off of what your website. I'd love to have a conversation with you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:25):\nAnd that first piece is the relevance. Here's why this is relevant to you.\n\nJen Abel (00:16:28):\nYeah. And then I say, our belief at Jellyfish is zero to one sales talent doesn't exist. That's why we built this model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):\nAwesome. And you kept it really short. So it's relevance, counterintuitive, keep it really short. And then what was the fourth piece?\n\nJen Abel (00:16:42):\nThe fourth piece is just make sure it's concise so that you don't have to scroll on mobile phone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:47):\nWhile we're on this topic. What's a good conversion rate of these sorts of cold outreaches?\n\nJen Abel (00:16:51):\nConversion rate is interesting. Because everyone's so focused on conversion rate. I get that in the beginning until you have some wins, you have to focus there. But I just want to reverse engineer it backwards a bit. Once you kind of have this, and I'll talk about it in a sec, which is win rate. Win rate is if I got Lenny on a phone call, and he went through the sales process, and I signed him up. And I spoke to 10 Lenny's and only Lenny R was the one that signed. That's one out of 10, that's a 10% win rate.\n\n(00:17:23):\nSo if you have a really high win rate, let's say 30 or 40%, you actually don't need as high of a conversion rate on the outbound, because you know if you get someone in the funnel, the throughput is very healthy. If your win rate is really low, you need that conversion rate to be much, much higher, because you need more and more and more at bats. So conversion rate is a funny thing. In the beginning I get it because you don't have a lot of customers going through the pipeline yet. But there's people focus on it in a little bit of a false sense because interest rate truly is also dictated by win rate. So I just want to specify that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:03):\nThat's a really good point.\n\nJen Abel (00:18:05):\nI would say if you're doing a win rate around 15 to 30% and you need to carry, oh I don't know, a million dollar quota. I would say a healthy conversion rate from outbound probably sits around, when it's mature, around five to 7%. Sometimes it could be two to 3%. Sometimes I've seen eight to 15% because it's coming from the founder, and they're solving a really heartfelt problem. So interest rate is also predicated on the problem that the founder has decided they want to solve for, and their insight on that problem.\n\n(00:18:51):\nAnd everyone wants to keep going back to, well, email rate is really low, email doesn't work anymore. LinkedIn, I'm not getting the connects I want. Yes, you can argue that the game has changed a little bit, but when a problem is truly being felt by the market, people will get on a call. People will respond. And if I can compare two engagements at a time that we're running, I see one where it's a 2% interested rate and then I'm seeing another one that's actually at 12% interested rate. And we're doing nothing different. The only thing that's different is the insight that the founder has on the market, which is a hard pill to swallow. And I know that's hard to hear too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:32):\nAnd those are two different companies selling different things?\n\nJen Abel (00:19:34):\nTwo different companies selling to two different markets, but they're not fundamentally drastically different markets.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:43):\nGot it. But one's basically got more product market fit essentially?\n\nJen Abel (00:19:46):\nThat's exactly right. So everyone always comes back to we have the sales problem, we have the sales problem, we have an outbound problem. And yes, there could be some technical things going on that you need to look at. Maybe you leveraged clay and you blasted a thousand people and now your domain health has been impacted. But the vast majority of the time, maybe you're just not saying anything interesting at all. Maybe the problem you're looking to solve just isn't widely felt. Maybe the perspective you have needs another level of refinement because you're just not getting those bites.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):\nI feel like this question you just touched on is something a lot of founders are always wondering, is this product not the thing people want? Is it my sales skills? I guess I imagine this is a very difficult question to answer, especially quickly. I guess is there anything there that's more likely because of this, it means your product isn't something anyone's want, versus you're not doing a good job selling it?\n\nJen Abel (00:20:41):\nRemember that amazing chart you drew where it talked about the length of time it took? I think you picked the top 25 startups.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:50):\nFor product market fit timeline [inaudible 00:20:51].\n\nJen Abel (00:20:51):\nProduct market fit. Yeah, that amazing image that I think has been reshared more times than anything I've ever seen. It's interesting because if you look at, I was looking at this closely the other day. If you look at the top section where the time to product market fit is consolidated, and you go all the way down to the air tables and the figmas, which a long time to get to product market fit. If you think about the earlier ones, which were, it was like GitHub that had product market fit pretty quickly. The SOC 2 compliant company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:22):\nVanta.\n\nJen Abel (00:21:23):\nVanta. There's this thing in my head and I haven't fully validated it but I'm going to share it with you, which is did they start with the market problem first and then build the product? Because they knew who their market was right off the bat. Versus an air table and a figma that I think started with a technical insight and then were trying to find their market.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:46):\nI think that's absolutely right. Vanta, the way they approached it, Christina, she was searching for a pain. She was obsessed with talking to everybody about a pain that they needed solved, and then she just built it in spreadsheets. So she started with the market very much so.\n\nJen Abel (00:22:00):\nAnd I think product market fit when you start with the market first, it's accelerated. But I will say this, I think that it's also capped on the upside. Because you're starting with the market versus the air table and the figma, which started with the technical insight and has uncapped upside. But one is certainly riskier than the other. Starting with a product is a hell of a lot riskier. And this is where I come back to so many people will say, how did you get funding and not know who your market is? And it's like, because if they do find it, that's a really, really, really big win. Versus I think if you start with the market first, you could potentially get a good win but is it more capped?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:47):\nInteresting.\n\nJen Abel (00:22:48):\nI don't know, it's just a thought. I was staring at your grid for so long, I was like, there's something here. And I kept coming back to those were more like I kept breaking it down to market versus product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:01):\nYeah, I love this. I think there's definitely something there. There's also horizontal versus a very specific problem you're solving.\n\nJen Abel (00:23:06):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:07):\nOkay, so you mentioned clay and you kind of nerd sniped me there of just what tools do you find useful? And it makes me think about finding leads, which is kind of going backwards through the sales process, but it might be okay, so maybe let's spend time there. Just like what do you recommend to founders to find the good leads? Glengarry Glen Ross good leads.\n\nJen Abel (00:23:28):\nSo I say before you buy any tool, don't even think about tools. I feel like people turn everything into this complicated mess with all of the tools that they start integrating. And then they're engineers, I get it. So now they start to engineer these sales tools together and then they blast their market, and now they have 5,000 notes out in one day and their domain takes a hit. So I think before you even overthink about the tools right now, can you manually find 30 people that you want to spend 15 to 20 minutes writing a rock solid note to? Are there 30 people that you are deeply excited to learn from, that you are willing to invest 15 to 20 minutes to write a really thoughtful note? Let's just start there. So some questions. One, are they even discoverable? How hard is it to find 30 people?\n\n(00:24:21):\nWhat have you noticed across those 30 people? Are there any interesting insights? Maybe it's the size of the team they work on, maybe it's the industry they're in, maybe it's the length of time they've been in their role, maybe it's their previous roles in their career. Are there some commonalities? There's always some level of a commonality usually in most cases. Okay, so now you're starting to collect some parameters. Just by doing this exercise, you're starting to collect some parameters around who you want to learn from and sell to. Now if you send out those 30 notes and you wrote them specifically, and you spend good quality of time on it. And you've hit them on email, you've hit them on LinkedIn, maybe even tried to call them, maybe you've sent them a Twitter DM, pulled out all the stops. How many people respond? 1, 5, 0?\n\n(00:25:15):\nIf it's zero, it begs the question, do you now want to do another 30 in a very similar fashion? Do you want to change the messaging a little bit? Now it forces these natural experiments. Or do you want to maybe go after a different role? So it forces you to answer these questions in a very manual way before you even think about integrating and spending time on tools. And then you get to a point where it's like, okay, now I'm starting to get some learnings and now I've realized, okay, it's this group of people, I've spoken to maybe two or three, now I want to go out and actually build a campaign to now talk to the next 10 to 15 people in that group. Truncate this as much as you can because I think people focus so much on volume in the beginning.\n\n(00:26:06):\nEven if you're selling down market, mid market, enterprise, volume comes once you've identified it and know the parameters. Parameters then allow you to do really strong enrichment with a clay. You now know the types of questions to give it. If you're not asking it the right questions, these enrichment tools, these sales tools will yield nothing. So it all comes back to even before you start your sales call, you need to make sure you're asking the right questions with am I even engaging, or do the people that I want to learn from or sell to, am I even messaging them in the right way? Are they even the right person? And the only way you can do that is by actually truncating these little experiments.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:49):\nI love how tactical that is. And what I love is even one of your nuances you mentioned is can you even find them? This gives you a signal of how are... You're going to have to have hundreds of these, thousands of these eventually. If 30 is hard or impossible, you're in trouble already.\n\nJen Abel (00:27:06):\nTotally. And it was funny, I was talking to someone today that said they had a target segment of high net worth individuals that they wanted to go out and serve. I'm like, how do you find those people? I guess when you get to a certain level, your net worth may be public. I don't know. That stuff's very hard to have certain parameters that are undiscoverable. And then if they're undiscoverable and it requires you getting on a call to understand if they are a fit, that does impact conversion rates. Not necessarily in a bad way, but now you need to kind of bring that back into the math equation, which is like, okay, if I speak to 10 people, I know two out of these 10 will be qualified. But I don't know which of those two out of 10. Well, that means you probably need more of those numbers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:52):\nSo to quickly recap a few of the key things that I've written down as we're talking. So if you're just trying to figure out who to reach out to, make a list of 30 potential prospects that you think are good fits, that would be excited about what you're building. Spend 15 to 30 minutes writing them each an email. Do these emails have to be really short the way you described previously?\n\nJen Abel (00:28:12):\nI would say the shorter the better, but would you respond to that? If you got this email, would you respond it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:17):\nGot it.\n\nJen Abel (00:28:17):\nOne of a great little tactical test is on Gmail, you can highlight the message and then have it replay it back to you from an audio perspective.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:28):\nOh wow.\n\nJen Abel (00:28:28):\nYou'd be shocked how many notes I've changed when it replays it back and I'm like, oh, that sounds really passive-aggressive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:34):\nInteresting. And so you also shared the structure for how to reach out to folks. So let me just share that again. And that applies to this initial email too, but it sounds like as you automate, you want to make it more precise and focused and not... Basically they're not as customized as you start reaching out to more folks.\n\nJen Abel (00:28:53):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:54):\nSo start with something, here's why this is relevant to you. You're looking for salespeople in this market. Here's something that's unexpected or surprised, like zero to one salespeople don't exist. Keep it short and then I always forget the last one.\n\nJen Abel (00:29:14):\nFocus on the problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:16):\nFocus on the problem.\n\nJen Abel (00:29:17):\nYou don't even need to talk about the solution. That's the big takeaway, which is if you get any sales email, you get what's the primary focus of that email? It's usually like here's what we do. But I bet if someone reached out to you with a novel insight and said, I'm really passionate about solving this problem, if it's something you're focused on, you'd probably reply.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:39):\nIf it's a big problem. If it's like, oh yeah, you're so right, I need this.\n\nJen Abel (00:29:42):\nThe beauty with the American market, and I say this because we do a little bit of work with international startups too, is if something doesn't feel right, people love to complain about it. And it's like use that to your advantage. Get that intel.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:54):\nA note that I just looked at, that I wrote down, that I think is very important is avoid using \"this is better\" as your pitch.\n\nJen Abel (00:30:01):\nYeah, yep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:02):\nDifferent. Here's something shocking about what we're doing. Here's something that'll surprise you.\n\nJen Abel (00:30:07):\nYeah, or counterintuitive. Exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:08):\nCounterintuitive.\n\nJen Abel (00:30:09):\nYeah, it's interesting. I spoke to a good friend that leads procurement at a massive organization. And he said to me, he goes, \"One of the worst things someone can say to me is we're better than X product. Then I ask them to define that. And then I ask them, okay, how do we measure that? And then I say, okay, should we give this company another year to give them this feedback before we make this huge transition and disrupt momentum?\" Yeah, better is a dangerous place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:40):\nI invest in a bunch of startups and I find it's impossible to get anyone to care if things are good enough with what they got today. I'm happy not using the best possible product if my life is okay. And I have so many other things I got to do, I'll just deal with this good enough solution for now.\n\nJen Abel (00:30:57):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:59):\nOkay, amazing. So we talked about how to figure out who to go after, how to pitch them to get them to want to talk. The next step I imagine is you're on the phone with them trying to convince them to actually care. What do you do there? How do you get them to engage further?\n\nJen Abel (00:31:15):\nOne is you need to be vulnerable. You're an early stage startup, okay. The market, we're at a point now where the market is smart. I always assume that the buyer I'm speaking to is highly educated and knows way more than I do. So just have that perception because what I've learned is a lot of the market will play dumb, and you can get yourself caught pretty quickly. So when you speak to them, I would be very open and honest with where you are. Hey, I'm an early stage startup. We are deeply passionate about solving this specific problem. We have a lot to learn. Here's how we are thinking about it from a problem priority perspective. Can we gain your insight into how this problem is manifesting on your side? And then let them open up. Now you have them one, talking about the problem. Now you're getting the intel about their perception of the problem, and is it even a problem? When you say you're early stage and there's still a lot to be done, it is easier to be honest.\n\n(00:32:20):\nIf you tell them you have a fully baked, ready to go product, they're not going to give you honest feedback. It's very hard to say to a founder and look them in the eyes and say, hey, we built this product, can I show you what it is? You're just going to get someone that's going to say, oh, this is great, this is wonderful. But when you're vulnerable and when you tell them it's not fully built yet, even if it is, you will get more raw and honest feedback. Because it is easier to tell someone, hey, before you make this mistake, I actually don't care about that. If you've already built it, they're not going to give you that feedback. So the further you suggest you are, you're actually going to hamstring a lot of the intel, hamstring yourself on gaining a lot of the intel. So that's one counterintuitive thing that I think a lot of founders don't realize.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:07):\nThis episode is brought to you by Paragon, the developer platform for building native customer-facing integrations with third-party apps. Our native integrations on your product roadmap, whether it's to ingest context from your user's external data and documents, or to sync data and automate tasks across your user's other apps, integrations are mission-critical for B2B software products today. But building these integrations in-house cost an average of three months of engineering according to the 2024 state of integration survey, which results in difficult roadmap trade-offs. This is why engineering teams at Copy AI, AI21, and over 100 other B2B SaaS companies use Paragon, so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The results, they've shipped integrations seven times faster, all while avoiding the never-ending maintenance that comes with rolling your own integrations.

And her last book, it actually has the opposite advice, but I think I know why, which is she focuses on later stage companies and her advice is the buyer. She has this really interesting insight that it's harder to buy software now than to sell it, because there's so much to consider and your job is on the line if you make a mistake. It's easier just to be like, forget it, I'm just going to go with what we have today. I don't want to put my ass on the line for buying this new thing that someone's trying. And so her advice is you actually have to educate the buyer on the market and here's what's happening. Here's where things are going, and here's why I think this is the future. But I think again, I think that's focusing on later stage stuff.\n\nJen Abel (00:34:55):\nA hundred percent. And you raised such a good point, Lenny, which is late stage sales and early stage sales are very, very different. And I think that's where a lot of early stage founders get tripped up as they're taking late stage sales advice, usually coming from an investor. Or they've maybe hired a salesperson that's focused on more mature sales. But I think she's spot on. Buying is just as hard, if not harder, than selling right now. Because who wants to make a mistake and also who wants to go through switching costs? Oh, it's so painful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:30):\nYeah. I think the other really important point here that you're making is that part of this initial sales experience of founder led sales is not sell as much as you can. It's to learn what people want. And so I love that you're sharing here's how to get the best possible feedback, not necessarily close the most deals.\n\nJen Abel (00:35:47):\nTotally. And founder led sales is not about revenue on day one. It is about learning as fast as humanly possible to get to that pulse, so that you can earn the right to sell. There's this concept that I talk about, which is you're going out to run sales to collect the research, which is what founder led sales is. And then you have sales for revenue, which is that post founder led sales stage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:13):\nAnd your milestone that you suggested of how far to take founder led sales, you said around a million ARR, right?\n\nJen Abel (00:36:20):\nYeah. I think it's about, some people say 500, some people say a million. I think if you get to 500K really, really fast, then I think absolutely you can move out of it. If you get to 500K really, really, really slow, you might not want to get out of it right away. You haven't reached that velocity point yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:41):\nAwesome. I have a post that we'll link to that has actually numbers and when all these big startups move from founder led sales. It's in that same series about product market fit. There's two stories this makes me think of I'll share real quick. One is Sprig. They shared a story of first round capital at their first round and their partner there is just like, we will not let you hire a salesperson until you hit a million ARR. We're going to help you. We're going to have salespeople helping you through it, but we're not going to let you hire someone. And he was really happy about that. The other is Zip, which just raised a $2.3 billion valuation, a procurement company that I was lucky to be an investor in. And their first founder led sales motion was they just reached out on LinkedIn to heads of procurement, and just leaned into what you're saving more, which is we just want your advice on this product that we're building. Just tell us what problems you have. It was very advice oriented versus we want to sell you this thing.\n\nJen Abel (00:37:33):\nYeah, no, absolutely. I have this theory that maybe you shouldn't hire any salespeople until series A, right? Because seed is all about experimentation and proving out that experiment, and then obviously series A is about exploiting that learning. But I see so many people, I mean hiring for early stage sales is the odds are actually more against you than trying to get your next round of funding. Because it's truly, truly such a counterintuitive stage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:08):\nInteresting. Okay, so I kind of took us on a whole tangent. You were sharing advice on how to get someone excited. So the first is when you're engaging, you're talking to the prospect and company ABC. Your advice is be very honest and vulnerable about your stage. Tell them you're early stage. You're building this thing. You're deeply passionate about this problem. Here's what we're trying to do, here's our priority problem perspective, and where we're focusing, and kind of get their feedback on your approach. Cool. You were going to go to the next tip and I took us off course.\n\nJen Abel (00:38:44):\nTesting the questions to ask. Where is that aha unlock for you? But more importantly, where's that aha moment unlocked for them? Because when they start getting their gears churning in their head about, and this is the beauty about not having a product and not showing them anything, they're visualizing in their head now. This is a really powerful thing, which is like, so tell me how this looks in your head? How are you seeing this? And they're like, I don't know if I can see it. And I'm like, great, we'll show you that. Great insight to know by the way. Or so I think this is how, I guess this is how it would work. Walk me through what's living in your head right now. You pick up on so much and then all of a sudden they're like, wait a second, we've tried solving for this and it's still not solved for. Or you know what? We hired someone last year to manage this. Great understanding. Is it being measured? Is it being managed and have they tried to solve for it? The leading indicators that you're onto something here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:44):\nI love this thread because this is what everyone's always like, how do I know if I product market fit? There's these signals that you're talking about of signs that there's something here. Like a big enough pain point where they're excited to basically they want to pay for it, they will pay to solve a problem. So maybe just again, say the things you notice that are signs like, okay, you have something here.\n\nJen Abel (00:40:03):\nSo I think the first is it has to be a growing and widening problem. No one's going to spend time fixing a pretty fixed problem, because it's not necessarily really a priority anymore. It's maybe a pain in the butt, but it's not a priority if it's not growing or widening. So gate check one is like, what is the implication? Are you measuring? Are you managing this problem today? Yes or no? If they don't know, great to know. If they said no, okay, move on to the next. That's pretty powerful. No, we're not measuring or managing this. Okay, there's probably not much there. If it is being measured or managed, then the next question you want to get into is how have you tried to solve for it? Is it through that head count that you just hired? Is it through another tool? Is it just still an open gap because nothing exists yet to solve it? Just understand their maturity around how they've tried to plug it. These are all that make the secret moments in intel to close that gap.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:06):\nThat's awesome. And essentially it's showing you that there's a pain here that they're paying attention to and are trying to solve.\n\nJen Abel (00:41:14):\nAnd what you're psychologically doing is now you're flipping them into a buyer where they're like, wait a second, hold on. I need to bring on so-and-so on the next call, they also think that this is not good enough.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:26):\nThat's funny because that's exactly what Wiz noticed, is they moved from people being like, oh, this is cool. I like it, I like it. To, okay, I'm going to pull in this person. I'm going to pull in this person to talk about it and make sure we're... And they were pulling in other people exactly as you described it, because they wanted to move forward on this thing.\n\nJen Abel (00:41:44):\nAbsolutely. And that's when you know there's some momentum behind it, which is when they're bringing in other colleagues. Whether it be the potential users, if you're reaching out to the executive, or the users like, hey, I actually want to bring my boss on to the next call.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:57):\nGood sign. Cool. Anything else along these lines of how to get someone excited slash understand if there's going to be pull there?\n\nJen Abel (00:42:04):\nI guess the one thing is please, please, please do not ask questions like what keeps you up at night? If you had a magic wand, what are your pain points today? I can guarantee you that answer changes every single day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:19):\nThat's super interesting. Is there any tip for how to end one of these calls, as someone that's never done sales is like-\n\nJen Abel (00:42:23):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:24):\nOkay.\n\nJen Abel (00:42:25):\nGet the second call booked on the first call.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:28):\nLove it.\n\nJen Abel (00:42:28):\nPull up calendars. Look at calendars. Who else should be invited? It's just a natural evolution to ending the call.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:35):\nGreat. So that's in 30 minutes though, right?\n\nJen Abel (00:42:38):\nAnd if they say, ah, I'll email you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:42):\nI could say.\n\nJen Abel (00:42:44):\nThat's also kind of a leading indicator. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:46):\nSo do you recommend not getting off the call, trying to avoid that, or is it just-\n\nJen Abel (00:42:50):\nIf they won't give you time on the calendar, you could say, listen, great. Feel free to email me. Maybe they're just being honest and they don't have their calendar available, but nine times out of 10, it's usually I don't have the heart to tell you I'm not interested.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):\nYeah, it's hard. It's hard to tell people you're not interested. Very cool. Okay. This is amazing. Okay, so the next step, if I remember correctly, is kind of co-authoring and co...\n\nJen Abel (00:43:13):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:14):\nOkay, cool. Talk about that.\n\nJen Abel (00:43:16):\nIn the early, early days, one of the biggest ways you can get folks excited is it feels like it's going to be built specifically for them. The power of specificity, the power of being extremely focused. With that, you can literally turn a customer into a guide by asking them to co-author the scope. The scope of work. The co-authorship piece is important for two reasons. It helps you understand where they're on their biomaturity. Let me explain. If they do not have an existing process or strategy to solve X problem, they can't buy a technology yet, which means you need to sell them. And this is why I go back to you need to sell them some form of a service, right? Why? You want to be the one in there educating. You also want to get the logo. You also want to show the revenue. While it's not recurring revenue, it still shows intent.\n\n(00:44:13):\nAnd I think that that's really important. Every founder I speak to is like, well, my investor really doesn't want service-based revenue. That's fine. But then you can also tell your investor, great, should I wait 18 months to when they're ready to buy a solution, and be the one that's not the one selling them because someone else educated them? These are all of the implications of waiting. So yes, is service-based revenue great? No, we all know why it's not great. But it's great in the sense that it shows intent. It's great in the sense that you can call them a customer. It's great in the sense that now you can use their logo. And it's great in the sense because you are getting paid to educate them. You are getting paid to help them design their process. This is where all the power lives. And this is why so many AI startups a year and two years ago were going in on services contracts, because they wanted to set the mindset with the buyer around what this would look like.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:07):\nIs there anything you recommend to time box contain the services piece? Because I know a lot of companies-\n\nJen Abel (00:45:12):\nYes, such a great point, Lenny. You absolutely need to time box this. I would time box it as 90 days and then what you can say in the next 90 days, we'll scope where we are and what you need. Scoping out more than 90 days, listen, so much is going to change. You might also not want to do it anymore, so you don't want to lock yourself up. So I would look at 90 day increments. A specific example. We had a founder that my colleague was working with, and they were selling a very specific technology to a non-traditional... Sorry, a very traditional industry. I don't want to be two bleeding with what it is, but a very traditional industry that's not used to working with startups, or necessarily plugging in a new technology right away. And they were very honest. They said, listen, we haven't changed vendors or partners in over five or six years.\n\n(00:46:04):\nI actually don't even know how we would do that today. Could you come in and explain to us, understanding where our workflow is and how we would integrate this, before we even consider the technology? Which we did. We got paid a nominal amount, but we're now a customer and now we get to set the stage for how they think about this. And then they won the technology contract. But everyone is so focused on selling the technology really, really, really quickly. That works in markets that know how to buy that technology, have a process in place, have a strategy in place, have an implementation team in place.\n\n(00:46:40):\nIf it's a new technology like AI right now, they need a strategy and process like who's the human in the loop? Is it them or is it you? How do we measure success? What does success look like? What risks should we be aware of? Our legal team's not even aware of all these risks. You want to be careful because legal can immediately, and procurement, can shut these things down if it seems too novel, where it's foreign versus they're so used to buying services, especially at market. It's their largest budget line item.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:10):\nSo it's interesting because most founders are very afraid of moving into services. I hadn't heard this advice before.\n\nJen Abel (00:47:15):\nProbably going to get slapped for saying all this stuff, by the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:17):\nWell, so along those lines, what percentage of companies that you've worked with or see do that or have to do that step?\n\nJen Abel (00:47:25):\nThis is going to be a shocking step. So I would 40 to 50% have to sell some form of service before they can sell a technology.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):\nWow. Of B2B SaaS company?\n\nJen Abel (00:47:36):\nA B2B SaaS. And this, again, this is specifically more top-down sales. But yeah, because the user and the buyer are different, which means there's user value, there's buyer value, there's all different players, there's procurement you have to go through. But yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:50):\nAnd just to make it even clearer, what's an example of a service that you've seen company offer in a step?\n\nJen Abel (00:47:55):\nSo I've seen, hey, can you come in and actually help me pitch this, design a custom pitch to my boss as to why we should do this today? And we literally got paid to build a sales pitch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):\nSo it's not necessarily providing a service. It could be just helping them sell this.\n\nJen Abel (00:48:15):\nYeah. It could be helping them sell in a way that makes you... You need to get a lot more context on their business. It can also be, hey, we haven't actually thought about a process for how we can actually deploy something like this. We're currently using this technology, which we want to change from. You've kind of hit this at the right time. How would we implement or how is it best to integrate with this tool? Can we get both of you guys in a room to map this out?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:43):\nGot it. So it's like consultants almost, like coming in to help you solve this problem.\n\nJen Abel (00:48:47):\nIt's a great point. It's consulting them towards the acquisition of the product. It's not consulting as one-off consulting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:53):\nGot it. And they know that obviously you're biased, but they also want the problem solved. And they're like, great, you're going to help us solve this problem, because it's on my plate and I need your help convincing leadership that this is-\n\nJen Abel (00:49:04):\nAnd I need to craft the storyline as to why we need to do it anyway, so I will pay you to do it, but here's the format it needs to be in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:10):\nFascinating. Wow. Okay. Anything else along those lines?\n\nJen Abel (00:49:15):\nAnd then of course, if you're in a position to actually sell the technology, because the market is able to acquire and adopt it and not have to create a new strategy or process, then obviously sell the technology. You don't need to be selling services.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:26):\nI want to come back real quick. The previous call, I wrote this note down as you were talking. You recommended not doing a demo and just talking about it broadly.\n\nJen Abel (00:49:34):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:34):\nIs that your advice there?\n\nJen Abel (00:49:36):\nOn the first call. Yeah. On the first call, my fundamental belief is that the demo is a bit of the only carry you control in the sales process, right? Once they see it, it's kind of like pitching an investor. Once they take a look under the hood, that dreaminess in their eyes, they're like, oh, I saw it. So leave them wanting more. And the demo is that, leave them wanting more. Even when you do a demo, don't demo everything. Leave it for a second call. Let them invest a lot of time in you. Again, if it's qualified. Preface that, if it's qualified. But everyone races through the sales process like let's do a demo call as quickly as humanly possible.\n\n(00:50:20):\nYes, that is important down market. That is important if you're selling a $3,000 tool, you absolutely want to be demoing as fast as humanly possible because it's a high-volume game. Upmarket, when you're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, you want to slow that down as fast as possible. Because you want to, one, make sure all of the right people are in the room. As soon as there's one lead on this, and if it requires other people involved, it doesn't feel like anyone else's baby. So you want it to make it feel like the group's baby versus this one individual's baby because it's very quick. Someone can easily say, I'd rather use this tool. And then there's this stalemate of nothing happens.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:55):\nJust to maybe reiterate, so far we've talked about figure out who to talk to, pitching them on talking to you, then having that first conversation. Maybe there's another conversation in there to get them excited. And then there's just getting them past the finish line, keeping everyone aligned. Is that roughly the next step or how should we think about this?\n\nJen Abel (00:51:14):\nYeah, so if you are selling upmarket and you now need to go to procurement, who is the group involved in the bot. They're the professional buyers. Procurement is a very interesting function. They are very smart, very, very smart. They do this for a living. They are professional buyers. So there's a couple things that you need to be aware of. You need to sell them as well. You need to really make this sound... Don't over complicate it. Don't add in jargon. Make it feel like, okay, I can wrap my head around this. The second piece is it's got to feel different from anything else out there. Because the professional buyer, it's much easier to say, wait a second, we have these 17 other preferred vendors that do similar ish work. Why don't you just go use one of them? Because, oh, by the time this gets through procurement, it could be another three to four months.\n\n(00:52:05):\nI've seen deals die on the vine because procurement actually suggested they go use another vendor in the system, that this buyer wasn't even aware of, because they didn't differentiate. It didn't feel different. It just felt slightly better. That's how it was positioned. The third piece is when you get to procurement, you're going to have to do all the work. Make their job easy. You are probably a very small piece into the very large deals that a lot of these people buy. So you can get easily sidelined just because you're just a small buy. So do the work for them. Literally say, I want to make this as easy as possible for you. Give me the forms that you need to fill out. I'll fill them out for you, and you can do it yourself. You can edit them. Do the lift for them. If you don't, it's so easy for it to just go there and die.\n\n(00:52:55):\nAnother piece that's important with procurement is explaining exactly what you do and don't do. Because if you say you do a bunch of things and they can't really place you, they're going to send you to the kitchen sink of contracting an MSA, which is going to ask you for $5 million in an insurance policy and all sorts of other things. And the ability to look at your book at any point in time. And the reason they did that is because they can't classify you. So the easiest thing to do is classify you as high risk. So make it easy for them, make it simplified. You can also truncate your contracts, meaning let's say IT is maybe, and you want to ask this, how long does it take to get through IT due diligence? They might say, oh, it's a 90-day backup, it's a 60-day backup, it's a 30-day backup.\n\n(00:53:43):\nThere's no backup. If there's a backup, you also don't want it to die and you want it to give an incentive. So this is when you want to truncate contracts to a technology contract and a service contract. Service contract allows you to onboard them, get them prepped, come in and educate all of the users about what they're about to go through. So that then there's an incentive to get that technology piece through. There's all these little things to think about, and I think everyone... Getting to procurement is also creative. And knowing who you're dealing with and how to make their job as easy as humanly possible. Because what you said and what April said is spot on, which is buying is just as hard as selling.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:23):\nAs I'm hearing you describe this, I feel like we might be discouraging people from selling because this feels very not fun. All these steps, all these procurement work, anything you can say to get people to feel like, okay, this is worth it?\n\nJen Abel (00:54:35):\nYes, I can get people very excited by this. Once you are in, you are in. Once you are in, you are now a preferred vendor. You now have the ability to cross over into other business units. You are now the reason that, hey, if your competitor comes in, well, you got there first. So what do you think procurement's going to say? This is why it's so important to get into the enterprise as fast as humanly possible. While it's a headache to get through, if you project manage it, you'll be good. If you make an accountability, just like if you were to go through fundraising. If you are a part of a team that had to raise money, it's no different. There's always some level of due diligence. There's always you doing more of the work than them. That's just enterprise sales. But if you prove value, your hundred thousand dollars deal could be $500,000 next year. Your $500,000 deal could be a million dollars the following year.\n\n(00:55:36):\nThis is where stuff begins to compound, and this is where your growth journey really gets accelerated. So the beauty with enterprise is once you're in, you're in. You beat out your competitor for a short period of time. There is a little bit of a moat there, but it's not forever. You all have intel that no one else will have. Meaning you're a part of the conversations, you have the badge, you can join the meetings, you can ask for introductions. They'll do it. It doesn't feel like sales anymore. You're now a partner. This is why it's so powerful to get into the enterprise because there's so many compounding effects. If you put the effort in on the sales side, the return is insane.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:20):\nThat was awesome. Nailed it. I'm excited. Just for folks that are listening, just to calibrate what size of company you're talking about selling to here, what's the size of the advice you've been sharing so far? Roughly?\n\nJen Abel (00:56:33):\nSo I've been talking a lot about enterprise sales, which is I would say anywhere north of 500 to a thousand employees. Just mental model. I'm talking about enterprise sales specifically because there's so much nuance involved in it, because the user and the buyer are very different, right? As you go down market, let's talk about small business for a second. The user and the buyer are the same person. There's no procurement. If they like what you've built, it's pretty straightforward process. In the mid-market, mid-market is a funky place because you either are anchoring towards the lower end of mid-market, which is more upper end of small business, or you're anchoring towards lower end enterprise. Those are two very different divides. So mid-market, just if you're talking about lower end enterprise, again, this is all relative. If you're talking about lower end small business, again, your user and the buyer probably are the same person, which makes sales a lot more streamlined.\n\n(00:57:31):\nBut churn. Small business, challenge with small business is the churn. If they get pissed off, if they don't feel like it's good enough, they are gone faster than you don't even realize. And they might even tell you. They'll just cancel. And we always see this on Twitter. They'll call American Express and say, cancel these charges. I don't want to talk to these people anymore. They're just more irrational because sometimes maybe it's their money if they're a small business. So small business in mid-market, while sales is a bit faster, you really got to be on the product market fit side, worried about churn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:07):\nAnd they also go out of business at a higher rate.\n\nJen Abel (00:58:07):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:07):\nAnd so you have that kind of churn.\n\nJen Abel (00:58:12):\nA churn piece too. Yeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:14):\nAmazing. Okay. What comes next? So we're kind of in procurement at this point.\n\nJen Abel (00:58:19):\nOkay, so now we're at signature, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:21):\nOkay.\n\nJen Abel (00:58:21):\nOkay. So as you enter procurement, okay, you want to know before you get to the next stage, who is signing this deal? Here are some examples of signers I've seen. Chief financial officer, chief legal officer, the business unit head themselves, the head of procurement. You want to know who that person is so that you can literally say to the head of procurement, hey, listen, I want to make sure this person has everything they need when they review this, to know what they're signing. Who is it and how can I give you a few bullets to share that you can maybe respond to, that we get tight so that they know exactly what they're looking at?\n\n(00:58:59):\nThis was two or three years ago, I was involved in getting a deal over procurement that was just truly, it was a pharmaceutical company and it was very, very long process. And we got to the finish line and the CFO was the signature. And this is when I made the mistake. CFO responds back to the procurement lead who sent it to the business unit, who sent it to me and was like, what am I signing? I don't actually understand what these people are doing and why are we doing this?\n\n(00:59:32):\nSo then she quickly said to me, hey, listen, we need to defend this. Can you put together some bullets? And I'm like, well, what kind of bullets do I need? What does this person care about? And again, it created so much anxiety and now I'm back in the bottom of the queue. Probably he or she's looking at the things that come in in an order of priority. So now I've elongated this by another month simply because I didn't plan. So this is just to say I'm learning from my own mistake of know who the signature is, because if they don't know what they're looking at, they're going to kick it out and you're going to lose your queue spot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:06):\nSo many ways to fail. And this was you selling Jellyfish or this was you working with a company?\n\nJen Abel (01:00:11):\nThis was me helping [inaudible 01:00:15].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:15):\nOh man. Okay. Anything else in that step that might be helpful to folks?\n\nJen Abel (01:00:19):\nYes. One thing to caveat is you do not get paid until you are approved by finance, and procurement has a signature on the contract. Meaning don't start any work. Or if you do start work, know that there is no payment. The business unit can't just pay you. It's paid through a purchase order, which is paid through by finance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):\nSo don't rely on that money unless it's finally, unless the signature's on the paper. Quick tangent, thoughts on discounting at any parts of the journey?\n\nJen Abel (01:00:54):\nIf there is a reason as to why. So discounting just to get the deal over the line, you're negotiating with yourself. Unless they ask for it and then ask them to defend it. Certain segments, like small business, you should leave a little bit of room for buffer because sometimes that's their own money. It's like their own small business. Mid-market and enterprise, there's got to be a reason why and ask them. Be like, hey, so if I give you a 30% discount, can I remove 30% of the value? You can kind of play it a little bit like that. I don't recommend it, but that's kind of what they're saying. But discounting is great if they're doing something for you far and beyond. For example, if they're a design partner, if they're going to be a reference for two years, if they're going to give you something far beyond just using the technology, then yeah, I think a discount is a good reason to give back to somebody that's giving to you, but not as a strategy to get a deal done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:57):\nOkay. Is there anything beyond this step of getting the signature? Are we done?\n\nJen Abel (01:02:01):\nYeah. I hope you celebrate because-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:03):\nOkay, great. You got a signature from this whole process.\n\nJen Abel (01:02:08):\nYeah. Hopefully I'm not making this sound too daunting. I'm just really trying to lay out all the mistakes I've made.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:12):\nYeah, no, this is exactly what people need. This is amazing. And your pep talk was really helpful too. Along the way. What's the general timeline for sales process like this in your experience, with these 500 plus ice companies?\n\nJen Abel (01:02:26):\nSo there's three things that dictate sales cycle. One is how well are you project managing it? For example, I'll say, let's have our second or third call in two weeks. Two weeks? Do a week. Why are you elongating this? Keep your calls as tight as possible because that shortens your sales cycle. The second is just how complex the organization is. If you're dealing with a highly regulated industry, just know it's going to take a bit longer, sometimes 20 to 30% longer. So a highly regulated industry, nine to 12 months on conservative, on the conservative side. Again, it's tricky because is there a budget line item dictated towards it yet, or are you creating budget? How painful is the problem? And how senior have you gone? If you're talking to the SVP or chief of whatever, they're pretty good at about being able to navigate the traps.\n\n(01:03:28):\nIf you're dealing with a director or mid-level person, they maybe have not purchased something before and just make some internal mistakes. I always say it can range anywhere. I've seen enterprise deals close in 90 days, believe it or not. Rare, but I've seen it. I've also seen enterprise deals typically take anywhere between six and 12 months. Really important but. Enterprises know that the process and the length to get the deal done is what costs more than the technology itself. Meaning the effort it takes to get through their system. That's why they're willing to spend so much. Sometimes that's actually more expensive than the technology itself. So don't negotiate with yourself, understand the value you're delivering, but don't be crazy. I've seen people try and go in with a million dollar deal as a seed stage startup. Oh, interesting thing. So interesting tactic. I've seen contracts in the enterprise that state that the deal cannot exceed more than 20% of the existing revenue.\n\n(01:04:39):\nSo there are these things just to be aware of. In most cases, you can ask them be like, is that a hard line? Is that hard, hard line? Or how negotiable is that? Sometimes it's negotiable. Sometimes it's like, no, this is a hard rule. But then it seems silly because you take a hundred thousand dollar deal and bring it down to 20,000. It's just be careful that you're stripping some of the value out. But I kid you not. I've seen an enterprise deal go from, it lands at 60 and it turns into 280,000 in four months. So again, I want to encourage, yes, this is a lot of work, but the payoff is exponential.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:19):\nWhat's a good ACV to start with if you're trying to sell to enterprise, to make it all worth it for your startup?\n\nJen Abel (01:05:25):\nI would say anywhere between 50 to 200K depending on the business unit you're selling to. That's kind of like sweet spot. They're used to something in that realm.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:35):\nAnd this is a startup selling [inaudible 01:05:38].\n\nJen Abel (01:05:37):\nEarly stage startup, like founder led, early stage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):\nInitial contract. Wow.\n\nJen Abel (01:05:43):\nYep. Initial contract. I would say, okay, probably caters more towards like 50 to 100K. But I've seen people sell to... Again, it's how big is the problem? Who are you selling it to? Is it the SVP that you started with and they've got a large budget, and it's a pretty healthy business unit? Or are you selling to a director?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:05):\nIf you're not able to sell your product at that price? What's your advice to teams?\n\nJen Abel (01:06:10):\nIf you are a startup, I always ask the founder, did you build this for the enterprise and is that the model you want to play? Or did you build this for small business? Small business is a marketing game. Marketing intensive activity, right? It's high velocity, high volume, lots of dials. It's a very different game than enterprise. So which game do you want to play? Let's just start there. Which game is more attractive to the founder. Or who is more exciting to serve? What's the storyline you want to tell investors? That plays a lot of it into it too. And do you have an enterprise product? Are you solving an enterprise problem or do you think you're solving an enterprise problem but you're not sure yet?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:53):\nAnd your point is also mid-market is it's rarely to be successful.\n\nJen Abel (01:06:57):\nIt's hard to start there because you're straddling two very different go-to-markets, right? One that's of high value, one that's of high volume. And also mid-market companies, this is where a lot of people don't... If it requires heavy integration, they don't have those resources. That's usually outsourced to an Accenture or some of these consulting firms, and now you're having to rely on third parties to be involved. It gets messy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:25):\nThis is fascinating. I have a list of questions from the audience that you pulled from Twitter. You asked on Twitter what questions to ask you as you're coming on here. So there's one that's very related to this, which is someone said, if you're still very early in pre-product market fit, but get initial validation from both small to medium businesses and enterprise, how do you decide which one to focus on? Is there a counter argument against starting or SMB going up market over time like most companies do?\n\nJen Abel (01:07:51):\nI've seen companies successfully do in both of those motions. Truthfully. We know all of those. We know people that started small business and worked their way up into enterprise and were successful. We've seen people be really successful by starting at the enterprise, like a Wiz. That's more of an internal question, which is like, who did you build this for? Where's the problem most felt and which go-to-market game do you want to play?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:15):\nAnd I think that latter part is so important. It sounds like why should it be what I want? It's like what's going to make a big business? But I think people forget, this is going to be your life for 10 years. Do you want to be selling to enterprises and building all the enterprise features? Would you prefer to build for small companies? Pros and cons to both but it's important to think about the life you're creating for yourself and your team.\n\nJen Abel (01:08:36):\nA hundred percent. And I built my career in enterprise sales, upper-end mid-market enterprise sales, and yeah, that's just the game I know the best.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:46):\nYeah, that's also an important part of it. Just to double down on that is like what do you have experience doing? Not like...\n\nJen Abel (01:08:52):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:53):\nYeah. Where's the opportunity? Okay. Another question that I love is, and we touched on this initially, but I think it's good to come back to this. Someone said, customers are fascinated with what we're offering from the initial calls, but responsive momentum is too slow from their end. Would be great to know how to fix this.\n\nJen Abel (01:09:10):\nYeah, it's tough because unless you're in the weeds to understand why. I'll give you a few examples that it could be. Did you speak to a buyer who now is trying to sell this up to their boss, and it's just getting sidelined and they don't know the executive value? They've just been selling the buyer value the whole time. That's one reason things can slow down. Another reason things can slow down is you haven't really framed the problem well and they don't understand the full implications of why they need to solve it. So it's kind of just sitting there a little bit. The third is they've just been really nice and it's not going to go anywhere.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:49):\nI guess that that's usually the latter. Was that true or it's kind of all over the place?\n\nJen Abel (01:09:54):\nIt's so hard to give a founder hard feedback. Because they've just dedicated their life to this thing. Who wants to be the bearer of bad news? And sometimes you just need to let the actions speak louder than words.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:11):\nWe've talked about all these steps. I'm curious, when you come to a founder or your team, where do you find the most on lock often? Which of the steps of the sales process do you find the biggest opportunity to improve conversion in sales?\n\nJen Abel (01:10:25):\nIt's qualification. Qualification because if you spend your time on the wrong leads, that equates to a zero. So if you don't get that first level right, let me put it this way, everyone that I know says they have a bottom of funnel problem. It's never a bottom of funnel problem. It's a top of funnel problem. I've actually never seen a bottom of funnel sales problem. It's always qualification, which is a symptom of not reaching out to the right person, not having the right messaging, not solving the right problem, or not being different enough.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):\nI love this. So basically the biggest pitfall people fall into, in your experience, is they're just talking to the wrong people, wasting their time?\n\nJen Abel (01:11:15):\nYeah. Talking to the wrong people or using the wrong message or...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:20):\nPitching them something they can't actually deliver.\n\nJen Abel (01:11:23):\nYeah. Here's the other thing too. Sales is supposed to feel fun for the buyer. They should be like, this feels fun. This person's invigorating. They're going to change my world. They're going to make me see things differently. They're going to get me promoted. They're going to help me increase my influence internally. And so many salespeople are so boring. How many times have you got off a call and you're like, I can't wait to get off this call? And founders too, just like all of a sudden their passion, they go like stone cold face. And it's like bring the passion. Bring the energy. That is felt by the market. Remember, some of these people are in boring jobs. Give them an outlet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:01):\nSo along those lines, I think a lot of people are just not... Like me included. I feel weird doing sales. It's a weird experience trying to convince someone to buy something. Is there any advice you could share to get someone over that hump?\n\nJen Abel (01:12:13):\nIf you have built something that you believe in. Very hard to sell something you don't believe in. I think everyone agrees that. If you've built something you believe in and they have a problem, that's a beautiful thing. Truthfully, that's what makes the world go around, is I have a solution to your problem. Now you just need make sure that the problem, you just need to be honest, that the problem they have, your solution truly can solve for. And you're not short selling just to get a logo and a deal over the line, and see them churn in six months or nine months or three months. That what you are selling is truly going to solve their problem. And be honest about it. I can't tell you enough when I tell someone, listen, I don't think I'm the right fit for you. They try and sell you on them.\n\n(01:12:58):\nThey're like, well, wait a second. Hold on. What if we did this, this, and this? And it's like, no, no, no. Here's what we're great at. And then they can say, well, I also need that too. And all of a sudden, this level of trust comes out. And trust is the number one currency in sales. If you are a trusted salesperson, people will recommend you all day and every day. If you're a trusted founder, your market will continually send you leads and word of mouth. So don't try and sell something just to prove to investors you sold something, because it'll be quickly seen on the other side when they churn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:32):\nAmazing. Okay, Jen, so I'm going to cut the lightning round. I know you also have to run and do real work. So let me give you a chance just to talk about what you do, how you help companies in case folks can find value in working with you.\n\nJen Abel (01:13:44):\nDeeply passionate about sales, as I'm sure you can tell. We specifically help founders through this pain. Navigating enterprise sales, mid-market sales, and really trying to crack that first million of ARR. Or sometimes even that first 500K of ARR if they move fast enough. And it is really hard. It's counterintuitive to what most people think, but it can be really, really fun when we show you the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:13):\nAnd you described to me how it works, and I think it's important to clarify this. You basically embed with the team and help them do this.\n\nJen Abel (01:14:19):\nYes. So I fundamentally do not believe in outsourcing the heartbeat of the organization, which is sales. So what we do is we embed alongside the founder and drive a lot of the execution, but make sure that they are the tip of the spear engaging directly with their market, and learning directly from the market's mouth, not playing this game of telephone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):\nAmazing. And I mentioned this when we were chatting, but I think of it again, is when I was interviewing all these companies about how they started selling early on. One of the interesting threads that I heard again and again, is how many of them hired a coach or a consultant as a founder to help them learn to do sales. And that's essentially what you do. And I didn't even know a service like this existed, so this is super cool. It'll point people to what you do. I also have to ask you, the question I ask everyone at the end is just, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJen Abel (01:15:08):\nHelp each other out. I think so many people have helped me in my career, and in this journey, that the pay it forward model that exists in the technology space is so beautiful. So just don't let that die.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):\nBeautiful. Well, Jen, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJen Abel (01:15:32):\nLenny, this was awesome. Thank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:34):\nSo awesome. So excited for folks to hear it. I've learned a ton. Okay, I'll let you go.

You guys do this over here.\" When in fact, where you really learn where the challenges are, or the problems or the successes is by just being there with the people in the trenches on one of the things, whichever one seems hardest or most complicated. And so I try to do that as often as I can, and I found that I always learn a lot by going through that detailed exercise.\n\nLenny (00:00:32):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, for interview world-class product leaders and growth experts, to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Jeremy Henrickson. Jeremy is senior vice president of product at Rippling, where he leads the product and design teams. Previously, he was chief product officer at Coinbase where he oversaw 10 x growth of the product and engineering organizations and helped scale Coinbase during one of the craziest times in the crypto markets. In our conversation, Jeremy shares his lessons about maintaining velocity at scale, creating a culture of fast decision-making, the importance of product leaders going deep on a problem, and becoming world experts at their domain. What to look for in product managers you're interviewing, why relying on frameworks can be so detrimental to your success, why you may want to avoid MVPs and instead designed for the most complex use cases first, and tons more. Enjoy this episode with Jeremy Henrickson after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:27):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours.

Jeremy, welcome to the podcast.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:03:30):\nThank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:32):\nSo I've heard nothing but amazing things about you and I'm excited to learn from what you've learned from your experience at Rippling, at Coinbase, and all of the products and teams that you've built. And so thank you again for being here.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:03:45):\nYeah, super happy to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:46):\nSo I want to start with your time at Coinbase where you were chief product officer and you were chief product officer during maybe the craziest time in the crypto markets. It was I think 2016, 2018 when I was looking at the Bitcoin prices and it was like it went from a $1000 to $20,000 I think in a matter of months. So I'm curious, what was that experience like, and in particular, what was like leading a product team through that experience?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:04:11):\nThe strongest memories for me are during 2017 where crypto, which had kind of been at its nadir in early 2016 and slowly started climbing out, just kind of took off and became a real thing in the public consciousness. And Coinbase, which at the time had an exchange just like on-ramp and off-ramp from fiat to crypto and back experienced over the course of 2017 40 x growth in usage.\n\nLenny (00:04:39):\nThat's like a dream come true for a lot of people.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:04:42):\nNo, I mean it was both a dream and a nightmare and I was incredibly lucky to be working on it with a team of people that I could really trust and could stand shoulder-to-shoulder within the trenches. And it was a lot of learning about how you can rapidly scale systems over time and people like to trade crypto on Saturday mornings, so a lot of Saturday mornings just some new thing would break on the edges of the system and we need to get in there and work on it. And so it was just a lot of really incredible lessons about who you choose to work with and focus and making sure you have the right people in the room at the right time.\n\nLenny (00:05:25):\nOkay. So let's actually unpack a couple of those. So focus is really interesting and something people always talk about, but hard to actually do. I guess how did you keep the team focused? I imagine just everyone's getting rich all over the place in crypto.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:05:39):\nHuh.\n\nLenny (00:05:39):\nThings are breaking all the time, like how did you maintain focus on your team?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:05:43):\nWell, the first thing is you don't talk about people getting rich. It's a very technical, you talk about like its customers, it's their money, and number one, it had to be secure. So there's a guy named Philip Barton, a friend of mine now, and he is just this amazing security leader at Coinbase, and he was able to always put these decisions that we were making extremely quickly in context and say, \"Look, these are the kinds of decisions we can make and still have it be secure no matter how fast we need to move.\" And so security was always the number one thing. And then the second thing is focusing on both the kind of immediate nature of the issue. Hey, site is down or whatever, and resolving that, but also trying to set those in a context of where we need to go over the next six months. What are we actually shooting for? What do we believe the volumes are going to be? What's it going to take to have everything from a user experience to the deep back end of the product that what would actually work for them?\n\nLenny (00:06:41):\nWhat was maybe the biggest challenge as a product leader trying to keep people focused and everything on the rails as things were going 40 x?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:06:50):\nI think the biggest challenge was that in crypto there's just so much uncertainty in general, simple questions like, is Ethereum going to be a thing, are the subject of debate. And no one actually at the time had an answer to that question. Lots of really strong opinions and so you have to be able to have those debates because lots is going on, but then you have to be able to come out of those conversations with a clear kind of company point of view that you're all shooting toward. And while there may still be differing points of views and debates that happen on the margins, you go full speed toward this answer until you decide to go full speed toward a different answer. And I thought we were pretty successful at that at Coinbase and it wasn't always easy.\n\nLenny (00:07:32):\nMaybe just a last question there.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:07:34):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:07:34):\nLiving through a time like that, a lot of people are going through these periods of just intense work and it's like, holy moly, this isn't crazy stressful working, like incredibly long hours, but then you look back at those times, and end up being some most important meaningful periods of your career.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:07:50):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:07:52):\nI guess one is that, is that your experience too? And then two, I guess is there any advice for someone that's maybe going through something like that of just here's maybe the silver lining of being in a period like that?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:08:03):\nSo it's hard, right? It wasn't always easy. I had a new daughter who had been born just a few months earlier, really tough to balance those things, but I've always loved the rate of learning. And so it is those experiences I feel that have most sort of accelerated my own personal growth and personal learnings because it's in the crucible of things being hard. And so I think when people are going through those times, it's nice to take a step back and talk with friends or whatever about what's really going on and setting it in the context of, hey, three, four or five years now from now when we look back on this, you realize, wow. A, we did something amazing with that time. And B, we learned a lot and we were able to take that with us into whatever we were doing next after that.\n\nLenny (00:08:52):\nBefore our chat, I'd asked you what people ask you for advice most around, and you said that people often ask you for advice on how to maintain velocity at scale, which is something every founder and product leader is always striving to do. And so what have you learned and what do you tell people about maintaining and maybe even improving velocity as you scale?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:09:12):\nI think there's a lot of different answers here, and I think a lot of them are very specific to the nature of the business that someone's in, like different businesses can maintain velocity in different ways. I think there's kind of a universal truth that you want small teams with clear missions. Right? If there's 300 people trying to work on one thing, the just sheer communication challenges, Dunbar's number, all of those things come into play and it's really, really hard to act quickly. And so having smaller groups of people breaking down what is always a very, very large problem into sufficiently small bits that small groups can attack wholeheartedly and minimize horizontal communication, I think is the first thing. I think the second thing is that to the extent it's like a technology problem. The more you can bake into a clear platform, it reduces the decision-making complexity for everyone who's working on the domain part of the problem.\n\n(00:10:09):\nAnd so a clear like a platform with a clear interface [inaudible 00:10:12] easy to use in all the ways that both engineers and product people want it to be easy to use, simplifies the space in which people have to think about these problems. And that's not always easy. Platforms are not, you can't just write a platform and hope it's going to work for the products. It's very much an iterative thing, but the more one can invest in that and have the right kinds of people who are capable of doing that sort of both systems thinking and product thinking simultaneously, I think is really important. The third thing, just from a leadership point of view is diving deep. Right? It's very, very tempting to float up here as a leader and say, \"Hey, you take that hill over there, you guys do this over here.\" When in fact where you really learn where the challenges are or the problems or the successes is by just being there with the people in the trenches on one of the things, whichever one seems hardest or most complicated.\n\n(00:11:05):\nAnd so I try to do that as often as I can. And I found that I always learn a lot by going through that detailed exercise. And I think the last thing is it's just making sure that teams have the right distribution of experience and seniority. Sometimes you get a team started and the team is perhaps doing something that's zero-to-one and they're amazing at all this zero-to-one stuff.\n\n(00:11:28):\nAnd then two or three years later, those same people are trying to scale the product to millions of people and it turns out that A, they don't like that part of the job as much, and B, maybe they're not as good at it. So I think you [inaudible 00:11:40] constantly look at the team and make sure that a people are doing things that they love and if they're not like, Hey, we've tried this other thing instead and recalibrate the team and make sure the right kind of skill sets are there. And I found if you do all of those things and then have product leadership where we're saying this is what we need to do and very, very clear and precise on what needs to be done, then you can usually actually even accelerate over time because you bake more into this platform, it allows your engineers to do more with less, and that's always pretty amazing.\n\nLenny (00:12:07):\nOkay, let me dig into a couple of these. These are really great.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:12:10):\n[inaudible 00:12:10] please.\n\nLenny (00:12:12):\nSo with the small teams with clear missions, is there an example of that at Rippling or Coinbase where that was a really good example of this being true?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:12:20):\nOne example is maybe three years ago when I was just starting at the company, we decided that we needed to build a time and attendance product, lots of market demand for us and that we hadn't built it yet, something that many customers need. And so there were a bunch of ways we could have chosen to do that, but the way we did it was to say, look, let's find one engineer, really talented systems engineer who's actually capable of doing kind of product thinking and have Parker, CEO also spend time on it. And you start there and Sachit brought a few people on with him.\n\n(00:12:56):\nAnd those four people over the course of maybe nine months or so, built a time and attendance product. It was the only thing they were doing. They didn't have to worry about what was going on with our payroll product except to the extent they had to integrate with them a little bit. They didn't have to worry about what was going on with the benefits team or our IT products. They were monomaniacally focused on this one thing and then identifying the places where yes, you, there's connectivity to the rest of the suite, and that allowed them to move extremely quickly.\n\nLenny (00:13:24):\nHow much of that was Parker being on the team, helping them unblock everything versus being very small and focused?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:13:30):\nI think it was mostly small and focused. Obviously, Parker can do things and unblock them in the way that only a CEO can and that helps. But the thing is at Rippling, like we've now replicated that a dozen times. That's our model for starting new things. And so it can't just be him unblocking things, though he does unblock things. It's more that this pattern of having these small groups be able to do things and then being able to have go to those people, whether you're Parker or somebody else in the company, and be able to say, Hey, how are things going? Or are we working on the right things? Or let's see the latest designs for that thing and comment on it.\n\n(00:14:05):\nAll of those things can happen just at a much greater tempo than if you're trying to go three layers down into the org and do things. I think that's the other, maybe the key point here that everyone is exposed senior leadership, yes, we have a management structure because you have to, but that management structure does not interfere with the ability of anyone anywhere in the organization to look at what's actually happening. And that happens very directly.\n\nLenny (00:14:29):\nSo let's talk about that model you just described. So what is that model? So this is how you approach new products, and I know within Rippling there's many, many products and features we're going to talk about this. And you're saying that you have kind of an approach to adding a new business unit essentially, or a new product feature.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:14:42):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:14:43):\nWhat is that model roughly?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:14:45):\nYeah, so the model's quite simple. In the vast majority of cases, we realize we need to build something and we have the one-page view of what that is. And usually, we're lucky enough that the things we're building sort of exist in some form in the industry today, not in the differentiated way that we can build it, but time and attendance is an example. That's a well-known thing in the industry. There's whole companies that do only that, right? So we start there, we find a single engineer who is extremely entrepreneurial, understands what it means to operate at tempo, understands what it means to make decisions with low information, understands how to work very, very quickly with a design partner.\n\n(00:15:22):\nSo we have a design partner and we say, \"Look, come into Rippling, spend a few months getting to know the platform first of all. So go work on this other team, understand what's easy for them, what's hard for them, how the platform works, how other products have been built on top of this. Go talk with other people who founded products here and understand what their experience is so that you can learn from and iterate on it, get an opinion about your product, and then start building it.\"\n\n(00:15:48):\nAnd during this intervening time, they're also recruiting a team of usually 2, 3, 4 other engineers who kind of have that same zero-to-one mentality and they start building. And usually over the course of six to nine months, we can get a product from a blank sheet of paper to something that is launched or at least that we're using internally when we dogfood our stuff really heavily. And then it grows from there. And then sometimes when you launch one of these products, you get close to launch, you realize, hey, actually a team of five or six people can handle this product ad nauseam. Sometimes you have to bump it up. It's like, okay, this thing's about to go to production, there's all these other things to do, the team needs now needs to go from 4 to 15 or something like that. Really depends on the product, but that's the general life cycle and then you keep growing and scaling it.\n\nLenny (00:16:34):\nThat is fascinating. So just so I understand, you find a founder type to take the lead on a new idea and do you recruit them internally or you sometimes find them externally just to focus on this product?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:16:34):\nBoth.\n\nLenny (00:16:34):\nInteresting.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:16:34):\nBoth.\n\nLenny (00:16:46):\nOkay. And then you find a design partner for them to work with to figure out what exactly needs to be built. And is it idea pick one design partner or you try to encourage a few?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:16:57):\nUsually, it's one. So there's a designer, so we have a design-\n\nLenny (00:17:00):\nOh, design partner, meaning a designer, not a company that is like their partner in design.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:17:06):\nOh, no, no, no. Literally, somebody who knows Rippling's products, knows our component library, knows all of that stuff and is skilled and doing UX and interaction and visual design.\n\nLenny (00:17:19):\nGot it. Okay, design. Okay, cool. And then they basically with maybe a couple engineers, just that's the team that initiates a new product line and then launches it, and then as it scales, it maybe grows the team, maybe not.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:17:33):\nYep, that's right. And it's pretty ad hoc, but every couple of weeks or something like that, they're meeting with me or with Parker or whichever one of us is the DRI on it and giving feedback on the designs, having a critical life or like \"Oh man, if I were using this as a admin, a small company or an admin at a large company, how would I feel about this? Would this interface work for me?\" And so we were pressure testing it throughout that cycle and trying to get the balance of speed and comprehensiveness, right.\n\nLenny (00:18:03):\nThis reminds me you're also, I hear not a big fan of MVPs that you building products to further point. Is that true? And then if so, how do you think about the initial version of a product?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:18:16):\nFirst of all, I don't want to knock on MVPs. I think MVPs have their place extremely useful, particularly if you're literally the zero-to-one company that's never done anything before and you don't have clear market validation. I think in our case specifically for Rippling, a minimum viable product would do a disservice to both our customers and to the very team that was building it. And the reason I believe that is that when you design a minimum viable product, you're optimizing for speed. And in that set of optimizations, you are minimizing the deeper product thinking about what can fully differentiate our product based on not only existing kind of capabilities within our products and platform, but based on what it ought to do in the future.\n\n(00:19:03):\nAnd so it sort of limits product creativity, but worse, it leads to building the wrong thing technically, right? So if you're only thinking through the simple cases and you're an engineer and no one's pushing you on saying, \"Wait, what about that healthcare hospital administration case where it's mission-critical life,\" then you're going to make a different set of as architectural assumptions, and then you're going to build on those and you're going to build on those for six months, nine months a year, and you'll have dozens or 100s of assumptions built on top of those.\n\n(00:19:38):\nAnd it's extremely difficult to unwind those decisions once you've built them into the product. And therefore we believe very deeply it's like, sure, understand those simple cases. Understand if you're a two-person company, you don't need all of these other things. And what is the product going to look like for you to approach it but also understand what it would mean to have 10,000 people globally around the world with this ridiculously hard use case? What's the model that would support that? And let's make sure that as we're doing the technical and product design for this thing, that it accommodates that view, even if we're not going to support it in the first version, even if we make the product decision to say, \"Look, we actually don't need to handle that case right now.\" You still build the product in a way that's not going to prevent you from getting there in the future. And does that take a little more time? Sure, yeah. But does it save you time in the long run? Absolutely. Right. And so that's our approach.\n\nLenny (00:20:39):\nIs there an example that comes to mind of a product you build at Rippling or Coinbase of just, it could have been this really simple MVP and then ended up being like, no, we did the right thing by building it further along the spectrum.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:20:49):\nYeah. So I think a great example of this at Rippling is our global payroll product. We could have said, \"Hey, look, we just need to support this one country. We need to support, whatever, the UK,\" let's say. So we're going to copy all of our US stuff, just replicate it and change all the things to be UK-like. That would've been the fastest thing to do to dramatically oversimplify, but that's not what we did. What we did is we said, look, we need to launch a six countries and these are six super different countries that we want to look at. And they're going to have different requirements from an HRIS standpoint, from an employer of record standpoint, from how you pay global contractors, from how payroll works, and we're going to make a system that works for those countries. And there's lots of downstream implications for that.\n\n(00:21:39):\nBut what it means is that now our global payroll system, adding a country is, it's not easy, but it's a lot easier than it would've been if you had to continue to stamp out and replicate and then of course maintain all of these things that have very little underlying connectivity. And instead, what we have is 80% of the system is baked into our global payroll platform, and then the 20% is country-specific. And most of that specificity can be handled not by engineers who are very, very expensive to change things that are local specific, but instead can be configured by somebody that's in compliance, by somebody that's in legal that needs to get the right documents into the system. And all of that stuff can be handled by the system, which allows us to move much faster sort of going forward.\n\nLenny (00:22:27):\nI've heard you describe this kind of idea as you encourage teams to design for the most complex use case first.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:22:27):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:22:32):\nIs that kind of the instruction you give these teams?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:22:35):\n100%, many times. And so it's one of these things that until you're here, it's a really difficult thing to kind of grok because A, it's so counterculture to what the background that most people have come from. It's like, no, no, no, don't think about all those things. Just zoom in on this one case, use it as a wedge, and then grow from there. And this is one of the reasons that we have people, especially new people in these kind of founding roles, come in and spend a few months just absorbing the culture to really learn these lessons. And it's one reason that we're extremely high touch with kind of new products in their infancy to make sure that we just don't fall into that trap, right? Especially because simultaneously with doing this, we're like, \"Hey, but we need to ship this as fast as possible.\" Right? And so you want to get the balance of those two things right.\n\nLenny (00:23:17):\nSo when I think about Rippling, I think of you got the culture is to do things the hard way and the right way. And an element of that is there's this concept that I've heard that Rippling is this compound startup? What does that term mean? And then how does that approach impact the way you build product and organize teams and all the things you were just talking about of MVPs and build new products?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:23:40):\nThe idea of a compound startup for us is that we're basically a lot of businesses that all work together. If you think about the products we offer, we have payroll, well, there's entire companies built just on payroll, insurance, and benefits, entire companies. That's our entire life. In fact, a fragment of benefits is the entire life cycle of a whole company. Our IT products, device management, and identity management, time and attendance, each of these things are industries into themselves with multi-billion dollar companies serving each of them. The insight Parker had before he founded the company was actually the result you get that when you have that is that there's all this data that gets replicated and copied and as impossible to keep in sync everywhere. The right answer is to have a single system of record, one place, one database where all of that information is resident so that each of these downstream systems can always have the right data at the right time.\n\n(00:24:34):\nAnd then you can build on top of that things like workflow and reporting and analytics and permissioning and all these kinds of underlying capabilities. So the idea of a compound startup is all of these different businesses benefit from being built on top of one platform. The activation energy for that is extremely high. So before my time at the company, Parker, Prasanna, the technical founder, and others, built all of the first versions of all these products and it was a minor miracle, they were able to do that. But having done it, we then had that platform and we could continue to build new verticals and new startups on top of that foundation.\n\nLenny (00:25:16):\nThis touches on something that comes up a number of times in this podcast, which is the importance of differentiation. And it feels like this is the differentiator for Rippling. It's not going to be just a better one of these vertical solutions like the main differentiators, we're going to do it all and everything's going to be so much better because it's all in one platform. Is that kind of where the original idea came from or is there a different way to think about that?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:25:38):\nYeah, I think that's right. So I mean, the fundamental contention is having a single system of record is better for many, many, many reasons, right? The most simple of which is there's a single source of truth and all of these other products can rely on it. But also, unless you start without assumption of everything being in a single system of record, there's a bunch of other things you can't do. You can't build out a, I don't know, a permissioning system that looks at the various attributes across all of these products. You now suddenly have to do an integration and each of these products talks different languages. You can't do simple things, build a product and say, who is this person's manager? Most products, you can't do that. Most products you find some system of truth, export everybody's name and email address and a spreadsheet, have another email address or another name, maybe an employee ID of who that person reports to and upload that to another system, which by the way is immediately out of date because organizational structures change all the time.\n\n(00:26:35):\nWhereas with Rippling, it's always correct. We are the system of record. So all of our products, they're like, \"Hey, who's that person's manager.\" And the system immediately knows. And that's a very, very simple example of something that you can only do if you start with solve it to come back to an earlier point, like solve the most complex use case first, solve the fact that this data all needs to be in the same place. And so our ability to differentiate boils down to that one fundamental decision, which just allows us to do things that are literally impossible for any other company to do.\n\nLenny (00:27:09):\nWhat would you say is one of the most unique things about Ripplings culture that maybe you haven't mentioned yet?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:27:15):\nI would say it's fundamental, speed of execution. I think in speed of decision-making. It's the thing that is probably the hardest to explain to people before they're here. It's hard to understand until you experience it. It's like let's not schedule a meeting for next week or tomorrow or later today. We're in the middle of a meeting, we need to make a decision. Let's either make the decision or if we can't, let's Slack call in the person that we need in order to make that decision. And we'll be done with the decision today.\n\n(00:27:44):\nAnd like sure there are irreversible decisions you can't make that way, but for the most part, we really value the tempo of decision-making and the speed of response. And no company I've been at any scale, 5 people, 5,000 people, has ever operated at the tempo this one does. And I think that our ability to continue to operate at that tempo, which is partly due to the fact that we are a compound startup and have these small teams independently operating teams and all the rest of that is a really differentiating thing about the culture of the company.\n\nLenny (00:28:14):\nI'm reading Kevin Kelly's new book where I don't know if you've seen his new book. It's all these little tidbits of advice and one of his pieces of advice is that usually the best time to do something is right now. And that feels like that resonates with the way you all think. I'm curious just how you create that culture and ability to make decisions fast. Is it purely top-down founder, this is how they behave, or is there something else that you found as effective to create this culture of moving fast, making decisions really quickly?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:28:43):\nObviously, a huge piece of this is Parker himself. It's an attribute of his personality, he likes making decisions quickly, and it's also a deliberate strategic decision on his part to have a company that makes decisions quickly. And so he models this constantly, right, in Slack, in conversations in person, and in every way possible. And there's an expectation throughout the company. If you kind of look at our leadership principles, this ability to make decisions quickly is something that kind of everybody promulgates. But also I think there's a number of things we've done to bake it in the way that we even do say quarterly planning. And the fact that there's this timeline for decision-making that doesn't leave a lot of room in the way that we expect people to know their domains, especially in product, right?\n\n(00:29:29):\nIn product, you don't own little feature, you own your product and you're expected to be the world's foremost expert in it. And if you are, what that means is instead of having to come back to people three days later with an answer, just off the top of your head, you can be like, \"Yes, this is what I think I should do about that or give me 30 minutes, look something up and I can tell you what we need to do about that.\" And so all of those things in combination just yield an environment in which these decisions happen very quickly.\n\nLenny (00:29:55):\nYou talked about quarterly planning and you're saying that there's like, here's the timelines we need to make decisions on these dates, and there's a culture of just we stay firm to that. And if you don't, then we're going to move on.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:30:06):\nThat's right. And it's shocking to people when we actually move on, right, that haven't been here yet. It's like, no, no, that date passed. You don't get to retroactively make everybody react to the fact that you didn't operate quickly enough, right? And it's not a hostile thing, it's just a, people just have to get used to. It's a deep cultural principle. And the fact that everyone stands behind it just means it's gets reinforced on its own, out of its own gravity.\n\nLenny (00:30:34):\nDo you have internal values that you've kind of outlined that are a part of this? Or is that not something that you find super valuable?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:30:42):\nNo, actually I find them quite valuable. And actually our COO, Matt MacInnis, who joined the company about a year before I did, he has been the one to really drive this and you go to, I can't remember this specific URL, but on Rippling there's a search Rippling leadership principles. There they are. And they are really true to the culture of the company. The way we came up with them was to us a couple years ago, to introspect and to what actually made people successful at the company? Like who's successful, why are they successful? Why do they enjoy being here? Or alternatively the opposite, like why people not worked out, why do some people not enjoy it here? And those are the things that are differentiating and those are the things that we wrote down.\n\nLenny (00:31:23):\nAre you hiring or on the flip side, are you looking for a new opportunity? Well, either way, check out lennysjobs.com/talent. If you're a hiring manager, you can sign up and get access to hundreds of hand-curated people who are open to new opportunities. Thousands of people apply to join this collective. And I personally review and accept just about 10% of them. You won't find a better place to hire product managers and growth leaders. Join almost a 100 other companies who are actively hiring through this collective. And if you're looking around for a newer opportunity actively or passively join the collective, it's free. You can be anonymous and you can even hide yourself from specific companies. You can also leave any time and you'll only hear from companies that you want to hear from. Check out lennysjobs.com/talent. For someone listening that's like, we need to move faster. And everyone always feels this, we need to move faster, we make decisions faster. What piece of advice would you give someone for helping them do this at their company?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:32:27):\nI think it's really context-dependent, but I think it starts with whoever is in the role of making the top-level product decisions of them being one extremely clear about what those priorities are and more importantly, extremely clear about what all the priorities aren't. Right? There are so many things that could be important or people can make the case for being important or whatever that are fundamentally distracting from the core mission of getting something done.\n\n(00:32:55):\nBut secondly, for that person to go all the way to ground on it, we have one of the leadership principles is go and see. Right? So to look at the thing and then walk all the way to ground and talk with the engineer who's writing the code on the thing. Because inevitably this top-level communication is insufficient to get to the detail of what matters and doesn't matter. And you don't have to do that everywhere, but if you do it in enough places, what it does is it creates a clear expectation of that kind of clarity across the board and forces everyone to up their game a little bit and just helps people understand what the expectation is. Right? And I think in the absence of those sort of clear expectations, it's difficult for people to perform at their best. Right? And so we try to do that pretty frequently.\n\nLenny (00:33:43):\nOkay. I definitely want to spend more time on this, but before we get there, so go and see. I love that. And that actually has come up recently on a number of podcasts, just the importance of people continuing to ask questions and going to the end of what's possible. Recent story was IO talking about building the cash card and going to the warehouse and watching the printings of the cards and things like that.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:34:03):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:34:04):\nI guess first of all, do you have a sense of where that came from and why that ended up being so important to y'all? And then two is there an example of you doing that or someone you've seen do that and that leading to something really important?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:34:16):\nIn the early days of our global efforts, when we were first trying to figure out what global payroll was, it was really tempting to say, \"Oh, well we're going to go into the UK and that's going to be relatively similar to what we're doing in the US.\" But our kind of head of payroll went in and said, actually, here are the ways in which we knew it was going to be different, but here are the ways in which we didn't anticipate that it was going to be different, which made us realize that we had to completely alter our approach for how we think about learning about each of these countries and going into them and having a fulsome experience.\n\n(00:34:50):\nAnd that then backs into things like, well, every country does tax filings, every country does them slightly differently, but how are we going to build a tax filing system that's going to allow us to satisfy the needs of every country in which we're going to run payroll? And it was only through that very early on deep look at how one country was actually operating and then doing the same thing with the next country that we were able to set in motion, all of those things. It's not like we knew all the answers at that point, but it allowed us at a much earlier stage to put in motion a bunch of stuff that we need to do that then got subsequently much more clarified and much more precise over time.\n\nLenny (00:35:30):\nAnd so the leader of that team basically just went and studied the tax laws of each-\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:35:35):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:35:36):\n... country.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:35:36):\nThat's right, went all the way to ground. It's like, okay, let's go and open up the big old, I mean, it's online these days, the big old textbook and look like it's, or you're in the United States, it's like you have to go look at Ohio or Pennsylvania, which have all these little local city or county based taxes. And it's incredibly instructive to look at just a few of those and think, wow, how do I think about configuring these change unannounced? Some city administrator or the city legislature, whatever they call them, they decide to change the tax rate. Well, how are we going to know about that? How are we going to change it? How are we going to change it so it's effective at the right time?\n\n(00:36:14):\nAnd you don't think about those things until you've gone all the way to ground and looked at how these things are actually worked, how they're communicated, and how they're thought through. And I think the same thing is true of every aspect of every product in different ways. Right? It might be a technical thing, it might be a design thing, it might be a compliance or a regulatory or a governmental thing, but whatever it is, that detail always exists. And unless you're getting down there and seeing it and understanding it firsthand, you don't really understand what your product needs to do.\n\nLenny (00:36:42):\nAnd I think an important element of this that's between the lines maybe is don't delegate this to someone. You may have a tax expert on the team, and I imagine many leaders would be like, go figure this out and tell me. And I think what you're saying is you go do that and learn, become the world expert at it.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:36:55):\nThat's right. That's right. You go do it. You go learn and then we can make the case for hiring the tax expert, which we do have by the way now. That's an incredibly important part of our success is having that specialist but not before somebody with a product mindset. The tax specialist is amazing at tax, right? That's what they're, they love and that's what they do, but that doesn't make them necessarily a great product thinker. So the person with the product thing has to get into those same weeds first to really understand it.\n\nLenny (00:37:24):\nDo you give any guidance and just how much time to spend on all that stuff versus the regular day-to-day of, say, a product leader on a team, it takes a lot of time to become a world expert on the tax systems of many countries, or is it just there's nothing more important than that, that is your job, and what are you doing not doing that? How do you think about it?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:37:42):\nI think it's equally if a job is 80 hours a week, it's 40 of your hours. I think that you can't really understand a product unless you've gone there. Right? And yes, it takes time and you're right, you can't just ignore the other half of the job of communicating with the engineering team and writing documents or whatever, but what's the point of writing a document if you don't know what you're talking about? And so we very deeply value that. And it's one of the reasons that we keep, at least at Rippling, our product organization really thin. We expect a single leader to be able to know the full scope of the product. In fact, great product leaders can in fact do that because they have this native curiosity and interest and ability to absorb a lot of stuff. And it makes, it's a lot of fun because now I have a group of people around me who are all really good at what they do and really understand what they do and that's kind of just an amazing place to be.\n\nLenny (00:38:42):\nI'm looking at this list and I just want to keep asking questions about it. One of the sure principles that I love is it reminds me of Amazon has the same principle I believe, which is leaders are right a lot.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:38:52):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:38:53):\nWhy do you find that to be important? I know you weren't necessarily design all these principles, but I imagine that something that you guys follow often and comes up a lot.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:39:01):\nI mean, this is one of my favorite ones because I think particularly for a product org, right? Because product leaders have to be right most of the time because their decisions reflect across the entire org and their decisions fundamentally spend time and they spend energy. And if they make good ones, the company does really well. And if they make bad ones, the company doesn't. And one of the things I really value in product leaders are people who can go into an ambiguous information with ambiguous situation, with incomplete information and a complex decision space and can look at that and listen to everybody and read whatever they need to read and say, this is where we need to go.\n\n(00:39:43):\nAnd even if everyone else is like, ah, I don't know, that feels wrong for this reason, this reason if they have the confidence to make that call, and then a year later when you look back on it, for them to have been right, that's extremely valuable. And it's one of these things that it's really hard to test for. You can get it by talking with people and asking, \"Hey, was this person usually right in respect?\" And people think about it, but in the context of a given company, just you have to take the time and see if those decisions are largely right. And it's the one value we have. It's like you can't really learn it. Either you're really, really good at making those kinds of decisions or you're not, right? It's a very peculiar skill that we really value.\n\nLenny (00:40:28):\nAwesome. Shifting a little bit, I know you all are going through this global expansion. We talked about this a little bit.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:40:28):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:40:35):\nAnd so just a few questions along this lines, because a lot of companies start one country, most companies do, and then they decide let's expand to new markets. So I guess first question is just how do you decide which markets to go after? And specifically where to start first and then just prioritizing the list of markets? What's kind of your algorithm for that?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:40:55):\nSo it starts with an assumption that we're going to have to be everywhere ultimately, that you don't actually have to build native global payroll in every country in the world. Just makes sense to do that every country in the world. But you definitely want to be able to pay people in any country in the world and you want to be able to have contractors anywhere in the world and have their information be in your HRS anywhere in the world. And so the decision for us, we were fortunate to, or when we made that decision, to have quite a few customers already, like thousands of customers. And so we knew not only where their kind of US employees were, but by virtue of being an employee system work, we actually knew where they had other employees. And so it was quite easy for us to say, focusing on US-based companies, which is incomplete data.\n\n(00:41:35):\nBut if we just look at our US-based companies, we know that there is immediate demand for those people to pay people in countries X, Y, and Z. And we just listed those out in raw numerical order. And then we kind of looked at, okay, how hard is it to build in these countries and how valuable is it to build in these countries? What is the strategic value of building in the UK or Canada or Germany or India or wherever? And then we had a discussion on where is there risk or where is this hard? Where is there a long pull? Where does this like, in what countries does it take a long time to get approval or whatever? And we just stack-ranked them and then we revisited that decision. The early decisions that we made on exactly which countries. We have subsequently reordered those over time. And as we've dove, dived in the countries, and learned more, we rejigger things like a little bit. But for the most part, that same basic list we started with is still mostly right.\n\nLenny (00:42:29):\nOkay. And then the other question a lot of founders always struggle with is when is the time to start expanding internationally? Because there's pros and cons. Do you have a sense of what convinced y'all to start going international?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:42:41):\nI think our case is slightly special, but I think the right answer to that question is always before you think you do before you think you need to because there are, it's harder than everyone if they've never done it before, it's harder than you think it is. It's more specialized than you think it is. People in the UK really, really care if there is a U in color, just as we care if there's not a U in color. There's just all of these subtle lessons that, like cultural lessons for companies that take a really, really long time to absorb. And so my view is you always should do it earlier than you think you should that, than you think you have to. In our case, it was always something we knew we had to do. In fact, we have a very clear thesis that companies that aren't global, particularly in payroll, but also in kind of insurance and benefits in IT. If you're not global, you're just not going to be around in 10 years because companies were becoming global, and then COVID happened and companies became global much faster.\n\n(00:43:35):\nIt stopped being the province of 100-person companies plus and started filtering down into very, very small companies. It just became commonplace for small companies to be multi-country. And so that very much accelerated our timetable. And then you saw other people noticed that too, and you saw other companies starting to try to address parts of this problem as well. And so there's this kind of competitive dimension, which is sort of secondary in most ways because we were going to do it anyway, but that also kind of adds a little bit of a fire under the thing.\n\nLenny (00:44:06):\nWhat have you found to be most surprising about expanding internationally to be successful in expansion? For folks that are maybe starting down this road of like, oh shoot, we should think about that.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:44:16):\nI think the thing that was most surprising to me the first time I did this back at Guidewire in the [inaudible 00:44:23] and remains the most surprising thing to most people every time I do this again, is that every country is unique. You can't just take your US-based approach and drop it into another country. Other countries find it insulting. It doesn't matter how much success you've had here. Everyone always believes rightly or wrongly that their local context is special. And you have to respect that. And it comes down to little things like they're being a you in color or not. Or if you ever see a demo delivered to somebody in another country where they see a detailed screen about a person and it includes a social security number, it's like that you immediately lose credibility. Doesn't matter how good all the rest of your stuff is.\n\n(00:45:08):\nAnd I think that that is consistently the thing that I think is most surprising to people is the degree to which that's true, which seems obvious in retrospect. If you took a German system or something and demoed it in the United States with poorly translated stuff, we would think it would suck too. But it's not, it's really hard to adapt to that mindset. And so it takes just a lot of energy to overcome that organizationally.\n\nLenny (00:45:32):\nMakes tons of sense. I'm going to go in a different direction now.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:45:36):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:45:36):\nFrameworks. So I know that you're not a huge fan of frameworks. We were chatting about this before we started recording. And so I'm curious just to hear your perspective on why you're maybe not a fan of frameworks and then also just how you crystallize processes and concepts for your team if you're not just like, Hey, here's our framework you should use.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:45:54):\nLook, I think frameworks are very helpful. So I'm not exactly anti-framework, but I am anti-process as a substitution for deep product thinking, right? So I like to have just enough process to create a frame so that the right decisions can happen and know more. And I think there's a danger, especially as companies scale, that you end up saying, well, if only we categorize everything correctly and Jira, like we will be able to make really good prioritization decisions. So I'm like, sure, extremely helpful to have clear categorization and things that Jira doesn't have like data and analysis and to be able to do all of that stuff. But what you really need to do is decide important to build and then have a way to build it really efficiently. And so I think the right answer, the right amount of process for any given team is like, or the right framework for any team is really just dependent on their specific life cycle.\n\n(00:46:47):\nSo you won't see me saying like, oh, we need to use this scrum thing or that combine thing, or whatever the latest, newest thing is. It's like, don't care about any of that. What I care is about something that's going to enable this team in this context at this point in their life cycle to build the right thing as efficiently as possible. And I'm fine if those are different for different teams. And the only place I care about unification is one on the quarterly planning process. And two, everything does need in fact to be in Jira because otherwise, you can't rationalize about what's actually getting done in not.\n\nLenny (00:47:18):\nIs there a process or framework that you find is counterproductive that you're just stay away from this thing? We've had a lot of trouble with it, or generally, it's like let's just rethink everything ourselves.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:47:31):\nNo, I don't find one to be particular, I don't consistently found one to be particularly problematic. So I think any framework sort of has its place, the right place, right time. I think there's danger any one time somebody like dogmatically says, I think we should use process X because that's almost never the right answer in my experience. I think there are places where that can differ. Like you start a company on the basis of process X and everyone's bought into that process and everyone understands it. I think they can be really, really great. And on the engineering side, I think this is hugely valuable. It's like test driven-development, first line of code's going to be a test, not the actual thing. Like fantastic, very supportive of all that. I think it's kind of different in the product world.\n\nLenny (00:48:08):\nIf you had to compare the way Coinbase builds product process-wise or just product development to Rippling, what would you say are the bigger differences?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:48:17):\nI think the differences are largely born of the different domains. So crypto, as we talked about earlier, really hard to predict what's going on. There's all these questions about what's the future of crypto, what's going to matter, what do we even need to build? What's going to survive? And so the process we had at Coinbase run, having those debates and getting to a decision and disagreeing, committing. And then from an execution point of view, being able to move fast. That was the trick at Coinbase. Here we know the things that we need to build at a high level. And the trick is how do we really differentiate it on the basis of these amazing platform capabilities we have? Or how do we have to evolve those platform capabilities in order to continue to build something that's just discontinuously better than everything that's out there? And that yields a different decision-making process. So for me, it's the mental model is actually of how I approach those things with the same, but they just yield different results in the actual making of the software.\n\nLenny (00:49:12):\nWhat is that actual difference? Do you find day-to-day? Is it timeline differences? Is it how quickly, I don't know the way you structure, how far out you plan, what do you find is the concrete difference as a result?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:49:25):\nI think the difference is in the day-to-day velocity of decision-making, because we can, Rippling, if you're on, I don't know, pick a random team. If you're on the device management team, you know what you got to do, right? There's no ambiguity. You're not debating about whether Mac or Windows is going to exist in the future. There's none of that cognitive dissonance. There is, we need to build this. It's hard to figure out how we need to build this, right? Because there's all these different things that we could leverage, but we need to basically get this done.\n\n(00:49:58):\nAnd so the kind of total velocity I would say is higher here, which does not say people work harder or less are at Columbia. Columbia was an amazingly fast environment, but it was also subject to the fact that you just don't know what the crypto markets are going to do, and you have to be incredibly reactive to that. And so I think maybe that's the one thing, like the reactivity to the environment and the crypto environment, what's going on, and the uncertainty of the regulatory environment, all that stuff. We got really, really, really good at handling those things really rapidly, which is something that we need to handle somewhat less [inaudible 00:50:34].\n\nLenny (00:50:33):\nSounds quite stressful at Coinbase.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:50:38):\nYeah, I mean it was fun. Yes, it was stressful. I mean, every job I've ever had has been stressful, but in its own unique way. But all of that stress I think is in the shape of a problem, that's in the context of a problem that's really interesting. I mean that's why I stayed at these places. But yeah, it's stressful.\n\nLenny (00:51:00):\nAnd looking back, what a joy.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:51:02):\nYeah. No, there are very good memories. I look back, I don't really, I remember the stress, but I don't like re-experience it, right. I remember foraging these relationships and building these amazing products that I've been so lucky to be a part of. And so I have almost only good memories of the places I've been.\n\nLenny (00:51:21):\nThat's what I find too. You go through these hardships and then you look back and you're like, wow, that was so cool. But assuming they go well, assuming the company works out and-\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:51:21):\nTrue.\n\nLenny (00:51:29):\n... it feels like it was successful. A lot of times you're at a startup, your life sucks for two years and it doesn't work out and that there is a lot of upside and good memories to that, but it's less glorious.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:51:41):\nYeah, that's fair though. I mean, the first company I was really at out of school's company called Reactivity back in internet one era, and we were trying to figure out how does this internet thing work and how do we start companies on the basis of these tech new technologies and how do we help other companies build stuff and figure it out? And that company fundamentally didn't work out, ultimately got kind of spun itself out and got acquired, which was great, but it was this extraordinary set of people that I was so lucky to work with and I loved all the time I spent there and it was foundational to everything else I ever did. And so even though that effort didn't pay off in the traditional set, the value of the learnings I had there and then the people I had a chance to work with was just really exceptional. So I feel very lucky.\n\nLenny (00:52:30):\nThat's a really good point actually. And I think I should correct even what I said that even when things don't work out, traditionally those experiences end up being incredibly valuable in all these unexpected ways.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:52:42):\nYeah, 100%.\n\nLenny (00:52:44):\nYeah. Okay, so final topic.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:52:45):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:52:45):\nI want to talk about hiring product managers and interviewing.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:52:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:52:49):\nSo you've hired a lot of PMs over the years. I'm curious, what's something you've learned about what to look for in product managers and also just in product leaders that other people may not be focused on as enough?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:53:00):\nI mean, I don't know that I have any particularly special insight here. I think there's a couple things that I do ask that maybe are more of an emphasis because it's Rippling than not. But the first of those is when people are going through our process, there's a part where they do this case study and an important part of the case study is that it's actually too complex for people to have all of the answers upfront. There's just the space of the problem is too large to do that, which means that in the interview there's a lot of opportunities or in the case study there's a lot of opportunities. So just ask ad hoc questions or to change one assumption. And seeing how people react to that is really indicative of how deeply they understand a new problem or how quickly or how mentally agile they are.\n\n(00:53:47):\nAnd some people are extremely good at that here in assumption and they blink a couple times. They're like, oh, well that has these 400 implications. And they just start rattling them off. And some people get really flummoxed. I mean obviously for our environment, that former is really, really important to us. I think the other thing that really matters to me is the insightfulness of questions that people ask, which is indicative of number one, their actual interest in the job.\n\n(00:54:14):\nPeople tend to ask better questions when they're more excited about working at a place and done their research and are asking people about it. And also the quality of those questions can vary quite dramatically. And that's okay. I don't expect the quality to be the same all the time, but sometimes people ask a question, I'm like, \"Oh man, I would've never thought to ask that question. That's such an insightful question.\" And then I pause and I have to think about my answer a little bit. And so it kind of pushes me to be a little bit better. And when that happens, I know I usually have pretty good candidate on my hands.\n\nLenny (00:54:42):\nIs there an example of someone asking a really good question that comes to mind that you think back to and like, Oh wow, that was great.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:54:49):\nI remember about three years ago I was interviewing a guy named Kyle Boston and Kyle is now runs our platform product organization. And I can't remember the specific question he asked, but it had something to do with, wait a minute, if you have all these products and you have this employee system of record thing underneath it, we be thinking about how to create these various pillars of underlying platform technology, things like [inaudible 00:55:22] all this stuff. And this was before we fully formalized the concept of our platform beyond the kind of employee system of record.\n\n(00:55:29):\nAnd I remember thinking, yes, we should, and that had entered our minds before, but the fact that somebody which who had almost no context on the company, that's what was impressive about this question. It's like, man, you've been thinking about Rippling for a couple weeks while you're interviewing with a bunch of other companies or whatever. And you've thought about it deeply enough to have this insight into the nature of the platform that we're building immediately gave me a bunch of confidence in his ability to think through the sorts of things we need him to think through.\n\nLenny (00:55:58):\nAnd I think it touches on PMs need to be business leaders and great questions are often about the business and the future of the business and how to make it run more efficiently and this, and there's a product org element to it. But I find that that's a really underappreciated element of PM interviews, just thinking about the bigger business, not just the PM product.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:56:19):\nFor me it's two things. It's thinking about the bigger business and having the context around whether it's revenue questions or strategy questions, but also the detailed questions. It's like, oh wait a minute. The implication of this thing that I'm getting asked or of this thing with Jeremy that you said earlier is all of these things. And their ability to understand that this isn't a simple business, it's really hard, it's really complex. And the ability to have these insights to help them think through those details is really cool.\n\nLenny (00:56:49):\nYou talked about this prompt you give product managers not to give away what you actually asked these days, but is there an example of a prompt that you've given in the past or you think is a good example of a type of prompt to give a product manager candidate.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:57:01):\nIn terms of a general kind of approach, I think a prompt should always reflect the actual business that they're going to kind of come into. So when we do, so our process overall is actually quite short. It's basically get in contact with us somehow, eventually get connected with a hiring manager, have a conversation with them. Then more or less you have a conversation with me, which is a product discussion. And then we have a case study which follows that. That's the whole process. Modulo, other conversations around the edges. And the questions that matter are around how do people think through that product discussion, which is relevant to our business. How do people think through that case study? That's number one. And the second thing is there's always a part of my interview, which is maybe sounds very simple, but it's just like, Hey, what questions do you have for me?\n\n(00:57:53):\nWe actually do that before we do the product discussion. And that's an incredibly important question because it is again indicative of these things that people have thought through or not thought through or the depth that they're thinking or their interest in engagement in the role. And at that second discussion, it doesn't have to be perfect or anything, but it is a very strong signal when people, whether they've thought through a set of questions they want to ask or just on the fly generating them, you learn a lot about how people think about product, about what they're looking for, about what they like doing and not doing, just through those questions.\n\nLenny (00:58:30):\nFor PMs that are maybe in their early career that are listening to this, what advice would you give them to help them accelerate and advance their career most in the early part of their career?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:58:41):\nBe humble. Being a product person means that by definition you're living in a world where no one knows the right answer yet because if somebody did, they would've already built it. And so having, no matter how smart you are, there's a lot of smart people out there. There's always stuff you don't know. There's always people who are going to know things that you don't know. And it is only through that acknowledgement that you can actually have the humility to say, I'm open to absorbing all of this stuff, I don't know. And open to synthesizing all this stuff and coming to different conclusions.\n\n(00:59:12):\nAnd so I found that that humility is one of the biggest differentiators in early career leaders who are able to let go of how awesome they were in school or in their first job or whatever. I mean, I had to do this and realize the job is always hard and the job is always about discovery every single day. And if you can maintain that curiosity and elasticity of thought and creativity and light coming solutions could be awesome. But if you close yourself off to that and think you always have the right answer, then there's like no hope.\n\nLenny (00:59:49):\nThis touches on another principle that I still have sitting on my screen here, which is great leaders change their minds a lot or just change their minds.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (00:59:57):\nYeah. Willing to look at new information and say, my mental model is adjusted by that or I was wrong very simply. I mean I think it's also important to be operating in an environment where you're allowed to say that you're wrong, right? Everyone's wrong sometimes. I mean be right a lot, but everyone's wrong sometimes. Right? And being in be able to be an environment where you can just say, yep, I was wrong. Here's the way in which I was wrong. Let's move on, is incredibly powerful.\n\nLenny (01:00:19):\nThe final question you've brought up Parker a number of times and something that is clear about him is that he's a very product-minded founder. He has a lot of strong opinions about what product should be. And as a product leader with a founder like that is often a challenging place to be similar to being the first PM at a startup and the founder has strong opinions about product. So my question is just what have you learned about being successful as a product leader with a founder that has very strong opinions about what the product should be?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:00:47):\nYeah, no, that's a great question. So I think you've got to be adaptable, right? It's like any other relationship, right? You have to understand what the nature of that relationship is, where that person's going to care, where you're going to care, the ways in which you can challenge each other. I think fundamentally you need to make sure that person is willing to be challenged, right? So I've seen product leaders or CEOs who are kind of unwilling to be challenged and I wouldn't be able to work with those people.\n\n(01:01:17):\nBut yeah, Parker is incredibly strongly opinionated, but he's also incredibly informed, which makes for some really, really great debates. And I've just found that whatever, and it's not even CEO, but whatever a manager's idiosyncrasies are, you have to find a way to work with those. And I think that adaptability, like I'm just sort of, I like being a moldable puzzle piece where I can just fit in. I think that's actually one of my core skills. And so that's worked out for me and Parker and I before I started developing a deep foundation of respect, which is extremely important to building that. And over the years it's just gotten deeper and deeper and we don't always agree, but when we can have a totally reasonable discussion about it, and that's what makes it fun.\n\nLenny (01:02:06):\nAdaptability actually is, I took a strength finder test once of finding my own strengths and that was my number one strength is I'm [inaudible 01:02:14] I think we share that.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:02:15):\nThat's excellent.\n\nLenny (01:02:15):\nYeah, seems like an important attribute for being in a place in. Well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you if you're ready.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:02:25):\nAll right, I'm ready. Hit me.\n\nLenny (01:02:27):\nHere we go. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:02:31):\nWell, first is my favorite series of books ever, which is the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson. It's a nine-volume epic or three-volume, nine-book epic depending on how you want to look at it. But it's about the time just before and into the enlightenment, historical fiction, a lot of fun. And I also love the Culture series by Iain Banks, which is just super fun, far-future sort of universe that I've really enjoyed.\n\nLenny (01:02:59):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:03:01):\nWatched The Last of Us, was an avid fan of the game and I thought they did a really nice adaptation. Favorite mov, like I guess, recent movie, it's not that recent, but I really like Tenet, which I thought was a, I was impressed with their ability to go there and make that movie and I just really enjoyed it end to end.\n\nLenny (01:03:23):\nIt kind of ended, but we had a drinking game anytime someone mentioned Last of Us, which took over White Lotus. I'm going to drink some tea right here.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:03:30):\nOkay, fair enough. I'll try. I've only got water normally I got tea, but water today.\n\nLenny (01:03:33):\nThat works. But it's interesting, it hasn't come up often, so I think maybe we end that for now and see what the new pattern emerges. And then Tenant feels like, I was just thinking it feels like a compound movie, compound startup as a movie, a movie is very complicated too to stay-\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:03:50):\nYeah, That's why I enjoyed it. I like trying to figure out the multi-timeline chart in my head as the movie progressed.\n\nLenny (01:03:56):\nThe puzzle piece within you trying to find all the puzzle pieces.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:03:59):\nYeah, for sure.\n\nLenny (01:04:00):\nWhat is a favorite interview question you like to ask? You already maybe answered this, but anything else come to mind?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:04:06):\nI think I did, no, my favorite one is What questions do you have for me by far?\n\nLenny (01:04:09):\nGreat. What are some favorite products you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:04:14):\nI guess I'll just mention, I don't know if I go as far as I call these favorite products, but there's two that come to mind. My wife's computer broke the other day and I realized it was the CPU cooler that went bad and the Corsair H60 CPU cooler was super easy to use and really adaptable to lots of motherboards. I thought that was great. My other favorite product is the one I'm wearing in my ears right now, which my first pair of nice headphones I ever bought died late last week, and had to do some really quick research into my new favorite pair of headphones. And these Focal Bathys are super nice. I'm a bit of an audio file. I like to listen to classical music and ambient stuff, so we need a lot of dynamic range and noise cancellation and these have been great so far.\n\nLenny (01:04:57):\nOkay, so what are they called?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:04:59):\nFocal, I think it's Bathys, B-A-T-H-Y-S. Okay.\n\nLenny (01:05:04):\nAnd has there a specific model or there's like that one?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:05:06):\nThat's it.\n\nLenny (01:05:06):\nOkay.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:05:07):\nYou'll know it when you see it.\n\nLenny (01:05:09):\nOkay. We will link to them in show notes, so maybe I'll get one. What's something relatively minor you've changed in the way that you built product that has had a lot of impact on your team's ability to execute?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:05:20):\nMaybe the most recent innovation sort of at Rippling was the kind of introduction of what I'm calling imperatives. These things that whether they come bottom up or top down are things that like everybody across the entire product and engineering team needs to do and what's important about that list of things that are not on it. And in a world where we could choose to do hundreds of things at once, being able to force rank that list of things, draw a line, say these are the ones everyone has to do, has created a lot more focus and clarity than we had before.\n\nLenny (01:05:48):\nSo imperatives are essentially here's the priorities for the next, say quarter six months here?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:05:53):\nHere are the priorities for everybody and now integrate that into your own team's priorities, right? So each team still is building their own priorities, but they have to factor in this set.\n\nLenny (01:06:05):\nHow many of those do you usually have? This is awesome. I like this tip.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:06:09):\nIt depends on what level of granularity you want to talk about them at, like maybe 10, right? It's a lot. We're going through between globalization and large improvements of the platform and a bunch of other large companies. All these things, it creates a bunch of things that just have to be cross-team simultaneously. I think it's pretty natural part of a company's evolution and we're just in that part of the cycle, so-\n\nLenny (01:06:33):\nAwesome.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:06:33):\n... used it.\n\nLenny (01:06:34):\nFinal question, what's a question I should have asked you that I didn't ask you?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:06:38):\nI guess, what do I do with my kids maybe? I have two kids, they're nine and-\n\nLenny (01:06:38):\nWhat do you do with your kids?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:06:43):\n... six. What do I do with my kids? My son, I'm a big board gamer and while I didn't push it on him, my son, he will play board games morning to night. And so we play a lot of European strategy games together and my daughter's now getting old enough that she's getting into them too. And so we just finished as a family playing Pandemic Legacy and the reward tomorrow night as we get to start playing Gloomhaven. So that's going to be fun.\n\nLenny (01:07:12):\nI don't know either game, sounds very hard and complicated.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:07:15):\nThey're fun. They're fun.\n\nLenny (01:07:17):\nAmazing. Jeremy, we covered a lot of topics. I feel like this is a compound podcast episode and so thank you for spending time with me. Thanks for being here. Two final questions, working folks, finding online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:07:32):\nAwesome. LinkedIn is the easiest way online and if what I've been talking about today sounds interesting to you, we're definitely hiring like senior entrepreneurial PMs. And so if those leadership principles on our website look interesting, I'd love to hear from you.\n\nLenny (01:07:46):\nWhat's the best way to explore those roles and apply? The\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:07:49):\nThe website has by far the best channel. It gets to this right recruiter who will tell me about it right away.\n\nLenny (01:07:55):\nGreat, surfline.com and there's probably a site for careers.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:07:58):\nThere is a career site on there that you, pretty easy to find.\n\nLenny (01:08:00):\nOkay. Rolling to that in the show notes. Jeremy, thank you again for being here.\n\nJeremy Henrickson (01:08:04):\nThanks so much for having me. This was a lot of fun.\n\nLenny (01:08:06):\nHi everyone.

All our companies are moving up into the right. Every product is working. We don't really have any problems because we're crushing it, and that's just a lie. The question that I often ask is how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want. The purpose of this question is actually to evoke your own agency. A perfect example of that would be, I say I don't want to feel busy all the time, but the truth of the matter is I feel really unnerved and disconcerted if my agenda isn't jam-packed. So if you want to create a high-functioning team, do your work, and it starts with the person who has the most power.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):\nToday, my guest is Jerry Colonna. Jerry is one of the most well-known and respected executive coaches in the world. He's co-founder and CEO of Reboot, an executive and leadership development firm grounded in the belief that better humans make better leaders. Prior to coaching, Jerry co-founded Flatiron Partners with Fred Wilson, which ended up being one of the most successful early-stage investment funds in the world. He's also a partner at JPMorgan Chase and the author of two books, Reboot and Reunion. As you might expect, this ended up being a very real and very open conversation about being busy and self-inquiry and the dangers of a growth mindset and the reasons that leaders and teams most often fail, and it's not what you think. Also, we talk about a very simple equation that Jerry and his team use to cultivate great leaders.\n\n(00:01:37):\nThis is an episode that everybody should listen to and spend time with. It'll make you a better person, a better partner, and a better leader. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Jerry, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:04:19):\nWell, thanks for having me, Lenny. It's really a delight to meet you and to be with you today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:24):\nI want to start with a very classic Jerry Colonna piece of advice that I've heard you share in other places, and I just want more people to hear this advice, and this is a question that you ask people when things aren't going their way, and I'll give you a hint. The question contains the word complicit.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:04:40):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):\nCan you share this question and why it's so important to ask this of yourself?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:04:45):\nThe question that I often ask is how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? And if it's helpful, let me break down the question a little bit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):\nPlease.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:04:58):\nSo I purposely chose the word complicit because complicit does not mean responsible, and that's a really important distinction. And as I often say, to understand the word complicit, think of the word accomplice. As I will share, you are driving the getaway car, you're not sticking up the bank teller. The second half of that question is I say I don't want. And sometimes people hear that question and they interpret it as, how have I been responsible for the shit in my life? And that is not the purpose of this question. The purpose of this question is actually to evoke your own agency, is to look at the ways in which you may have been diluting yourself.\n\n(00:05:56):\nA perfect example of that would be, I say I don't want to feel busy all the time, but the truth of the matter is I feel really unnerved and disconcerted if my agenda isn't jam-packed. And the reason that this is all really important is part of my approach not only to coaching, but to the process of growing up, is to use what I call radical self-inquiry, to really cut through our own delusions and say, how does it serve me to feel completely busy to the point where I feel exhausted? And perhaps there's another more conscious way of getting that feeling than feeling like crap all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:56):\nThis is a good segue to something that I hear you. You have this equation that you and your firm use to think about how to create and cultivate great leaders, and it includes one of the variables is radical self-inquiry. Can you share this equation and just how you work with folks to build this in them?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:07:14):\nSure. I'll tell a little story about that. I remember one time I was, this is how the equation came to be. I was doing a talk, I think here in Boulder at Naropa University where I used to be on the board of trustees. It's a Buddhist university, and as is often the case, I'm winging it as I go and I'm walking around probably without shoes on because that's what I do. And there was a dry erase board behind me and I was trying to explain what it was that I do, what it was that I encourage people to do. And I jumped up at the board and I wrote practical skills. And in writing that, what I was trying to convey, what it is that people typically come to a coach for. They want to understand how to do their job. They want to understand how to live. They want to understand the how.\n\n(00:08:11):\nAnd then, I wrote plus, and then I sketched out radical self-inquiry. And I said in that moment, I said, \"People will come and ask me how, and I will drive them crazy because I will say something like, tell me about your father, or tell me why you chose to be in the job you're in the first place, or tell me about your relationship to money, or tell me about your relationship to self-worth.\" And then, I expanded it and I put another plus sign and I said, \"Shared experiences.\" And then, I drew an equals equation line underneath the whole thing, and I said, \"Enhanced leadership plus greater resiliency.\"\n\n(00:09:05):\nAnd so, the equation is practical skills plus radical self-inquiry plus shared experiences, that is the process of actually talking about the craziness that goes on in your head equals greater leadership. That all makes sense. But then, there was this other piece, enhanced resilience. And when I do this on a dry erase board, I will often circle that phrase, and I say that is the purpose of this whole thing, because the truth is, if you follow my story at all, you know that in my late 30s, the depression that had really marked most of my life had gotten so bad that despite my outward success, I was suicidal and lost.\n\n(00:09:58):\nAnd I will turn to the audience and I say, \"I get you want to be a great CEO, I get you want to be a great executive, but what I really care about is you not killing yourself in the process.\" So if we take a step back, the whole point of what we refer to as the equation really boils down to that point, how do we grow up and become the leaders, the adults we were born to be without feeling like crap?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:31):\nAnd there's this huge implication here that a lot of people think that when they reach a certain point, become successful, make a certain amount of money, get a beautiful house, still be happy. And essentially what you're saying here is that's very often not the case. Maybe in most cases, not the case.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:10:48):\nIt's not only not the case, it's the big lie that we're socialized with since childhood. I remember one time I was on the road doing a talk for, I was promoting my first book, Reboot, and I was at, I think it's called the Fitler Club in Philadelphia. I was doing a fireside chat. And after talking with my conversation partner, a guy named Chris Fralic who was one of the co-founders at First Round, really, really good guy. We turned to the audience and there was a Q&A as there often is, and this young guy shoots his hand up and he introduces himself and he says, \"I'm 19.\" And he looks over to his right and his mother's sitting there and he says, \"And my mother brought me here,\" which I laughed.\n\n(00:11:40):\nAnd he said, \"So what you're telling me is you don't have to be an asshole to be successful.\" And I could not think of a better summation of everything that I'm about than for a 19-year-old kid to look up and say, \"You don't have to be an asshole to be successful.\" And of course, the corollary to that is you don't have to feel miserable just because you're trying to create a career.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:12):\nAs people start to think about this and think, okay, I feel like I've been heading in this direction of I just need to keep climbing the ladder, making more money, as they hear you talk, what's the pivot that folks should make in their mind around where they should actually be heading? What is a direction where they'll end up not wanting to kill themselves, in spite of being successful?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:12:34):\nTo be clear, not everyone ends up in that level of depression, but the hack, if you will, is consciousness. So what do I mean by that? Part of what makes radical self-inquiry radical is we're socialized not to ask certain kinds of questions. So for example, someone says, \"It's really important for me to be ambitious and achieve a particular goal.\" What's radical, a radical question to ask is, and what will that do for you? What is it that you believe being \"successful\" will do for you? How do you define success? Where does that come from?\n\n(00:13:30):\nIn Reboot, my first book, I tell the story of what I refer to as my pursuit of lemon drops. And briefly, when I was a boy, there was a lot... I grew up with an enormous amount of chaos and insecurity, financial and otherwise. And a big source of stability in my life were my mother's parents, my grandfather and grandmother. And Grandpa Guido, who was an ice man and emigrated from southern Italy in early 20th century, always seemed to have, well, he had this endless supply of lemon drops, and they were always kept in this green pantry outside of the kitchen. And for me, the stability and what I considered wealth seemed to match to this notion of this endless supply of lemon drops. And when I got to my 30s and I was outwardly successful and I was a hot shot BC, I had lemon drops, but I didn't feel safe, which was a mindful.\n\n(00:15:02):\nAnd so, I told that story in Reboot as part of my exploration into the core question of how did my relationship to money shape my career choices, shape my school choices, shape my own sense of safety and self-worth? So long-winded response to your question, what I encourage people to do is to ask themselves these kinds of questions so that they can raise their level of consciousness so that they can be in the driver's seat of their lives and not some learned behavior that they developed as a child to answer perhaps their parents or grandparents' anxieties.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):\nI feel like a lot of people hearing this are afraid to ask these sorts of questions. The reason they don't ask these questions is because they worry that this is going to be like, okay, I got to quit my job, move to the woods, give up all these luxuries they have. I don't even want to think about that. I got a whole family to support. I got to succeed. Advice for getting over that hump of just like-\n\nJerry Colonna (00:16:17):\nSo let's just pause, Lenny. Okay, so what you're doing in this moment is empathetically imagining what may be going on for your listener, but the empathy is actually based on your own question because you invited me on the show, you knew I was going to get to this point. So I'm imagining that as you take this in, that thought stream shows up for you. \"Jerry,\" says Lenny, \"If I open up that closet, all the shit's going to fall out, and what am I going to do with it?\" Does that resonate at all?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:58):\nThis is why I was nervous to have you on this podcast. I knew what you-\n\nJerry Colonna (00:17:05):\nSo answer my question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:07):\nI don't think it's that strong for me to be afraid of that because I've taken a different path already and gotten off the career ladder climbing treadmill. On the other hand, back to your original question, we talked about being busy. I'm very guilty of that. I'm constantly trying to do less, but constantly doing more, and my life is just very busy.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:17:28):\nThank you for giving me more of that answer. And trust me, your listeners are going to appreciate you being fully there in just the way you were. So let's take a step back. The fear is, if I can reflect back to your original question, the fear is if I go there, I don't know what's going to happen as a consequence of that. If I pause and ask myself, is this relationship working out for me? I might end up leaving this relationship. If I pause and ask myself if this career isn't working for me, I might leave my career.\n\n(00:18:25):\nAnd the good news bad news is that's true. That is absolutely true. And if we look at some of the other observations we were making before like anxiety and depression, we have this belief system that if I pay no attention to the thing that I'm afraid of, it's somehow going to magically go away. If we pay no attention to the source of discomfort, it's somehow going to go away. And that's not actually how life works. More often than not, what we do is we respond to the source of challenge, whether it's a discomfort in our relationship, whether it's a discomfort in the way my life has unfolded. We respond to it by plasting over band-aids and sometimes they're relatively healthy, we become obsessed with working out, or sometimes they're unhealthy. We become obsessed with work or substance abuse or that kind of thing. Or sometimes, and this is super popular right now, we lean into what I would call as a spiritual bypassing where we go to Peru and we go do ayahuasca or we spend the weekend doing mushrooms with friends...\n\n(00:20:08):\nAnd what we're really not doing, Lenny, is confronting the parts of ourselves that need some tending to because we're afraid of the consequences. But I'll tell you a quick quote. One of my favorite books is Bruce Springsteen's autobiography, and about in the middle of the book, he has this passage where he talks about having spent 25 years in psychoanalysis. So let me just let that statement land. Bruce fucking Springsteen, 25 years in psychoanalysis. And he has this passage where he talks about the unsorted baggage of our childhood. And what he rightly asserts is that we all have unsorted baggage, and at some point we're going to pay the price of not sorting that baggage. And the price more often than not is in tears.\n\n(00:21:21):\nNow, this is Bruce Springsteen talking about this. This is not some airy-fairy transpersonal Jerry Colonna coach. And the reason I draw that out is we as children are socialized not to develop these consciousness skills. We are socialized to develop what I would call bypassing skills. And as he correctly points out, if you continue to bypass sorting out your baggage, there's going to come a day where you're going to have to pay that price. It could be in your own depression, it could be in, I've seen this a thousand times Lenny, entrepreneurs sabotaging their successful businesses because the belief system from their childhood goes something like, I don't deserve success so let me blow it up. We put this all under the rubric of midlife, but I don't know, when does midlife begin, 35? When does it end, 70? What I do know is it's the bulk of our adulthood.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):\nOkay, I think you've done an excellent job convincing me and others to spend time on this now, and I think there's an assumption of it gets harder, the tears get more intense as you wait longer. There's this ticking time bomb that better some amount of tears now than 10 times more tears later. Is that right?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:23:04):\nWell said.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:06):\nOkay. So coming back to this equation, I think I want to give people some things to do now that they may be likely convinced, okay, I should really rethink what I'm doing. So back to the equation, practical skills plus radical self-inquiry plus shared experiences equals enhanced leadership and greater resilience. So the three things you can work on are practical skills, radical self-inquiry, shared experiences, skills I think people get. So radical self-inquiry, these are essentially questions to dig into what drives you, what makes you happy. What are some questions again that people should be asking there as they're listening or maybe after they finish listening?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:23:40):\nIn the time since I've been a coach, which is now going on 27 years, the popularity of journaling has gone up, which is awesome. And part of what happens is people journal, but they don't know what they should be journaling or how they should. So let me give some questions then, and this is a way to approach it. Let's imagine that what we're trying to do, whether we're sitting in meditation, whether we're journaling, whether we're taking time away, we're just pausing and starting to ask ourselves questions. So my famous questions include things like, what am I not saying that I need to say? So let's imagine ourselves in a relationship that's not working.\n\n(00:24:30):\nTalk about something that could be terrifying. What am I not saying in that relationship that I need to say? By the way, this is a good question to ask if one is responsible for leading people too. Corollary questions to that would be, what am I saying that's not being heard? And then, of course, what's being said that I'm not hearing? So if we just pause and look at those four questions, how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? What am I not saying that I need to say? What am I saying that's not being heard? And what's being said that I'm not hearing? Can you feel the power of all of that in those questions?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:25):\nYeah. Scary questions.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:25:27):\nThey are scary questions. You know you're in the radical self-inquiry zone when the questions take your breath away, when the questions, and by the way, you don't have to share the answers to these questions with anybody but yourself. Now, there could be some power in sharing them in a group of friends and sharing them with a group of colleagues, sharing them with a coach, sharing them with a therapist. But the most important person with whom you should share the answers is oneself. This is a little bit of Buddhism here. Self-delusion along with attachment are the biggest contributors to our own suffering. Self-delusion. Everything's great. How you doing? Everything's great. Bullshit. Can we just not bullshit each other?\n\n(00:26:30):\nSo let me just pause. Those are just four questions. My first book Reboot has a set of questions after every single chapter. We also have a journal that we put out that has questions and questions, but the more important thing to take away from this is questions that startle us, questions that may cause us to be a little afraid of the answer, that's where the gold is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:02):\nAnd we'll point people to the book for many more of these questions and the worksheets. For the third party equation, shared experiences, can you explain what that is?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:27:11):\nWe were talking about socialization, for example. Prior to launching Reboot, the company, my co-founder, Ali Schultz and I, the roots of Reboot the company began with me designing, or Ali and I designing these boot camps. And the original iteration of the boot camp, we used to call CEO Boot Camp because it was originally we would get first-time CEOs together and we would do a bait and switch. We would pretend to sell them practical skills, and then I would start asking really tough questions like who would you be without the story of who you are? It's like what?\n\n(00:27:57):\nThe notion of shared experience as an important component grew out of that. Because what would happen is imagine sitting in a circle of people who just have your back, who really care about you as a person. And imagine then discussing some of the answers to those questions. Who would you be without the story of who you are? What is it that you wish that people in your life knew about you, but you're too afraid to tell them? And imagine sitting in a group of people who can just hold that space without fixing you, without telling you what you're doing right or wrong? We, too often than not, especially in what I would say the entrepreneurial community are socialized to bullshit not only ourselves, but everybody else. All our companies are moving up into the right, every product that's working, we don't really have any problems because we're crushing it, and that's just a lie. Imagine having the capacity to be in relationship with people where you can just tell the truth. That's what shared experiences are about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):\nMy wife does a women's circle where they gather and just share what's really going on within in their lives. And it's-\n\nJerry Colonna (00:29:26):\nThat's it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:34):\nAnd it's very confidential. There's a ritual to it, and it feels like that's a really good avenue for things like that.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:29:42):\nWhat circle do you sit in?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):\nNo circles. This is my circle.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:29:49):\nBut there is something powerful here. I think in the last 15 years, the rise of podcasts, good podcasts. What I think what happens is let's hope this is happening for your audience right now, good quality intimate conversation between people who are authentic and real, creates space for someone to be authentic and real, even if it's just with themselves. So you're doing a mitzvah, you're doing a good deed by creating this space.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:24):\nThanks, Jerry. Let's go back to the busyness point, and I'll talk about myself a bit to get it real again, because I think it's also something a lot of people struggle with. I listen to this, they're just like, I'm so busy, and every time someone ask me how I'm doing, busy, so busy, like swirly eyes emoji, swirly eyes emoji.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:30:45):\nWith a little head shake.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:47):\nThat's right. And the melting face emoji. And that's very much me. And it's funny because I started this journey of the newsletter of just like I call the project avoid getting a real job. And it was just like, cool, just do this newsletter thing, not have the job. It'll be chill, write an email once a week. But I just find myself taking on endlessly more and more. And for me, I feel like the drive is it's just fun to see it grow and for it to keep building and doing well.\n\n(00:31:17):\nThis reminds me, there's a quote that Will Smith shared once that I think you'll like. Someone asked him what it's like to be famous, and he's like, \"Really awesome as you're going up to fame. Pretty okay as a famous person. Really bad when you lose that fame.\" And that's how it feels with the growth of this thing. It's just like growth is up. Oh, life's good, and then it starts to stall. I'm like, oh, no, it's all going to fall apart. So I think that's where a lot of that comes from for me. It's just like, oh, what's next? I got to, let's see what else I can do here.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:31:44):\nWell, how do you feel about yourself when you're on that growth trajectory?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:50):\nI feel great.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:31:52):\nSay more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):\nI feel like I'm achieving and heading in a... Part of it is just fun. It's like fun to win. So it's just like, yeah, we're doing it. It's working.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:32:07):\nAnd when you're not growing, how do you feel about yourself?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:13):\nAbout myself. There's this sense that it's all over. Oh, maybe it's all going to fall apart, and maybe I'm not as good at this as I thought, and maybe-\n\nJerry Colonna (00:32:25):\nOkay, so stay in that spot for a moment. So imagine, and I don't know that this is true, but I can imagine that there's a little whispery voice in your head that's always there that says, \"Lenny, you're not as good as you think you are. In fact, Lenny, they might even find out.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):\nYep. Yeah, imposter syndrome.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:32:52):\nOh, shit. So by being busy and by being on that growth trajectory, that voice maybe sounds a little less persistent, maybe a little less loud. Now, I want to offer a different potential. What if you could enjoy the puzzle of trying to create something new, trying to create magic, something out of nothing, but it doesn't matter to your sense of self-esteem if you succeed or fail. What if what drove you was not quieting that voice, but what drove you was, oh, this is just fun? Seth Godin, who's a dear, dear friend of mine, talks about art projects.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):\nAlso a former podcast guest.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:33:57):\nSo what if you just approached the project as if it was an art project? I think it's going to show up this way. What if it turns out it's wrong? What if it's this? What if it's that? And your sense of self-esteem is not attached to the outcome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:16):\nWhat's interesting is that's how I started this whole thing. I had no intention of it being a career and way I make a living. It was just, this is cool, people seem to like it, I enjoy it. Let's just see where it goes. No expectations.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:34:28):\nAnd then what happened?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):\nAnd then it worked.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:34:30):\nIt became successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:31):\nThat's right. It worked out.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:34:33):\nRight. It became successful, meaning you developed an audience, meaning you developed a following.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:41):\nAnd then, income. That was a big part of it.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:34:43):\nAnd then you developed an income, and then the stakes went up, and then all of a sudden, my heart, the anxiety.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:54):\nNot quite that strongly. At times it is, but there's a bit of just, oh, wow, I am relying on this now. I can't just let it fall apart.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:35:03):\nBecause my life would fall apart if I let it fall apart.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:07):\nYeah, life would change in a big way if this whole thing ends.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:35:11):\nRight. Right. So what you're talking about, what we're talking about right now, remember before I said in Buddhism, we talk about self-delusion and attachment. Now, we're talking about attachment. When we become attached to the outcome, we inadvertently fuel our own suffering. When we become attached, and in this case, okay, I get it. There's a financial reality. This is important because it helps pay the bills, if it doesn't entirely pay the bills. Great. Got it. Fabulous. But really the deeper attachment is see, I'm not nothing. See, I'm not a nobody, I'm a somebody, and that's the source of the suffering.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):\nThat is so true. That is very much a part of what has driven me is I was always a very shy kid growing up, and I don't think people expected a lot of me except my mom and dad, I guess. And so, I always had the sense, I'll show them, I'll show them what I could do, and that's always, it's this chip on the shoulder thing that I know drives a lot of people.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:36:29):\nHow old are you, Lenny?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:30):\n43.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:36:30):\nOkay. So maybe now at 43, you can take in the fact that you are somebody regardless of what you do. What's your wife's name?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:48):\nMichelle.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:36:49):\nIs she going to love you even if the podcast fails?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):\nAbsolutely.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:36:55):\nWhat, is she an idiot? No, she's a smart person. The people who actually know you and care about you may be proud of your efforts, but their love for you is not dependent upon its success. And that's like a rewiring. Do you have children?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):\nYeah, we got a 22-month-old now.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:37:30):\nOh, mazel tov. That's wonderful. My children are 34, 32, and 28. So I'll speak like the old man that I am. When we take that test, that spelling test, and we stick it with magnets on the refrigerator, it's at a pride. The challenging message that we inadvertently can send to our children is that we only love them because they got an A on the spelling test. And so, it's really critically important that we as parents do our own internal work to convey that unconditional love that is our birthright as human beings. And we hold onto the goal because the goal is cool, because solving a puzzle is fun, because doing hard work and experiencing the reward from that is affirming, but your value as a human being is unshakable. Now, as a father, isn't that the feeling you want your child to have?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):\nAbsolutely. And there's a lot of parenting advice these days that helps you learn to do that. There's all these TikToks now, don't say good job. Just say good choice or great, hard work. Great job working hard on that.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:39:04):\nRight, right, right. I don't know how I feel about getting parenting advice from TikTok, but okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:12):\nI'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Luo (00:39:19):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:21):\nSo what is new with OneSchema, I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launch a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing and mapping and integrating CSV and Excel files.\n\nAndrew Luo (00:39:37):\nYes. So we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema file feeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema?\n\nAndrew Luo (00:40:11):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:32):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:40:46):\nJust to close loop on this, I think as people hear this, I feel like, okay, cool, everything falls apart. Sure, my parents will love me, my wife will love me, they won't think less of me. However, it's nice to get that really nice couch and that nice hotel and the income, the comfort that comes with income at a certain level is hard to give up. How do you help people get past that that might go away and feel comfortable?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:41:09):\nWell, the good news is, and again, this is a Buddhist reference. The good news is there's a wisdom tradition that teaches all about this. So very briefly, the Buddhist story is in his mid-30s, he wakes up to the truth of birth, old age, sickness, and death. Birth, old age, sickness and death. And he wanders into the forest and he becomes a wandering mendicant and he becomes a holy man, and he's still not satisfied. And as I like to tell the story, one day he decides, fuck it, I'm just going to sit under the Bodhi tree and I'm not going to move until I figure this shit out. And so, he sits and sits and sits, and the story is he sat for 40 days living on a single grain of rice every day because always right, crazy stuff.\n\n(00:42:05):\nAnd when he woke up, he woke up to the four noble truths and the four noble truths are life is filled with suffering, that which we do to push away suffering increases suffering. The third noble truth is that there's an end to suffering. That's a really important one. And the fourth noble truth is what's known as the eightfold path to the end of suffering.\n\n(00:42:34):\nSo let's focus on the second noble truth because that's really what you're talking about. When we acquire that nice couch, when we buy that nice house that stretches our income to its maximum, if we're doing it to enjoy the couch or the house, then A-OK. But if we're doing it because we're trying to push away the suffering of am I good enough to be loved, to feel safe, and that I belong, that which we do to push away suffering will increase suffering. And in this case, oh my God, what if they take my house away from me? Oh my God, what if I fall backwards down that staircase of life? Oh my God, what if all of those people who have signed up to my Substack suddenly disappear? You see how the attachment becomes that source of suffering? You see how the thing that we do to make ourselves feel better in fact fuels the tenuous hold that we have on our OK-ness? I'm okay just as I am. I'm okay.\n\n(00:44:03):\nIt all comes down to why we're doing what we're doing. Now, to be clear, this is hard for me. I think it's hard for everybody. When my first book came out, Dan Harris, who's a really good friend and client from 10% Happier said to me, \"Don't read the Amazon reviews.\" The truth is, I've read two reviews. I read it in the first hour after it was released, and I've never read a review since because there's no way I can experience those reviews without becoming attached to how people feel. So thank you. I'll put it over here and I'll just stay focused on the experience that I get from writing.\n\n(00:45:04):\nAnd yes, do I want to sell thousands of books? Do I want people to feel moved by my writing? I do, but you know who gets the most out of my writing? Me, because when I sit down, this is my file folder for whatever I might do for our next book, what I'm trying to do is answer questions that I have. For example, Captain Chaos is running the country right now. What is it that the world is going to need two or three years from now? And what's my contribution to that world? Now, just as I say that, how does that feel to you? It's kind of settling. So I know that in order for me to feel good about my existence on this planet, I have to ask myself these questions and I have to attempt to answer these questions. Whether it turns into a book that people buy or not is secondary, I have to do this work regardless.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:22):\nThat super connects with exactly again, the way I started this whole thing is I started writing just to crystallize my own thinking, and it ends up being useful to other people.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:46:33):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:35):\nPeople hear this and they're like, why would I want to give up this great couch and house and car and all these things? That's really hard. And risking that by just doing something that feels good versus it'll make income, but it actually works. That's what I found. If you focus on a thing that is useful to yourself and interesting and not come at it from how do I make the most amount of money and turn this into whole thing, but more just, this is really interesting. I'm going to see where this goes. It will work for me.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:47:00):\nLenny, you implicitly asked a how question a few minutes ago. How do I do this? How do I do this radical self-inquiry? And I asked, I responded by offering a few questions. Let's build upon that for a moment, because what you are articulating right now is in the process of asking those questions, you can go back to what Simon Sinek would say is your why. You could go back to your core principle. You could go back to the centerpiece within you, which is what do I believe to be true about the world and how do I want to be in that world? You know what animates me right now is a question? With my children being fully fledged adults, I am really focused on what kind of ancestor to my descendants would I like to be? 20 years from now, 30 years from now, 40 years from now, I'll be gone. What would I like those who follow after me to believe to be true about me?\n\n(00:48:11):\nAnd you just paused. I can tell from the Adam's apple jumping up and down, that that question landed for you. It's a question of legacy. It's a question of meaning and purpose. At the end of my days, this is a question in Reboot, at the end of my days, what would I like the people who come after me to say about me? And what I want people to say about me is that he gave a shit about the world, he cared, and he tried, and he was kind. Those are the things that matter to me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:00):\nI'm always reminded of that frame of reference when I go to a funeral and people reading the eulogy and the old advice of what do you want your eulogy to say and making that your mission. But on the flip side, there's this viral video of Mike Tyson. Someone was coming up to him I think before his big match recently, and asked him about his legacy, and he's like, \"I don't give a shit about my legacy. It's just a made up thing that doesn't matter.\" So let me just ask you this. Why is it important to think about legacy? Does legacy even matter? We're dead. What's the difference?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:49:33):\nFar be it for me to criticize Mike, and don't hit me Mike, because even as an old guy, I wouldn't want to be hit by Mike Tyson. I don't know what's behind his response, but I can tell you what's true for me. I made oblique reference to Captain Chaos in the world as it is right now. The world's a tough place right now. We live in a world where it's almost normalized that a teenager will shoot other teenagers in school. It's almost normalized that people are dragged off to jail. Something is happening, something that's really disturbing.\n\n(00:50:28):\nNow, to be clear, we've always had disturbing times. I mean, I was reminded recently, I'm reading a book called Soldiers and Kings, which I highly recommend, which is about human smuggling from Central America into the United States, and it's an extraordinary book. And in reading that, I was reminded of policies that the US government has used over the years, whether it's supporting dictators in Central America or other sorts of things, things that I oppose, that feel immoral, if not directly immoral.\n\n(00:51:15):\nWhy does this come up for me? I can't shake the feeling that someone down the line in my lineage is going to ask of me, \"And what did you do, grandpa? And what did you do, great grandpa?\" I know what I want that answer to be, which is I tried. Lenny, God gave me the ability to put two sentences together in a way that people listen. I feel a moral responsibility to use that God-given gift to help create the world, that I would like to see, a world of kindness and empathy, a world where poverty is diminished, a world where people feel safe however the fuck they identify. I don't give a damn. So is that my legacy? Yeah, and maybe there's some ego implicit in that, but can I go on for just a bit on this?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:54):\nAbsolutely.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:52:55):\nAt the end of Reboot, I write about this moment, and in this moment I am in Marin County. My wife Allie and I are together. And I'm once again torturing myself with this question. Have I been a good man? I drive myself crazy with that question. Have I been a good father? Have I been a good partner? Have I been a good man? And she says, in a very frustrated way, \"All right, already. Enough. You're a good man. Stop.\" And so, I go for a walk, and as I'm walking, I encounter this toppled over oak tree and the roots are all torn up and you've seen trees like this, and clearly the tree died and clearly a wind came and clearly knocked the whole thing down. And I look at the tree and I say to myself, \"Here lies a good man.\"\n\n(00:53:57):\nAnd I liken myself to this toppled over oak tree, and I imagine that that tree had lived its life with its limbs gnarled and twisted by actions that it should have taken and actions that it shouldn't have taken, but good choices and bad choices. But that for the majority of its 75, 80 years, it lived into its purpose of providing shelter and shade for those that may have come from beneath it. And I make this point that at the end of my days, I want to be like this tree just slowly dissolving into the earth, having done the best job I could of being purposeful. I feel better. My suffering is eased when I can lean into that, which then makes me able to be present for the other person, whether it's a coaching client, whether it's a podcast conversation, whether it's just going for a walk with one of my children. I just feel better, and I think I am a better person when I think about things like that. So far be it from me to disagree with Mike Tyson, but I think he's wrong.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:34):\nGood callback. It sounds like The Giving Tree to me.\n\nJerry Colonna (00:55:38):\nOh, yes, yes. Shel Silverstein.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:43):\nTo give people something to do with this area of legacy. How did you approach coming up with figuring out what you wanted your legacy to be? Are there some questions you asked? Is there something you recommend folks do to help think through this for themselves?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:55:57):\nWell, it's delightful that we've ended up here because I think that I'm still working through those questions. As I said before as we both connected with, I use my writing to find my way to answers to questions. So part of what I'm dealing with right now is, look, I'll turn 62 this year. That feels old, but it also feels settled. And part of what I'm trying to figure out is what do I want my elderhood to be like? And I'll be honest, I'm enjoying this time of my life where I'm finding myself being a voice of comfort, being a voice of maybe even sanity in a time where that feels really insane and challenging. So maybe that's what my legacy will be. I'm not 100% sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:03):\nIs this maybe hinted the new book you're working on? Is this the topic you're thinking about or is this not?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:57:09):\nYeah, and other things. That's right. That's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:15):\nSpeaking of the world being very crazy right now, you talked about your kids, AI is very top of mind for a lot of people in particular. It's stressing a lot of people out. In a lot of ways, it's quite unsettling in future careers, in skills, people-\n\nJerry Colonna (00:57:29):\nIt is unsettling, isn't it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:31):\nQuite unsettling, but there's a world where we don't need humans in the future, potentially. Just what advice do you share with clients to help them work through this period of worry with the future, with AI being the core of it?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:57:45):\nWell, if we go back to the equation for a moment, I think it's really important that we actually talk about these things. I would say a year ago, I likened it to the experience that I had. Remember, I'm old enough to remember when not everything had an IP address. Now, our refrigerators have IP addresses. I mean, it's freaking crazy. I'm old enough to remember when you had to install an IP stack into your personal computer in order to connect to the web. That's how old I am.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:22):\nDid you have the phone modem where you had to put the phone?\n\nJerry Colonna (00:58:26):\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. It was a big, big deal to go from 1,200 baud to 2,400 baud to 56K. Oh my God, it was like a rocket ship. A year ago, I thought we were going through a similar kind of transition. We're clearly not. This is different. And in the coaching therapeutic world, everybody's like, \"Oh my God, ChatGPT is going to replace me.\" And I don't know, maybe. What I am finding is... I wear glasses. So for those of you who are only listening to the audio, you may find that news. What I am finding is in my own life, it's like I have put on a pair of glasses that are really, really sharp and helpful, and it is disturbing and unsettling because I think it does challenge this question of what is our role as human beings?\n\n(00:59:46):\nNow, what I come back to, and I could be wrong, but what I come back to is we're talking through a medium, a mediated experience. My signal is bouncing up into the sky and to a satellite. I won't name the company, it's coming back down. I don't know what your access is. We're using this platform or a site to record this, but somehow we're still finding the capacity to be present for one another in a heart-to-heart way.\n\n(01:00:30):\nAnd so, when I look at these phenomena, what I lift up is that. What I am hopeful about is that that which does not matter in the experience of being human gets burned away and is taken care of, call it by AI, but that that which matters, which is presence and connection, human-to-human contact, strategic thinking, formulation, you want to talk about it in terms of engineering, the conceptualization, that that gets elevated and our skills get better at doing that. And in the most optimistic point of view, what ends up happening is we spend more time on that which matters, and less time on that which doesn't matter. And I could be completely wrong and we could all be out of work and making sure that the robots are well-oiled, and that becomes our purpose.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:47):\nAlong these lines of glasses and even coaching, the world of coaching, there's a really interesting use case I saw today that Dan Shipper shared that I think you'd love, which is now that ChatGPT has memory, remembers everything you've said, and you can think back, you can ask it, \"What are blank spots in the way I see the world that I'm not seeing?\" You could also upload all your chat transcripts from your meetings and ask it what could you do better in meetings?\n\nJerry Colonna (01:02:14):\nLook, one of my colleagues in the coaching company, he has uploaded, he kept all of his journal entries, I think over 10 years journal entries from Evernote, and he uploaded that. I think he uses Claude, and he's asked Claude to highlight things. What am I not saying that I need to say? What am I saying that's not being heard? He's asked it to reflect back, and I think it's been incredibly helpful for him. I think the result is that he is a better coach, which is interesting, because the feeling is, well, does this replace it? I am finding, I'm using ChatGPT really as a writing and thinking partner in a way that I did not have before, and I'm still using my live real human writing buddies, which are really important to me. Where does this all end up? I had no idea. It is unsettling, it's uncanny, and it's also enlivening and exciting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:31):\nWell put. I love that you can ask these hard questions of Claude/ChatGPT, these questions that make you really scared could ask it what are the answers, and even not have to do the hard work and maybe get a better answer. I doubt that that will give you the best answers.\n\nJerry Colonna (01:03:47):\nWell, what it might do, which I think would be wonderful, is it might give you more questions to ask yourself. I'm a huge fan of powerful questions and the answer I give to a question like what am I not saying that I need to say? That question, you can ask yourself that question every single day. The question of how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? You can ask yourself that question every single day. To take a step back, the subtitle of my first book is Leadership in the Art of Growing Up. The Art of Growing Up is a practice. It's not a scientific moment where one day you wake up and you're done. It's an ongoing practice of not continuous improvement, but continuous inquiry that can feel exhausting when you contemplate it, but enlivening when you live it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):\nAll this, some people may think of as this whole idea of growth mindset. I know that you're not a big fan of this term, that it's used in a harmful way a lot of times. Can you just talk about that why you find that growth mindset as a concept isn't necessarily useful?\n\nJerry Colonna (01:05:18):\nHere's what I have a problem with. First of all, having a growth mindset is a very, very helpful thing. What I have a problem is in having and how we can turn a notion like a growth mindset into a fixed mindset, which is, it's this funny little trick the ego does, and the ego says, \"Okay, well, this is a growth mindset. Oh, this is not a growth mindset. Okay, then this is good. This is not good. This is bad. This is...\" What Buddhism has taught me is that everything's falling apart all the time even our growth mindset. When we get too fixed on the proper way to do things, we're setting ourselves up for attachment and therefore suffering. So if you can hold something like a mindset loosely with that attachment, go for it. Have a blast. Enjoy it. But the minute you start to nail it down to the floor and say this is the way it ought to be, I ought to always have a growth mindset, you've become fixed. And that's what the ego does.\n\n(01:06:48):\nTo be more explicit about it from a business context for example, the great business writer Peter Senge says, \"It is virtually impossible to challenge the assumptions that made you rich in the first place.\" So think about it in our experience of starting a business. We have what the Zen Buddhist would say, beginner's mind, all things are possible. And then, we experience, you were talking about it a little before, a little bit of success, and the ego, which is so terrified of not having success, start to say, \"Aha, this is the way to do it.\" And then, we start to deviate from that because life happens and then the anxiety starts. So the question is, how do you hold a growth mindset loosely knowing that you ought to stay present to the world as it is, respond to the changing dynamics, figure out what's next because that's the growth. So put succinctly, stay attached to the growth and hold mindset a little loosely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:07):\nI love that. It reminds me of advice. I did a meditation retreat once, and there's always a sense with Buddhism, and it's interesting how often Buddhism and advice from Buddhist teachings comes up on this podcast by the way.\n\nJerry Colonna (01:08:18):\nWhen the student is ready, the teacher will appear. You are inviting it in, but keep going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:25):\nThat makes sense as you say that. Interesting. So there's this fear I think people have with Buddhist teachings that you will not be as ambitious and you will not achieve as much if you're not attaching.\n\nJerry Colonna (01:08:41):\nIf you're not anxiously chasing something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:42):\nYeah, exactly. If you're just like, \"Why do I need that? I don't need to be the CEO of the VP because like, oh, I won't attach to that.\" And then, so people fear that downside. So I asked this question at this retreat and the advice they shared there was don't attach to this idea, but just point your cart in that direction and head there.\n\nJerry Colonna (01:09:02):\nYeah, I like that. Look, the fear you're talking about is the fear of complacency. And if we look at the structures of the mind and we look at our socialization, the way we're socialized to ward off complacency is anxiety. And so, if we go back to some of the things we were saying before, if I grow up believing that the way I'm going to make my parents love me is by achieving, then if I become complacent, then what's at risk is their love for me. So just like we made the connection before where unconditional love exists, unconditional positive regard for self, otherwise known as self-compassion can be a powerful motivator, especially when you get to the point where you say, \"As painful as it is for me to write, I enjoy writing. I enjoy working out. I enjoy pushing myself. I don't necessarily enjoy it in the moment.\" But I certainly, when I look at two books on my desk and I say, \"You know what? That feels good. That makes me happy.\"\n\n(01:10:43):\nTo me, the ability to hold the seeming contradiction of those things is a hallmark of my adulthood. It's to get satisfaction out of hard work for me is a much greater motivator than fear of complacency. As I've sort of slip-slided my way into that place, I have found... I work seven days a week. I don't have to, but I enjoy it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:29):\nThere's another, maybe a last area I want to spend some time on, which is around teams and what often causes trouble for teams. What breaks teams? What breaks companies? You have this point, you make that it's rarely lack of talent on the team, lack of strategy, lack of execution, that it's something else. What is that something else? What often do you find as the source of the problem for teams that aren't working?\n\nJerry Colonna (01:11:56):\nWell, it's the unresolved, I'll be dramatic with the language, demons from their childhood. It's the unsorted baggage. Here's what happens. Teams are groups, and there are group dynamics that always happen. There is the scapegoat, there is the truth-teller who has to say, \"Let me tell you what's really wrong with everything going on.\" Without the individual's radical self-inquiry skills, groups tend to be condemned to repeating patterns oftentimes of their family of origin.\n\n(01:12:40):\nI'll tell you a quick story. There's a very famous software blogger, blogger-owned software that I coached for many years, and we were doing an executive team meeting, and something happened in the group as we were talking that I observed once, twice, and three times, and finally, I said, \"Okay, guys, I'm seeing something happen here. Every time we get close to talking about something that's really painful, somebody makes a joke and all the energy disappears and everybody laughs and everybody's nice.\" And as soon as I said it, my client who was CEO at the time said, \"Jesus Christ, that's just like my family.\" It was like, yes, that's just like your family.\n\n(01:13:35):\nCarl Jung once said, \"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.\" Let's apply it here. Until you make conscious the unconscious patterns operating in the group, the group will continue to repeat those patterns and you will blame somebody in the group. Romantic relationships from a Buddhist perspective, part of what we do in romantic relationships is we find the perfect foil for us to work out our unconscious phenomena. When we join a group, when we form up in teams and organizations, we are unconsciously finding the perfect foils for us to work out our own shit. So if you want to create a high-functioning team, do your work, and it starts with the person who has the most power in the group. If that person refuses to do their work, the entire group will become a manifestation of early dysfunction in the individual's lives. Does that make any sense?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:59):\n100%. And this comes up a number of times on this podcast, just the impact the leaders issues have on the rest of the team, and also just this idea that the conditions they're trying to avoid are the conditions they invite in because they're avoiding.\n\nJerry Colonna (01:15:14):\nThat's it. That's it. One of my favorite teachers and dear friends is Parker Palmer, and he builds on, I think it was Socrates who said, \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\" And he builds on that and makes a joke, and he says, \"But if you choose to live an unexamined life, please don't take a job that involves other people.\" And that's it. You have a responsibility to examine your own shit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:43):\nSo say you're on this team, so there's two sides of this. You're on a team, the leaders clearly got some stuff that they need to work through, but they're not. Is there something you can do there other than just, \"Hey, please, this is hurting us?\" And then from the leader's perspective listening to this, what should they do? Is it get a coach? What can you do?\n\nJerry Colonna (01:16:01):\nSo for the one who has less power?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:04):\nYeah.\n\nJerry Colonna (01:16:05):\nOne of the things to ask oneself is what draws me to this position in the first place? How have I been complicit, not responsible in creating the conditions I say I don't want. How have I benefited from the dysfunction that exists in this organization? And benefit is a funny word. It doesn't necessarily mean I'm making more money. It means, for example, a benefit might be, boy, this feels familiar. I always find myself working on teams that are dysfunctional in this way. What is there in that experience for me to learn? So that's one thing.\n\n(01:16:55):\nYou asked about the person who has power. You were using the word leader. I will talk about power, and you threw out, well, should they get a coach? Let's put it into larger context. Should you examine your life with radical self-inquiry? Yes. I would argue that the more power you have, the more moral responsibility you have to actually pause and figure out what it is that you're doing to be complicit in creating the conditions you say you don't want.\n\n(01:17:28):\nTo be a very quick example what I'm talking about. A couple of years ago, I was doing a talk at a venture firm's CEO portfolio summit, the portfolio company's CEO summit. And we're sitting in a room, and of course I'm walking around again with shoes off and whatever, and people are firing questions at me. And one woman says, \"Well, I'm the CEO of this 15-person company, and I have a question for you. Why is it that nobody on my team can make a decision without me?\" And I said, \"Who hired them?\" And she, \"Well...\" I said, \"Okay, how does it make you feel when they make a decision that you disagree with?\" She said, \"I'm furious.\" \"Well, how can you hire people whom you expect to make decisions without running them through you if you can't tolerate them making a decision that you disagree with?\"\n\n(01:18:37):\nYou want to build a scaled leadership team, you have to be willing to have them make boneheaded decisions. And that's really, really hard, especially if we're \"in founder mode\" driving all the decisions. So that's your growth edge. We were talking about before about growth mindset. That's your growth edge. How can I be with the people in my life making boneheaded decisions about something that I care so much about and what is the best way for me to be in relationship about that?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:18):\nSo much of this comes back to that question we started this with of just how are you complicit in creating the conditions you don't want? A big takeaway for me here, and it just keeps coming up and again and again, is if you're struggling as a leader, if your company's not working as well as you wanted to, if you're having a hard time with your team, going back to that equation, it's not about building more skills like public speaking skills or email skills, or I don't know, financial skills. It's self-awareness, radical self-inquiry, understanding what drives you, what makes you happy. Is that generally correct?\n\nJerry Colonna (01:19:51):\nLenny, I was just going to say, you just made me so happy you saying what you just said. Yes. I've been coaching now, as I said for a couple of decades. Before that, I was a VC for 15, 17 years. What you just said is the wisdom of my 40 years as an adult. That's it. This is why radical self-inquiry is so damned important because it leads to a little bit less suffering and a lot more resilience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:28):\nFor folks that want to actually do that, well, they can rewind back to the middle of the episode where we actually ask the questions that are associated with the radical self-inquiry, and then obviously if they want to dig deeper, they can buy your book.\n\nJerry Colonna (01:20:41):\nOr 10 copies of the book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:43):\nOr 100 copies for everyone at the company willing to Amazon. Jerry, is there anything else that we haven't touched on that you think is really important for people to hear maybe as the last piece of wisdom?\n\nJerry Colonna (01:20:57):\nNow one of the hopes that I have you ask me at the start like what would be my hope is that we ended up being closer and friends, and I feel that. Let me extend that out to everybody. What I always hope from all of these intimate conversations that I try to do in podcasts is that people walk away going, \"Geez, I'm not alone.\" We've made different references to the fact that it's a hard time. The truth is it's always a hard time. And what makes it hardest is to feel like I'm the only one who's going through this. So what I appreciate about what you do, Lenny, is that under the guise of talking about product, you're really talking about the process of being human. And that is a mitzvah. That's a good deed. And so, I hope in the process of listening to this, people walk away going, \"Okay, I feel a little bit better today.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:04):\nI really appreciate that. The way I think about these sorts of conversations and episodes, I call them Trojan Horse episodes where people come for the other stuff, tactical, practical stuff, and then they get stuff they really need to hear. And so, I appreciate you. Jerry, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJerry Colonna (01:22:19):\nThank you for having me. It was a delight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:22):\nSame for me. Bye, everyone.

It's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful way in a short term. Ultimately, you want to find a short-term metric you can measure that drives a long-term output.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):\nYou mentioned the early team. I felt extreme ownership.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:00:34):\nYes, you are a data scientist, but your goal is to figure out what's happening. And if that means that you're going to pick up the phone and call customers, then that is what you're going to do to roll up your sleeves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):\nToday my guest is Jessica Lachs. Jessica is Vice President of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, which has built one of the biggest and most impactful data teams in tech. She's been at DoorDash for over 10 years and was the first GM at DoorDash responsible for launching new markets. Previously, Jessica founded GiftSimple, a social gifting startup and began her career in investment banking at Lehman Brothers.\n\n(00:01:11):\nIn our conversation, we go deep on how to build and scale your data org, including why a centralized org model is so effective. What to look for when hiring data people, how to pick the right metrics for teams to align incentives and drive the right sorts of outcomes. Examples of how the data team at DoorDash has helped the business make better decisions, a bunch of great stories about the early days of DoorDash and a ton more.

It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and helps the podcast tremendously.\n\n(00:01:44):\nWith that, I bring you Jessica Lachs. Jessica, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:01:55):\nThank you so much for having me. I'm very excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:58):\nSo you've built one of the largest and most respected data teams in all of tech. I've heard from a number of people that look to you for advice when they're trying to build and scale their data teams. And then DoorDash in particular is an incredibly complex business. There's three or maybe even four sites to the marketplace. There's this operational element. From the outside, it just feels extremely complicated and wild. I imagine from the inside it's even more wild. Let's talk about some of the things you've learned about building and scaling the team. You have a fairly contrarian perspective on how to structure data teams. This was referenced when we had Elizabeth Stone on the podcast too. She approaches data the same way. So I'd love to hear just your take on how to structure data teams within companies.\n\n(00:02:42):\n This episode is brought to you by Webflow. We're all friends here, so let's be real for a second. We all know that your website shouldn't be a static asset. It should be a dynamic part of your strategy that drives conversions. That's business 101. But here's a number for you. 54% of leaders say web updates take too long. That's over half of you listening right now. That's where Webflow comes in. Their visual-first platform allows you to build, launch, and optimize webpages fast. That means you can set ambitious business goals and your site can rise to the challenge. Learn how teams like Dropbox, IDEO, and Orangetheory trust Webflow to achieve their most ambitious goals today at webflow.com.\n\n(00:03:30):\nThis episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams, and the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time-consuming, expensive, and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations or you can use an all-in-one document SDK.\n\n(00:04:04):\nMost product managers will tell you, \"Paperwork sucks.\" Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand's style, and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features. For your users paperwork often starts with an AI-powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's drag-and-drop builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy-to-understand documentation.\n\n(00:04:46):\nBuild documents software fast with Anvil, that's useanvil.com/Lenny to learn more or start a free trial. That's useanvil.com/Lenny.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:04:59):\nThere's two main things that I think are important when you're structuring a team. The first is I believe that analytics should have a seat at the table just like engineering and product and the business folks, the operators. For me, analytics is a business impact driving function and not purely a service function. I think there are analytics teams at other companies where they are answering people's questions, maybe even through Jira tickets, we're building dashboards. That was never really of interest to me. That wasn't the team that I wanted to build.\n\n(00:05:35):\nFor me, it's about finding opportunities, about having a point of view on the decisions that we should make, not just answering the why but answering the so what. \"So what do we do now that we know this?\" And so that's definitely one thing as far as my point of view on building a data team. I think the second thing which may be a little more contrarian is I think there are people out there who think that analytics should be embedded into business units. I strongly disagree. I believe a central model, a center of excellence is superior and I'm happy to talk about why, but that's something that I feel quite strongly about. We've tried it or I shouldn't... well, we've experimented in the past with the alternative, so putting it into a business unit and it's just much more problematic and I think the value you get from a central model is far greater than some of the things that you might lose.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:36):\nYeah, let's definitely talk about it. And just to make sure people understand, when you say central versus embedded, is that in terms of reporting lines, in terms of their goals?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:06:44):\nIt's a great question. So mostly it's in terms of reporting lines because I think on the goal side, that is something where we have the same goals that our partner teams have, and I think that that's actually an important part of a successful central model. So when I say central model, it just means that for marketing analytics, marketing analytics is part of the broader analytics team. It does not sit and report in through marketing. Just to clarify.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:13):\nGot it. So the reporting functions at some companies, there's the head of marketing or some partners to the head of marketing where the data, say, analyst or biz ops people or data scientists would report potentially to them and that's it. And they're not as connected to the core, to the rest of the data team, the rest of the analytics team versus-\n\nJessica Lachs (00:07:30):\nExactly. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:31):\nYeah.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:07:31):\nSo you'd have a bunch of smaller, of course, data teams that sit embedded within the functions. And I understand why business leaders like that. You're embedded within the function, so you're a part of the team. That ownership, that camaraderie that comes with that, I think you can solve for that. But I do understand that that is a benefit. I think the other benefit of course is the business leaders control the roadmaps so they get to dictate the work. They know that they have help and resources in that area when they need them. So that certainty, that control, I totally understand the value there, but I think that those are two things that you can solve for if you know that those are the biggest issues with a central team. So for us, we have a central analytics team, but we are divided up into pods that map perfectly with how product engineering, operations marketing are structured as well.\n\n(00:08:33):\nAnd so our team de facto has these folks embedded with our partner teams, even though the reporting structure is up through a central org through me. And that helps the team to feel like they are one team, both in terms of the analytics team feeling like it's one team, but also to use the marketing example, the marketing folks are one team and because the analytics shares the same goals as the marketing leaders, your incentives are aligned to work on the most important things and your success is their success and vice versa. So I think that that's been really a happy medium, but still preserves all the benefits of a central org. And there are a lot of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:23):\nI want to hear about them, but I think something that some people may think when you say essential org is like a silo data team that sits there and they're like a service org a little bit within the company. It's like, \"Hey, I need some data help.\" And you try to convince that, \"Hey, I need some help on this thing.\" And that's not what you're saying.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:09:41):\nOh, no. No, no, no. That job seems terrible. I don't want that job. No, to the earlier point, we have a seat at the table. We are business partners, we are thought partners with our product counterparts, with our engineering counterparts, with our ops counterparts, and we again, share the same goals and have the same initiatives that they do. And it's just our job to come at it from a data-driven place. We bring to the table insights on things that we've noticed, deep dives that we do to understand the problems that we're trying to solve better. If we need to grow, what are the most efficient ways to grow? What are the trade-offs that we have to make? Where are their pockets of opportunity? That is what I expect my team to be able to bring to that table, the proverbial table, that we want to see that. And in order to earn their spot, that's the deal. We get the seat at the table and we need to earn it by bringing opportunities that we all can go and go after.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:52):\nAwesome. So in a sense, it is embedded. They're embedded in cross-functional teams across the org, but they report up to essential org to you essentially in the end?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:11:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:02):\nCool. What are some of the benefits of this approach?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:11:05):\nOh, there's so many. Okay, so the first thing is a consistent and high talent bar. I think this is something I saw when we would have some pockets of analytics folks embedded is having a consistent bar for talent in terms of what we're looking for, what are the technical skills, what are the soft skills? And being able to evaluate candidates with that same bar, using our same rubric. You just get more consistent and higher talent in my opinion. I think that's number one. Number two is actually growth opportunities. So if you're siloed, you may be the most senior data person within... I keep picking on marketing. But you might be the most senior data scientist within marketing. Where do you go from there? I think when you have the central org, you're able to see if there are growth opportunities in other areas within the company.\n\n(00:12:04):\nAnd so that really helps folks to stay engaged because they can look at new problems if the problems they've been working on for several years are getting maybe boring and they want something new, there's an opportunity, move from marketing over to merchant analytics. And then I think similarly, if there isn't a promotion or room to grow, if you want to be a people manager and there just isn't a people management role within your functional area, well, you've got 10 other ones to look at and maybe there is that opportunity. So I think it helps with the growth opportunities for the team, which helps to retain talent. So that's a second thing. The third thing is just consistency of methodologies and metrics. So you don't have sales that was as defined by one team and sales as defined by another team. You just have sales and everybody is using the same metrics, the same methodologies, and you're able to improve your methodologies with input from more people.\n\n(00:13:10):\nAnd rather than recreating the wheel, building the same churn prediction model on six different teams. You can instead build one and have the input of six different teams. I think that's definitely another benefit. Also helps you just scale because you start to see the same problems across teams and so you're like, \"Ooh, this is an issue that we need to get ahead of. This is something we need to automate,\" or, \"This is something that we need to improve upon,\" or, \"a problem that is going to grow as our business, as our teams scales.\" So I think it helps you see around corners a little bit more.\n\n(00:13:45):\nAnd then just lastly, there's a team culture brand. I think that's really important, not just externally for recruiting top talent, but the team is really proud to be members of the analytics team. We have a unique culture of learning, of sharing. You have someone you can go to talk about your challenges. You have someone who can peer review your work. I think just having that team culture that we have is really important. And it's a lot harder to get when you have the individual silos, particularly in an earlier stage when it's a smaller team, you just don't have as many people around. Everybody wants to have friends at work and we're creating an environment where they can find like-minded data nerds.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:33):\nIt makes me think about Airbnb's first data team. I don't know if you know Riley Newman well, but he built Airbnb's first data team and it was actually an analytics team. They called themselves the 'A-Team' on the point of culture, and that always felt a lot of fun and they loved being part of that team.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:14:49):\nYeah. We have the same, but now I feel a lot less special for coming up with that name.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):\nOh, you called it A-Team also?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:14:56):\nYeah, we got the A-Team, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):\nAnd then I think they moved away from it when there was a push. Now we're data scientists, we're not analytics or analysts. And that was like, I don't know, 10 year ago, like [inaudible 00:15:08] data science. We're data scientists.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:15:09):\nWe'll always be the A-Team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:11):\nThere's so many threads I want to follow here, one that's a tangent, but something that I think a lot of people struggle with is you talked about how you want your data team, your analytics team to be proactive, to find opportunities, to give you ideas, to help you figure out what to build, not just answer questions. At the same time, there are many questions that teams need to get answered. Do you have any advice for just how to set up a team where they both find time to explore, dig, show opportunities and come up with big ideas and also, \"Hey, we just need to figure out the funnel conversion on this thing,\" or \"Hey, what do you think? What's happening in China right now?\" Thoughts there?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:15:47):\nYeah, such a good question. I think it's something that never gets easier. You have to be very intentional to carve out time for exploratory work for deep dives because as you mentioned, there are always more questions and more work to be done than hours in the day. And so I think being intentional about it and setting goals for your team around finding these insights through self-directed work is an important mechanism for holding ourselves accountable to that goal because it tends to be the first thing that goes when you get a lot of inbounds, you're like, \"All right, well, let's deep dive on something that I don't know if it's really something. It could be high ROI, it could be low ROI, I don't know.\" So the expected value is lower than this known thing that I can deliver and make someone happy.\n\n(00:16:42):\nSo I think to prevent that time from just slipping away, you really have to be intentional. We would do hackathons for our team to carve out days to just go and look into these really interesting things and find opportunities. And I think we have the support of our business partners because so many great insights have come from these deep dives and it really has been some of the work that drives future roadmaps. So they're always really great at allowing us to have this time and actually encourage us often to have this time for some self-directed work, to go find the next big opportunity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:23):\nIf there's no answer that comes to mind, that's totally cool. But is there an example of one of these insights that someone on the data team came up with that led to something big for DoorDash that you're able to share?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:17:35):\nSo one interesting example was from a hackathon we did a couple of years ago where we were looking at referral as a channel for consumer acquisition. And when you compare that channel to others, it was below average in terms of the engagement you'd see from consumers who came through that channel and the payback period. And rather than just lowering spend on referrals and moving right along, we really wanted to understand what was happening. And so during the hackathon, we did a deep dive into referral. We actually tried referring each other. We tried committing referral fraud, creating new accounts to get around rules. And we uncovered a lot of fraudulent behavior through this deep dive. We ordered so many cupcakes to the office. I remember using referral credits because you had to place an order to be able to get the referral bonus. So we would create the account, place the orders, and we just kept ordering cupcakes.\n\n(00:18:39):\nAnd what we noticed was that referral as a channel was a bit misleading when you would look at the average in terms of payback and that it was really a bimodal distribution and you had one group of really great consumers who were referring other really great consumers, and the payback on those consumers was really strong. In fact, if that's all you saw, you would spend a lot more on that channel.\n\n(00:19:08):\nAnd then what was happening was you had this other group of consumers that were not as good people who were posting referral codes online and getting people who were just in it to get free discounts and credits. And we had at that point in time, pretty lax fraud rules. And we didn't have caps on these things. All of which came about from this deep dive where we found that this group of consumers was really a drag on the efficiency of this marketing channel. And so I think that's an example of a few things that we like to do at DoorDash. One being these deep dives and taking the time to really understand the problem and then ultimately make a bunch of recommendations for what we should do, including better fraud checks, caps on referrals, et cetera, et cetera. But also how the average can be incredibly misleading. And so looking at distributions and trying to break down what you're seeing to find ways that you can optimize in ways that you can gain in efficiencies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):\nThat's an awesome story, great memory to come up with that one. So this is a really good example of a way to carve out time for the data team to think long-term, think look for opportunities, find big ideas. So the hackathon is one idea. Imagine many data people are struggling often to push back on asks that are just like, \"h, we need to know. We just need this one thing. Here's a question, just answer this one question part.\" Do you have any advice to data to get better at pushing back? Sounds like a bit of cultural like, \"We have time, we need to work on these bigger things.\" But just any advice for data leaders or data ICs to find time for these sorts of things?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:20:59):\nYeah, saying no to someone is never fun. I think as a self-proclaimed people-pleaser, you don't want to say no, especially when it's something you can do and you know that you can very easily with maybe an hour's work, make someone happy. I think it's really important to establish a culture and for leadership to really establish the rules of working and that operating model so that some of the junior folks aren't forced to always have to say no. And I think one of the ways we do that is through our goaling. So because our goals are the same as our business partners, we're able to pretty easily say, \"Hey, we've got a limited amount of time. These are our goals. What are the most important things that we are going to work on this week or this month in order for both of us to hit our goals?\"\n\n(00:21:49):\nAnd so when something comes up to be able to say, \"Hey, this data poll that you want me to do, is this more important than these other three things that I was going to be working on? Yes or no?\" And I think sometimes people don't necessarily realize the trade-offs, and when you make them apparent and you put them front and center, they realize that, \"Oh, actually, you know what? That asset's not important. That can wait.\" So I think that that's definitely something I would recommend, which is always share the trade-offs. Don't suffer in silence with, \"How am I going to do all four of these things?\" Bring it up and say, \"Hey, this is what I was planning to do. If you want me to do this extra new thing, then one of these other things is going to have to drop.\n\n(00:22:36):\nI personally don't think that your ask is more important than these three things, but maybe there's new information, maybe there's context I don't have, so let's talk about it.\" Rather than just being like, \"No, I won't do that.\" That's not a great approach either. I think having the conversation and constantly reevaluating your prioritization to make sure you're working on the most important things or your team is working on the most important things is really good hygiene to have with your business partner. So some teams do that through a weekly standup like, \"Here's what we're going to do this week. Do we like this prioritization? Do we not?\" Some folks do it less formally than that. I think you got to figure out what works for you. But to the earlier point, it's a conversation with your engineering partner, your product partner, your ops partner, you're all on the same team, you're all trying to achieve the same goals and you're all incentivized to have your analytics team working on the most impactful things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:32):\nThis advice is great for any role basically. And if I were to summarize it to a couple words, it's just prioritize and communicate what your priorities are and then align on the trade-offs of shifting your priorities.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:23:45):\nEvery once in a while you just throw one over and say, \"You know what? This is quick. I'll do it.\" At least I do. I think sometimes just knock it out, build some goodwill. I think that that's also important. But usually it's not something you can do in five minutes and in that case it's that ruthless prioritization for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:05):\nAnd then there's also the side that you talked about of just show that you can provide value doing these things that are longer term, like prove your worth. \"Hey, look at all these opportunities I found for our team over time, I should keep spending time on these other areas,\" versus the on fire stuff.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:24:18):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:19):\nWhen you're hiring people for your team, I'm curious what you look for and you think is incredibly important that maybe other people aren't prioritizing as much. What do you focus on when you're hiring?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:24:31):\nYeah. So everybody needs to have a certain set of technical skills. I think that's a non-starter. We have a technical bar, we do a technical screen. So I think that's table stakes. There's some really unique characteristics that I've noticed when I look at some of the top talent that I've had on the team or have on the team. I think the first thing is just curiosity. You can't teach curiosity, or at least I haven't found a way to do it. If somebody else knows how, please let me know. Somebody who is just self-motivated to pull on the threads when they find them. So they don't just answer a question. They're like, \"Hmm, this thing seems a little odd. I'm going to dig in and look. Even though I could say I'm done, I answered the question, I did the thing I was going to do.\" The person that has that curiosity, something seems off, something doesn't really make sense and goes and proactively looks into what that is. That is just so valuable. So I really look for that curiosity and that self-motivation to do it without being told.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:39):\nHow do you test for that? How do you do that in an interview and get a sense of if they're good at that?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:25:43):\nOne way you can do it through the questions you ask is have something that is not quite right within the case that you're presenting and see if people notice first and foremost. And even if they don't, if you point it out like, \"Where do they go with that?\" I think that that's something that you can test for. I think you can also ask for examples that for these folks typically will highlight this, they'll talk about, \"I noticed this thing, and so we decided to investigate.\" So I think that there are ways that you can get that signal through the interview process, but it's really hard. I think testing for hard skills is a lot easier than testing for soft skills. And I think in some of the questions we ask, we'll ask a question with the idea that we're assessing something separate than what the question is necessarily asking. And I think that this is one example of where that really works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:47):\nYou said that you give them a case. What does that look like? What is the actual approach to how you do this interview?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:26:52):\nOur interview process has in the early stages a coding exercise. So we do our technical screen and a shortened version of a business case. So real world problem solving. Typically, it's something actually from DoorDash history, like a real problem that we had to see how people can problem solve on the fly. I think that that's an important skill to be able to have, which is, how do you take a problem, break it down, talk through it. A little bit like some of those consulting cases that you hear about, but something that's really rooted in real problems. And I think you can learn a lot from those types of cases where, yes, you get to see how people handle ambiguity and structured problem solving, but ultimately most people get something wrong. They make an assumption that's wrong because well, I would hope that the interviewer knows the business better than the interviewee.\n\n(00:27:56):\nAnd seeing how people react to being told they're wrong is a really important signal in my opinion. Seeing how people respond, how they're able to take new information and pivot, how they're able to make a decision. So that's another thing that I like to see in cases where, hey, you may not know the real right decision. You might say, \"Hey, I could see it going one way, I could see it going the other way.\" But I always push people to say, \"If you had to make a call right now, what would it be?\" So are people able to have a point of view without full information because that's life. Sometimes you have to just pick a direction and make a decision even though you don't have perfect information. So I like to see some of these softer skills and how they manifest throughout a case interview, even if it's not specifically what I'm asking with the literal problem we're solving in the case.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:57):\nAlong these lines, but in a different direction. You don't actually have a deep data science data background before you got into this stuff. I know you had some art background, you had an art portfolio back in school, and I think a lot of people wouldn't imagine that for someone being head of analytics for a company like DoorDash. I don't exactly know the question, but I guess is there anything there that you think would be interesting for people to know or hear?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:29:24):\nYeah, it's funny. I joke that I have a job I'd never be hired for because I don't have a traditional data science background. And I know that Elizabeth Stone on her podcast with you talked a lot about her non-traditional background for a CTO. So hey, maybe there's something to it. But I became a data scientist out of necessity. I completely self-taught in terms of SQL and Python and I did it because there was a need at DoorDash for someone to help figure out what the right goals were, how we set those goals, how we were performing different markets early in the DoorDash story, so 10 years ago at this point. And I think I just gravitated towards that type of work and Tony recognized that superpower in me even though I don't have that formal training. So yeah, I'm a bit of an artist for fun, but I guess a data scientist in practice or for career.\n\n(00:30:31):\nBut I think that that non-traditional background has been a great thing because I'm able to hire people who have the technical skills that I don't have, the folks with PhDs in statistics and the data scientists, machine learning and otherwise. I am able to hire those folks and yet keep them really focused on driving business impact because my background was on the finance side, and so I've always been a pragmatist. And for me, the purpose of our team is to drive business impact. And so the mix between the technical skills of the smarter people that I've hired, the smarter than myself, and my grounding in driving business impact has been a really great partnership.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:21):\nThat's quite an inspiring story for someone that is just starting out and doesn't necessarily have a lot of experience in data, but also just generally. I think this is a really cool example. You could be successful in a field that you don't have a ton of background in. I'm curious what you think it was in you that allowed you to succeed in this and get to where you are today. What do you think you did right or what is some habits or ways of thinking that you think helped you achieve that?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:31:52):\nFirst off, I have imposter syndrome like everybody else. So it's not like I have this crazy sense of confidence of like, \"Oh, I can do anything.\" I definitely have the same doubts that others have. I think part of it was probably not even realizing what I was doing. When you're at a startup and things are moving quickly and you see a problem, and I've always liked solving problems, so I was like, \"All right, how do I solve this problem?\" It was like, \"Oh, well, I need access to the data. I don't have access to the data. All right, I'll ask an engineer to get me the data. Well, this isn't going to scale. I can't always bother an engineer, so how do I figure out how to get the data myself? Well, let's learn Python.\" So I think it happened organically and I don't think I realized at the time what I was even doing.\n\n(00:32:41):\nAnd then I think if you think about things from first principles about what you need right now in front of you to unblock yourself or solve a problem, and you just focus on that instead of thinking about a global org that you're trying to build. I think that that helps. So for me, it was always about solving the problem in front of me the best way I could. And if that meant I needed to hire an engineer to report into me through the finance org, then that was what we were going to do and nobody was going to tell me I couldn't do it. So I think it's a belief in yourself, and ultimately it's just my desire to solve problems and figure out what has to get done is, I think, ultimately how it came about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:30):\nI love that so much. There's so many elements there that I think a lot of people can learn from. I feel like there's also this underlying current of you're just motivated for this to work. You wanted DoorDash to succeed, and you're just like, \"I will do what I need to do to make this happen. I need to solve these problems. I'm not going to overthink. Do I have the skills necessarily to do these things [inaudible 00:33:48]?\"\n\nJessica Lachs (00:33:48):\nYeah, I think I'm competitive. I think that's a trait that you find in a lot of early DoorDash folks and current DoorDash folks, to be honest, just wanting to win and being willing to do whatever you need to win. So roll up your sleeves, do something that's not your job. I think back to early days of taking out the garbage on Saturday nights because it needed to get done. I think that that was something that is ingrained in our culture from Tony Xu, from our founder and CEO, and I think that really resonated with me, and I feel like I've always operated that way as well. And I think that that helped me in my career to be able to do what I've done without really thinking about it too much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:40):\nAre there any other memories or stories of the early days of DoorDash that would be fun to share? Something that sticks with you of like, \"Wow, I can't believe that's what it was like?\"\n\nJessica Lachs (00:34:49):\nOh man, there's so many, including so many mistakes that we've made. But I think something that really stands out to me is before I moved to the analytics area, I was actually a GM. I was the first GM at DoorDash and I was in Boston in 2014 launching the city of Boston when nobody knew who we were. And we would wake up early in the morning, 5 A.M. and we would go out, it was the winter of 2014. We'd go out and we'd hand out promo codes consumers outside of the [inaudible 00:35:30] in Boston, and these promo cards would be attached to kind bars so people would take them. And the whole team, it was a small team, there were four of us, but the whole team would go out in the morning to do this. And I think back to our sales guy, shout out to Joey G. So Joe Graccio is our sales guy in Boston-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:47):\n[inaudible 00:35:47] Joey G.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:35:51):\nAnd he was gold on signing merchants on the platform.\n\n(00:35:55):\nThat was how he was gold. His compensation was tied to that. And yet in the morning when we would go out, he was with us handing out promo codes because he was part of the team because he wanted to win. We wanted to grow the business. And I think that that is just a great example of the culture that Tony and the early employees and Stanley and Andy, other co-founders really instilled in all of us early in those days. So I think that that ownership, that extreme ownership of the outcome is definitely one of the things.\n\n(00:36:32):\nI think the other is just being very customer first. And I say customer, I mean consumers, dashers and merchants as all being our customers. And the first time I ever went to the office headquarters in Palo Alto, which at the time was in an animal hospital. The first time I went there, there was a huge site outage and the whole company, it was like 20 people at the time, the whole company jumped online to do customer support, to answer the phones, to make sure that folks were getting refunds for orders that weren't going through, make sure the orders that were out there were getting delivered, just dropped everything and hopped on to do support.\n\n(00:37:15):\nAnd I was brand new, didn't really know how to use the tools, and so it was like, \"How can I be useful?\" And so back in those days, we used to order dinner to the office using DoorDash. And so in order to preserve about three dashers who would've had to deliver food to us, I was like, \"I'm going to go out, go out dashing, go get everyone pizza so that we could feed the masses doing credits and refunds and do what we had to to make sure that we were serving our customers well.\" And I think that night was one of the largest refunds as a percent of our bank account that we had ever given out. And I think Tony, there were two examples that he's talked about where we just gave a lot of money back to customers because it was the right thing to do because our service failed and we wanted to do right by them.\n\n(00:38:06):\nSo I think that those are two stories that stick out in my mind and really highlight culturally what makes DoorDash unique and what I think has been a really important part of our success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:20):\nIt reminds me of the story that Tony and all the early employees, and I imagine you did this just like, \"We're dashers,\" it's like a rotation where you dash for a while. Is that part of the culture?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:38:32):\nYeah, so we have a program, a WeDash program, and Keith Yandell, who's our chief business officer, did your podcast last year and he talked about this. But four times a year all the employees go out and go dashing or do customer support, and it's part of our culture that I love. I actually go pair dashing, so I go together with one of my colleagues. We've done it for years now, and it's a fun thing that we do together four times a year. Actually, usually more than that. And it's important because you get to use the product, you build empathy with all the audiences. I think all of us order DoorDash a lot, so we've built empathy with consumers. But being able to go and understand what it's like to go out dashing and when you're in the restaurant going and talking with merchants and seeing the experience from their point of view, I think it's just incredibly important. And of course we find a lot of bugs like, \"Hmm, this doesn't work the way it should, let me report this.\" So I think it's also just great for catching bugs in the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:43):\nThis episode is brought to you by Attio, a radically new type of CRM.

That's attio.com/Lenny.\n\n(00:40:39):\nI want to come back to a thread, something you mentioned where you and a lot of the early team had felt extreme ownership over the company and that's why a lot of this stuff happened. For people, every founder, every product team, they're going to like, \"Yes, we need that. Let's make sure everyone on the team feels extreme ownership.\" Is there anything that you think that the early team did to create that or is it hiring, just pick people that will have that feeling already, or is cultural?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:41:05):\nI think it's both. It's definitely cultural. I think it comes from the top and I think that Tony exhibits this extreme ownership and looks for it in others. So I think that helps. But I think even today I expect of my team that same extreme ownership over the outcomes. And so I'm more interested in our team figuring out how to solve a problem than the box that someone fits in like, \"I'm a data scientist and so I only do these things.\" Right? It's like, \"No. I mean, yes, you are a data scientist, but your goal is to figure out what's happening, and if that means that you're going to pick up the phone and call customers, then that is what you're going to do.\" And I think that expecting that and setting that as the norm for the team, this ownership of the outcome is something that we continue to do at DoorDash and instill in everyone whether you were early or just joined last month.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):\nIs there an example of that that comes to mind of someone practicing extreme ownership, like a data scientist calling someone or something along those lines?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:42:16):\nYeah, so I actually had a meeting yesterday morning with the team that's working on some of our affordability initiatives and we had shipped something that we expected to work, and it didn't. And instead of, \"You can dig into the data,\" to understand the segments of consumers that you would expect it to work with and those that it wouldn't, of course we did that. But ultimately it was like, \"I don't know why.\" And that's where qualitative research is superior to quantitative research, it's asking for the context, to actually talking to people to figure out what was the motivation, what worked, what didn't for them. And so the team, data scientists included, just sat and made phone calls. And so they were talking about what they found from those phone calls and that's going to inform future decisions. And I think rather than saying, \"Well, that's what the qualitative research team is supposed to do,\" it's like, \"No, no, no, that is what our team, anyone's team is supposed to do because that's what's needed to unblock us from this next test that we want to run because we need to know what we are testing.\"\n\n(00:43:23):\nSo I think that it happens every day. I think I really love when I see team members go outside the traditional bounds of what a data science role might be and do some product management work, do some engineering work. I think that that's part of what keeps the job interesting. I think it's part of what makes our team special is that that is not only allowed, it's encouraged, and probably also a reason why we've had folks who've gone from my team to the product org and to the ops org and to the finance org is because they get to do and experience parts of that job and get a good sense for what that's like and then realize it's something that they love. So I think it's definitely something we encourage at DoorDash.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:17):\nI love that. I want to move in a slightly different direction. One of your colleagues told me that you are incredibly good at defining metrics, which is so important to get right for a business, especially when it's complex at DoorDash. And I hear you're especially good at finding the right metric to drive the right incentive, especially when the business is really messy and things like that. So I'm just curious what you've learned about how to pick good metrics and align incentives well.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:44:45):\nI've learned a lot of things about metrics, mostly from bad metrics. I actually think you learn a lot from picking the wrong metric. Ultimately, you want to find a short-term metric you can measure that drives a long-term output. So people always talk about, \"Oh, we want to drive an improvement in retention.\" Retention is a terrible thing to goal on because it's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful way in the short term, and yet you want to be able to experiment and iterate quickly. So what are the things that drive retention? What are the inputs? So I think it's really important to find the right inputs, and then through experimentation test whether or not those short-term inputs are driving the long-term output that you're looking for. I think that's one thing. I think keeping things simple is another thing I've learned over the years, maybe it's data scientists, but they tend to love these composite metrics with a coefficient.\n\n(00:45:44):\n\"We're going to wait this input at X and this input at X+2.\" And then you end up with a metric that nobody really understands that doesn't actually mean anything. And you're like, \"I don't know if a 0.1 increase is it a lot? Is it good? Is it bad?\" So they're just hard to work with.\n\n(00:46:07):\nAnd so I always encourage folks, just pick something simple, even if it's not perfect and your composite would be more perfect. If people understand it, if they have an intuition around it, if it's something that people can talk about across the company, it's going to be a much better metric in terms of driving real outcomes than your made up composite score that nobody understands. So I think keeping things simple is also really important. And then I think the last thing I'll say is it's important to understand how metrics across the company equate to one another.\n\n(00:46:43):\nAnd so we spend a lot of time quantifying things in terms of a common currency. So for example, if I were to lower price by a dollar, what would I get in terms of, we'll say, volume? Well, what if I lowered delivery times by a minute? What do I get for that in terms of volume? And so now you can make trade-offs between maybe your marketing team and your logistics team because you have this common currency that everyone can talk about. And so we've done that. We've tried to quantify all of the levers of our business, price, selection, quality in common terms, so that if we have, say, a dollar to spend, we know what we get depending on where we put it, over what timeframe. I think that that helps us make decisions more quickly because we know what our options are. We know we have our inventory of things that we can do, short-term, long-term, and what we get for it. So it definitely helps us to make decisions more quickly and hopefully better decisions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):\nThese are so awesome. I definitely want to follow up on some of this. This is so good. So maybe on this last one, which we did at Airbnb also like, how does everything translate into Knight's book and booking? Every decision we make, what is the actual Knight's book impact? And so I imagine in your case, I don't know if you want to talk about these things. I imagine it's transactions, or purchases, or GMB or something like that, so I'm guessing is the final metric. I don't know. Is that something you talk about or you don't talk about that?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:48:26):\nWe measure things in terms of GOV, so Gross Order Value, and also volume.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:33):\nGot it. [inaudible 00:48:34]. Okay, so basically every other metric that people are gold on as much as you can translate, there's a model that translates that into Gross Order Value and volume? Awesome. So when a team is saying, \"Hey, we're going to change the onboarding flow and impact conversion here.\" I don't know. I guess what are some examples of other metrics on teams that potentially translate into GOV and volume just to make it even more real?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:49:01):\nYeah. So everything from the example that you started with, which is an improvement in the login flow, how many more consumers are getting onto the app and ultimately placing orders. And so you can translate that to, of course, orders and GOV. But then something as interesting as selling a Thai restaurant in Sacramento, we're able to say, \"What do we think that that gets us in terms of GOV from the consumer by selling that Thai restaurant?\" So it's every area of the business, it's mobilizing more dashers on the road. What does that do to our quality metrics in terms of delivery times? How does that translate? So because of that, we're able to figure out if we want to spend the dollar or spend the time, the team's time, on improving conversion or spending more money in marketing or onboarding more dashers or signing more restaurants or adding more grocery stores. So we are able to look across the whole business and figure out what is the right mix of actions to take to achieve our goals.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:18):\nI could see as you talk about this why this is so important in a marketplace, especially a multi-sided marketplace where there's always trade-off decisions between supply investment and demand growth and dasher growth. I don't even know, my brain would explode trying to think about all these things, so I get exactly why this is so important to business. Okay. And then in terms of the simple recommendation, I think when people hear like, \"Yeah, keep it simple,\" they're like, \"Yeah, yeah, we're going to keep it simple.\" What are some things that point to, \"This is not simple,\" that tell you like, \"No, this is way too complicated. You should try to simplify this metric even though it's not ideal. It's not the perfect metric, but it needs to be simpler.\"\n\nJessica Lachs (00:50:56):\nYeah. So we had a score for merchant health, which we tried experimenting with, which was a combination of factors that we had found would lead to a merchant being on the platform and getting an order. So we wanted to make sure that the merchant had active hours on the platform and had images and had a full menu that was accurate and robust. A number of different inputs. And we created a composite that weighted all of these different inputs. And then we were like, \"What is our merchant health score?\" And you were like, \"It's 0.35. It's not 35%. So what is that, that 0.35? I don't know what it is.\" So instead of that, we said, \"What are the most important factors in order... First, let's measure how many of the new merchants are getting an order within their first, say, seven days on the platform.\n\n(00:51:57):\nAnd then let's look at how many of our merchants are doing these things we know are important. So these inputs. So let's goal our team on getting merchant photo coverage up. Let's goal the team on making sure that we have open hours, accurate hours.\" So yes, someone might say it's simpler to have a composite metric, but it was so hard to understand what it was and how to move it that it became meaningless. And ultimately moving to something that was simpler to understand, even if it meant having three metrics instead of one, it ultimately was better for the team because folks knew what they were trying to move. And so yeah, maybe we missed number four, five and six on the list of things, but you got one through three and that's 95% of it anyway. So once we get success with that 95, then let's talk about figuring out the other 5%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:55):\nIt's so funny because this is exactly what we went through at Airbnb, we had, we call that a healthy host. I led the host quality team for a while and we came up with this healthy host metric that was six factors of a host, like the cancellation rate, the review rate, their response rate and things like that. And then we're just like, \"Cool, let's move this, let make more hosts healthy.\" And then you end up like, \"Okay, which one do we focus on?,\" And, \"Oh, what about all these others?\" And we ended up basically focusing on one at a time. And so let's just make that the goal for now and then rotate through the different biggest [inaudible 00:53:28] opportunities to move. [inaudible 00:53:30].\n\nJessica Lachs (00:53:30):\nExactly. I think in hindsight for the example you give, which of those six things are actually the most important? And if you're able to then quantify which one matters most, you work on that one first and you materially move that one and then you work on the next one. You want to move them all. But being able to prioritize and know what you're going to get for a 20% improvement in, say, your cancellation rate, that's where analytics I think can add a lot of value. Because yes, ultimately you'll get to all of them, but the way you do that and the time can have a meaningful impact on your growth. If you can target the most problematic things first and solve those, you get more bang for your buck and that compounds over time. And so doing the things that matter first and most quickly is a competitive advantage in my opinion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:21):\nThe other thing we found along those same lines is rotating between different metrics is so not efficient because you get good at, \"We're going to move this metric.\" And your team's like, \"Cool, we totally understand this lever,\" like cancellation rate. We become really smart at cancellation rate and then three months later, you need to switch to response rate and they have to learn a whole new paradigm of how to think about it. And it's just super inefficient. So we found basically, just keep a team on the metric until there's no more opportunities and give another team one of these other metrics.\n\nJessica Lachs (00:54:50):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:52):\nSo many lessons. Okay. And the first thing you said on how to pick a good metric about this idea of short-term metrics that have long-term impact. How did you phrase that again?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:55:02):\nYeah, so we find proxy metrics for long-term outcomes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:05):\nAwesome. And it's similar to the simple metric, and it all comes down to, again, just like the metric should be something probably, you can move, you can understand, that's close enough to this ideal, perfect metric, but isn't necessarily the entire ideal. Okay, awesome. Anything else along these lines of just picking metrics, working with metrics that you've learned that would be worth [inaudible 00:55:28]?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:55:27):\nWith metrics, we are often looking at the average, and I think we talked about this a little bit earlier, but making sure that you're looking at the edge cases and your fail states is also really important. And so we often will set goals actually and create metrics around those edge cases. So like the disaster deliveries, the ones that go terribly wrong. So we have this concept of Never Delivered, which is orders that are never delivered. We're really great at naming things at DoorDash, and they're very rare. And so if you were just looking at the average effect or the average consumer experience, it would never come up. If you were just measuring quality based on average values of delivery times and lateness [inaudible 00:56:18], these wouldn't show up because they are so rare, but they're terrible. They're terrible experiences for consumers. They lead to churn.\n\n(00:56:27):\nThey're incredibly expensive because you're refunding an order or repurchasing food and having to send another dasher to deliver that repurchased food. So they're very expensive, they're costly from a consumer experience standpoint. And I think if you're not looking for these fail states, they are often missed. So I think when you're picking metrics, yes, you want to improve engagement and you want to improve conversion, and there's a lot of things that are averages overall that you want to move, but it's so important to find these edge cases in these fail states and actually set concrete goals around eliminating them because it can be really powerful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:11):\nSo the tip here is actually make that a goal like, never deliver at some team, just keep cutting that down?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:57:17):\nExactly. So we have part of our quality analytics team and we have product engineering and ops on it as well. Their goal is to eradicate Never Delivered. And in order to do that, you have to understand why they happen. Sometimes it's human error, sometimes it's fraud. And then figure out ways that you can prevent them, that you can fix them while it's happening and ultimately just get rid of them from the system. And you're never going to completely get rid of them, but you can make a meaningful impact to make them even more rare than a fraction of a percent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:00):\nYeah. And I feel like people may be hearing this and like, \"Of course, why would you not focus on terrible work experiences?\" But I think in most companies, they look at the big numbers, they look at the averages as you said like, \"Oh, it almost never happens. Why do we even spend any time on this?\" And your point is, you should actually spend time on these really terrible experiences, even if it's a tiny portion of your business. I guess maybe share why that's important. Is it just because that has trickle-down effects on the brand?\n\nJessica Lachs (00:58:27):\nYeah, I think it's a couple of things. So just because something doesn't happen frequently doesn't mean that it's not important. So the Never Delivered example is a great one in that this is leading directly to churn and it's also costing a lot of money far more than its frequency would suggest. And I think the fact of the matter is is when you have things that cause churn, you're losing all of that consumer's subsequent orders, and that is not necessarily observed. You're just seeing one bad experience, you're not seeing all of the lost orders because they're lost. And so I think that sometimes this is an area where the data doesn't show you the full picture. And being able to quantify the impact on engagement, on profitability, will make it stand out as something that really, that you would maybe miss if you weren't really looking for it.\n\n(00:59:25):\nAnd then I think the other thing is with something like login errors, sometimes you don't see it in the data because people can't even get into the data. If you're not able to log in, you're not making any purchases, you're not ordering, and so you may not see it in the data that you're looking at. And so that's also something that I think is important for data folks to think about, which is what data don't we have? What data might we be missing? Where might there be opportunities and things that we actually need to identify and fix that we may not see? Because in this case, with login failures, they're not able to log in. They're not in the denominator, and so we're missing out on them from the data set entirely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:15):\nJust a couple of more questions. There's one that I skipped that I'm just going to come back to. It's completely out of nowhere, but I think it might be interesting is about a global data org. So you run a global data org, you have data scientists and analysts and biz ops people all over the world, not just the US. I'm curious just how is it different managing data people in different countries versus just the US? What's a big difference?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:00:37):\nEveryone always asks about the differences. What I am surprised by is how similar things are, how similar people are, the data scientists themselves, but also consumers and dashers and couriers, as we call them at Volt. There's a lot more similarities than differences. I do think that when you built a business in the US and then you introduce new countries, having different currencies and different languages adds complexity that you weren't necessarily familiar with. I think similarly in EU countries versus non-EU countries in Europe, there's different regulation. So that adds a fun layer of complexity. So I do think that it adds complexity to the problem set, but ultimately so many of the problems are the same. It feels a little bit like going into a test having seen the answer key. And so for me, there are problems we've encountered at Volt through Volt analytics where I'm like, \"Oh, we've had a similar problem.\n\n(01:01:49):\nI have an instinct for what the answer might be. Let's still test because there could be differences cultural or otherwise, but I feel like I know where we're going to end.\" And then sometimes there are problems where it's new for one reason or another, and it's exciting because you're like, \"All right, let's see if things are different here.\" Let's see what ideas might work in a Volt country that don't work in a DoorDash country and vice versa. So I think I tend to focus more on what's the same, and then I'm pleasantly surprised when I find things that are different because that keeps you on your toes and keeps things interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:31):\nI'm going to take us to AI Corner. This is a segment we have in the podcast where I try to understand how people are using AI in their day-to-day and in their business. I'm curious if you've found some really interesting way of using AI ideally in... you can go in either one of these directions, and how you or your team work day-to-day using AI tools to make you more efficient, or integrating AI into your product, making DoorDash better.\n\nJessica Lachs (01:02:59):\nYeah, I think that there are opportunities in both. I think one of the things I'm really excited about is actually the former. So in helping to make the team more productive, we do something called Office Hours at DoorDash, the analytics team. And it's something that we started eight years ago, and it was a way to provide support for teams that at the time we just didn't have the bandwidth to support. So we would go, in the early days, we'd go sit in a room and we'd say, \"Come on in and we'll help you with anything you need help with. We'll help teach you SQL. We'll help look at some of your work. We'll be a thought partner. You could just come learn what we're working on.\" Whatever it was. We would do two hours every week of Office Hours at different times to be friendly to different time zones.\n\n(01:03:52):\nAnd I think one of the things I'm excited about is being able to really empower some of the folks that are still coming to Office Hours for one thing or another to be able to use AI to help edit queries on their own for example, to be able to say, \"Here's a query. I want to make this. Please adjust this to our grocery business so that I can see the GOV for grocery.\" And so working to build these tools that will help not just our team in terms of time saving, and also to be honest, folks are going to use it on our team, but really to be able to empower non-technical users to be able to do things on their own and not have to take up bandwidth for the analytics team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:40):\nSo essentially it's a chatbot that anyone in the company can talk to you to get advice on how to write SQL queries, query data and things like that?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:04:47):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:49):\nIs there a clever name for this chatbot per chance?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:04:51):\nSo it's not clever. It's called Ask Data AI, and that's named for our internal Slack channel that used to be the open Q&A for people to ask data. So it's not at all clever.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:51):\nBut it's clear.\n\nJessica Lachs (01:05:07):\nBut again, it goes with the theme of very, very specific naming conventions that we have at DoorDash; Never Delivered and Ask Data AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:18):\nI love it. Just clarity above all else. That's something I've learned from an editor that I work with. Jess, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with? For folks that are trying to build their data teams, make their data teams more efficient, is there any final wisdom nugget you'd want to share?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:05:39):\nI think the only thing that I want to reiterate is that you don't necessarily need a formal training in whatever it is you're building. And I think that also goes towards the folks that you hire onto the team. And so I mentioned earlier that we've had a lot of folks go to product or go to ops from the team. What I didn't mention is how many folks we've actually had join the analytics team from partner teams. So whether that was from engineering or from our ops team or marketing or finance, we are a net importer of talent as opposed to a net exporter of talent. And I think that that's because my own experience coming over from operations, from being a GM and making that transition into analytics, I find that I'm drawn to other folks who want to make a similar transition.\n\n(01:06:39):\nNow again, you have to have the technical skills, and most of these folks have acquired these skills on the job, whatever job they are doing at DoorDash before they transition to the analytics team, or they had maybe some formal training in school. But I love seeing the folks that make that transition and actually want to join the analytics team, even if they're not a career or data scientist. I think it creates a really unique environment where you have folks on the team from different backgrounds with different expertise who can teach each other things. So I can teach you how to build a discounted cash flow model in Excel, and I can learn how to make kick-ass slides from someone who has a background in consulting. And I can learn about common gotchas in statistics from someone who comes to us with a Master's or a PhD in statistics, and we've got our econometrics folks and we've got our economists. We just have a group of people with different backgrounds who can all teach each other how to be better. And we're not all carbon copies of each other.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:55):\nWhat I'm hearing is you try to optimize almost for a lot of different complementary skills and very different backgrounds almost.\n\nJessica Lachs (01:08:02):\nExactly. And also people who have experience at different size companies. I think I love folks from startups who have that hustle and grit, but I also love folks who've seen what scale looks like and can help us see around corners as far as what problems we will encounter as the business is growing. And I think it is not just about a diversity of skill and a diversity of background, it's also diversity of prior company and stage. That can be really a unique way to think about structuring your team so that you get the best of both worlds.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:40):\nAmazing. Well, just when you thought we were done, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:08:47):\nI am. Let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:48):\nLet's do it. Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:08:55):\nI tend to read fiction, particularly historical fiction, and I love spy novels. So I think my brain is always in problem-solving mode even when reading. A recent book that I read that I enjoyed was The Rose Code by Kate Quinn, and it's about women code breakers in World War II, and I really enjoyed that. But rather than recommending a book... I guess I did just recommend a book, but rather than recommending another book, I am going to recommend the Libby app and supporting your local public library because I love the library and I love Libby, so I'll give that as my other recommendation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:37):\nBeautiful. Very on brand with sharing economy, company stuff. Libby. Cool. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:09:46):\nYeah, another one. I don't actually watch a lot of TV, definitely don't watch a lot of movies. In fact, haven't seen some of the movie greats. I get yelled at a lot by my friend. \"I can't believe you haven't seen that.\" I tend to re-watch things, so series from the past, over and over again. I think it's just like how I shut my brain off. So I've recently re-watched The West Wing, which is one of my favorite shows of all time, probably for the 50th time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:15):\nOh my God.\n\nJessica Lachs (01:10:16):\nAnd Alias, which was a Jennifer Garner series from the early 2000s. Also, Spy. So I'm noticing a theme. I think I really love the spy genre. But yeah, I've watched those. They're both great, but not at all current.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:33):\nPerfect. Perfectly acceptable. Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:10:39):\nThis is a bit of a curveball. So Korean sunscreens. So I burn really easily, so I have to wear sunscreen and I love Korean sunscreens. I was introduced to them by a friend of mine, and they're just far superior to what we have in the US. So I highly recommend people give Korean sunscreens a try, particularly there's a Beauty of Joseon on branded sunscreen. It's just amazing and is delightful to wear, which is important when you have to wear it every day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:09):\nI've been trying to wear more sunscreen as I age, and so this is a really good tip. Was that a brand you recommended?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:11:15):\nYeah. So Beauty of Joseon is the brand.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:15):\nBeauty of Joseon.\n\nJessica Lachs (01:11:18):\nThere's another brand, Isntree, which also has a great sunscreen. But I'll be honest, almost every Korean sunscreen I've tried is great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:28):\nOkay. I'm Googling this as soon as we get off. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and share and or share with family and friends even more [inaudible 01:11:39]?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:11:40):\nI do. So there's a John Steinbeck quote, which I'm not big on quotes, but I like this one, which is that, \"It's a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it.\" I find that that's something I really live by. First off, I love sleep and I try to get as much of it as possible. But the other thing is that if I'm stuck on a problem or if I am writing a response to something like a tense issue or an emotional issue, often I find that if I put down my thoughts, go to sleep, check it in the morning, I end up with a better outcome. So all of a sudden you have a new perspective and clarity on a problem you were stuck on, or you realize that you weren't clear in the way you were communicating your thoughts because you were emotional about something and you're able to put together a much better response to an e-mail or to whatever problem you're handling. So sleep can solve lots of problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:46):\nI love sleep as well. I'm always telling my wife, \"Let's go to sleep.\" Like, \"Okay, I'll be there soon.\" I love that advice. Okay, two more questions. Who's influenced you most in your career? Is there someone that comes to mind?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:13:00):\nSo I think two answers, a multi-part answer. So I think first my career has been in male-dominated industries and I've worked with just some incredible women who've really influenced me. When I was a banker, there were two senior bankers, Vanessa Roberts and Gina Tarone at Lehman Brothers where I worked. And they were just so incredible. They were just so good at their jobs and I found that really inspiring.\n\n(01:13:29):\nAnd then at DoorDash, Tia Sherringham, who is our GC, and Liz Jarvis-Shean, who leads comms, are just dominant in their fields. And I think that that's really empowering and have been big influences on me to just see strong, powerful women kicking ass and that helps me believe that I can do the same. So that's one answer.\n\n(01:13:54):\nAnd then the other answer, sort of cliche, but my parents. My mom was a statistician at the UN before she got married, and she actually chose to stay home and raise three children, so I'm the youngest. And when I was in, I think it was elementary school, decided to go back to school, switch careers and become a nurse. And so the fact that she embarked on this completely new career in her forties after 15 years as a stay-at-home mom and my father supported this. I think that that was really, really influential and was probably the first time I saw that you can do whatever you put your mind to, no matter your age, no matter your circumstances. So that was really influential and I don't think I've ever told her that. So hi, Mom.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:44):\nHi Mom. Thank you, mom.\n\nJessica Lachs (01:14:45):\nYeah, I think that was influential for my career. Definitely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:49):\nThat's a beautiful answer. Fun fact, I worked with Liz at Airbnb. Your person you just mentioned in the comms team.\n\nJessica Lachs (01:14:57):\n[inaudible 01:14:57]. She is great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:58):\nShe's amazing. Final question. So when you joined DoorDash, imagine it wasn't obvious that it was going to work. I imagine it was still like, \"This was a crazy idea. Maybe it'll work, maybe not.\" Is there a moment you recall where you're like, \"I think this is going to be a big success? I think this is actually going to work out?\"\n\nJessica Lachs (01:15:14):\nTo be honest, I went into DoorDash because I wanted to learn for the experience. I thought it was interesting, problems with interesting people. I never thought too much about whether it would work. I of course wanted it to work and was very competitive and wanted to win. I think there's two moments that stand out. One was when the third party market share data showed that we had become the number one player after, I think we started at number four or five. And I think that that was really exciting to see the trajectory and to see us gain in category share. That was exciting. I probably didn't see it until months after it had happened because we don't spend a ton of time focusing on it, but I do remember somebody wanted to include the graph in some presentation, some sales material, and we're like, \"Oh, we're number one. That's incredible. We used to be number five.\" So I'd say that that was one.\n\n(01:16:17):\nThe other one that stands out was, the first talk I gave in a lot of these startup talks in the early days in Boston, and I'd asked the audience, \"How many of you have used DoorDash?\" And there'd be like three people who would raise their hand. And then it was a few years ago, maybe 2018, 2019, and I was giving a talk and I asked the audience, \"How many of you have used DoorDash?\" And almost everyone's hands went up. And that was actually pretty memorable for me because in my mind, we were still the small startup that no one had heard of where I had to over enunciate the D's in DoorDash. So people didn't think I worked for Jordash, the nineties' denim company. And so that was pretty meaningful to me when just so many people had used the product or were consumers of DoorDash. It was pretty exciting. And I still get excited. I saw DoorDash mentioned in a book recently that I was reading. It was like, \"We're in the book.\" So those little things when you become part of the cultural lingo that I think are really, really special.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:33):\nWell, I'm a very happy customer of DoorDash. I've never had a Never Deliver. It's always there, sometimes a little late. Usually it's perfect. Thank you for everything you do. Go team DoorDash.\n\n(01:17:44):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow stuff that you do? I know you've been doing more writing on LinkedIn and things like that, so just help people understand where to find you and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJessica Lachs (01:17:55):\nYeah, so as you mentioned, to find me LinkedIn, I don't have a huge social presence, but I am on LinkedIn and I am currently writing a series of blog posts about my experience building a global analytics org at DoorDash. Some of the lessons I've learned over the last 10 years. So definitely check those out.\n\n(01:18:16):\nAnd as far as your second question of how listeners can be useful to me, I guess read the post on LinkedIn and I'd love to hear what people think, whether you agree with my point of view or not. That being said, be nice. I want honest feedback, but I want kindness as well. So yeah, just engage with the content and let me know what y'all think. I think I do have a broader ask, which is just to encourage folks listening to TruthSeek, something I take seriously at DoorDash. It's a company value. But there's a lot of misinformation out there and it's often up to us as individuals to figure out what's fact and what's fiction. So I have a plea for folks to do your best, to search for the truth and speak the truth, and I think we'll all be better off for it. And of course, use DoorDash.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:13):\nOf course.\n\nJessica Lachs (01:19:14):\nYes, there are three things that listeners can do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:18):\nYou're at DoorDash.com. That was awesome. I love that last point as well in addition, to use DoorDash. Jessica, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJessica Lachs (01:19:27):\nThank you for having me. It was a lot of fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:29):\nSame for me. Bye, everyone.\n\n(01:19:32):\nThank you so much for listening.
