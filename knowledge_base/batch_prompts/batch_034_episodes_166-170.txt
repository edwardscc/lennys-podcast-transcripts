You could argue it applies even more because the right growth advisor can have literally company changing impact. Something I've experienced several times in hindsight when you're like, \"Okay, here's the needle in the haystack.\" And then it's implemented and you can see hundreds of percentages, sometimes over a thousand percent lift when you get it right. It's one of those weird disciplines where the right person at the right time can literally say a sentence that changes the trajectory of your company. You can't say that for a lot of different disciplines, but this is one of them.\n\nLenny (00:00:36):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products.

Good to see you.\n\nLenny (00:03:36):\nIt's good to see you too. I want to start with a story that you shared once when we were hanging out in the past and something that I'll never forget, and it's about the time that you just joined Facebook and apparently you had some kind of big presentation you had to give to the entire company or the executive staff. And then I just love the way it kind of unfolded and it kind of gives you a glimpse into what it's like to work with Zuck and at Facebook. Can you share that story if that rings a bell?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:04:00):\nIf remember the story, well, basically I had just started at Facebook about... I'll use those two interchangeably. I remember it as Facebook and I always will. I was three months in and was working on a new area for me. So I came in, started putting together our thoughts on a strategy and was asked to do a presentation in front of the company with Mark on the strategy. So I whipped up a draft strategy, put together some plots and plans, presented in front of the company and went well. And then every six months there's something called the [inaudible 00:04:32] Team Review of Facebook and basically product area leads will go in and present their strategy, how it's going. Again, I just joined three months before, so I walk in no idea what to expect. I am sitting at a table. You can kind of envision it's a big room, a really big room with a bunch of tables set up in a big square with a little microphone.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:04:50):\nSo I sit in there, there's Mark and all the executives sitting on the other side. And I sit down and it's quiet for what felt like five minutes. I'm sure it was not, but it was quiet for a while, just sitting there waiting for what's going to happen now. And at some point Mark kind looks over, says, \"Hey, we saw your presentation, saw your strategy. Now when are we going to start seeing results?\" And that was my introduction to Facebook. It was kind of my introduction to working with Mark and was a pretty kind of intense thing to go through. Again, I just joined. The strategy was very much a draft at that point, but I think what it highlights is something that Facebook does really, really well, which you get very quickly when you join Facebook and it's why they're such an execution machine and can build a lot of great product. It's because they focus exclusively on that magic word, which is impact.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:05:44):\nAnd that was kind of my first introduction to working with Mark and just that laser focus on, \"All right, got it. Now when are we going to start seeing impact and kind of moving from there?\" So it's something that is very much in the culture there and something that is so important. It's something of course that we focus on a lot at Shopify, but it's that difference between, \"I don't care how hard you've worked. I don't care what you're working on, what the activities are. What are the outcomes? What is the impact you're having?\" I actually really love that word impact and focusing on it because it's vague enough that it covers off any work that is impactful towards the mission and it's precise enough to know what does that mean when you say, \"Are you having impact? Or what is the impact we're having?\" So it's a great way to approach things. That was my first experience there within a few months. And yeah, we jumped in and started focusing on having a lot of impact from there.\n\nLenny (00:06:36):\nI love that story. There's a couple things there. One is, if I were in your shoes, I'd poop my pants sitting there for five minutes waiting for what do you guys-\n\nLuc Levesque (00:06:45):\nThat did not happen. I had a report.\n\nLenny (00:06:47):\nOkay. How did it go? How did you deal with it? Or I guess how did you respond?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:06:51):\nWell, we had, funny enough, already started having impact, so I was able to at least respond with, \"Hey, we've kind of already started in a few ways\" and walk through where we were having impact and just focus on the strategy, what our plans forward were and where we wanted to go from there. So I think that's how I responded.\n\nLenny (00:07:08):\nOkay, great work. So something I've started doing actually on this podcast is I've started to keep a little Post-it of, here it is, of themes that continue to recur across companies that are most successful. And impact comes... It's number one on my Post-it here, is just impact comes up so often as something that the best companies continue to come back to and focus on and put a lot of emphasis on. I guess I don't know what the question is exactly, but is that just what you find in the work that you do with all the companies you work with? Just how important it's to come back to impact as maybe the primary thing?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:07:42):\nYeah, I mean I think it's easy for a lot of leaders and companies to get caught up in how hard are people working, what did they do, and recognizing and rewarding activity. I mean, everybody wants to have impact. The companies that truly focus on that are the ones that break through and really make a lot of progress towards the mission. So that seems obvious I think when I say it out loud, but being in that culture and having it really ingrained in everything you do whether it's performance reviews or strategies or these reviews with the executive team, it all gravitates around impact. And I think it's that laser focus on it that matters so much. But I mean I've certainly seen it going other ways where it's more about working long hours. And certainly there's a correlation, to be clear, between working hard and impact, but I find it's just such a precise way to think about how people are performing or what you're doing in terms of is your strategy working? Is the direction you're moving in having the intended outcomes that you want? And yeah, I do think it's all about that.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:08:46):\nBeing a growth leader where everything's so measurable, impact is something that can be very clearly measured and you know whether you have it or not. So the most important thing that we work on constantly is reviewing what's our strategy, what are we working on? Is that driving towards the top level north star outcome we want? Is that having the impact? And then basically doing everything around that singular north star. So it's very, very important. I think it's more profound than it might seem just from the outside. But if you've worked in different companies, you've probably experienced different versions of this too.\n\nLenny (00:09:20):\nYeah. I want to spend more time on this, but before we move on, you also have another Zuck story. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Zuck recruited you personally to join Facebook/Meta. Is that true? And then if true, what was that like to be recruited by Zuck personally?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:09:35):\nIt was an interesting experience, very intense, but also one of the reasons for it was I was living in Canada and my family was there and I had some strong personal reasons why I couldn't leave Canada. But yeah, we had a lot of discussions with Mark. I won't get into the micro details of it, that's more Mark's story to tell than mine. But a few takeaways from going through that experience. As a leader, hiring is the most important thing as we all know. It's a craft and a skill that I'm always working on refining. I have my own playbook that I'm constantly tweaking, testing out different approaches, trying to find the best talent and assessing them and trying to close them and bringing them on board. So I learned a lot through that experience with Mark.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:10:15):\nA couple things that stood out were the first one would be that Mark really involved the entire executive team. It wasn't just me talking to recruiting or talent or HR or just Mark, it was the entire executive team. That's something that I think a lot of leaders don't take advantage of. I've seen leaders, I've certainly done this at times where you go it alone or you're working with recruiting, but the reality is all the leaders, all the execs in the company know how important it's to bring in talent and they're always more than happy to help. So that's something that I think more leaders should do is really recruit all of their peers and their leaders in the company to help close. And that's certainly something that happened when I was in discussions with Mark and Facebook about joining.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:10:55):\nThe second one, which I had I suppose never experienced before, was that they made it very personal. I had these reasons why I couldn't leave. So initially I was excited by the opportunity, but I couldn't see myself moving to California for personal reasons. And through discussions, Mark basically involved my wife, involved my spouse in this, Andrea. We flew down, had dinner with him and Priscilla, his wife. Andrea had ended up meeting with many of the executives at Facebook and really talking through what was holding us back, why we couldn't come, potential options and ideas for how we could come down.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:11:33):\nBut involving somebody's spouse and family I think is a really good idea because it's a very personal decision to change company. It involves more than just that person you're talking to, it involves the whole family. So that was something that I think is an important thing to have in your kind of playbook for hiring, is really think about the whole person's family and involve them if you can. In fact, Toby did this as well at Shopify. He flew down here with Fiona and we had breakfast with Andrea and them and reviewed a few offers when I joined Shopify.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:12:03):\nAnd then the third thing is just to be absolutely relentless and don't give up and don't let momentum drop. It took seven months for me to go from, \"This is amazing, exciting, but there's no way I can make this work\" to, \"Okay, let's move to Palo Alto.\" And Mark, the execs, a variety of leaders there were in discussions for months and months and months and never letting the momentum die. That's something that I think is really important. No doesn't necessarily mean no, and in this case it definitely wasn't the case. I had the same experience with Toby at Shopify where we've been talking about working together for over 10 years now. And then finally the timing was right and I was able to join the company.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:12:45):\nSo just be relentless, involve the family, involve the spouse if you can, and recruit some help from other executives in the company. Those were some of the things that stood out through my experience. But yeah, it was a pretty wild time in my life.\n\nLenny (00:13:00):\nRelentless is actually another word. I wasn't necessarily I'm supposed to yet, but I feel like it's another trend to cross. The most impactful and successful founders is just this like, \"I will not give up. I will keep at it.\"\n\nLuc Levesque (00:13:09):\n[inaudible 00:13:10].\n\nLenny (00:13:10):\nAnd so that's a really interesting example of that in action. I was going to talk about this later, but maybe it's a good time to talk about it now, which is around hiring. So you talked about you have this playbook for how to hire. You mentioned to me that you kind of find that as you scale as a leader, hiring ends up being like the most important skill maybe, maybe one of the most important skills. I'd love to hear your take on just what you found about hiring as you've grown as a product leader.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:13:33):\nWell, I think you reach a point in your career where you realize that hiring is the skill you now need to become world-class at because you're not no longer doing the work yourself. You're still of course involved and doing some of the work and getting your hands dirty, but the bulk of your team's success now will be the quality of the hires you make and you truly need to be world-class at that. So yeah, I built this playbook out. I was in Canada in Ottawa when I sold that company, Tripadvisor, and really started growing my team and becoming more Leaning into leadership at the time through that experience.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:14:07):\nOne of the benefits of being in Ottawa and kind of off the grid if you will, is it's a curse and a benefit as that you don't have a ton of people you can learn from. So it does mean you need to go to first principles and think things through from the ground up. It takes a little longer, but you come up with your own playbooks on how to do things. I think you've seen my blueprint, which is a good example of that where I have this blueprint I put together. When new people join the team, I show them my blueprint, which is basically a list of my quirks so we can really quickly align. That's something that just being in Ottawa and trying to figure out how to be a leader and avoid mistakes, I was like, \"Wouldn't it be nice if you had a blueprint? When somebody joined, you can just tell them all of your quirks and you can just quickly calibrate on how it is to work together versus through awkward long discussions over the course of a year.\"\n\nLuc Levesque (00:14:51):\nMy hiring playbook's a similar thing. I think of it in three different chapters, if you will. There's finding talent, assessing talent, and closing talent. In terms of finding talent, I do believe that the best predictor of future performance is past performance. So I'm looking for what I call signs of excellence. So I want to know the top people generally have done multiple amazing things in their life, repeated success, not just once. Maybe it was work related, maybe not work related. But generally speaking, if you think back to the stars you've worked with, they've done some amazing things. And that's why I always start when I interview or when I chat with people, I started talking about just trying to understand, \"What has been your path? What have you done professionally and not professionally?\" And generally, stars going to stand out. It's very rare that there's not something obvious that comes through.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:15:39):\nSo for myself personally, I'm looking for kind of three different signs of excellence to tell me that it doesn't have to be three. The mental model I have is as you're talking to them, you're getting pluses and negatives. There's red flags you're hearing and there's really great things. And then at the end you can make an opinion of how good this person is.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:15:56):\nAnother great sign of excellence, and this was just through reflecting on stars on the team and thinking what makes them unique, what about them. One of them is when somebody's boss leaves the company and then comes back to poach them, that is such a strong signal because if you think of what just happened, the leader who knows exactly how good this person you're talking to is, they have the most knowledge of the performance of this individual, they left the company. They've come back to poach them, putting their own reputation at risk by coming back depending on the situation. And they would never do that unless this person was really, really good.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:16:37):\nSo you don't want to over pivot on one signal, you want to look at the full picture. But those are the types of things I look at to bring in top talent. And I've got this whole playbook, mistakes I've made that I've learned from, things to avoid. And over the years, yeah, I've put together this playbook that I try to follow and I'm always running little experiments to try to make it better.\n\nLenny (00:16:56):\nWere going to that blueprint that you mentioned. A lot of which you're talking about is probably more relevant to senior executive type people because you're looking for... Or maybe not because you're looking for say three.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:17:06):\n[inaudible 00:17:06].\n\nLenny (00:17:06):\nOkay. So people early in their career could also have three, say, moments of excellence?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:17:12):\nYeah, I mean just thinking off the top, it depends on the type of person you're hiring, but are they a founder? Have they tried to do something? Did they win an award somewhere? Are they a gold medalist at something? Have they done something that others have not that shows grit, that shows drive, that shows the ability to succeed? And I've seen that you can apply that to any candidate you're hiring.\n\nLenny (00:17:36):\nThe implication there is, without that, they're probably not going to be stars, that there's a strong correlation between having signs of excellence and them performing really well in this role.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:17:45):\nCorrect, exactly. Yeah, I mean I suppose it's possible, but it would be pretty rare that somebody would come in without some sign that they stand above the crowd. And again, I'm talking about you generally want to hire the top 1% of candidates. So when you're looking for the best of the best, you definitely are looking for those signals.\n\nLenny (00:18:01):\nAwesome. Okay, so I'm going to bring us back on the agenda that I had for myself, which is I want to start with talking about advisorships and advising and growth advisors. You've been a growth advisor for a long time to some of the most amazing companies out there, Twitter, Pinterest, Patreon, Canva, Thumbtack. I'm sure there's others that you don't list that are more informal. Now you work at Shopify. And so what I think about here is a lot of founders often think about, \"Should I bring on an advisor? What should I look for an advisor? I've heard stories of advisors being useless sometimes. People tell me I don't need advisors.\" So I guess the question here is just what's your take on when it makes sense to bring on and consider bringing on a growth advisor and what should people look for when they're exploring and talking to a potential growth advisor?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:18:47):\nA few thoughts. In terms of when, I don't think you can probably come into early. It's probably harder to find really good ones than it is to time it. But generally speaking, I would say you don't want to focus too much on growth until you have product market fit. So make sure you have a product that users love that's either showing strong signs of retention or has some good loop that you can see that you can start thinking about growth.\n\nLenny (00:19:08):\nLet me follow on that thread real quick because I find some founders still want to have someone come help them with growth even though they know they don't have product market fit, even though this tip comes up every single time when I'm talking to growth person, like, \"Wait till you have product market fit before doing growth stuff.\" So could you just add a little bit of why that's important while we're on that topic?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:19:27):\nGrowth advice is generally always applicable. And if you can start thinking about how to build your product early, even if it's pre-product market fit, you're not going to do any damage, but you may be wasting some capital on an advisor or a growth person too early. The problem that I see is if you start growing a product that doesn't have product market fit, you're actually doing more damage than good because you have a product that is now being exposed to the market through growth levers and through optimization that is giving a bad experience with your product. And you want that product that you know is tight and you know has product market fit to start building the flywheel and start growing. You don't want it to be growing if it doesn't satisfy that need that you're trying to build out for. So I can see it having more damage than good because when somebody tries something, they're unlikely to try it again. And so that's the dangerous game you can get into. So you're better off with a good product that's satisfying a need and then growing from there.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:20:20):\nI will say to kind of play devil's advocate with myself and something that I've done actually in one of the products, I've built several consumer products and grown them, is that sometimes to know if you have a product, you need users to use it. So there's like some subtlety in here, but I would say if you are trying to get users in to start playing with it at scale, I mean try to focus in on a market that is maybe off the grid. Like pick some English-speaking country that's a bit off the grid that you can isolate your marketing to so you can start getting dozens or a couple hundred people per day coming in and giving you feedback.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:20:58):\nI've seen that work too. So I'd say wait till you have product market fit. If you do start growing your product early because you need that signal from people actually using it beyond just focus groups and friends or small numbers of people, try to do it off the grid in smaller markets that you can get kind of contain the growth and get what you're really trying to get, which is that signal on is it working or not.\n\nLenny (00:21:19):\nAwesome. Okay, I threw us off track. Let's get back on track. So we're talking about when it makes sense to find a growth advisor and then what to look for and so on that you might want to work with.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:21:27):\nI mean, what makes a great growth advisor is somebody who really understands what to do but also why certain growth levers work. It's that kind of deep understanding of levers of onboarding or whatever area they're focusing on that really makes growth advisor stand out. So when you're looking for a growth advisor, you want to have those discussions to see like, \"How much depth does this person have? Have they seen a playbook and they're just good at repeating the playbook or are they evolving, are they growing?\" The best way to get to know that is to start really asking them questions about growth and growth advising and the certain things that they've done and why they think those have worked.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:22:09):\nThis can be tricky if you don't yourself know growth. So I think one thing that I have not seen a lot of founders do that I would advise is if you have an advisor already... Because this applies to finding growth advisors, but it also applies to hiring good growth talent. So if you have somebody you know whether it's already an advisor or somebody who knows growth, you can solicit their help in trying to flesh out whether somebody you're trying to hire is of high talent. So if you have an advisor, you can make that one of their roles is vet out any new talent coming in. And if you're looking for an advisor, try to find somebody that you know and trust who can do that first pass. Because for somebody who knows growth that you trust, it's actually not a lot of work for them to vet out how talented someone else's. It's an easy ask to make and something that if you have that person in your network or that worked with you that you can leverage for.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:23:01):\nBut I haven't seen that too often where founders kind of take advantage of people they know or existing growth advisors to help recruit and vet talent because it can be quite hard if you don't know the growth space to know if somebody's good or not.\n\nLenny (00:23:15):\nThat's a really interesting idea and it could be where you find someone that's too busy to work with you, but maybe you could just ask, \"Hey, could you just easily help me vet people?\" And it takes a lot less time.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:23:26):\nYeah, I've never been asked that, which is, I mean I don't know if I'll start getting asked this now, but it does seem like that's a really simple way to add a ton of value. And as a founder, I mean even if you have to pay this person or whatever you have to do, but it's such an important hire to get right. We talk about the 10X engineer and we don't really talk about the 10X growth advisor or 10X growth person, but the same dynamic applies. You could argue it applies even more because the right growth advisor can have literally company changing impact where they're either building or helping to ideate or helping to implement a growth loop that literally changes the company. As we know, you need a great product and you need a great growth loop. And it's usually just one loop that you need to get right. Most companies have gotten to where they are just off of one really strong channel that they've just dominated, so it's important to get right.\n\nLenny (00:24:17):\nIs there an example of that sort of impact that you've seen in your advisorship or other people's of just an impact from one conversation or a little bit of a help?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:24:25):\nDefinitely. And I think what I would point to is the advantage of a growth advisor is it takes a long time to understand a channel. Certainly people have to know their stuff, they have to be very good at their craft, their growth craft, but also they have to be exposed to a large set of experiments or an environment where they've just seen what works and what doesn't. So no matter how good somebody is, if they haven't been exposed to an environment where there's a lot of experimentation, a lot of learning, it's very hard for them to internalize that. So once a growth advisor has that, it's takes years to learn it, but it literally can take seconds literally to communicate that. So I've worked with some companies that you've mentioned and certainly have had impact very quickly.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:25:09):\nI mean, one example would be a company that I worked with. Now, a public company. At the time, they weren't. On day one, walked in, they presented their strategy, their plans, their funnels and their landing pages. I could see very quickly that there was something they were doing that was a little off and I asked them, \"Well, why are you doing it that way?\" And they said, \"Well, we think it just looks better that way.\" And I said, \"Well, just do it this other way.\" I remember this because it was such a short conversation and then three weeks later we connected and I heard they had rolled it out and it was a large impact that they had from this one change. This has happened many times with the companies I've worked with, but it's a good example that once you know it, it's not hard to recognize it if you deeply understand it to give advice, but it takes a long time to get the base knowledge.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:26:02):\nSo I don't do these too often anymore, but when I do advise, I take them very seriously. I focus exclusively on having impact. I think that's really important because like you say, there's a lot of advisors out there. Some of them are great, some of them different qualities, and you really want to make sure that if you are an advisor, you want to be in the camp of when this person comes in, they have a lot of impact and it takes time and focus and energy and alignment and there's a bunch of things we can talk about that that helps to drive that alignment. But having impact is the most important thing, whether you're an advisor or if you're hiring because it's one of those weird disciplines where the right person at the right time can literally say a sentence that changes the trajectory of your company. You can't say that for a lot of different disciplines, but this is one of them.\n\nLenny (00:26:49):\nThere's that word impact again,\n\nLuc Levesque (00:26:51):\nImpact. Impact.\n\nLenny (00:26:52):\nThe point you just made about how one conversation can have a ton of impact is a reminder of why sometimes the price of an advisor feels absurd where like, \"For one hour it's like thousands of dollars,\" but it's because obviously they spent a decade learning a thing and one conversation is all of that work they put into it crystallized for you in the moment.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:27:13):\nExactly. It's something I've experienced several times in hindsight when you're like, \"Okay, here's the needle in the haystack\" and then it's implemented and you can see hundreds of percentages, sometimes over a thousand percent lift when you get it right. It's exhilarating. It's great. I have something I used to say, which is, you want your impact to be so big there's a slide in the next board deck on try to explain what happened. That can happen when you are advising companies because you're able to share a very quickly insights. But one way to drive alignment is not everybody can do this, not all advisors do it this way, but I personally love just when I do these, which is not that frequent, just purely doing equity because I love the alignment in outcomes where the founder will be successful and you will be successful. So the incentives are really good to drive the right performance and the right outcomes that you want as a founder.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:28:09):\nSo if you can do it, I would definitely advise founders to bring advisors in for equity if you can. I think the same applies for your internal growth team. You want to make sure that the teams are incentivized not on activities, on doing stuff, because there's a lot of stuff to be done in growth, but really driving the outcomes that you want. And equity's just a great way of saying, \"Hey, we're in this together. We're on the same side of the table. Let's go grow this company.\"\n\nLenny (00:28:36):\nI was actually about to ask you what kind of structure you recommend for an advisorship. Is there anything else you can share about just what you'd recommend a founder do in terms of compensation for an advisor?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:28:45):\nThere's a couple things. I'm a big fan of equity because of the alignment of incentives. You should think about, without getting into too much detail of the actual structure of the deals, but think about how you vest the equity. The last thing you want is an advisor holding back on sharing knowledge. The ideal engagement would be an advisor comes in, delivers as much value as possible quickly, and then trains your team. And then maybe it's a one-year engagement and hopefully they've learned because the advisor has been incentivized to share as much as possible and to train the team as much as possible. And then ideally you don't need them anymore after. So there's something there about structuring equity vesting. I'm a big fan of vesting earlier rather than later. So think about in terms of structure you're vesting, commensurate with the value you want, which is very much front loaded.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:29:35):\nI'm also a big fan of three month cliffs. Something I've done, I always do actually, is listen, in the first three months you'll know both sides if it's working or not. And you want to de-risk that on both sides because it really should be seen as a partnership between the advisor and the founder. If the founder thinks you're not adding value in the first few months, I think they should just tear it up and both sides move on. It's not good for the founder to continue the deal and it's not good frankly for the advisor because they're not, for some reason, able to add value in that environment. So I love a three-month cliff at the beginning where if it's not working in the first three months, you tear up the deal and both parties walk away and de-risk the entire thing, and again, drives incentives in the right way where the advisor is 100% incentivized at as much value as fast as possible. And so that's another thing that I tend to do and I've done it for a long time.\n\nLenny (00:30:28):\nThat's a really good tip. Basically don't do it for a year if you're vesting for advisors, probably not even to a year, but yeah.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:30:33):\nThere's a bunch of ways to do it. Honestly, it's hard enough to find growth advisors that have capacity, so you got to also say like, \"What can you do that the advisor's comfortable with?\" But yeah, I mean just to be candid, I think you want to structure in a way where you're not dependent on the advisor over time. They're adding a ton of value, they're helping teach the team, they're probably bouncing around because your company's changing, your team's changing, your leaders are changing. But over time, and that can be years, but it shouldn't be indefinite. You shouldn't need an advisor forever.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:31:04):\nI've seen a scenario where there's desire to keep the advisor on almost as insurance, like, \"If something goes wrong, I just wanted to be able to pick up the phone.\" That can make sense. But I do think a good growth advisor is incentivized to share as much as possible, as fast as possible to have impact to train your team. And then whether you want to keep them on or not long term as an insurance policy or just to answer questions as things change, that should be a choice and not because, \"If we lose the advisor. We're completely screwed.\" That would be a bad place for you to be in as a founder.\n\nLenny (00:31:35):\nYou said it's hard to find a good advisor, 100% agree. Any advice for people to help them find an advisor that might be the right fit?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:31:43):\nYeah, I would say there's more of them these days than there were even just five years ago or 10 years ago. Depending on your situation, if you're a founder, I would start with your investors. I think VCs have an amazing network of advisors. I get, I don't know, a couple requests a week that I'm not taking right now. But that from my experience and what I've seen, that's probably especially the high end VCs, the very talented VCs will have this network. And frankly, it's a great partnership as an advisor for you to have. You can help the companies, you can help the VCs and it helps you. So everybody wins, just asking other founders that had good experience, much like hiring.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:32:21):\nThe third advice I would give is to find companies that are world-class at what you're trying to grow, what channel or skill you're looking at, and then reach out and see if there's a way to help that way. That's actually how I got started. I was at Tripadvisor and a prominent VC reached out. One of the companies they were working with needed some help on SEO. I was still in Canada at the time, got connected with them, had a phone call, had a significant impact through that one phone call. And rather than joining as an advisor, I essentially helped them out pro bono in exchange for, \"Hey, I want to get connected in the Valley.\" So I was in Canada, I wanted to start another company, I wanted to get connected. So through that tactic where they reached out to a company that was known to be world-class at SEO, I think that was really smart on this VC's part.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:33:13):\nAnd then maybe some advice to up and coming growth advisors would be that first one, I didn't take a single shred of equity or money and just tried to have as much impact as possible and to help out this company as much as possible and then make sure that I was able to get connected to other people that I wanted to meet in the Bay Area. And then kind of things snowballed from there.\n\nLenny (00:33:33):\nI definitely want to chat about how to become a growth advisor because I think people listening here might be like, \"Oh, that sounds pretty good. Someday maybe I'll become a growth advisor.\" But before we get to that, what are things that an advisor are best suited for versus finding someone full-time versus no one? What are the ideal kind of problem sets for an advisor versus say, full-time hire person?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:33:57):\nI would say your preference should always be to have somebody in-house. I'll start there because you want to have that as part of the culture. There's so much more that they can do when they're in-house. That being said, if you can't find somebody in-house, then bring on an advisor... Even if you bring on an advisor, some advice to founders would be you want to surround your team or at least one person that you've identified who's just a amazing world-class doer, even if they don't know growth, with a set of growth advisors so that they're learning, that's being put through the culture of the company and that knowledge stays inside of the company. So I'd say I would prefer to go internal, surround these people with great advisors and then take it from there. That would be how I approach it.\n\nLenny (00:34:41):\nOkay. So two thoughts here. One is I feel like this podcast is becoming an interesting way to discover awesome growth advisors. I think over time I'm building this directory of who are awesome, smart growth people that are open to advising. So that could be an interesting opportunity to just look through the folks on this podcast and-\n\nLuc Levesque (00:34:59):\nYep, there's some great people that have been on here. Definitely.\n\nLenny (00:35:02):\nTotally working my way through all the amazing least smart growth people and product leaders. The other is I've noticed they're a lot of the best growth advisors have worked with the same sorts of companies. I find Miro comes up a lot, Canva comes up a lot, Pinterest. All these people that have worked with say Pinterest that I hear about are just awesome. Casey comes to mind, Melissa Tan who's coming out with a podcast, I think she worked with them. Dropbox. Anyway, so maybe one idea, see who these companies work with as advisors and that can maybe point you to people that are worth exploring.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:35:34):\nI mean, that's a good idea. It kind of goes back to something I mentioned earlier, which is companies that have a lot of traffic and that have a lot of users are a great learning ground for growth people and for advisors, because no matter how smart you are, you need the reps. You got to go to the growth gym and put in the reps, which is experiments. You've got to try things, things that are going to work, things that aren't going to work. There's a discipline of when something doesn't work, you can learn almost as much as when something works. But you need that traffic, you need that environment. And that's why certain companies have these great people coming out like Casey at Pinterest and other people that have been at these companies that have the traffic, have the culture to support it, to support growth. I don't think that's a coincidence why some of these companies have some great people coming from them.\n\nLenny (00:36:20):\nThe other tip I just thought about as you were talking is everyone's launching a Substack newsletter that is doing any sort of advising because there's a lot of power in building an audience and creating kind of awareness of what you do. So I wonder if another tip is search Substack's directory of newsletters for specific things you're dealing with, like say, go to PLG or sales and you might find someone there.\"\n\nLuc Levesque (00:36:39):\nI haven't done that, but that seems like a reasonable way to do it.\n\nLenny (00:36:42):\nThat's where we're all heading.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:36:44):\nI'm not saying that the people on Substack have this. But as advice to the people listening, is when you're vetting for a growth advisor or growth talent, don't just wait it on the public halo of somebody. That's a common mistake I've seen where maybe somebody's done presentations at a conference or somebody's done... I don't know, but their Twitter following is broad. They can be excellent. That's not a disqualifier immediately, but just make sure not to make the hire just exclusively on that. I've made that mistake a few times and it's a common one to get into. So make sure you're vetting properly, even if somebody with a large following on Substack or Twitter. That's I think an important thing to keep in mind.\n\nLenny (00:37:25):\n1000% agree. I always say that the best product leader is the best growth. People don't have time to sit on Twitter and tweet and write newsletters. They're doing the job, working, building, growing, and maybe eventually they get out of that and start writing. But I 1000% agree, there's a lot of people-\n\nLuc Levesque (00:37:40):\nWell, not to disqualify all the people on Twitter.\n\nLenny (00:37:43):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:37:43):\nSome of them are tweeting [inaudible 00:37:45], but my point is just don't over pivot on the halo. Just look at their past performance. What teams have they been on? What environment do they have? Do they really know growth? And sometimes they do, but I think it's a common mistake to say, \"Oh yeah, they have a large following, let's hire this person.\" That's poorly.\n\nLenny (00:38:03):\n1000% agree. Rarely does a celebrity hire that seems really genius on Twitter and Substack end up being as amazing as you think.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:38:12):\nYeah, it does happen, but yeah.\n\nLenny (00:38:13):\nIt does happen. Absolutely. One last question around this topic. People listening might want to become growth advisors, I'd mentioned this earlier. Is there any other advice you want to share? Just like, \"If you want to become a growth advisor someday, here's what you should think about.\"\n\nLuc Levesque (00:38:26):\nYeah, I think the right mental model as a growth advisor is around the same one as an investor. So the most important thing an advisor can do aside from having impact and knowing their craft is picking which companies to work with, especially if you're working for equity. So I'll only speak to that, but you're basically putting in your time, you're picking likely a smaller number. You only have so many hours in the day of companies to work with and you want to make sure there's a likely exit in the future. So for me personally, I have a spreadsheet, like most big decisions that I make in my life. Over the years I've just added criteria and questions to ask myself about the company and then reflect on, \"Okay, is this kind of checking all the boxes for a likely outcome?\" Because you don't just need to be successful, you need to be successful and for the company to be successful and for there to be liquidity of that.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:39:17):\nSo you need to put yourself in the shoes of an investor and look at it as an investment. That is arguably the most important thing because you can go and do a great job and then wait many years and potentially not see any reward for it. And I think that's the nice thing about the equity structure in that you're tied in the same incentives with the founder, which is just great in terms of any relationship to have the same incentives, but you want to make sure that there's a good likelihood of a decent outcome down the road.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:39:49):\nIf I can throw another one in.\n\nLenny (00:39:49):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:39:50):\nThe other piece of advice I would give is it can take a long time for some of these companies to be successful. That's okay. You should expect that. In fact, you should just go in with that mindset. When I'm deciding to work with a company, I'm in there for 10 years and I know that and I say that. And I say, \"I'm in. We're in this together if I choose to work with the company.\" But it does mean that the structure of the deal needs to reflect that. So you need to have a long tail at the end.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:40:15):\nSo if you're taking options or RSUs and it's pure of the equity, make sure you have the time for that to happen. There would be nothing worse than putting your heart and soul having impact and then waiting, I don't know, a couple years and then your equity expires. So you make sure there's a long tail. I mean, it can literally take over 10 years for these companies to exit. And you should be okay with that. I think that's okay. You're taking some risks. They're taking some risk on you and that's a great partnership, but you'll just need the time for that. So advice to growth advisors, make sure to ask for a long tail so that you don't end up in a bad spot in the end. And that incentives, again, are perfectly aligned between the founder and the advisor.\n\nLenny (00:40:52):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is the next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10X your experiment velocity.\n\nLenny (00:41:59):\nSo I want to segue to a different topic, SEO. You're kind of the... You tell me, but it feels like you're one of the earliest SEO people in tech. You helped grow Tripadvisor many years ago and it was mostly SEO-driven. I think you innovated a lot of SEO tactics and strategies. And then you helped Pinterest, Thumbtack, other companies that are very SEO-driven. You talked about how many companies grow through one channel and these are all very SEO-driven companies. I imagine Shopify has a lot of SEO work that's happening right now with you there. And so I want to chat about SEO. So I guess broadly SEO is like... It's like this amazing growth channel. It's basically free. It continues to work after you stop doing any work on it for a while. Many founders think about, \"Should we invest in SEO? How do we approach SEO?\" So maybe just as a first question, what are signs that your product and company is a good fit for SEO being potentially a huge channel for growth?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:42:55):\nYeah, I've been doing SEO for a really long time. It's a lot of fun and certainly being a supervisor was a great learning ground for that, that we were able to really innovate and try new things there. In terms of the playbook that we built out. That was a lot of fun, those years.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:43:11):\nCouple thoughts. The first one would be I do think there's an SEO play in any company. Maybe at a different extent, but Google is such a large funnel of existing demand for your product or your product area that there's usually an angle to get some SEO traffic there. So I do think it applies to most companies. I would say if you're an early product that the world's never seen, it's a brand new thing, there might be some creation, some demand creation you need to do, but most of the time there's existing demand in Google where you can harvest demand or there's queries that are related to your topic that you can start ranking for to start building brand awareness. So there's always some angle.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:43:52):\nAnd then I kind of divide websites or online products into two categories. There's the ones which are smaller sites, small number of pages, very targeted at your product and don't have this kind of loop of creating new pages automatically. Most eCommerce sites actually have would a number of pages around the products and about us, those types of pages. That's one type of sites. Let's say they have dozen pages. And then there's other ones with thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of pages which are either user generated content like Tripadvisor and Pinterest and others, or marketplaces like Thumbtack and other types of websites like that. Those are generally easier to see a huge amount of impact very quickly because there's such a large optimization surface and ideally it's growing and generating traffic automatically.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:44:40):\nI've always thought of LinkedIn as just such a great example of this where you have this viral loop where if you recall when it was just starting, everybody was getting these invites from LinkedIn. Those come and go. You get an invite, you register, you don't. That happens. But the byproduct is when people join, they create this beautiful lightning page, which is your profile that gets indexed. It's kind of like a viral loop feeding an SEO loop that continues to grow. So that's a good example of use generated content which kind of feeds on itself and grows. So there's those two categories. Going back to the first category, if you only have a small handful of pages, the way to think about that is you certainly want to optimize those pages, then you want to start creating content that speaks to your audience beyond that. So you need a content strategy, whether it's a blog or creating new parts of your site that address questions that your audience might have. But generally speaking, I think there's an SEO play in any company and there's just different tactics, strategies, and approaches to get there.\n\nLenny (00:45:40):\nAwesome. I never thought of it that way, that there's kind of these two buckets. So the first bucket is like you don't have a ton of pages that naturally are generated as a part of your experience. And the second is you do. I guess in the second bucket I think of Reddit and Glassdoor and Quora, Tripadvisor, a great example, Pinterest. In the first bucket is the way to generate pages. Basically, it's editorially write content and have people write things for you. Is that generally the strategy?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:46:07):\nThere's different ways of doing it, but a good content strategy is a kind of tried and true approach. Definitely.\n\nLenny (00:46:13):\nAnd in that bucket of you don't naturally have a ton of pages, can you primarily grow through SEO? Or is SEO always going to be this minority channel and you have to find something else?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:46:24):\nNo, it can be a big channel. This is also about creating content, but it's not your users creating the content. You have to go create the content and have some high quality answer to a question that's being asked on Google. I think one thing to keep in mind with SEO is entire industries are based off of single keywords. I remember when I was in the travel industry that literally companies were bought and sold based on one keyword rank. So it's not like, \"Oh, it's a little bit of traffic.\" And I think this is a bit unintuitive with growth. A lot of people, they'll think of growth as linear or it's another channel, it's another thing. I mean, growth done right is exponential. It literally is company changing.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:47:00):\nWhen you're talking specifically about SEO, keep in mind the world is searching for that thing, targeted on that one keyword and likely you're clicking the number one search result. So getting that number one spot is not like, \"Oh, that's a little bit of traffic.\" You can literally build an entire business around that first spot. So don't think that's... Well, maybe it is commonly known, I'm not sure, but it's definitely something that is non-obvious or intuitive I think to most people. And if you have an entire SEO team working on one keyword, I don't think that's crazy because a small number of keywords can define an entire industry or a business.\n\nLenny (00:47:37):\nIs there an example of that sort of situation when keyword's building a massive company?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:47:41):\nYeah, I mean there's a lot I'm sure. I can speak to my own company that I sold to Tripadvisor. It was called TravelPod. It was a travel blogging website where you can think WordPress, but for travel, which I started earlier. It was the first site to do that. I made the mistake of not knowing SEO or growth before I sold the company. And so that was a great learning for me. When I went in, this is a story where we're looking to acquire another site and I thought the product was pretty poor. I remember talking to the founder and thinking... He'd asked me if we'd want to acquire it, and, \"The product's terrible. Why would I want to acquire that?\" He's like, \"Yeah, they're 10 times bigger than you.\" And, \"What?\" That was when I realized, \"Okay, we've been building a great product and great engineering culture and it is important, but you really need to know this growth stuff.\" So that's actually the moment I shifted to, \"All right, we have to really know these growth levers.\"\n\nLuc Levesque (00:48:34):\nIn that space, the number one keyword was Travel Blog. And so owning that was a big deal and we did not own it. I think we ranked number two for a really long time. I can't remember if we got it in the end, but that's just one example where... And there was many, many travel businesses where I always loved looking at a business and trying to figure out, \"What's their growth loop? How did they do that?\" And it's not like, \"Oh, it's a great business. It just grew.\" Most of the time it's price line crushed it at SEM. Facebook crushed it at a viral loop where you got tagged in a photo, you got an email and you had to go register because there's a photo of you somewhere you really want to see. Tripadvisor did a great job at SEO. In [inaudible 00:49:14], it's just one really strong channel that propelled the company forward. And in this case, it can literally come down to one keyword like we had at TravelPod.\n\nLenny (00:49:20):\nSo maybe it's a good time just to give a people a mental model of the different channels/loops that exist. So you've talked about SEO is one, paid search is one. What's the collection for people to think about? Usually as you said, one of the use is the primary source of growth for a company.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:49:38):\nYeah, there's a variety of them. I think you have to look at where the intent is right now. It does change over time, but you have social channels like TikTok, Instagram. Influencers are a great area to engage with there. You have SEO, you have search. I think ChatGPT is another upcoming one that we might want to talk about a little bit where I do think we've never seen that kind of growth for search before and that's a platform that we have to start thinking about how do we optimize for it. Google just announced there are recent changes. They're going to be putting in an AI box at the top, the searchers also, how do you optimize in a world where it's not so much about optimizing for the platform, but teaching the AI what you do and why you're the best in the world at it. So that's another whole area that we could talk about, but that's a big channel I think that that's growing.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:50:29):\nViral loops are always a powerful thing if you can get them to work. That's more about psychology and channel optimization, where you want people to be incentivized to share the product that you have with their friends and then to have their friends come back and register. So you can have one viral loop, you can have secondary viral loops, you can bolt viral loops on your existing products. There's different ways of doing this. And then just backing up. When I think about growth, I don't think about a specific... It's not growth equals SEO and Instagram. For me, growth equals whatever it takes to move the needle. So I get this question all the time, \"How do you build a growth team? What does a growth team do?\" And I say whatever it takes. That could be zero to one building a new product. It could be M&A, it could be SEO, it could be social, it could be onboarding.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:51:15):\nI think that's a better framework to look at. And then if you look at it through that lens, then partnerships easily folds into that where I've seen a lot of businesses get very big on just really clever partnerships, either strategic or broad kind of affiliate based partnerships. So there's a lot of channels. I definitely wouldn't restrict the scope of a growth team to just a small subset, but have a very wide funnel or at least strategy in terms of just test a lot of different things and go after the channels that work and pivot when it does, and then really lean into the one or two or three that really work because sometimes that's all it takes for business.\n\nLenny (00:51:50):\nWell, you definitely nerd sniped me with the ChatGPT, so let's just spend some time there. I think this relates to just the general sense that SEO is always changing and it feels like this is an SEM I guess in this case too. And ChatGPT and Bard, I guess, is maybe the latest change. So what should we know there?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:52:05):\nYeah, I think we're all still trying to figure it out. I was at Google IO last week or the week before. As soon as I saw the search result with the big box of AI, answers at the top, having done this for so long, I immediately knew the impact that I think is about to come. I've seen this play out in travel where Google acquired ITA and did flight search and hotel search. Generally, it's great for users and great for Google and the search engines, but makes it a little bit difficult for the publishers and the sites that are adding value to the ecosystem through being ranked in search results.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:52:42):\nSo what we're about to see is basically Google, what they showed was a big box on top of the search results that answers the query directly. So if you think about that, that means that there's a lot of queries right now that users are clicking through down on the organic links and getting their answer there, which will be answered directly in the search result. We've seen this play out over the last five to 10 years where more and more answers are being shown at the top. Every time something changes, entire industries are disrupted or are changed. And I think that's going to happen again.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:53:14):\nSo there's different types of keywords. There's transactional ones like e-commerce keywords with purchase intent. There's navigational ones where you're trying to get somewhere. And there's informational keywords, which is, \"I have a question. I'm looking for an answer.\" It's pretty broad. It's a big area. I think that last category of keywords is particularly at risk. So if anybody listening to this is currently getting traffic on those, you should start thinking about what does that mean when things start changing. And I think the changes will be... We'll probably start seeing things shift to paid. You have to pay for that free traffic.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:53:47):\nThe second one is there may just be a case where those keywords just don't get many clicks anymore. You might drop down to a very small number of clicks, if at all, because questions will get answered directly in the search results. So it's a big shift. We have to see how things land, but that's, I think over the next 12 to 24 months, if history repeats itself, we'll see that channel change. We've seen this play out in all the different channels. They kind of evolve generally. You can't blame the companies are doing what they have to do. ChatGPT is now 50% of my daily searches and not Google. So I think Google has to react and this is what we'll see. So from a growth perspective, definitely something to start to think about.\n\nLenny (00:54:25):\nSuper fascinating. I think about my newsletter and now Google suck it all up and just tell you all the answers. Great. Good news for me.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:54:33):\n[inaudible 00:54:34].\n\nLenny (00:54:39):\nYeah. Yeah. And change is great. Things don't-\n\nLuc Levesque (00:54:41):\nIt's exciting. It's exciting. I'm just geeking out on growth a little bit, we haven't had a big platform change in a long time. So I'm like, \"All right, cool. Let's go see what we can do here. How do you optimize this? How do you get listed if you can?\" We're not sure where the placements will be, but that will be the new game.\n\nLenny (00:54:58):\nYeah, there's actually a lennybot.com that is a GPT bot trained on my content that there's a newsletter post about how it was all built so you could build your own. And so I think my new goal is going to have to convince people to go to lennybot.com instead of Google. Wish me luck.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:55:15):\nHey, you got to lean into it. Yeah, we have a shop.ai, this great AI-based shopping engine. And I'll tell you, I bought so much on it. It's so good. The more you use these technologies, the more you realize how good they are. And that's something biggest coming. It's not just, \"Oh yeah, there's another change.\" I was summarizing the Google change is to some people and originally was thinking this is the biggest change in the last 10 years. And then when I reflected on the last 10 years, I thought this is actually the biggest change since the inception of Google actually. I don't think we've seen something as profound as what's coming. And you really need to get ready for it.\n\nLenny (00:55:52):\nYeah, I've been using ChatGPT for helping me with interview questions actually, and once in a while there's like a really good one.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:55:59):\nOh, that's cool.\n\nLenny (00:56:00):\nSo thank you ChatGPT, bringing me good things also. Maybe one more question along these lines around kind of connecting advisorship in SEO. Would you suggest when you're starting to think about SEO, starting to invest in SEO, you might be listening to this feeling like, \"I got to think about SEO,\" does it make sense to bring on, say, SEO advisor like you? I know you're not available currently, but other folks like you or are an agency that is really good at this stuff or bring on someone full time? Do you have any kind of frameworks for thinking about which direction to go?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:56:30):\nIt's hard for an agency or a pure advisor without internal help to do a really good job without internal talent at the center. So I would say I would start with just hire somebody internally and give them the mandate and incentivize them correctly to go and own this channel. Even if they don't know SEO, my advice would be get an engineer, get somebody who is just a relentless doer who wants to learn this and surround them with great advisors that I've just seen that work really well.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:56:59):\nThere are some good agencies out there. Agencies will be working with multiple companies, so it's a little bit harder to get the same impact from an agency. It can work sometimes. But my preference is generally a last resort would be an agency. And I'd much rather have somebody who's internal who knows the business, who knows the keywords, who can have the knowledge internally inside the company permanently and help grow a team around them and have succession in place and a proper team so that you're not too dependent on this one person. But that would be my go-to. And then if you're really stuck, you can use agencies, but my default would be having somebody internal supplemented with agencies if you have to. Sorry, SEO is very specific. I mean, it's a very tight channel that knowing certain things about it can have a big impact. I think you do want people that have that experience that can bring that in from the outside to augmenting internal teams. It'll take a really long time to learn it.\n\nLenny (00:58:01):\nAwesome. I was going to ask that. So you ideally want to find someone that's done it before that isn't just a relentless learner, but is that plus, has done SEO in the past?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:58:08):\nOh, yeah. Ideally, you hire an amazing SEO person who can bring internal. Second would be somebody amazing who can get things done, surround them with advisors. And then in my stack rank, the third would be agencies.\n\nLenny (00:58:20):\nAwesome. And then the other kind of common issue with SEOs, it takes a long time to show impact. Do you have just a rule of thumb of just give them this much time to see if they can make an impact?\n\nLuc Levesque (00:58:29):\nI'd say a few things. I'd say if you already have content and pages that are pretty good and getting a decent amount of traffic, it doesn't necessarily have to take a long time. So that would be my first reaction. It can take a long time. Generally, it takes a long time when you have to build new content. So the way to think about Google is it is going to take your content, it's going to show it to its users, people that are searching, and it's going to determine which piece of content is the best to ranked highly. It's not just about little tricks and links and keyword ratios. Those days are over. Those do matter, but it's not purely about that. And if you have a new piece of content, it takes time for Google to build enough trust to say, \"Okay, I'm going to start showing this to users now\" and then start collecting user feedback and then rank it appropriately. That can take some time.\n\nLuc Levesque (00:59:14):\nBut if you have existing pages that are ranking eight and they're already on the first page, it doesn't always happen. But I've certainly seen it, in fact more common than not that you could have sometimes hundreds of percentages of lift very quickly. And it depends what you're starting with, is probably the right way to think about it. So if I'm trying to summarize it, I would say 12 months is probably max. If you can't see impact in 12 months, there's something wrong. If you have existing content, it could happen pretty early. It could happen on day one. Actually I've seen that happen. If you have to build new parts of the site, it can take months. I've seen that happen in companies I've worked with where I think it would be like a quarter, we had to wait till we saw a big lift. So it's somewhere between three to 12 months.\n\nLenny (01:00:05):\nAwesome. That's really helpful. Okay, so final topic/final question. You've had a truly incredible career. You've worked with incredible companies, incredible leaders. I'm looking at your site here in a site window and you're like, here's a picture of you and Zuck. Here's a picture of you and Toby from Shopify, and there's more. I'm curious what you believe has been key to your success and your career success that you suggest listeners who want to have some measure of similar success do.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:00:36):\nIt's probably a bunch of things we could talk about here. Yeah, this is the obvious thing is I think you've just got to love what you do. You got to work hard. You have to have impact. Certainly at the end of the day in growth, that's all that will matter. If I think back to specific things that I do though to pick one thing that's been very important for me throughout my journey is the art of self-reflection. And coaches. I've had coaches my whole career. But the macro theme is you're constantly iterating, experimenting, and becoming the best you can be in your career also as a dad and as a husband, and of course for your own personal health. But that reflection is so important. I've leveraged many, many different coaches over the years and now do a lot of self-reflection through a morning routine that I have and that I've been doing for quite some time that has been a big unlock for me.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:01:32):\nThe biggest, most important part of that morning routine is dedicating an hour aside to really think about, \"What's going well? What's not going well? What am I screwing up? Well, why am I screwing it up?\" Which is often more important than, \"What am I screwing up?\" And of course, \"What am I going to do about it?\" But as long as you're learning and iterating every day, then you're just making constant progress towards your goals. It's something I do that I love doing. I love thinking. So I literally can just sit there and think for hours actually. I have a dashboard on all the areas that I'm focusing on with red, yellow, green, and just constantly revving on what am I working on improving, what am I doing, what experiments am I running and where am I doing well and where am I not doing well and how can I be better in all areas of my life, including being a leader. There's a lot of different things to it, but I think that's really important and something that I've learned over the years that is probably the most valuable to have as a skill.\n\nLenny (01:02:32):\nI definitely want to spend more time on this. So you said you sit for an hour reflecting on what's going well, what's not going well. Is there more you can share about how you accomplish that, how you find time to do this for an hour?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:02:43):\nYeah, it sounds crazy when you say it, but I do. So I wake up at 5:00. I work out. So I do cardio, I do some exercise. There's this great book called Spark, which is all around the neuroscience of exercise and I really learned a lot from that in terms of having this great morning routine that really boots you up. I kind of call it my bootloader. When I start in the day, if I go through my bootloader, I have just a much better day.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:03:09):\nSo exercise, stretching, meditation, and then I do a cold plunge now. So I do a bunch of different things. But then I do some reading, but I do carve aside one hour where I go through... And this is probably important and it's where I've landed, but structured self reflections. That's why I have this dashboard. I have certain areas that I think about what's going well, what's not. I track all the experiments I'm writing. I'm just really passionate about if you're going to do something, try to do it as best as you can. This is a habit that has allowed me to sharpen my skills in certain areas.\n\nLenny (01:03:47):\nWhat are some of these things you're working on? If you can share what's on this dashboard, how can people imagine what this might be?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:03:53):\nSo there's a lot of personal stuff on it, but it literally is broken down between being a better friend, better husband, better dad, and then better leader. And so on the personal side, I've been known to work a lot of times. Balance is always hard to find. From being a dad and then thinking about how to be better there, I realized about six months ago that I've never actually asked for feedback on how I'm doing. So I asked my kids six months ago, I asked both of them independently, \"What's one thing I can do to do more of or do less of to be a better dad?\" And they were kind of caught off guard by it. My son's 15 and my other son is 12. And I said, \"Take some time to think about it.\" And after about a month, my son came back and said, \"Dad, I got one.\" He said, \"I want to spend more time with you.\"\n\nLuc Levesque (01:04:53):\nSo that was very helpful for me to hear. I'm big on routines and habits to make sure that things that you want to do are repeatable and it's not one-off things. So ever since that day, I've now have a daddy date if you want to call it. But every two weeks we do one-on-one time together with each of the boys. They get to pick what we do just so we have that consistent, whether it's dinner or play basketball in the front. But it's all about feedback. So that's one example on the personal side.\n\nLenny (01:05:27):\nThis reminds me of a tweet I just saw where someone said that the only people that are going to remember that you worked late for many nights is your kids.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:05:37):\nWow. Wow. That's deep. I like that a lot.\n\nLenny (01:05:43):\nAs a soon to be parent, that's going to stick with me.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:05:46):\nWow, I like that a lot. So it's tough, right? It's tough to balance it all out. It's very difficult because you want excel at everything you do in life. So that reflection helps, be it check-in as well of how am I doing in all these areas? And that I find the color coding is helpful for that too, of just doing a bit of a gut check and asking for that feedback.\n\nLenny (01:06:06):\nSo it also makes me think about, I was watching a Jeff Bezos interview and ask him what his morning routine was and he said that he just likes to putter around. he likes to just sit around, talk to his kids, read the newspaper. He doesn't book any meetings in the morning. He just finds he just needs a little flex time at the beginning.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:06:22):\nTotally. Before I became a dad, I read somewhere that one of the most impactful things you can do as a father is just be there for dinner every night. So I have been there for 15 years every single night. But it was a good reminder it's not enough. Having dinner is important with your family, but in our case there's more you can do. And just getting that feedback and doing some reprioritization is always important.\n\nLenny (01:06:46):\nSpeaking of dinners, and maybe just as a last question, I know you do this really interesting thing where you have dinners with interesting people. You just kind of invite them to your house. I don't know if interesting is the right way to describe it, but just kind of interesting people, prominent people. Can you just talk about what that is and what you think about and the benefits of doing something like that?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:07:04):\nI think interesting is the right way to think about it.\n\nLenny (01:07:05):\nOkay.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:07:07):\nI started this when I was in Ottawa with a bunch of founders there. It's become one of my favorite things to do. Honestly, it's like the bright spot in my month that, I call them guilds. So the word guild is with the builders. That's how it originally started. So Guild Night is what I call it. The idea is basically all interesting people doing interesting things actually want to spend time with each other. That's why I'm actually surprised more people don't do this. But I'll basically have interesting people come, usually five or six. We'll sit around talking about specific topics. So I do one for consumer product, I do one for SEO, I do one for growth leaders and just have really smart, interesting people come and we'll talk about different topics that are relevant.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:07:57):\nSometimes we'll pick a topic, so we'll have a group and then we'll say, \"Hey, we want to talk about AI.\" So one of the advantages of being in the Bay Area is you can find three or four people that likely wrote some of the core code in Google or in AI, and then they'll join. People want to meet. People want to get together and have these conversations. So it's very exhilarating. I learn a ton. It's a lot of fun. I don't know why more people don't do it. And it's a bit of work to organize, but it's also just tactically been a great way to meet fascinating people. It's helped a lot for recruiting, for if you need a back channel. Now you know all these people that are in different industries. But business aside, they're very valuable business wise, but they're just a lot of fun and they've become some of my favorite things that I do.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:08:43):\nI'm really surprised why more people don't do it because I think especially now that everybody's remote and we're working from home, or most people are, it's more valued than ever. So it's something I'm looking forward to continuing and always actually through my morning reflection, thinking about what are new ones I can spin up who are interesting people that we want to break bread with. I do think it's important that it's done at your house. If anybody's thinking of starting this, you can do it at a restaurant, but there's something about being in your home or being in somebody's home, five or six people having a great conversation about a topic that's mutually interesting. I think everybody values it and it adds a lot of spice to life. I think it's really important.\n\nLenny (01:09:23):\nAny other tactical tips for making one of these happen? So you do it at your home, you cater. How many people? How long? Anything else you want to share there?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:09:31):\nYeah, so I think the most I've done is 10. That's a bit too much. Six seems to be perfect, six to eight, eight at the max. I do get a catered so you don't have to worry about cooking. The topic, something like a topic that it's common so that everybody can rally around. I do think it's important, like I mentioned, doing it at home. Usually we start around 6:00, we go till 9:00 or 10. It's just been a really good thing that I've learned over time is a really good thing to do to just make for a better life, frankly. Make richer life with some great friends.\n\nLenny (01:10:08):\nAnd when we say cater, it's just ordering in basically, right? It's not that-\n\nLuc Levesque (01:10:11):\nYeah, you can just DoorDash some food so you don't have to worry about cooking. I'm sure there's other things. I've never really deeply thought about it, but in terms of what are the specific things, I've evolved it over time, but I don't cook anyways, so it would be terrible if I cooked. So this is much easier to do it this way. And as long as you're inviting kind of interesting people, everybody's going to want to come and spend some time and bring some bread.\n\nLenny (01:10:33):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:10:39):\nI think so.\n\nLenny (01:10:40):\nI think you are. Well, question one. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:10:47):\nSo there's one that I've already mentioned, which is Spark. It's the neuroscience of exercise. That's a great book. It's not one of these exercise to stay fit and to live longer. This is really about, frankly, if you exercise and do it in a specific way, they have a kind of blueprint they lay out, it's good for just cognition and kind of horsepower and performance. So that's been a really important one and has been a big part of me building on my morning routine. The second one is when I picked up I think about a year ago or six months, and I recommended it, gee, I don't know, at least to a couple hundred people now because I recommended it to my team. It's called Smart Brevity. Have you heard of this one?\n\nLenny (01:11:31):\nNo, but I love the sound of it.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:11:33):\nI've always been big on writing crisply and being very tight and not having three-page memos that you're sending off. Especially now that we're remote and we're all doing slack and email and different ways of messaging, how tightly you communicate, how crisp your communication is really important for frankly you getting your point across and also for the other person who's probably digesting a hundred of these messages. So this book is... It's a book on how to do that. It breaks down how to write crisply and the different parts of it. I've definitely seen improvements in the team since I've passed around. So that's a great book frankly for anybody, work or personal because we're writing so much and communication is so key. So that's the second one. The third one is a golden oldie. It's one that I've read many, many times and I recommend from a growth perspective. This one youlikely heard of, it's Influence by Cialdini.\n\nLenny (01:12:28):\nI got it back on my bookshelf there.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:12:30):\nYeah, it's a great book, and it's because it's really the underpinning of so many different product and growth principles that you can apply. So that's just a classic that is good to reread at least once a year. So those are three books.\n\nLenny (01:12:42):\nI'm going to extend this a little bit. I'm going to add two books that are building on your two books, or the first two books, I guess. One is Peter Attia just wrote a book called Outlive. That is-\n\nLuc Levesque (01:12:50):\nI've got to read it.\n\nLenny (01:12:51):\nOkay. And it's exactly the same kind of premise of just how important exercise is. I think there's a quote in there of just the only thing proven to help you live longer is exercise. And then Smart Brevity, there's another book that I'd recommend if people want more on though on this topic called Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:13:07):\n[inaudible 01:13:08].\n\nLenny (01:13:08):\nAnd it's by the guy that wrote the War of Art and Bagger Vance. I forget his name off the top of my head, but it's like, \"Nobody wants to read your shit. Here's what you need to do for people to want to read anything you're writing.\"\n\nLuc Levesque (01:13:23):\nYeah. We want to scan. We want to read. Yeah, that's great. I'll pick that one up. Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit.\n\nLenny (01:13:27):\nExactly. What a title.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:13:29):\nThat's a great title.\n\nLenny (01:13:31):\nAll right, back on track. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:13:36):\nI don't watch TV much and I haven't really watched any movies in a while. But I do watch a lot of podcasts on YouTube. Andrew Huberman has got, of course, a great series. I've watched I think everyone he puts out, so I don't know if that counts, but that's-\n\nLenny (01:13:49):\nAbsolutely\n\nLuc Levesque (01:13:50):\nOkay. So I watched that. And then of course the All-In Podcast is always fun, so I make sure to watch those when they come out as well. A lot of fun and informative. So those are my two, I would say.\n\nLenny (01:14:01):\nGreat picks. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:14:06):\nTeach me something about growth that I don't already know. Because... and you could apply this to engineering product, any other area, because it really gives you a sense of what this person thinks is the top of the stack in terms of the smartest thing they know. Whether you know it or not is irrelevant. But sometimes you actually do end up learning some stuff. But it's my favorite question because you can really engage in a conversation around, \"Okay, the thing you think is so unique that maybe you've come up with this learning yourself or you've created this tactic and then it gives you a sense of how much they know the craft.\" So that's my favorite question.\n\nLenny (01:14:42):\nWhat is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you just really love?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:14:46):\nI've got a cold plunge that I bought that I love. So it's called the Renew Cold Plunge. It's cold but super convenient and I do that every morning and I just love it.\n\nLenny (01:14:58):\nAny advice for cold plunging? That sounds very painful and hard.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:15:01):\nI usually start going... I go in a hot tub to warm up, then I go in the cold plunges and back in the hot tub. That's an easy way to get started. But I will say I jumped in yesterday and today without going to hot tub. It was very painful, but I felt so much better after. So I might be changing up my approach, but I'm just kind of experimenting with different things. But that would be some advice. And then just go slow. Start it not too cold, and then slowly make it cold over time. But I think it's a pretty good thing to add in so far.\n\nLenny (01:15:31):\nHow long have you spent in the cold plunge?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:15:33):\nIt varies. Right now I'm doing five minutes. Five minutes at, I think it's 53 degrees. So I've started at 60, slowly bringing it down. But you do have to go slow because I brought it down even further and kind of caught me off guard and got a little dizzy. So you got to find your sweet spot.\n\nLenny (01:15:53):\nDamn. Very Huberman inspired. I imagine this-\n\nLuc Levesque (01:15:57):\nDefinitely it was part of the source there.\n\nLenny (01:15:59):\nI know people would hear a lot about cold plunges. I guess what have you seen as a benefit just while we're on this topic for people to seriously consider doing this?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:16:06):\nSo a couple things. Mood afterwards is so much better. You get this great multi-hour boost from doing it. Especially like I mentioned, not doing warm before or waiting 10 minutes and waiting 10 minutes after before you warm up, after you get out, great mood boost. It also helps a lot with sleep. So if you do it at night, which is a little bit difficult, it helps a lot with sleep. Those are probably the two biggest things. And you do get to a point, I'm there now where I kind of look forward to it because you know how good you'll feel afterwards. So when I'm thinking about it, I know it's painful, it doesn't make it easier, but I do look forward to it now. It's a pretty cool thing.\n\nLenny (01:16:44):\nOh man. I got to get one now.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:16:46):\nYeah. [inaudible 01:16:49].\n\nLenny (01:16:49):\nOkay, two more questions. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:16:56):\nOne change that comes to mind is it's common to hear discussion around you need to experiment, you need to have rigor, you need to look at results, iterate based on those results. That's pretty much common knowledge is how all good companies that execute growth that do it. I think the subtlety is that experiments are great, but they can be slow. You have to look at the results. You have to analyze how things went. You have to learn what's going on. You have to build the experiment. So there's a cost to an experiment and not everything needs to be experimented. And that's not something that I generally hear growth teams talk about. It's usually, \"Hey, we need to experiment.\"\n\nLuc Levesque (01:17:40):\nSo one thing that we're definitely focused more on lately is this idea of sometimes you just need to YOLO it because it's a better product experience or you just kind of know it's going to work. And if you're YOLO-ing 40 things and three of them work and you can look at pre-post, you can look at holdouts, there's ways of making sure you don't cause major damage, but the speed can outweigh the cost and time it takes to do experiment. So that's one change we've recently implemented. That's been pretty impactful.\n\nLenny (01:18:09):\nFinal question. So we met actually a long time ago in Montreal, or maybe it was in Ottawa, in Canada somewhere. I think it was through an organization called C100 when I was starting my company back in the day. And so my question is, what is your favorite Canadian food?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:18:24):\nIt's funny. My favorite Canadian food, I'm from Ottawa and there's a lot of shawarma, Lebanese shawarma everywhere. I know it's not traditionally Canadian, but Canada's so multicultural, so I'll make this count. I love a good shawarma and it's so hard to find a good shawarma in the Bay Area. We've still been looking here. But my favorite Canadian food or pseudo Canadian is shawarma. If I had to pick one purely Canadian food, and this is related to Montreal where we first met, it's got to be a Montreal smoked meat sandwich.\n\nLenny (01:18:58):\nExcellent choices. You're making me very hungry. I'm going to go get some shawarma, buy me a cold plunge. Luc, this was amazing. We talked through everything I was hoping to talk through. Advisorships, SEO, hiring, building habits, cold plunges. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nLuc Levesque (01:19:18):\nYou can find me online at luclevesque.com. So first name, last name.com. And how can they be useful to me? Listen, we're always looking to hire the best of the best. So if you want to work at an amazing company with an amazing team doing very impactful work and learn the craft of growth, please reach out. We're always looking to bring on amazing talent. So that would be the woodway.\n\nLenny (01:19:40):\nAwesome. Luc, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nLuc Levesque (01:19:43):\nThanks. It's great to chat.\n\nLenny (01:19:45):\nBye everyone.\n\nLenny (01:19:48):\nThank you so much for listening.

So what it means is people have things that they either care about or don't, and you're not going to change that. So it's a huge lift to try to change someone's worldview or their passions. It's a light lift to take the thing you want to talk about and just shape it into, to fit into their worldview or their passions. There's not always a fit.\n\n(00:00:33):\nThere's going to be people who are just not your natural audience, and you should know that and not waste your time. But if your natural audience cares about X and you're offering Y, then it's your job to create the API or to create the bridge from X to Y. With messaging, it's not build it and they will come. It is so hard and you'd have to be superhumanly gifted to the extent that I can't recall seeing in my entire life, where you create a message and a story so powerful that someone who didn't care at all before suddenly makes that their passion. It's so much easier to take what they're passionate about and understand it, and then convince them that if they care about that then they should care about your thing because of this connection.\n\nLenny (00:01:18):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Lulu Meservey. I met Lulu while she was head of comms at Substack, where she was infamous for taking big risks and bold stands, and as a result creating a lot of attention for Substack, and other companies she's represented. Lulu is definitely the most innovative and interesting comms person I've worked with.\n\n(00:01:46):\nShe's currently executive vice president of corporate affairs and chief communications officer at Activision Blizzard. And she writes what I'd say is the best newsletter on PR and comms strategy, a newsletter called Flack. In our conversation we get tactical about how to make your idea spread, cultural erogenous zones, the growing importance of going direct versus relying on traditional media. The importance of taking risks in your comms and much more. Lulu is so insightful, I could have continued to explore the subject for hours. Enjoy this episode with Lulu Meservey after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:21):\nThis episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build AI powered features in your audio and video products then you need to know about AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to transcribe and understand speech at scale. What I love about AssemblyAI is you can use their simple API to access the latest AI breakthroughs from top tier research labs. They recently launched Conformer-1, the largest trained speech recognition model on the market which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. All of AssemblyAI's models, which are accessed through their API are production ready.\n\n(00:02:54):\nSo many PMs I know are considering or already building with AI, and AssemblyAI is the fastest way to build with AI for audio use cases. Now is the time to check out AssemblyAI with their new Conformer-1 model available today, which makes it even easier to bring the highest accuracy transcription to your customers just like Spotify, CallRail and Writer do for theirs. Visit assemblyai.com/lenny to try their API for free and start testing their models with their no code playground, that's assemblyai.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:28):\nThis episode is brought to you by Public.com who want to tell you about their new treasury accounts, which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash, that is higher than a high yield savings account while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year-high, but buying US treasuries is super complicated. If you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash into US treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account, and you can access your cash whenever you want even before your treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days, just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield.\n\n(00:04:10):\nPublic will automatically reinvest your treasury bills at maturity, so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield. And you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8%, a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a treasury account at public.com/lenny. Lulu welcome to the podcast.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:04:39):\nThank you Lenny. Great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:41):\nI am really excited to chat all things comms and PR. I've never met a founder or product leader who doesn't want to get better at spreading ideas and getting their product out there, and you're very good at this. We're going to talk about some of the things you've done in the space. But just to start maybe just broadly I'm curious to hear just what have you learned about what helps an idea spread?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:05:03):\nSo there's a few ways to make the idea spread, the overall principle is you have to make it memorable and you have to make people want to say it of their own volition. And so what doesn't make them want to say it is doing a favor for a corporation. What does make them want to say it is they want to bring joy to somebody else, they want to make somebody laugh, they want to appear interesting, or they want to project some part of their identity. And so a few things that you can do with an idea to make it spread better, you can make it into a joke, so you can turn it into a line that people will repeat. You can use an analogy, you can take something and just say it over and over, move fast and break things, don't be evil, build something people want.\n\n(00:05:47):\nYou can create a mental image that is very colorful. So I have a mental image for people that I use a lot, which is put the pill in some cheese and we can talk about it later, it's about how to craft a story that will stick. But when I say put the pill in cheese, people tend to remember that and it's more easily repeatable. And then the last thing is use a story, use an anecdote instead of using adjectives because adjectives are so subjective, they're meaningless to people. So if you give them a story that's something they can repeat over the dinner table.\n\nLenny (00:06:17):\nDo you have any examples of the frameworks you just shared? So you talked about maybe having an analogy or putting the pill in the cheese, which I think is referring to when you feed a dog a pill. You want to hide the pill in the cheese. Is there any stories or examples that come to mind of this in action either something you've done or other companies you've seen?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:06:34):\nOne example not for the better is binders of women. You remember when Mitt Romney said binders of women and it just absolutely caught on like wildfire, and it's because you can picture the binder, it's a hilarious mental image. You make lots of jokes about it. It's a very specific unusual phrasing that is very repeatable, and it lends itself so much to memeing. So it's not something that they wanted to have happen, which is a word of caution, this can backfire on you as well, but that's an example. I mentioned move fast and break things, software is eating the world, it's time to build. Those are these short phrases that take normal words and put them in an unusual order, and then especially if you repeat them a few times they just become very sticky.\n\nLenny (00:07:19):\nThese things sound really smart and wise after the fact, do you have any advice on just how to... So we're talking about coming up with a cool phrase that'll spread of how to do that. I don't know what have you seen work for coming up with move fast and break things, how would a founder approach that?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:07:35):\nYou want to make it something that a second-grader could understand. You want to minimize the cognitive burden on the recipient. So it should be something where they're not having to expend any extra energy understanding the thing, where it immediately paints a picture. Or if you were to make a joke, it has to be a joke that they immediately get, or it's a very widely understood reference. You don't want it to be this inside joke with yourself that other people might get if you explain it to them. So if you were to boil down the essence of let's say your company or your mission, get it to one sentence and then turn it into a sentence that you could explain to a second-grader, and then cleanse it of all cliches and common parlance. And if you can then turn that into an analogy or if you can make it into something that has imagery, then you're probably 80, 90% of the way there.\n\nLenny (00:08:36):\nSo you've definitely done this on Twitter. It might be fun just to share a tweet or something of yours that has done this that has spread like crazy. I noticed you delete your old tweets, which I think is really smart and I should probably do that. So I couldn't find any examples, but I remember just being like, \"Holy shit, it's got a bazillion views.\" Is there there an example that comes to mind that you could share? Just share something you put out that just went crazy.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:09:00):\nI actually have a negative example too. I think it's useful to share my mistakes or missteps in addition to what went right, because there's more mistakes and missteps than what goes right. In general, you try a bunch of things every once in a while they succeed. But I think it's useful to think about what didn't land. And so one of mine was when you might remember this because this was the Substack era, when we were taking a lot of incoming for not censoring enough, and we took a stand that we want to encourage free expression. I was actually on maternity leave, so I was a little bit out of the loop, but I wanted to jump in there and support the cause. And so I did a thread about why we're standing by this principle even when it's hard, and the thread was pretty well received, it traveled a lot.\n\n(00:09:53):\nI think it was 30 something thousand likes among people that we cared about, people who write on the internet. And then there was one tweet in the thread where I said something like, \"Doing this isn't pleasant, but neither for that matter is the sea.\" Completely esoteric reference, it was fresh in my mind because it was from a New Yorker book review where in that context it was poetic and evocative and beautiful. And I did the thing you're not supposed to do, which is take an inside joke with yourself and release it into the world.\n\n(00:10:33):\nAnd that one tweet was a dud in the middle of the thread where you could see the likes drop off precipitously and people were like, \"What are you talking about?\" And then afterwards I looked at it with fresh eyes, \"Yeah, this makes no sense whatsoever out of a context.\" And also I'm not a New York book reviewer, so that was a good don't. But the fact that it was such a colorful metaphor actually caught people's attention in an accidental way. I didn't mean for it too. I guess that's a don't, does that serve as an example?\n\nLenny (00:11:08):\nYeah, that'll work and we'll go through other examples. But that's a good segue to something I was going to save for later, but it may be a good time to chat about is just something that you're big on is this concept of taking risks as a comms person, I think you have the sense that comms people are just very conservative, and there's a big opportunity to get a little out there. And in this case maybe it didn't work out, other times you have and it has. So just talk about that philosophy you have around taking risks.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:11:34):\nI think if you're a startup your enemy is the status quo. And when you don't take risks, when you minimize risk by doing nothing, the best way to minimize risk is to do nothing. You're letting the status quo win. You're letting your greatest enemy and rival and threat to your business win by default, because you're not even going to try to compete. And so I always encourage people to try to make mistakes of commission rather than omission. Because if you make a mistake of commission you can observe it, you can learn from it. You know right away that it's happened. You can move really quickly and adapt and become better.\n\n(00:12:11):\nWhereas if you make mistakes of omission you're letting status quo win, you're not observing, you're not learning, and you're maybe not even noticing opportunities slip by. So the example that I use, again, an analogy to make it more memorable, my analogy for this is if you are investing money in the market versus if you're just sitting in cash. If you're sitting in cash you won't lose your money and it feels safe. But over time the world moves and the market grows, and everybody else is getting richer and you're getting poorer in real terms. Whereas if you make an investment it'll go up and down, there'll be some volatility. It's not just going to go up every day, but over the long run you'll be much, much better off.\n\nLenny (00:12:54):\nIs there an example of something you did that you took a risk and it worked out, or you saw someone else do this really well?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:13:00):\nThe stand for free speech thread would be a risk that worked out. It was a risk because it was a topic that a lot of people were already mad about, which will happen with every topic that matters. It felt a little risky for me because I was on leave, I wasn't really in the middle of things. I was addled already, so I had at least one thing in there that was nonsensical. So there was the execution risk of would I'd be able to do this well.\n\n(00:13:29):\nThere was also the risk of you poke your head up and make a thing where there wasn't a thing, and if that were to go wrong and embarrass the company or if that had made Chris or Hamish or Jerraj upset, that would've been upsetting to me and obviously a failure of my job. So that was a risk that I took and we took and they were supportive, and it did work out because the people who were most likely to write on Substack generally appreciate that stance.\n\n(00:14:00):\nI actually have one more for you Lenny when you asked about what are things that help stick in people's memory, there was the fail example of the sea analogy. I think a useful example that works is I often say to find your audience's cultural erogenous zones, and it is something that you immediately know what I'm talking about. If I say know your audience's cultural erogenous zones, you know what it means, it's a shorthand that everybody understands. It's not an inside joke with myself, and it's something that is unusual and upraising that you're going to repeat it and hopefully remember it, so there's one for you.\n\nLenny (00:14:40):\nYou told me about that framework and I definitely wanted to hear more about it. What does that mean and is there something that you've seen someone do that's just like, \"Wow, they really nailed this erogenous zone approach.\"\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:14:54):\nYeah, they really got it in the erogenous bull bullseye. So what it means is people have things that they either care about or don't, and you're not going to change that. So it's a huge lift to try to change someone's worldview or their passions. It's a light lift to take the thing you want to talk about and just shape it into, to fit into their worldview or their passions. There's not always a fit.\n\n(00:15:26):\nThere's going to be people who are just not your natural audience, and you should know that and not waste your time. But if your natural audience cares about X and you're offering Y, then it's your job to create the API or to create the bridge from X to Y. With messaging, it's not build it and they will come. It is so hard and you'd have to be superhumanly gifted to the extent that I can't recall seeing in my entire life, where you create a message and a story so powerful that someone who didn't care at all before suddenly makes that their passion. It's so much easier to take what they're passionate about and understand it, and then convince them that if they care about that then they should care about your thing because of this connection.\n\nLenny (00:16:09):\nThis makes me think about one of the other tweets that I think went crazy, which is where you share the things you're muting on Twitter. Where it's like the threads thimble and the pointing down thing, and it feels like that's exactly that where people are just like, \"Yep, this is me.\"\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:16:25):\nYeah, it is that. I have an example for you Lenny. The one that my mind goes to is when Kamala Harris was running for Senate. Put aside what anyone thinks of Kamala Harris as a politician or if you agree with her politics, it doesn't matter. When she was running for Senate, she had this example where not enough people care about K-12 education. It's not a sexy topic and only moms care about it, whereas people cared a lot and still do about national defense, national security.\n\n(00:16:55):\nAnd so she said the way to get their attention is you go to people who care about national security and you tell them, \"Did you know that in order to enlist for the army you have to have a 10th grade reading level?\" If you can't read at that level, you're not going to be able to read the army field manual. And so if you care about the future of national defense and being able to maintain a standing army, you need to care about middle grade reading standards. So that's a perfect example, and in fact it stuck with me such that many years later I'm still repeating it to you.\n\nLenny (00:17:28):\nSomething else that I think what you teach helps with is underdogs coming up against incumbent companies, giving them a chance to stand out. Like Substack I think is a good example where you just helped elevate Substack on the world stage in a lot of ways. What have you found works best for underdog startups and companies trying to get attention?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:17:49):\nFirst, you have to acknowledge that you're the underdog, and you're not going to use the GE playbook from the 1980s or whatever. So acknowledging that means knowing that you're not going to play the game that requires you to have more resources, more and deeper relationships, and institutional backings, and to be able to draft off of the current narrative. So all of those things are going to be not in your favor. If you're a startup for example, by definition you're trying to disrupt something, you're trying to do something differently, you're fighting the status quo. And if that's the case then you can't rely on maybe the government, maybe mainstream media to support what you're doing. And so you should assume that you want to go with an approach that doesn't require a lot of money or people, that doesn't require that institutional backing and those relationships.\n\n(00:18:40):\nThat means building your own distribution, which you can do starting from day one. You can start doing that before you even have the company. It means taking your story and winning hearts and minds. Number one, by making it a story that you shape to fit people's cultural erogenous zones of your audience. And number two, by finding the centers of gravity in society, like the influencers that are going to help spread it for you. Because you're not going to on day one call up the New York Times and get them to print the story that you want them to. So you need to figure out who are the influencers and the way to do that, I'll cut off the rabbit hole after this because you can just go deeper and deeper, but the way to do that is in concentric circles. There's a general who said if there's a problem I look for it in concentric circles going back to my own desk.\n\n(00:19:33):\nIf you want to spread something you go out in concentric circles starting from your own desk. So you need to get first really clear with yourself about what your message is and just get really crisp with it. This is hard to do because you know too much, so out of the 1,000 facts in your head you're going to have to pick just between one and three. And then the next circle is going to be your co-founders, your executives, your employees, your investors, you go to your power users, and you go out from there, and it has to be in that sequence.\n\n(00:20:06):\nBut once you get the sequence and you identify who the people are and you know who your audience is, and then you're able to hone in on what their cultural erogenous zones are, then you're able to craft the message, have the delivery mechanisms, and then know your target, and then you're off. But you just need to do that exercise upfront, so you don't have a lot of wasted motion.\n\nLenny (00:20:25):\nI really like this concentric circle framework. I haven't heard this before. Just to make it a little more real is there something that you can share, something that comes to mind that illustrates that?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:20:36):\nWell, you and I have talked a lot about Substack, so I'm speaking out of term now that I don't have the employee badge. But something that I thought the Substack founders have always done so well is propagate product updates out in concentric circles. So there's a lot of things where you're going to know about it. You, Lenny will know about it more than a new writer who just joined, because you're a power user of the product and they would want you... Now they would want to make sure that you love the thing, and that you feel maybe even a little bit invested in the thing. You've been telling people about recommendations for nearly a year. No one asked you to do that. We didn't pay you to do that. You've done it because you were brought on board early and it was something that the company made sure that you liked, and then you became the next circle out that spread it to your next circle out.\n\nLenny (00:21:33):\nIt's interesting because I didn't think of it as an intentional strategy to get news out, and it feels like there's a synergy with just talking to your power users. Getting feedback from your power users leads to this interesting second order effect where they also want to... they feel like they're on the inside of something, they want to share it and maybe talk about it and tell friends about, \"Hey, Substack's working this cool thing.\" So that's kind of a cool-\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:21:53):\nWell, early on Lenny you asked about how do you get a message to spread? And I said you give people incentives who want to spread it. So your incentive was you helping others, you like paying it forward and helping other writers and podcasters, and you genuinely enjoy the thing. And I think there's some value to your own project that you get to show social proof that a lot of people like this thing and it's growing, and that's what you got. If it had been like, \"Hey, Lenny, can you do us a favor and tweet this thing?\" You might've done it, but you would've done it once and stopped and it wouldn't have been something that you organically keep doing.\n\nLenny (00:22:30):\nTo make this even more real I'm trying to help people understand this concentric circle idea, so first Substack is an example. What would be the few layers of the concentric circle on the middle would be maybe the power writers. What would be the next couple layers?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:22:46):\nIt's the employees at the middle, almost always, and then it is depending on the company. So here it would be the power writers, it's youth, a lot of the original writers. Bill Bishop comes up a lot, he was Substacker number one, he's always really meaningful. And then it's fast growing writers. It is writer influencers. There are certain members of the media that cover media and writing, and so they matter a lot. And then investors are in there just to keep close to the fold.\n\n(00:23:18):\nBut if you're a different kind of company that might be employees board, institutional investors, government and regulators then users, just depending on how much power each group has to influence your future. And the reason I say go out in concentric circles as opposed to just hit each of these groups kind of haphazardly is that's your way to control the message. Because each circle is going to assume that the inner circle knows better than them and they're going to follow the lead of the inner circle. So an example is if you and I have a company, Lenny and Lulu, this is a DTC startup.\n\nLenny (00:24:01):\nThat's a great name.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:02):\nIt is, we should do it.\n\nLenny (00:24:03):\nWe should do this.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:04):\nIf we had a company and we were trying to put out a message to the world that our new thing works, it's really revolutionary, our genes are the best genes. If employees are not saying that, then people are going to look at employees and say, \"Well, they would know, they're closer to this than we are. So if they're not excited then why would we be excited?\" And so that undermines everything that we're trying to do, you can't skip a circle is my point.\n\nLenny (00:24:32):\nSuper interesting. And I imagine the closer they are to the employees the more time you spend with them, and the more innately they're closer and also their perspective and what they share is more powerful because they're closer to what's happening.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:48):\nAnd if it goes wrong the more damage they can do. So on the spectrum it's if they are not totally on board and they're not an effective messenger, versus they're just lukewarm and they're not really sure they believe it. All the way to they actively fell off the bandwagon and you lost them, and now they're out there proactively contradicting everything you say or even trying to destroy the company, that can happen. If an early employee, for example, feels disgruntled, which is easy to do and it's easy to do through a comms mistake. If you sell them on one thing and here's a vision, and now either that's changed or you miscommunicated. If they feel like there's a bait and switch they're going to be really mad. And now you've created someone who is incredibly credible and has the same social and professional circle as you and is trying to ruin you.\n\nLenny (00:25:44):\nThat's such a good point. For someone that's trying to do this maybe internally they're like, \"Oh, cool, we got to create these circles for our startup.\" What do you recommend they do? Do they make a list of here's our inner circle, here's the next circle of people.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:25:56):\nYeah, you take out your one-page Google Doc. I feel like most comms problems can be solved with one-page Google Doc. So you go to your one-page Google Doc and you take your audiences, you list them, probably stop at five or six because past that it's like way, way first world problem. You'll have more than enough work to win over the five or six inner circles, and then you have to rank them. And you rank them by how much they're able to influence your success and how much credibility other groups assign them. So then you have your inner to outer circles.\n\n(00:26:32):\nAnd then for each of them you would think about what do they care about that's their cultural erogenous zones and where do they reside intellectually? So do they listen to podcasts, if so, which ones. Do they go to in-person conferences? Are they getting all of their news from Reddit? If so, which subreddits are they on Hacker News? Once you map that out, then again you have the people you're trying to reach, the ideas and messages that resonate the most with them, and then the ways to actually reach them.\n\nLenny (00:27:04):\nThis is becoming a real template we can start using. In the bucket of erogenous zones what are some examples of erogenous zones for people in this context?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:27:15):\nWe've talked about the free expression stand from last year. A lot of people care about first amendment, protecting press freedoms and free expression. Not a lot of people care that a journalist said something mean about Substack. And so there were a few times when we did have to push back publicly against a journalist saying something mean and unfair or untrue about Substack. So obviously my and our ulterior motive is to vindicate the company and show people that this isn't true. But if we had just done that, nobody would've cared or maybe a few diehards would've cared. There are people who care deeply about Substack, but not as many people and not as deeply as the people who care about their ability to express themselves freely or their right to build their own media platform without too many controls.\n\nLenny (00:28:20):\nThe way you described it earlier came back to me as you were talking, which is this idea that lights people up. What lights people up within this list of people that you're making? So that's really interesting. So the idea is create this list of people across circles further and further away from your employees. Think about what lights them up, what are their erogenous zones intellectually, and then think about where they spend their time intellectually, what are they listening to? What are they reading?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:28:44):\nYeah, that's it.\n\nLenny (00:28:46):\nAmazing, this is super cool.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:28:47):\nIt's not easy, it's hard, you have to make very difficult tactical decisions every day when you're doing that, but it is simple.\n\nLenny (00:28:54):\nYeah, it seems pretty easy. Okay, this is great. Another framework that we haven't talked about yet, do you have this math formula for how ideas spread? Does that ring a bell?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:29:04):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:29:05):\nOkay, let's get into that.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:29:06):\nI think it's useful to try to bring as much discipline as possible to comms, because you're really just measuring vibes. In a world of OKRs and data and metrics it's hard to know if you're doing the right thing with comms. And so I think whenever you're able to establish a framework its useful, so this one is kind of a mathematical formula of comms for a purpose. It assumes that you have a business goal and as a business goal, not communications goal, it's not get this many impressions or go viral or blah. It is we're going to grow our revenue by X, or we're going to make this penetration into this user base. When you have your business goal you're going to need certain people to do certain things for that goal to come true. So for example, you're going to need this type of person in this quantity to buy these sneakers in order for you to meet your revenue goal.\n\n(00:30:07):\nSo now you know who the people are and the action they need to take. The next step is what do they need to believe in order to take that action? So they need to believe that their feet are not comfortable now, and that it's possible for their feet to be more comfortable and that'll have a positive effect on their life, and that this new sneaker technology is real, so they need to believe these things. Then it's where do they reside intellectually? How do you deliver that message to them, and that's the who do they listen to? Which accounts do they follow? Which podcast do they... what trips do they take? What newspapers, et cetera. And when you have that then you have the equation of we need to deliver this message to these people through these mediums in order to get them to do this thing with this call to action. And that way you know that you're at least pushing forward and getting something done with your comms as opposed to just saying words into the ether.\n\nLenny (00:31:11):\nI think you had something like there's pressure and force and area, is that part of this or is that a different framework?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:17):\nDifferent framework.\n\nLenny (00:31:18):\nOh, okay, cool.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:20):\nOh yeah.\n\nLenny (00:31:21):\nOkay, okay, let's talk about this other framework too.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:24):\nI've got more frameworks, Lenny.\n\nLenny (00:31:25):\nI love it, this is what this podcast is all about. Let's do it.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:29):\nThis is a useful one for early stage startups especially, or anybody who's just trying to be lean and efficient, which is anyone who's an underdog like we talked about earlier, that if you decrease the surface area than with the same amount of force you can apply more pressure. So the amount of pressure is the force divided by the surface area, this is a basic equation for physics, but it's also true of communications, which is if you decrease the surface area and don't try to appeal to everybody with everything. And you're targeting exactly whom you're talking to and you are sharpening your message to a point, to get them in the bullseye of the cultural erogenous zone. Then you're able to with the same amount of effort or expense or time, you're able to make more of an impact, you're able to apply more pressure.\n\n(00:32:30):\nSo I think of it as there's a continuum between you can either hyper-target, so the extreme of the continuum is you are becoming the life partner of one person. That's the ultra hyper targeting. And then the other end of the spectrum is you're appealing to everybody. You're appealing to a larger number of people, but with a weaker message, in a weaker way. So you could say world peace is good, nobody disagrees with that practically, but also it doesn't stick and it's not meaningful to them. So you have to choose where you're going to be along that continuum. And for most startups I would choose towards the fewer people end of it, where you choose who's going to be your diehards and then you foster them and create really deep meaningful relationships with them. And the way to do that is to decrease the surface area and apply more pressure.\n\nLenny (00:33:23):\nIt feels like you did that with Substack where it was focused on people writing online, or I guess tell me is that how you thought about it Substack of here's our little focused area and we'll focus target message to that.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:33:37):\nThat was the goal and that's actually why I started spending time on Twitter. It was a very self-loathing exercise like Hamish doesn't like the Twitter model, nor do, we would talk about this a lot and I always felt a little bit fringe being on there. And before I worked at Substack I had a sleepy account of a couple hundred followers that didn't do very much. And I realized that the people that we were trying to speak to are heavy Twitter users, whether it's media people or online writers. And so I decided I'm going to spend some time and try to build an audience and then that audience became leverage, for better or worse. I don't think we should measure people by their Twitter following, but the fact is that if you have more then journalists and writers take you a bit more seriously. And so if I was going to try to carry a message on behalf of the company, I felt like it would be more effective if I had more people.\n\nLenny (00:34:38):\nAnd it worked. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company is taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.\n\n(00:35:18):\nBeginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups, it's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Basically, to increase the effectiveness of your message you can either increase the force and what is in this context force? Is it like the amount of messaging or is it the success of your message?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:36:11):\nIt's the amount of effort you put into it. So it's how much you are spending on this campaign or you have a limited amount of hours in the day and dollars in the bank. And so anytime you're doing something with comms, you're either paying the dollars or you're paying the time. Sometimes you're drawing down on credibility too, you have a certain amount of credibility and there are times when you just have to say, \"Please trust me.\" You can spend that more efficiently if you focus. So instead of if you just take a simple ad campaign, instead of spending a million dollars to reach a million people, maybe you spend a $100 to reach the hundred most important people. And focus that message exactly to them so that when they see your ad they're actually going to click on it and they're actually going to forward it, and that's a much better return. And then you might end up with a million dollars worth of return, because those people were so passionate that they then became their own messengers without you even having to be involved anymore.\n\nLenny (00:37:12):\nThis is a really great framework, again, is your advice that for the smaller you are just basically reduce the area?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:37:21):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:37:22):\nAnd the larger you are increase that over time?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:37:24):\nYes. If you're just starting out, get 10 diehards and just spend all your time... You can't start out and try to win over the general public. You start out by creating a tiny, not the best analogy is one I can think of right now, a tiny monopoly. And it's the same like succeeding on Substack or creating anything on the internet. You choose what is going to be your tiny corner of the internet that you are going to just dominate entirely. And the smaller it is, the more you can dominate it and then these people that are in it become your true believers, your diehards, and they'll expand it out to the next circle and then you go from there. But if you try to win over everybody at the same time, it's a food coloring in the ocean kind of thing as opposed to food coloring in a cup.\n\nLenny (00:38:17):\nIs there an example that comes to mind of someone that did this really well? I don't know. I know it's hard to think of just an example off the top of your head, but does anything come to mind?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:38:25):\nBalaji did this really well with his book The Network State, that book was super successful. He didn't do a lot of the traditional book tour New York Times stuff. He went his own route, and I think that was really smart if you're going to put it in the setting of this framework, it's he created his own distribution channels. He didn't try to compete with the roster of Harper Collins on their turf, and when he created his own distribution channels he focuses on who are the diehards and the truth fans, and these are people that he fosters. He goes on podcasts that reach these people. He doesn't deviate from messaging to try to appeal to everybody. There are people who just will never like that guy and he is totally fine with it. So he's not watering down who he is to appeal to people who will never like him, which it's tempting for companies to do.\n\n(00:39:17):\nYou hate when people are mad at you, so you try to appeal to them and then your true fans lose their passion because the thing that made you so special has now gone milk toast. So Balaji fosters his true fans and then when the book launched they propelled him to the top of the Amazon list, because they were out there evangelizing, proselytizing. You probably saw all these tweets about his book. He didn't pay anybody as far as I know. He didn't pay anybody to do that. He just shared it with the people and they wanted to show that they were into this.\n\nLenny (00:39:46):\nThat's a great example. I know that founders often worry focusing too narrowly limits their market, and it's never going to grow into anything large. In your experience do you find that that's just often not true, that there's often a much bigger opportunity than they think? Or is that just a good way to start and then you expand from there?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:40:03):\nIt's both. If you're writing online or doing something online, the denominator is the size of the internet. You don't need to capture 80% of it. If you capture 0.01% of it, that is a great business and then you can go from there. Once you've won that then you can decide to go from there and the world is a big place. So now that everything's digital the denominator's so large that I wouldn't worry too much about the numerator. But it is also true that if you start off trying to peel to too many people, you have to water down your stuff so much that you'll never stand out. And you've written about this Lenny with how to be viral, how to be noticed, and one of the things is be remarkable. And you can't be remarkable if you're trying to appeal to so many people that you have to become the average of 500,000 people's tastes.\n\nLenny (00:40:57):\nThis is a good way to think about I think when something's not working, when you're trying to get a bunch of attention for your product and no one cares. Feels like this is one reason is just you're going too wide.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:41:09):\nYeah, I think that's probably the most common reason.\n\nLenny (00:41:14):\nMaybe just thinking about diagnosing why your comms may not be working. This may be too big of a question, but just what other explanations could there be for why no one cares about what you're trying to put out?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:41:25):\nYou're doing it as a corporation instead of a person. This is another super common mistake is you're letting yourself speak like a faceless corporation because it feels like that's what you should do now. Okay, now you're a real company and now you got to do real company stuff, that means you have to issue decrees on behalf of the C corp and you don't. And it doesn't work because people don't trust institutions. People don't like corporations or at least are not passionate about them. People care about people and trust and like people, and so there's a sense of wanting to cosplay an executive and it doesn't work, it doesn't resonate. A good example of this would be Ryan Peterson at Flexport. His company, even after it got huge, he never became the generic corporate chief. He always was a person. And there are people, many, many people who became interested in Flexport because Ryan's an interesting guy. And it's not like they had a passion for logistics and freight and shipping, but he's doing something interesting. And then he became the human gateway drug for people to become interested in his company.\n\nLenny (00:42:40):\nYeah, absolutely. He had that crazy viral tweet about the ports and that's a really good example. Man, I was going to go in a different direction, but maybe we go to this idea of going direct. You're a big fan and Balaji is a really big fan of this too, speaking of just the importance of going direct. So maybe just talk about what does that mean and why is that important these days?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:42:58):\nWell, Balaji is more go direct than me. He thinks that I'm soft in this area because I think that there's still a place for engaging with media and that it's just another tool. He's for just straight-up go direct undistilled. But I think that for everybody a 100% of the time you want going direct to be a part of what you're doing, whether it's all you're doing, or whether you're doing something else, you can't not have a direct channel. So what that actually looks like, and people say this all the time go direct. What does that actually look like to go direct? It means that the founder or executive for some very senior person has to be speaking from themselves. First person, may be first person plural, and speaking in a human voice authentically. You see them make mistakes, you see them be vulnerable, and they have to become an ambassador to the community.\n\n(00:43:55):\nIf you don't have that, then you don't have a direct channel even if you have a Twitter or a Substack or whatever, it's not direct if not connected to a person because if the other side of it is a corporation there's no direct connection. And then the second thing is start building your own audience as soon as possible. You can do this alongside engaging with the media or doing traditional things. To the point of focusing your energy and decreasing the surface area, for startups I would not recommend trying to do an Instagram, a Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and TikTok. I would choose the thing that that person is the best at. So if your spokesman is going to be your CEO, which is a good default, they're going to have a dominant communication style where they're the best at being themselves. And that's important because if somebody else is ghost-writing all their stuff, it shows.\n\n(00:44:53):\nSo some CEOs are better at writing long form. Some CEOs are better at doing videos. Some do better with audio or podcasts, some are better with short form. The way that Elon Musk communicates on Twitter, he's born to do Twitter. You can't picture him writing long thoughtful blog posts, it's not a thing that he does. Whereas Brian Armstrong or Hamish or Chris, they write great blog posts that are sincere and effective, and that's better than them just trying to do it only through tweets. So pick the thing that your spokesperson is the best at and then invest everything into that channel, and then build it up to a decent amount and then expand outward. Because if you try to build six or seven channels at once you're just not going to get anywhere.\n\nLenny (00:45:47):\nI think that's such a important point. I feel like me choosing a newsletter was actually a really good choice. As much as you may not believe this I'm not a performer person, I just want to hide behind the computer and just type stuff. And the newsletters, especially during COIVD, I was like, \"I just sit at home and share stuff and edit and think about it where it's like, 'Hello everyone.'\" And it took me a while to get to this point of like, \"Oh, I can maybe do a podcast because I've built up a little more confidence that this is useful.\" So I so agree with that and that's what I tell a lot of people. Just pick the platform that is most natural to you. Maybe you like talking, maybe you performing on video, maybe you just want to sit and type.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:46:24):\nAnd that's a good point too, Lenny, because it changes over time. Just because you pick one thing doesn't mean that you're stuck with only that forever. Over time you might choose different things and I've seen founders become a lot more comfortable in front of the camera, for example, once they've done a few reps. And the other reason to know that you can just change it over time is otherwise it feels like a deterrent to getting started. Sometimes there's paralysis if I don't know which thing to choose, and so I'm either going to do a bunch of them or none of them. Go with your gut pick one and you're not wed to that forever, you can always change it down the road.\n\nLenny (00:46:58):\nDo you think every founder needs to be on Twitter? I get this a lot from founders. Do I need to be on Twitter? I hate Twitter. What's your take?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:47:04):\nNo, I think a lot of founders do. If they are super mission driven, for example, that's one way that you're going to find other people that resonate with your mission and that you're going to make the case for the mission. If you're mission driven there's also a good chance that you're doing something that some people love and some people hate. And so you're going to need to be out there fighting the fight in a way. I don't mean in a pugilistic antagonistic way, but you have to defend your thing. And so I think it's important if you're mission driven. I also think it's important if your charisma is a big part of recruiting for the company. There are some companies where the founder's charisma is a big part of why people want to go work there. So Palmer Lucky and Anduril, he is magnetic to a lot of engineers and they want to go work with that guy, specifically. Whereas there are companies where people want to go work for the company and it's less important that the founder is vocal.\n\nLenny (00:48:02):\nWhat's interesting I found recently is I get more traffic to my newsletter from LinkedIn than Twitter. Is that something you think about at all? Going to LinkedIn instead of Twitter feels so wrong to say, but what's your take there?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:48:14):\nYes, if you are career related, LinkedIn will be a lot better. One, it's better because it's not such a cesspool where anything immediately becomes controversial and people fight over it in their mentions. Two, because LinkedIn is really underutilized and founders should know this, PMs should know this. LinkedIn is super underutilized because it gets a ton of eyeballs in time, but most of the content sucks. 95% of the content this is not scientific-\n\nLenny (00:48:49):\nSeems right, seems right.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:48:50):\nThis is my might estimate. 95% of the content is people congratulating each other on work anniversaries or people saying, \"I'm so proud of my team for this thing they did.\" And then people react out of a sense of friendship and affection or support, but actually genuinely interesting and useful content on LinkedIn is very rare. So the ratio of your competitive set of interesting content versus how much time and attention people spend on there is excellent.\n\nLenny (00:49:24):\nThat is really good advice. I'm going to throw a fishing line into the pool of examples. You talked about people doing this well, going direct. Balaji talking about Ryan Peterson and Elon obviously. Is there anyone else that's just like here check out what they're doing and could be a good model to learn from?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:49:41):\nI think it's really interesting to see what Mike Solana is doing with Pirate Wires. Here's an example of why it clearly makes sense to have the founder be very active on Twitter because he is his own recruiter and spokesperson. So I think the makeup industry actually is at the forefront of this. The makeup industry is smarter than all of us in how they use social media and influencers, because they caught on very early on that people don't buy makeup to subscribe to makeup brands, that they do it because a certain celebrity or influencer or Kardashian has this nice looking eyelid and they want their eyelid to look that way.\n\n(00:50:25):\nAnd so going back years before the rest of us were talking about going direct, there are makeup companies that would spend $0 on marketing, and minimal efforts on press and pour all of it decreasing the surface area. Pour all of it into fostering a small roster of influencers and having them spread the message. And so I think watch makeup companies, watch consumer companies, they're doing it right, they speak with a human voice, they speak through human beings and they're fast. If there's a trend the same day they will have hopped on the trend... within an hour they're on the trend, as opposed to other industries or more traditional companies that take a few days and they route through approvals and then the opportunity's gone.\n\nLenny (00:51:11):\nWhat are some makeup companies for people to check out to see what they're doing?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:51:14):\nSo NYX, N-Y-X, it's a division of L'Oreal. NYX is wanted the makeup companies that has, as far as I know $0 spent on marketing and all of their dollars and all of their effort spent on paying influencers. And they really out punched their weight in terms of using humans to deliver a message that contains a call to action and then selling out product. And the product will be like a normal black eyeliner. It's the most fungible thing you could possibly imagine, and that one eyeliner will be sold out at CBS's across the country for a couple weeks, because they did something right with their social media using a person.\n\nLenny (00:51:57):\nJust a couple more questions around this going direct concept. I don't know if you actually talked about why that's important because I think we talk about this a lot, and I think people may not recognize why people find this so important these days. What's the motivation behind that with Balaji and other founders?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:52:14):\nThere's two reasons it's important, there's the offense and the defense of it. The defense of it is going back to having the underdog, the insurgency mentality. If you're trying to do something different that goes against the grain, people are going to attack you. Not everyone's going to like it. And the point is that not everyone should like it, but you need a way to stand up for yourself because you don't have the big institutions and power structures that are going to do that work for you because you're going against the grain. So if you're going to stand up for yourself there's only one way to do it, which is you do it. And so building the audience and the channels and you have to prime the market. By which I mean if you're a public company, you're priming the market by getting them used to how you convey information to them.\n\n(00:52:58):\nIf you're a small startup or a founder, you're priming the market by making your audience aware of how you normally communicate, so that when you do something it's not weird. If you never post and then suddenly you start posting, people are going to think you're having a crisis or something like what is going on? They're going to try to read into it. So you have to already have the cadence and the relationships set up so that when you need to draw on them if you're under attack then you can, that's the defense of it. The offense of it is if you're doing something new and if you're mission driven, and if what you're doing is truly unique and innovative, no one else will be to tell that as well as you. The most friendly, sympathetic reporter on Earth could not tell that as well as you because they don't understand it as well as you, and so the onus just falls on you to do it.\n\nLenny (00:53:52):\nIf someone listening is like, \"Yep, okay, I fully agree, time to do this.\" What do you suggest as a next step to starting to build an audience and going direct broadly.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:54:03):\nStep one would be assessing what are you good at and what do you enjoy? So that's where you decide, do I like long form writing, or do I enjoy podcasting, or what are my mediums? Step two is setting up your account on those channels. So if you enjoy long form writing then you're going to have to choose, do you do a Substack, do you do Medium or whatever else? There's a objectively right answer on that one. But if you are doing short videos you're going to choose are you going to invest in Instagram, or you're going to invest in TikTok, you set that up. And then you start building your audience. And when you start if you're actually starting from zero, get some pipeline of talent ready. Sorry, not pipeline or talent, pipeline of content. Get it ready, it's the same way as if you're launching a Substack.\n\n(00:54:54):\nIf you're launching a Substack you want to get a week or two of posts ready to go, so that out the gate you can build a lot of momentum. With different social networks it actually helps the algorithm if you come out the gate strong and are really regular. So TikTok, for example, if you're starting at TikTok with zero followers, you want to get a week or two of solid data just in the pipeline so you can hit it, hit it because the algorithm favors you right as you're starting out because they want you to keep going, so you want to ride that as much as possible. So that's step two is just get yourself ready for launch. Don't do one post and wait, get a bunch of posts ready and then boom, boom, boom. And then three is to have an ongoing content strategy, you know who you're going to reach, you know what they care about.\n\n(00:55:42):\nSo you have to plan out, \"Here's the cadence with which I'm going to talk to them. Here's how I'm going to do community management and respond to people, and here are the ways where I'm going to do announcements.\" And you get into a cadence because it's the same as growing a newsletter. The regularity and the consistency is a big part of growing. And so it's the same with audience. A mistake that people make I think is just every once in a while trying to go viral as opposed to just being consistent. And then some posts do better than others organically, but that's the way to do it. I don't live that. I'm not a good example because I'm so self-loathing about being on Twitter I will go away for one or two weeks and do nothing, and then I'll come in with a bunch of posts in one day. It's not a best practice. It's not the way you're supposed to do it. Ideally, you're just there every day saying something and then it builds over time.\n\nLenny (00:56:36):\nI'm actually an example of trying to focus on consistent non-viral content and it's worked out.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:56:44):\nIt has worked out.\n\nLenny (00:56:46):\nIt's worked out. It's worked out so far, but it's interesting to see how different people act and how it's like I'm trying to go viral every tweet, every post and that is hard. And it's also just like people can tell you're just trying to create some viral thing and no one cares.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:57:00):\nAnd it's very obvious when you're just trying to go viral for the sake of it and you don't have a real message. It's like the post when people screenshot the iPhone six digit security code and they say best feature apple's ever built. A few people did that, and now I've seen it probably dozens of times. And it doesn't even help to get you followers because that's not something where people say, \"Only this person could uniquely give me this kind of content in the future.\" If you're going to get followers with a one-off joke, it has to be an incredibly hilarious one-off joke where they say, \"This person is going to keep entertaining me.\" But with these kind of viral baits, I don't think it's even that effective.\n\nLenny (00:57:41):\nAnd also what I find if something does go viral, whatever the correct term is and then life goes on, nothing's going to significantly... that's just one thing, and then you have to do it again and again. That's where people don't realize like, \"Oh, I went viral. I'm done. My life is good now.\" Nothing's going to really change most often, and you have to do it again and again.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:58:03):\nI think that's true. One thing that I've noticed about your audience, Lenny, is that it's the right audience. It's the people who find value in what you do, and they're in the right place and there's a match. Sometimes in the effort to just gain followers for the sake of it or a go viral for the sake of it, you end up with a mismatch of the audience. You had this viral hamster tweet, and now they're all here expecting hamster content, and they're not engaging with you, you're not bringing value to them. It's just making the number go up, which is not that meaningful. So one example of this is there's all these threads about how to just grow on Twitter for no reason, just grow for the sake of growing.\n\n(00:58:48):\nAnd it's a lot of generic advice of make sure that you bullet point out the 10 things. But it's always pablum of make sure that you value your relationships, and make time for yourself. And things that are not enriching people's lives they get a lot of likes that are low value likes from random people about the internet. But I don't think that they're deepening a relationship with a meaningful audience, and I don't think that they're really capturing the respect and admiration of their peers. So I think it's just important to consider what trade-offs people make in their efforts to grow.\n\nLenny (00:59:28):\nWell, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:59:35):\nReady.\n\nLenny (00:59:35):\nFirst question. Great. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (00:59:41):\nI recommend Gates of Fire, it comes off the Marine Commandants Reading List, it's on there perennially. It is about the Battle of Thermopylae, it's the 300 Spartans, but it's the whole backstory. And if you get into it's about leadership, it's about courage, it's about creativity, and it's really well-written, so that's one that I recommend a lot.\n\nLenny (01:00:00):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:03):\nI've been watching The Last Of Us, like everybody on Earth. I've been watching it both for entertainment and for work, because it's really interesting to see how the show drives sales of the video games, and how you can use that to make the whole of the sales greater than the sum of its parts. So I'm watching that really carefully.\n\nLenny (01:00:24):\nInteresting. We have a drinking game now. Every time someone says Last of us that's a new thing because it's starting to come up a lot, so everyone enjoy your drink. Favorite interview question you like to ask?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:36):\nI like to ask people what they've been reading too. It's a good way to get good book recommendations. It's also a good way to see where their head's at when they're not working.\n\nLenny (01:00:45):\nFavorite SaaS products that you use day-to-day and bonus points for something that is new or interesting that you've recently discovered?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:52):\nI don't know that this is new or novel because I use Notion for almost everything, and I really like the new AI that they've built into it. I also have been using Lex, which is Nathan Baschez startup, where it's like the AI writing editor that you've probably seen. I'm trying to think if there's anything that I use that other people don't. I don't think I'm terribly original in that sense. I use a lot of Microsoft Excel, which I think is controversial.\n\nLenny (01:01:21):\nThat is, wow, that's cool, but I get it. That's when you know you're doing serious work, you got to accelerate.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (01:01:27):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (01:01:28):\nFinal question, best tip for someone trying to get attention for their product, take away tip, best takeaway tip.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (01:01:37):\nGive it away for free to the right people. If you can choose the people who are going to love it, look at the Venn diagram of people who are going to be obsessed with this product. And people who have a large following among the other people that you want to get to, whoever falls into that sliver of the Venn diagram shower them with free product.\n\nLenny (01:01:58):\nAmazing. Lulu, I think this conversation is going to lead to a lot more people going direct, taking risks and ideas spreading. Thank you for being here. Two final questions where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:13):\nPeople can find me at getflack.com, that's where I write down my ideas, hopefully more frequently in the future than in the past. But that's where they can find some of this stuff if they're interested. How can listeners be helpful to me is to give me feedback. I'm learning on the job. I don't think that there's anyone alive who's an expert in communicating in this crazy environment that we have now. I think we're all crossing the river by feeling the stones, and so your listeners have gone through this in many different ways. And I hope that if they have new ideas of feedback or objections, that they'll email me through that website or on Twitter and let me know what they think.\n\nLenny (01:02:54):\nAmazing and its get flack.com.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:55):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:02:55):\nWe'll link to it in the show notes.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:55):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:02:57):\nLulu, thank you for being here and sharing your wisdom with us.\n\nLulu Cheng Meservey (01:03:00):\nThank you, Lenny, appreciate it.\n\nLenny (01:03:03):\nThank you so much for listening.

It is not a choice. You need to get better at both.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:07):\nIt feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days. How is AI pricing different?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:00:11):\nThe winners in AI will need to master monetization from day one. If you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you start at training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, you're in trouble. 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that that 20% is the easiest thing to build often.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):\nWhat would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:00:33):\nIf you think about market share and wallet share, let's think about it as a two-by-two. The quadrant that you really want to be in is the outcome-based pricing model, the top-right quadrant where you have great autonomy and great attribution. About 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model. If you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):\nDo you feel like the popular IDE startups, they're going to be in trouble down the road?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:00:58):\nSome of them, yes, without naming names.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):\nToday my guest is Madhavan Ramanujam. Madhavan is the smartest person I know on pricing and monetization strategy. As managing partner at Simon-Kucher, he's worked with over 250 companies, including 30 unicorns, to help them figure out how to price, package, and grow their products.\n\n(00:01:18):\nHe's also the author of the book on pricing called Monetizing Innovation. And now he's back with a new book, a sequel, called Scaling Innovation, which teaches you how to architect your business for long-term profitable growth and also how to avoid the common traps that teams fall into that keep them from building real, durable, sustainable businesses.\n\n(00:01:36):\nBill Gurley wrote the foreword. I had a chance to read an early copy. I absolutely loved it. It's a book that every founder needs to read. And in this episode, Madhavan shares many of the biggest lessons from the book, including how pricing strategy is very different for AI companies, why you need to get your pricing model right from the start in today's market, a very simple two-by-two to help you pick your pricing model, how to gain pricing power, a ton of tactical advice for negotiating more effectively, the most common traps founders fall into, and so much more.\n\n(00:02:05):\nIf you order five copies of the book, Madhavan is offering a chance to win a free conversation with him, a signed copy of the book, an invite to the book launch, a t-shirt, and more. Just send a copy of your purchase receipt to promo@49palmsvc.com.\n\n(00:02:19):\nAnd some more good news, Madhavan is now more accessible. He left Simon-Kucher. He's now investing full-time with his own fund. He focuses on early-stage AI companies.

Thanks so much for hosting me again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):\nThis is a very rare second visit to the podcast. You've got a new book coming out. I've got a very early copy right here. If you're watching on YouTube, here's the copy you sent me. It's like 200 pages. Did you print this out on your printer, by the way?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:04:54):\nYes, I think I ran out of printer ink after that, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):\nI appreciate the early copy. It's amazing. What we're going to be doing with this conversation is going through some of the biggest lessons that you shared in this book to give people a sense of many of the things that you share, many things you've learned since writing the first book.\n\n(00:05:11):\nLet me start with this question. Why'd you decide to write another book? And what is the difference between Scaling Innovation, which is the name of this book, and Monetizing Innovation, is the name of the first book?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:05:21):\nSo Monetizing Innovation, we actually wrote it eight years ago. Time Flies. And the core thesis of that book was, how do you build products that are not just cool but are products that people need, value, and are actually willing to pay for? And I think that took a life of its own.\n\n(00:05:36):\nAnd over the years, we kept getting another question from entrepreneurs that, \"Hey, we built a great product, we know there is willingness to pay, but how do we build a great business? How do we scale this?\" And the brutal truth is that even if you have a great product, you might actually not figure out a way to grow fast and grow profitably. So we wrote Scaling Innovation in an effort to actually solve that puzzle.\n\n(00:05:55):\nSo you can think of this as a sequel to Monetizing Innovation. And Monetizing Innovation. Talked about how to build great products. Scaling Innovation talks about how to build a great business. And writing a book is... There needs to be a purpose for this. For me, the reason for writing books is about giving a bit back based on what I know to founders. And book writing is hard. Writing a good book is even harder.\n\n(00:06:19):\nAnd just like Monetizing Innovation, Scaling Innovation is not marketing fluff. It actually has real actionable stuff packed in that you can go on Monday morning and start implementing. And we wrote this book to give back a bit of what we know and to help companies scale and architect towards profitable growth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):\nI love people like you that do the work for, I don't know, decades at this point, learn from real life experiences over and over and over, and then just share all this stuff with people. This is the most... the highest ROI way to learn, is letting you do all this work to learn all these things and then you share all your answers with us. So that's why I love these books.\n\n(00:07:00):\nIf you had to boil down the thesis of this book into just a simple thought so that we can just start to plant this in founders's heads, what would that be?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:07:08):\nSo if I have to boil down the core thesis of the book, it is basically that if you want to build an enduring business, you need to be able to architect towards profitable growth. What that means is you need to be able to master two engines: market share and wallet share.\n\n(00:07:26):\nIt sounds simple on the surface, but it's actually quite complex. Because if you unpack that, for gaining market share and wallet share, you need to be good at acquisition, monetization, and retention, as in get customers, make an initial money on them, but also make money on an ongoing basis and have your customers actually refer more customers.\n\n(00:07:46):\nMany companies, actually, what they do is they focus on a single engine strategy. So they focus on one of those two topics and pretty much exclude the other one. That leads to all kinds of situations. You see companies saying, \"I'll grow at all costs and postpone monetization.\" You see some who would say, \"I'm going to monetize earlier on,\" but they might miss out on acquisition opportunities. Or yet others who are so focused on a small set of loyal customer base that they're neither monetizing nor are they actually acquiring.\n\n(00:08:17):\nSo the good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both. But this does not mean that you're putting equal effort on market share and wallet share at all given points in time, but it means you're putting equal attention on both those topics and being thoughtful about the trade-offs and saying, \"How can I actually look at these two topics together so that I'm architecting towards profitable growth?\" That's the core thesis of the book.\n\n(00:08:47):\nWe actually showcase nine strategies that actually allow companies to architect towards profitable growth. And every chapter ends with how this particular strategy circumvents a single-engine problem and helps you focus on market share and wallet share at the same time. And there's also CEO questions and leadership questions that people should reflect on when they architect towards profitable growth and are they on the right track? I mean, think about this ways. If you're flying a aircraft, you don't want to flight on one engine. Why do you actually want to do that for your business?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:21):\nOkay. So I imagine many founders or people thinking about starting a company are not feeling like they're in one bucket or another. Intuitively, you're not like, \"Oh, Of course. We're going to just focus on growth forever, and that's all that matters.\"\n\n(00:09:36):\nYou had these kind of traps that founders fall into that you referenced a bit. Can you just talk again about just the common traps you find founders fall into that people may recognize like, \"Shit, that's what I'm doing probably\"?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:09:47):\nSo let's unpack the traps that are correlated to the archetypes. If you're a disruptor archetype, you might fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might land, but you might not expand. As in your eagerness for acquiring, you might have actually given away a lot at less and you have given the farm away, but you don't have anything to expand to. That's the first trap you're likely to fall into.\n\n(00:10:12):\nThe second trap that you actually fall into is you start... A market share that won, is different from a market share that is actually held. If you're so acquisition focused, you're actually focused on getting more and more customers, but you're not spending enough time with customers that you actually got to keep them, upsell them, keep them happy, et cetera. So you might fall into that trap.\n\n(00:10:34):\nIf you're a moneymaker, you fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might nickel and dime your customers to death. Because you're focused on monetization, you might come up with a very differentiated pricing model, different levels, hidden fees, things to charge for many different things and come across as just trying to nickel and dime your customer.\n\n(00:10:53):\nThe second trap that a moneymaker actually falls into is that you fall into the price premium paradox where you think that pricing high actually indicates value, but your price is so high that you actually start hurting your acquisition, so it just becomes irrelevant for most people.\n\n(00:11:13):\nIf you're in the community builder, you actually fall into two common traps. The first one is you're focused so much on the foundation that you actually miss the frontier, which is you're so focused on your loyal customer base that you forget to attract different types of customers and you're not acquiring.\n\n(00:11:30):\nAnd the second trap that you fall into if you're a community builder is you train your customers to expect more for less. Because you're so eager to satisfy your loyal base, you start giving them more and more, and you're training your best customer base to expect more for less.\n\n(00:11:46):\nSo these six traps are very common across these archetypes. Being a profitable growth architect means that you're avoiding these traps. In other words, you're simultaneously being a disruptor, a moneymaker, and a community builder all at the same time. And how do you actually have that archetype and the right strategies to actually go about your business?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):\nOkay. So this is what you want to not do. You mentioned you have nine strategies for how you actually want to approach pricing, monetization, scaling, monetization, and innovation. Can you share a couple of these strategies, maybe two or three, maybe some of your favorites?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:12:21):\nSure. So I will unpack a couple of strategies. Maybe the first one I would take is what we call as beautifully simple pricing. So in your early days it is by far more important to have pricing that is really simple and it's not creating too much friction in the sales conversation. I mean, the asset test that you probably should go back on Monday morning and do is take some of your early prospects or customers and ask them to articulate the pricing strategy back to you, right? If they were to actually sell on your behalf, how would they describe the pricing strategy? And if they cannot contextualize that in a simple manner and actually explain, you don't have a simple pricing strategy. It's as simple as that.\n\n(00:13:02):\nAnd having a simple pricing strategy also means that your pricing needs to be able to tell a value story, as in you need to contextualize your price based on the value that you actually bring to the table.\n\n(00:13:15):\nA great example here is Superhuman. When they started, they were actually competing with free email products and they were coming up with a premium email experience. And how do you actually price that? And I thought the team at Superhuman with Rahul and others did a pretty good job. They came up with a $30 price point per month, which was pretty simple. But the way they kind of told the story was that you pay a dollar a day for actually getting four hours of productivity back in the week, and then suddenly the pricing doesn't look too off. I mean, it's like the price for a latte in a week to actually get four hours back. Why wouldn't I actually do that, right?\n\n(00:13:50):\nAnd pricing contextualization and value story doesn't need to just apply for premium products. If you take another example, like the Subway $5 footlong is a different way to say a story with pricing that, oh, for $5, you get a lot of value actually back. So beautifully simple pricing really means coming up with a simple pricing strategy that your customers immediately get and your pricing is actually telling a value story and how do you actually get that. So in the book, we have a checklist of 10 different things that you actually need to look at to make sure that your pricing is beautifully simple.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:25):\nAs we go through these strategies, is your advice try all these things, like you should do as many of these strategies as you can, or is it maybe pick a few that work for you or just one is enough?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:14:34):\nSo there are nine strategies. We have organized that into strategies that apply during your startup phase, like just when you get started, and strategies that apply to you in your scale-up phase. So there are four strategies that you need to do in your startup and five in the scale-up, so it's quite manageable. I would argue that all four apply in the startup and all five actually apply in the scale-up phase, but it's not like you need to start focusing on nine things from day one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):\nSo this first one was the startup phase?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:15:01):\nYeah. The beautifully simple pricing is the startup. Exactly. And so in the scale-up phase, I think one of the most important strategies is to master negotiations and really get better at acing negotiations, especially if you're in a B2B situation. And how do you actually do that? Because you need to be able to talk about the value and contextualize your price based on those kind of conversations.\n\n(00:15:25):\nSo to master negotiations, it comes down to actually three things. Mastering gives and gets, being good at value selling, and third, having the right negotiation strategies. So let's unpack that each at a time.\n\n(00:15:39):\nSo giving and getting, why is that important? Because in a negotiation, typically you're giving. I mean, you're giving concessions. People are asking. If you don't get anything back, you're basically indicating to the other person that they can keep beating you up and you need to keep giving. But if you're giving something but you ask for something in exchange, then you're basically bringing authenticity into the negotiation because it actually means something to you to give, so you're asking something back. It actually makes the negotiation way more effective.\n\n(00:16:10):\nAnd in the book we actually talk about the top 10 gets in B2B and the top 10 gets in B2C. One of my favorite gets in the B2B situation is what I call as conducting a value audit. So what this means is if you're giving a concession, ask for a value audit in exchange where every six months a team internally from your customers would be commissioned to actually conduct a value assessment of your products so that it becomes their business case and you co-create it with them saying how much value is actually produced. And this is great because if they actually engage in that, that gives you tremendous pricing power for renegotiations because it is their business case, they're championed it internally, and you're pretty much making your products pretty sticky. So it's a pretty harmless get, but it could be very powerful for future negotiations. So being good at-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:00):\nThat's really smart.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:17:01):\n... gives and gets is... Thank you. Being good at gives and gets is really critical.\n\n(00:17:07):\nThe second thing in mastering negotiations is being good at value selling. And for being good at value selling, you need to do three things. First, you need to be able to create the needs. Second, you need to be able to create affirmation loops. And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And let's talk about each of those. So creating needs is very important because many founders show up and try to understand what are the needs of the customers. That's one way to look at it. But you need to be able to create needs rather than just discover them.\n\n(00:17:38):\nSo for instance, if you're a marketing automation AI product and you save, let's say, three weeks of work that actually needs to be done to actually get stuff in a dashboard that can be analyzed by marketing managers, the way you create the need is ask about existing processes and say, \"Okay, so just so I understand, all of this stuff actually takes you three weeks to put data together to actually have meaningful dashboards for your marketing managers to take action. What if that was available to you instantaneously?\" Oh, you have now just created a need, right? So being in that mindset of creating a need as opposed to just discovering them.\n\n(00:18:17):\nThe second thing is creating affirmation loops. And this is really important. I've seen a lot of founders get into negotiations. They're so eager to talk about their products. They keep talking about the products without any affirmation from the other side. You need to pause and create affirmation loops, things like, for instance, \"Okay, so far, you've seen all of this. How does this actually play out in your company? Do you see it as valuable? What about this dashboard do you actually like?\"\n\n(00:18:44):\nSo when you ask these kind of questions and your customers are playing back the value that they actually see in your product, you're creating affirmation loops, which become tremendously useful when you start selling the product finally. Because if they've agreed that there's value that is being produced, then you also have a better commercial discussion.\n\n(00:19:03):\nAnd the third one is creating a good ROI model. And I see a lot of founders work on a POC. And after the POC's over, they'll show up with an ROI model and try to defend a price. You've already lost the battle. I mean, no one is going to believe an ROI model that you just cooked up. Everyone is going to challenge you on assumptions.\n\n(00:19:22):\nThe right way to think about an ROI model is to actually co-create it with your customers from day one, which means agree and validate on the assumptions and the inputs. So like, \"Hey, how long does this process take today? How many engineers are there?\" So you create ask questions that are all inputs to an ROI model. And if you have done that process and the customer agrees on all the inputs, they're very unlikely to push back on the output of an ROI model. So a POC needs to be framed as the purpose of a POC is to build a business case, and we are going to co-create an ROI model with the customer as opposed to it being a tech and product functionality feature test and you show up with an ROI model.\n\n(00:20:06):\nAnd when you're building an ROI model, there are many buckets to focus on, but there are three that are very critical. The first one is, what are the incremental gains that you actually bring to the table based on KPIs and metrics that your customer is tracking? So this could be things like incremental revenue, reduction in churn. These are the immediate, tangible, clear impact to the business line based on the products that you actually bring to the table.\n\n(00:20:33):\nThe second bucket is cost savings. Are you reducing headcount? Are you reducing license costs? What are the tangible cost savings?\n\n(00:20:41):\nAnd the third one, which is often overlooked, is opportunity cost. For instance, if you save 10 hours of time for a team, what do they actually do with that 10 hours? That can also be quantified. So when you put all of these three things together, you start building a proper ROI model that you can actually use in your value selling to defend the right price.\n\n(00:21:02):\nSo we talked about three steps in mastering negotiations. The first one was gives and gets. The second one was getting better at value selling. The third one is actually getting better at even negotiations and what strategies would you actually use. And there are a couple of strategies that we have found to be really productive.\n\n(00:21:20):\nThe first one is to show up with options. Many founders rush with one product and one price and say, \"Okay, this is a hundred K product, and that's what we are trying to sell.\" Inevitably, what will happen is the immediate focus of the conversation will be on the price, and you're only talking about price.\n\n(00:21:39):\nBut if you have options on the table, let's say if you have a good, better, best, if you're a hundred K product, a 200K and a 300K option, then you're not just talking price, you're talking value. Because if your customer is budget conscious, they'll say, \"Hey, I like the hundred K price point, but I actually like the functionality in your 200K product.\" Then your immediate question is, what in the functionality do you actually like? Why is that beneficial for you? So you switch the conversation back to value as opposed to just talking about price. And we have seen that with these kind of conversations, you're by far more better off to actually land in a much better place than just showcasing one product and one price.\n\n(00:22:18):\nAnd showcasing options doesn't need to be just different products. It could even be a pricing model choice. And I'd probably give a simple hack that people can try on Monday morning. I was talking to this founder who said, \"Hey, I think the budget is about 100K. That's what I believe from the key stakeholder, but my product really brings crazy value. I could even charge, let's say, a 500K for this product, but I don't have the courage to actually go and ask for a 500K price because I kind of know a hundred K is the budget. What should I do?\" So for those kind of situations, actually show up with options in your pricing model.\n\n(00:22:58):\nSo we coached him to go in with a hundred K, plus 10% on any incremental value that you bring, or it's a 500K fixed. So now this is actually a great situation in negotiation. Because if you're price sensitive, you're focused on the hundred K. It's a small fee to actually get started. But the conversation will gravitate towards, \"What is that 10%? How do you measure value?\" That's a great conversation to have because now you're talking about, \"How you add value? Where's the value generation? What portion would you take?\"\n\n(00:23:28):\nAnd you see one of two situations. Either the customer say, \"That's great. You're putting skin in the game. Let's go with a hundred K and 10%,\" or, 80% of the situations, you might actually want to avoid the outcome-based pricing as a buyer, but you're not really fixated on the 500K at that point. It is the premium that you're actually paying for the certainty. So no one is focusing on the 5K because of the hundred K option on the table, and you just put a 500K and got the courage to do that. And in this specific situation, that 500K got negotiated to 400K, and they just 4X the deal compared to where they would be. So having options on the table when you negotiate is critical.\n\n(00:24:05):\nAnd there's also some tactics that we showcase in the book, like anchoring is important. If you start high, you'll also end up higher. And also tapering concessions. How do you give concessions? I mean, the worst negotiators will start by giving a small concession and then give a bit more when someone asks like... You might give a 5% discount, and the procurement guy says, \"That's not enough.\" \"Okay, I'll give you 10% more.\" \"Okay, that's not enough.\" \"I'll give you 15.\" What are you indicating to the other person? You're just basically indicating that I can keep beating you up and I can get more discounts.\n\n(00:24:35):\nThe best negotiators who taper the concessions. So they would say, \"I can give you 15%.\" \"Okay, I need more.\" \"I'll give you five.\" \"I need more.\" \"I'll give you two.\" So you're automatically indicating to the other person that the negotiation's actually ending. So how do you taper concessions also become important.\n\n(00:24:51):\nSo when you put all of these three things together, if you master your gives and gets, you get better at value selling, and you use the right negotiation strategy, you can extract full value from every deal. That's probably way more important when you're at the scale-up phase.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:05):\nThis is such great advice. I love that this is just one small chapter of your book. This could make or break your company. It's interesting that you have a whole thing on negotiation in a book about scaling innovation and growing your company. Is the assumption here that your pricing and monetization is so impacted by how well you negotiate because that changes your entire pricing structure and how much you're making? Is that why you put so much effort into this part?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:25:31):\nExactly. I mean, in a B2B situation, you can set all the pricing you want, come up with great pricing models. But at least even today, it's a human having a human conversation trying to negotiate. So if you cannot contextualize what you put on the table, how do you negotiate around value, how do you contextualize your price, you're leaving a lot of money on the table.\n\n(00:25:49):\nSo to us, negotiations is yet another monetization topic where you're thinking about it as extracting full value from every deal. And this is not just negotiation tactics, like keep your boss at home and just negotiate and things like that. This is actual negotiation strategies that are rooted on value selling, gives and gets, and focusing on extracting full value from every deal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:14):\nSo useful. This idea of throwing out a third higher priced option, say 500K, it's so interesting. Because usually the advice I hear is like, \"Just throw out twice the number you used to... \" Just put it out there just in case, which is really scary to ask for like, \"What about $50,000?\" And this is like a much less scary way of doing that. \"Okay, but we also have this 500K option. Here's what you get.\" And then they may be like, \"Oh, that's exactly what we want.\" And you're like, \"Oh, wow. It worked.\"\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:26:40):\nExactly. It's a very simple hack to get your courage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):\nThat is so cool.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:26:44):\nPut a good price point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:45):\nWow, this is awesome. This is just like a golden nugget within golden nuggets of advice. Okay. So you have nine strategies. We've covered two. Let's not get into them, but just what are a few more just so people know what else they might be able to learn?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:26:59):\nSure. We talk about how to land and expand, as in how to design your best free product in such a way that you are landing, but also expanding. We talk about things like how to have the right packaging strategy, how to stop churn before it happens, how to do price increases effectively. Because at some point in your scale-up journey, you need to increase price, but how do you do that meaningful fashion?\n\n(00:27:24):\nSo we have various strategies that apply both for the startup and the scale-up phase. But in combination, all of those things help you articulate and architect towards profitable growth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):\nAwesome. Okay. Let's talk about AI for a bit. A lot of your book is about how AI pricing is very different from other previous traditional pricing strategies. And it feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days, so I think this is going to apply to a lot of people. How is AI pricing different?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:27:51):\nYeah, AI pricing is very different from the previous vintage of companies. Why is that so? Because AI founders need to tackle monetization from the very early days, like day one in their seed stage pre-seed kind of thing, which was not probably the focus for the previous SaaS companies. Why is that? So because of two reasons.\n\n(00:28:11):\nOne, for the first time there's cost dynamics to actually navigate. So you need to think about monetization from day one. But there's also a more critical reason, which is value capture. Because with AI products, you're actually bringing a lot of value to the table. And if you don't capture that from day one, then you're training your customers to expect more for less.\n\n(00:28:31):\nSo for instance, think about this. If you're building a agentic AI product that taps into labor budgets, labor budgets are 10X compared to software budgets. So if you use all the old playbooks, then you're under monetizing, again, from day one and training your customers to expect more for less. So how do you come up with foundational models that actually allow you to capture the value that you bring to the table?\n\n(00:28:55):\nAnd why has this become critical? Because with AI, finally, founders can really solve the attribution problem. In the previous vintages... For instance, if you take Slack, you can say that the productivity went up, efficiency happened, but you cannot measure it, monitor it, attribute it to Slack. Okay, that's probably why they were in a seed-based pricing model.\n\n(00:29:17):\nBut in today's situations, you see companies that say, \"In a Fortune 100 company, I was able to improve throughput by 10%, reduce crap by 5%.\" And when you get into those kinds of situation where an AI is creating core value and it's attributable to the AI, you get a lot of pricing power.\n\n(00:29:35):\nSo the two questions that we commonly hear from AI founders is, \"How do I set the right pricing model?\" as in, \"How do I charge?\" which becomes way more important than how much you charge. Because the underlining business model has changed. We have moved from software being a pay for access to now you're paying for work delivered. So the monetization model's become key. That is the first question that people actually ask us.\n\n(00:30:05):\nThe second one is, \"How do I navigate POCs, commercial discussions early?\" Because the buyer on the other side also wants to see the value before they engage in a commercial discussion.\" So those two topics become very critical, and we have showcased a lot of this in the book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:23):\nThis episode is brought to you by Persona, the adaptable identity platform that helps businesses fight fraud, meet compliance requirements, and build trust.

And then I want to talk about this two-by-two that you have in the book. And I'll actually pull it up. So let's talk about POCs first.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:31:43):\nSo POCs, when we talk about POCs, many founders think about a POC as a proof of technical functionality, and is their product actually working in their customer environments. And they set up the expectation that we are saying, \"Hey, we are going to put the product, and we're going to see if it actually works.\" And they would probably say, \"Should I charge for a POC versus not?\" And we'll unpack that in a bit, should you or should you not.\n\n(00:32:10):\nAnd that's actually a completely wrong way of framing it. The POC should be framed as the entire goal of the POC is to create a business case, period, full stop. It is not to demonstrate product functionality fit within your customer environment's ability to integrate. All of that stuff is a consequence of the business case.\n\n(00:32:30):\nSo if you frame it this way is you can say, \"Look, it is a 30-day pilot for co-creating an ROI model and building a business case along with their users. If we see value at the end of the 30 days based on the business case, we can get to commercial discussions.\" So that way you've actually not talked about your price. You're only focused on co-creating a business case with the customer. And based on the business case, you can actually come up with a proper commercial agreement. And if they see value, they're going to pay you for it. So thinking about the POCs in that kind of manner.\n\n(00:33:03):\nAnd the question that I often get asked is, \"Should I charge for a POC?\" And the answer is yes, but smartly. Let's talk about why it's important to charge. The reason you need to charge for a POC is you start isolating people who are just tire kickers versus serious buyers. It becomes a lead qualification mechanism. If you didn't have that, you're going to attract all of these curious buyers who are just curious about AI. They just want to see if it works or not. They will say, \"Yes, I'll engage with the POC.\" They will take 30, 60, 90 days with you. They will burn a lot of resources, never buy. You've just wasted your time. Time is of the essence. So having a price tag to your POC actually indicates that there is seriousness on both sides, so you should charge.\n\n(00:33:48):\nBut how do you actually charge for it? You need to charge for it smartly. What this means is that you need to make sure that your POC pricing is not a reflection of your actual commercial deal. Because let's say if you just say it's a 10K POC for a 30-day pilot. If you don't talk about the fact that it is not the same as your commercial discussion, you have now set an anchor that, okay, it's 120K per year kind of deal if the POC works. So you have to be clear that the 10K is only for building a business case. Commercial discussions will follow after that. It is not an indication of the actual commercial discussion.\n\n(00:34:28):\nBut your buyer on the other side might still push you saying, \"That's all great, but I need a price or a budget, otherwise I won't move forward with it.\" So there are two ways to actually deflect those kind of questions. The first way is contextualize the price on the value. So you can say something like, if you're pushed for price, \"Hey, for customers such as yours, we have been able to at least unlock 10 million in very similar situations. And our pricing is... One is to 10X when it comes to ROI.\"\n\n(00:34:58):\nSo you basically said that you're a million dollars to actually get started, but you actually didn't say it. You just said, \"It's a 10 million, and I'm taking one in 10 in exchange for it.\" So you've given the buyer an indication, but you've framed it in such a manner that actually is justifiable, right? A one in 10X ROI. So that's one way to do it.\n\n(00:35:16):\nThey might still say, \"Yeah, that's good, but I need a budget.\" So then rather than just give them a budget saying, \"It could be a 200K option,\" don't do that. That's the worst thing you can actually say. Give them a range. You can say something like, \"Look, the final pricing would be anywhere from 500K to a million. And based on the business case that we would co-create with you, we can pick a point in that range that justifies the value that we bring to the table.\" So you're giving budgetary ranges, right? So that's the other way to actually go about POCs.\n\n(00:35:46):\nSo how you navigate your early wins, who you choose is very critical when you're building companies at scale and fast in AI because that actually dictates the destiny for the rest of your future. And picking those early wins is very, very critical. And having buyers who are serious, lead qualifying, having the right POC process, and thinking about POCs as, frankly, not just trying to see if your product actually works and delivers value, but it's a great chance to have a commercial test-and-learn experiment and have fun with it and try to see what you can bring to the table in terms of your value and what portion can you actually take.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:26):\nSo the core takeaway here is, for AI companies, you no longer can just grow and figure out monetization later. Your advice here is what you start with is what you're going to end up with, and it's very easy to under monetize because people aren't realizing that they're now helping with actual labor force savings versus just SaaS software that's making people a little bit more efficient.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:36:50):\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, I strongly believe that the winners in AI will need to master monetization, and they need to master it from day one. And when we talk to early-stage founders, it is a topic that keeps many people up at night, but that's also why we wrote Scaling Innovation and other assets so that they can get some more courage to think about pricing correctly from day one. And it's become very critical for AI companies to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:16):\nDo you feel like the popular IDE startups, I won't name names, do you think they've under monetized and they're going to be in trouble down the road?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:37:24):\nSome of them for sure have. I think they will probably run out of it because they might show a lot of, let's say, fast revenue growth, but is that enduring revenue? Are people actually going to stay? And is there going to be churn? And so there are a lot of aspects to marketing profitable growth. It's not just growing fast, but also growing profitably and having an enduring business. So some of them, yes, without naming names. But yeah, I think that's why it's important to be thoughtful about market share and wallet share.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:54):\nWell, those are different. I think what you're saying here is the retention may not work for some of these companies. But on the other hand, they're really cheap. 20 bucks a month to help your engineer be 10 times more productive potentially, is that too good a deal? Do you think they should have priced a lot higher?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:38:11):\nYeah, for sure. I mean, if you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you started training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, I think there are companies that have actually done that. And they try to undo it with having more sophisticated, let's say, products that are actually higher priced or much higher priced, et cetera. That's one way to undo that situation.\n\n(00:38:32):\nSo it's really a trade-off between getting more customers and making money at the same time. That's the whole point of the book, market share and wallet share, and how do you dominate both. So if they're being thoughtful about both and have a vision to not just grow market share, but also have a clear strategy to land and expand and increase wallet share, those strategies might pan out for those types of companies. If you just threw out a $20 product hoping to just accelerate your market share, you're in trouble.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):\nOkay. This is a great segue to this two-by-two, which goes much deeper into this. So it's easy to be like, \"Here's what you shouldn't do.\" Here's your advice on what to actually do. So I'm going to pull up on my screen this two-by-two that you have in your book. So if you're watching YouTube, you'll be able to see it.\n\n(00:39:13):\nSo talk about this. This is essentially how to figure out the best possible pricing model and where you have the most power.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:39:20):\nSo when you talk about AI companies and monetization models, we get asked this question. \"Should I be usage-based? Should I be outcome? Should I be a copilot mode? Or how do I actually think about my pricing model?\" So we came up with this framework, which is a relatively simple, straightforward framework, but very powerful.\n\n(00:39:39):\nSo there are two axes here. One is attribution, and the other one is autonomy. And when you have high attribution and high autonomy, that is when you have high pricing power, and we'll come back to that in a bit, right?\n\n(00:39:51):\nSo let's take the first bottom-left quadrant. That is the quadrant where your attribution is low and your autonomy is low. In that situation, the best pricing archetype that actually fits is it is actually a seed-based or a subscription model because there's not much to do about it because you're not being able to attribute a lot of value to what you bring, but you're in a copilot mode and you're not in an autonomous mode, so a seed-based pricing would actually make sense.\n\n(00:40:18):\nBut if you're at that quadrant, the immediate thing to think about is, how do you actually build more attribution and move to the right so that you actually get more pricing power? So if you think about the bottom-right quadrant, those are companies that have actually done that. They can prove more attribution to what they actually bring to the table, but they are still not in a fully autonomous mode, as in there is still humans in the loop.\n\n(00:40:43):\nIf you take Cursor, for instance, it definitely improves productivity, can actually bring down the time to actually do code, the attribution is clear, but it's still in a copilot mode. In those kind of situations, a hybrid pricing model is the best option where you still have a seed-based model for the copilot kind of use case, but you also layer in a consumption model which actually says there are a certain number of AI credits or tokens that can layer in the usage aspects. So if you use more and more, then you're actually paying more on consumption. So it's a hybrid model that actually works there.\n\n(00:41:18):\nIf you look at the top-left quadrant, those are products that are very autonomous but are not strong on attribution. So these tend to be mostly backend or infrastructure kind of products that are core critical to run businesses, can be autonomous, but they're not directly impacting the KPIs that businesses are tracking, and hence cannot prove attribution very effectively. So in that situation, you need to be on a pay-for-what-you-consume and a usage-based model. A seed-based model would not make sense because it's autonomous. There's no human in the loop. But that's why you're also in a usage-based model, saying the more you use it, the more you're actually charged. And usage becomes a proxy for the value that you bring to the table.\n\n(00:42:07):\nThe quadrant that you really want to be in is the golden quadrant, which is the top-right one. That's the outcome-based pricing model where you have great autonomy and great attribution. And here is where I think AI can be really magical. So this means you're not only charging for work delivered, but you're charging for work delivered that was delivered by AI without no humans in the loop. So that becomes more of an outcome-based model situation.\n\n(00:42:35):\nSo a classic example here is Intercom for Fin. What they actually do is they charge based on an AI resolution. So if an AI is able to resolve the ticket completely independently without a human in the loop, then they charge for it. If a human intervention is needed, they don't charge for it. So they're more on an outcome-based model. Or companies like Charge Flow would charge up to 25% on a charge bag that they're able to actually recover, because these are core savings that you actually bring to the table based on your AI. It is highly attributable, highly autonomous so you can start moving towards an outcome-based pricing model.\n\n(00:43:14):\nIf you look at the state of where AI is today, as of the day of recording this podcast, now, the most popular model is right now a hybrid pricing model. So because this is also expected, because the previous SaaS playbook was usually on the seat-based model, but they've all now moved on to at least a hybrid to actually incorporate AI credits and usage, et cetera, about 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model as of today. But those companies, some of the best ones are able to recover 25 to 50% of the value that they actually bring to the table.\n\n(00:43:54):\nIn the classic SaaS situation, we used to say if you can charge 10 to 20% of the value, that's actually great. But in AI, you can actually charge 25 to 50% because it is autonomous, you're doing it with the AI. There's no humans in the loop. You are creating incremental value to the business metrics. You are producing hard-cost savings. There's opportunity costs. You can justify all of that. It's attributable. So you can actually take 25 to 50% of what you bring to the table.\n\n(00:44:22):\nIn a lot of benchmarks and studies that actually show, and this is also my belief, that in the next three years that 5% number will move to 25%. So what this really means is if you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant because that's a magic quadrant. If you can truly price based on outcomes, you've achieved and unlock tremendous value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:49):\nWow. Okay. I'm just going to pause again. This is amazing. Madhavan, thank you so much for it. I love, again, that you just spent years, decades studying this stuff, come here, tell us all the answers of what we should be doing. This is incredible.\n\n(00:45:01):\nLet me ask you this. By the way, for folks not watching on YouTube, the companies you have in the golden quadrant, outcome-based pricing, Sierra, Fin, and Chargeflow. We've got the founder of Sierra and Fin coming on the podcast soon, so we'll talk about all this with those guys.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:45:16):\nAwesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):\nSo is the way to use this two-by-two figuring out your model? Is it like, \"Okay, I'm like Cursor. I'm going to go in this quadrant,\" or is it, \"How do I get to outcome-based no matter what? That's where I need to be\"?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:45:32):\nYeah, so that's a great question. The first one is to actually figure out what is your right archetype based on where you are today. I think that is most important. If you try to rush into an outcome-based pricing model but cannot prove attribution, you will fail. So it is really coming up with what is the right archetype based on what I'm doing today, but also use this two-by-two to say, \"How do I paint a vision to actually get to outcome based? And can I get close to that? Or can I be purely an outcome-based model? How do I evolve into that?\"\n\n(00:46:05):\nWhat that would mean is, how do I build functionality in the products to actually show attribution, how do I build more agentic workforces to take the human out of the loop and be more autonomous, and being thoughtful about your vision and strategy so that you will orient yourself towards more outcome-based pricing models. So when you think about increasing attribution, that means, first of all, understanding what are the KPIs of your customers. How do they track their business performance? Can you impact it? Can you productize things in your product that showcase that you are actually affecting those KPIs in a positive manner? Can you build dashboards to show value attribution? Can you do those value audits that we talked about on an ongoing basis to actually show that you're bringing a lot of value to the table and is attributable to you? So how do you create these kind of attribution mechanisms become important and also autonomous based on building more agentic workforces that can actually be on an autonomous mold?\n\n(00:47:04):\nSo pick the right archetype and plan to get to as close as you can to the outcome-based pricing model. That's how I would use the two-by-two. And you actually kind of see this happening with certain industries, right? If you think about coding as a overall category... Like back in the day with GitHub, everyone, they started with a seed-based model. They've now moved to the hybrid-based pricing model with Cursors and everyone else, but the natural move would be more towards a outcome-based pricing model where a AI agent can probably code everything at the same time, debug it, and you're kind of almost hiring a AI developer or AI QA person. And that actually becomes more closer to a outcome-based model because it's attributable and autonomous. So that is picking the right archetype and then figuring out your pathway is the key way to interpret this two-by-two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):\nThis explains why everyone's pulling agents. That's where the money's at, what you're telling us here.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:48:00):\nYeah. It's going to be the age of The Matrix. Too many agents.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:04):\nAgent Smiths everywhere. They didn't turn out too great. So what I'm hearing is if I were Canva... So Canva here in your model is bottom right. They're in a hybrid pricing model. They have a base fee and consumption fee. What you would do if you were helping Canva is what can you build that creates more autonomy, an autonomous version of Canva? And it's not like you need to do this. It's just you have more pricing power if you figure something out there.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:48:31):\nExactly. And a good case for that is the Fin product from Intercom. Because traditionally, all of those kind of companies used to price based on an agent basis. How many customer service agents are actually using the product? It used to be seed based, but they built out Fin, which is a completely AI resolution for those kind of support tickets. And then that actually enables them to move to the outcome-based pricing model quadrant.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):\nAmazing. So say you're an AI founder today. You're thinking about your pricing strategy, your monetization strategy long term. Your advice is work with design partners, create these POCs where you work on this ROI model with them to ideally find some outcome-based pricing strategy. Is that a good way to summarize it? What would you add to that?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:49:17):\nYes. I mean, at least be able to contextualize the business case. Even if you're not moving to an outcome-based pricing model, be clear on the outcome that you're actually creating for your customers through that business case, which actually will enable you to charge a fair price in exchange for that outcome. And if your customers agree with the business case, then you can actually take a portion of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:43):\nFin, actually, they're a new sponsor of the podcast, and I learned... I didn't know this. It costs 99 cents for every support ticket they solve [inaudible 00:49:51].\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:49:51):\nThrough AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:52):\nThrough AI.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:49:53):\nExactly. If it needs a human intervention, then they don't charge for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:56):\nYeah. And it's just like, what? That's such a simple story. Your agent costs 20 bucks. This thing costs 99 cents\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:50:03):\nYeah. That is two chapters in one beautifully simple pricing and an outcome-based pricing model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:09):\nAnd interestingly, they were the most hated pricing model initially. I did a survey on Twitter ones, like, \"What products do you pay the most for?\" and it was always Intercom. And everyone hated their pricing, and they found a solution.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:50:21):\nI think they found a great solution.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:23):\nOkay. So is there anything else along these lines that you think companies, especially AI companies, should be thinking when they're thinking about pricing that you'd want to share before we move on to other stuff?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:50:34):\nI think we've covered most of the topics. Like we said, it's being thoughtful about POCs, choosing the right pricing archetype or the pricing models. Those things become very critical in the early stages. But when you start scaling and, let's say, you become a multi-product company, then you need to start focusing on, \"What kind of packaging strategy should I have? Is it a platform plus add-ons? Should I have versions of the products like good, better, best? Should I tackle different use cases because now my AI can solve an insurance use case and a healthcare use case? Should I productize to different use cases? Is that my packaging strategy? Or should I keep it completely modularized for people to pick and choose?\"\n\n(00:51:17):\nSo these kind of questions become more critical, and that's why the chapter on blowing up your packaging from your early days and coming up with your packaging strategy for your scale-up phase become very critical. So I think that's the next thing that founders would be hit with, as in when they build multiple products, they need to think about the whole packaging, cross-selling, up-selling motion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:37):\nThis touches on something I was about to ask, which is a change in your pricing strategy. How often is it a success to change the way you price? I know we're talking about you need to get it right from the beginning if you're an AI company. In your experience, how often... What does it take to successfully shift the way you price down the road if people are listening to this and are like, \"Shit, we already have this pricing strategy\"?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:52:00):\nBack in the day, we used to say that you should revisit your pricing strategy, overall pricing model, how much you're charging at least once in two years. With AI, that's probably reduced in half because of the scale with which and the speed with which companies are built and competing.\n\n(00:52:16):\nSo I would say that it is an ongoing journey. It is not like you just solve it in day one, fill it, and forget it. You have to be thoughtful from day one, but also be ready to pivot, iterate, and you're going to learn along your journey. So the whole point is to think about pricing as also a test-and-learn opportunity in your early days.\n\n(00:52:38):\nAnd there are things that you would change more often, and there are things that you probably don't want to change too often. Things like pricing model, unless you really changed your attribution autonomy, there is no need to shift your pricing model. Stay within that archetype. Don't confuse things.\n\n(00:52:54):\nBut there are things like price points. Should I increase my price because it's been six months a year? Yeah, you should. Because in a year there's probably prices go up three to 5% for everything that you consume. But how can you actually increase your prices and be thoughtful about it? So that entire chapter on how to do price increases smartly become very important in the scale-up phase.\n\n(00:53:16):\nI think Warren Buffett summarized this really well. He said the true definition of a company is a pricing power. And if you have a prayer session for doing a 10% price increase, you have a terrible business. So you have to be able to increase prices over a bit of time. But how do you do it strategically that does not affect too much churn, but you're also able to pass on the increase as a value exchange, those things become critical.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:39):\nAwesome. Zooming out a little bit, something that I love about your book is you structured it around these axioms. You have a bunch of these really clever axioms that get stuck in your head and help you think about pricing. Can you share some of your favorites, maybe two or three referred axioms from the book?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:53:55):\nYou talked about Sierra being in your park founders. I don't know if that's Clay, but here's a shout-out for Clay. So Clay actually read the entire book and gave me feedback, Scaling Innovation, the similar copy that he actually had. I called it Scaling Innovation Axioms throughout the book. And the whole point of the axioms was that at the end of the day, if you can just take all the axioms, put it in a printout next to your desk is the summary of the book. And it's like PT statements that you'll just remember what to do.\n\n(00:54:26):\nSo he came up with this idea that, \"Hey, rather than calling them just generic scaling innovation axioms, you need to brand each and every axiom.\" And I thought that was a brilliant idea. So I went about coming up with a unique... He even contributed to some of the names. We came up with some unique names for each axiom.\n\n(00:54:45):\nAnd here's the other fun fact. Probably I'm geeking out too much. But when I counted the number of axioms, there were 42 axioms. And I didn't try to make this up. And if you're a Hitchhiker's fan, then you know that's the answer to everything.\n\n(00:54:58):\nBut jokes apart, let me unpack a few axioms. One of my first favorite axioms, what I call is the 20-80 axiom. Especially in tech companies, 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that the 20% is the easiest thing to build often. So what founders do is they take this 20%, build it, put it out in the market almost for free, and then they're chasing their tails to build 80% stuff that's only driving 20% willingness to pay. So if you have not been thoughtful about that, you've given the farm away unintentionally.\n\n(00:55:37):\nSo truly understanding what drives willingness to pay in your product is critical. And I think people call it the MVP. I think we should change the definition of MVP. It shouldn't be minimum viable product, it should be the most valuable product. And be thoughtful about what are you actually giving out as your early products I think is key. That's the 20-80 axiom.\n\n(00:55:58):\nProbably my second one is the price paralysis axioms. So what that means is your reluctance to do a price increase is often internal and emotional and it's not external and logical. This goes back to the same prayer session to actually do a price increase. If you're holding hands, you have a terrible business. So it's mostly internal and emotional, and how do you be thoughtful about price increases become important.\n\n(00:56:29):\nProbably my third favorite one is stopping churn before it happens, so stopping churn axiom. So to stop churn, you need to attract customers who won't leave. That sounds counterintuitive, but that's the best way to actually stop churn. What does this actually mean? Most companies will try to stop churn when someone actually says, \"I want to go.\" It is too late, and you're being reactive. At the most, you'll throw some offers. They will stay for another six months, and they will leave. They've already made that determination.\n\n(00:56:59):\nThe way to stop churn is to start acquiring customers who won't leave. And that is the most important thing. So if you look back at your data and say, \"Who are the types of customers who actually tend to stay longer? What are their characteristics? How can I focus my acquisition dollars in getting more of those?\" then you stop churn before it happens. And that's the key.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):\nThat's interesting. I'm surprised you didn't say what was my favorite, which is... I think it's like, \"If you land, make sure to expand.\"\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:57:28):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):\nThat one really stuck with me.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:57:29):\nThat's a good one, too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):\nMaybe talk about that one. Yeah.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:57:32):\nSure. I mean, so if you land, you need to also make sure you're expanding, in the sense that if you give the farm away in your entry-level product, you don't have much to actually monetize later. So being thoughtful about what is the fence between your land product. Is it a free experience? What is the getting? And the getting is typically based on are you getting based on features? Are you also getting on usage? And how do you be thoughtful about that? So you leave stuff for the expansion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):\nOkay. So zooming out even further, to kind of wrap up, what would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away that they think they understand but they probably don't?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:58:14):\nYeah, I think this comes back to what you started with. I think intuitively people get it that they need to think about market share and wallet share if they're growing. And even if you ask them, they'll say like, \"Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking about wallet share,\" but have they really thought about it equally and paid equal attention? Have they postponed one of them? Are they operating in a single-engine strategy consciously or subconsciously? I think that's the key takeaway I have.\n\n(00:58:40):\nSo the contrarian take is not to put equal effort on both the engines at the same time. In certain stages of your company, you might need to be more market share dominating. In certain stages you might need to be wallet share dominating. It's not equal effort, but it's equal attention and really developing that mindset of being a true profitable growth architect. And that is the main takeaway that I have for people. And if you are not in that mindset already, there's a book for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:12):\nI'll point them to it. So just so folks know what to do when they're like, \"Okay, I need to focus on wallet share more,\" is the main focus figure out a pricing model that aligns well with pricing power, what's in the bucket of work to do to invest more in wallet-share thinking?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (00:59:28):\nSo it's actually all of those. Market share, wallet share, acquisition, monetization, retention are all kind of correlated. You can't think about them in isolation. So I wouldn't say only for wallet share what do you need to do. If you want to grow on both the market share and wallet share... Let's say, for instance, you need to have the right land-and-expand strategy. The land helps you with acquisition. The expansion helps you with wallet share.\n\n(00:59:54):\nIf you have a pricing model, then you need to have a pricing model that lets you acquire faster because it's intuitive, but it should also help you recover value, which is like your monetization. And if people understand your pricing model, they're actually going to stay. So it's all sort of goes hand in hand. So I wouldn't isolate thinking one way or the other. That's why the nine strategies actually are very powerful. Because if you follow those strategies, you are not going to fall into the single-engine strap. These are tried and tested strategies of how to build businesses in such a way that you're being thoughtful and paying equal attention to both market share and wallet share.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):\nAll right. That is a very reasonable answer. Madhavan, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:00:41):\nRead the two books in sequence, Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. Because it's one thing to build a great product, it's yet another thing to build a great business. You cannot build a great business with a not-so-great product, and you cannot do it the other way around either. So I think it's thinking about pricing early, especially for AI companies, being thoughtful about it, price before product, and then thinking about how to actually scale, developing a profitable growth mindset. All of these things become critical. And I'm looking forward to the feedback from the audience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):\nI feel like your books are in the staple of founder reading. There's all these things you just don't know what you're doing. And there's a few of these books that are like, \"Okay, here's all this advice that'll answer so many questions and save you so much heartache.\" And so I'm really excited you're adding something to that bookshelf. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:01:16):\nOkay. Let's go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:36):\nLet's go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:01:41):\nThe first one that comes to mind is Business Model Canvas by Alex Osterwalder. It's a classic and one of my favorite books. I recommend a lot of people to read that because I think it nicely ties a lot of what we are also seeing from a more strategic business model angle.\n\n(01:01:57):\nI like this book, Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow. I think that's also a classic because, again, there's always a human element to things. And understanding the customer psychology is important whether you're in B2C or in B2B. Because if you're in a B2B situation, it's humans having a human conversation. So it's as much behavioral as it's actually numbers. So I love that book, and there's a lot of nuggets in there, so I recommend a lot.\n\n(01:02:20):\nAnd probably the third one that I recommend is a book called Contagious by Jonah Berger. I love that. He was in the PhD program at Stanford in marketing, and he actually wrote this book on how to make messages viral. And he's actually seen the best viral messages and boiled it down to a framework. And if you follow that, then you can make those messages viral. And I've tried to use some of those in my own outreaches and things of that nature, so I think it's a fantastic read.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:51):\nWow.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:02:52):\nHave you read it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):\nGot to check this out. I have not. I haven't even heard of it. All right. We're going to go viral because we got the playbook.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:02:57):\nContagious. That's the name of the book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):\nContagious. Okay. We'll link to that. Is there a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:03:04):\nI guess a movie. Sure, let's pick a movie. Definitely enjoyed Mission Impossible, the final one, eighth in the sequence. I think I find that a whole... I love those, the entire genre, one through eight. But what I kind of like about it is my willingness to pay has constantly increased over a period of time. They could have charged me whatever they wanted for the eighth movie. I would've probably gone and seen it, when I wanted to. So I thought that's an interesting example of a durable brand where your monetization power actually increase over a period of time. So I think I enjoyed the movie. It was great. Yeah.\n\n(01:03:43):\nHey, by the way, I just realized MI stands for Monetizing Innovation and also Mission Impossible. Maybe subconsciously that's why I liked it, too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:52):\nAnd you're the Tom Cruise character.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:03:53):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:55):\nI love how you're the only person in the world that thinks of Mission Impossible through a monetization, willingness-to-pay lens.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:04:00):\nExactly. I think there's too many of these dinner conversations also gravitate towards pricing and monetization. I think it's become my life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:09):\nOh, man. We need a version of this movie, like a Mission Possible of Madhavan.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:04:14):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:14):\nI'd pay anything for that. All right. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:04:22):\nI would probably talk about two products. The first one is Delphi, the Digital Mind representation. There's a Lennybot that you actually, I think, put out. I find that product fascinating, and I also love the founders, Dara and Sam there. I truly believe that that is going to be the future for thought leadership and how thoughts are consumed by consumers.\n\n(01:04:46):\nAnd I've used your Lennybot. I really enjoy it, like if I can co-create some thought leadership piece with talking to you, but it's not you, your AI, and it's actually living and breathing your brain. How cool is that? And I think that I really love the product category. There's a lot of different use cases, longevity, extension, use cases, things of that nature. I'm excited about the product. I think it's been great. I plan to, taking inspiration from you, plan to create a Delphi of myself-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):\nOkay. I was going to ask.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:05:15):\n... at some point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):\nOkay.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:05:16):\nI think it should be [inaudible 01:05:17]-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:16):\nSo that one would... Yeah.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:05:18):\n... the book maybe. I'll try to. That's the promise. Try to keep it ready. So I think if you want to talk more about the book or things of that nature and talk pricing, you can talk to my AI, too, right? I mean, I find the product fascinating.\n\n(01:05:31):\nThe second one I would probably say that's been super useful in terms of just productivity is Granola. We love that product. I think just the ability to take notes and during all the meetings and organize it and being able to query things, et cetera. I think it's been a great product that we recently started trying and we've been really liking it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):\nCool. That's been the most mentioned product recently. How cool is that? Love Granola. Get a year free of Granola if you're a paid subscriber to my newsletter, lennysnewsletter.com. Click bundle, one year free for not just you, your whole team. What an offer they offered. It's crazy.\n\n(01:06:05):\nOn Delphi, what's interesting about LennyBot is it's not just my knowledge, it's every single podcast guest's insights and lessons also fed into it. What an oracle of knowledge this thing's become. And it's free at this point, completely free. Lennybot.com. No, I get nothing from it. It's just out there.\n\n(01:06:24):\nOkay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:06:32):\nCreate value in everything and anything that you touch. Everything else will follow. That's my life motto.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):\nThat resonates deeply. Okay, last question. You recently moved into investing. So what's cool is it used to be very expensive to work with at Simon-Kucher, I think it was called. Very expensive. A lot of big company stuff. Now a lot of more founders have access to you because you're investing in startups. So just talk about that. Talk about what you're doing these days.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:07:00):\nSure. I mean, at Simon-Kucher, I got to work with over 250 companies. And my co-GP now, Josh Bloom, he also had an opportunity to work with our 250 companies. So combined, we worked with our 500 companies, more than 50-plus unicorns. It was a great ride.\n\n(01:07:16):\nAnd often, we were actually working with them in much later stages when series D or pre-IPO, post-IPO, private equity companies, et cetera. But the two of us actually now started a venture firm with an explicit goal of working with early-stage AI founders. And it goes back to the topic that we started with. AI companies needs to deal with monetization from day one. But for those kind of companies, fee-for-service transaction model doesn't necessarily work. And that's also why we pivoted to venture.\n\n(01:07:51):\nSo our business model is pretty standard right now. You get access in the cap table. We roll up our sleeves and work with the founders in all things monetization. So we are invested in their success and we will partake in the value creation. There's no fee for service, no friction on those kind of manners. But on the flip side, we get to concentrate our efforts in fund one and probably 20 to 25 companies, and that's where we will be spending our time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:16):\nWhat a deal. Madhavan, two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and talk about this offer? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:08:25):\nWays to find out, I think just google for Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. You'll probably land in a lot of pages. You can also go to Amazon, I think, if you want to purchase the books. Actually, Scaling Innovation is now available in pre-order. I think we'll have the pod released before the book is actually out. The book is going to be out on August 5th. So there's an opportunity to pre-order.\n\n(01:08:48):\nAnd maybe I will take an inspiration from your master bundle, which I really think is the world's best bundle, and come up with my own bundle for getting users to pre-order. So if you love Monetizing Innovation, I can tell you you would really love Scaling Innovation. So go buy it for your teams. Buy it for yourself.\n\n(01:09:06):\nAnd here's the offer. So for anyone who's able to buy more than five copies, send us a screenshot of your purchase pre-order, right? Send us a screenshot of your purchase to promo@49palmsvc.com. So that's promo, as in promotion, @49 P-A-L-M-S-V-C .com.\n\n(01:09:30):\nAnd here's the bundle offer that I have. 10 people will get access to bundles as a raffle, and the bundle is going to include a signed copy of Scaling Innovation, a 30-minute ask-me-anything session, an exclusive invite for a Scaling Innovation book launch, and also a Scaling Innovation t-shirt. So that's my coming up with a bundle. I didn't get Granola and others to put in for me just yet, but I think this hopefully suffices and is exciting for folks to buy.\n\n(01:10:01):\nAnd, yeah. I mean if you like the book, please do leave a review on Amazon. That always is helpful. Because if more people review it, the book takes a life of its own. And I'm really thankful for also the support that I got over the years from founder community, from the venture community for Monetizing Innovation. I think there's been, over the last eight years, thousands and thousands of fans of the books. They've done a whole lot talking about it, writing reviews, posting on LinkedIn, and making things like price before product or product market price fit and things as a part of founder vocabulary. So I'm very passionate that people actually did that and very thankful for them. So there's also probably an equal measure. If you're excited about Scaling Innovation, I would love for you to talk about the book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):\nAmazing. And I think the reason people do that is because you give away so much for free. You just shared so much wisdom for free that is going to help so many people, so it all comes back to you.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:11:05):\nI just tried to plan my give and get right there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):\nThere we go. Oh my God. A good callback. Madhavan, this was incredible. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nMadhavan Ramanujam (01:11:13):\nThank you so much, Lenny. Was a pleasure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:15):\nSame. Bye, everyone.\n\n(01:11:18):\nThank you so much for listening.

And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster. Their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion because as a PM, for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going and it's hard work and part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.\n\nLenny (00:00:57):\nToday my guest is Maggie Crowley. Maggie is currently vice president of Product at Toast. Prior to this, she was VP and head of product at Charlie Health, senior director of product at Drift, director of product at BevSpot, a product manager at TripAdvisor. She's also got an MBA from Harvard Business School. She was also an Olympic speed skater, which is insane and incredibly cool. And in our conversation we discuss the three most common threads across the best product managers that she's worked with, hired and managed how to very tactically write out a product strategy to share with your team and manager why being data-driven is a red flag for product thinking. Why product content you find online can be dangerous. Her best advice for how to break into product management. Also, the impact writing online has had on her career and so much more. Maggie is amazing.\n\n(00:01:44):\nI'm excited for you to learn from her like I did. With that, I bring you Maggie Crowley after a short word from our sponsors.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:04:10):\nThanks for having me. I'm super excited.\n\nLenny (00:04:12):\nYou put out so much content across podcasts, blogs, tweets, I'm sure there's other things I haven't even seen. And so what I've done is I've scoured all of your content as much as I could to find topics that we could dig into in our conversation today. And I thought it'd be fun to start with how to become a successful product manager and what it takes to be a successful product manager, especially long-term in your career. You've worked with a bunch of PMs, you've hired a lot of PMs, you've managed a lot of PMs, and so I guess the question is just what are some common threads you've seen across the best product managers?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:04:50):\nYeah, it's an interesting question mostly because I've worked in startups, zero to one, scaling stage startups, enterprise, all that kind of stuff. And there's a lot of content out there I think on how those roles are different and how PMs are different across those different types of companies. But what I've seen is that there are some standard things that are the same across the role no matter whether you're a consumer, B2B or startup or a large company and in particular about what sets PMs apart from one another. And the things that I look for when I'm hiring or when I'm looking to promote people or when PMs stand out, even when you're not looking are three things.\n\n(00:05:31):\nFirst, I think the best PMs are really good at breaking things down and simplifying things. So, finding at any moment what is the really truly the only thing you need to do, especially in a big company, there are 8 million priorities, there's 700 OKRs, there's 25,000 projects you could work on, and teams will get bogged down in that complexity. Similarly speaking at a startup, you might think that it's easy to find the one thing to do, but at the same time there's so many fires that are happening and so many things you could do in such a world of opportunity that even just picking one and sticking with it is really difficult. And so the best PMs not only can find the one thing to work on, but they can stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it.\n\nLenny (00:06:15):\nI think that's a really interesting point, because it sounds simple. Also, just this idea of simplifying, but I think there's so much up there partly because within simplifying is prioritizing and you can almost boil down the job of the PM as they're just prioritizing and telling people what is next. And so I think that's a really powerful point you're making.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:06:33):\nPrioritization is a tough word because there's so much wrapped up in that and what it means to prioritize. And I've worked for people who wanted to understand the formula for prioritization and why this thing and how can you prove that this is the right thing to work on and not that thing. And then a week goes by and then they want to reevaluate the priority and they want to re-litigate the priority. And so it's so much more than just a moment in time deciding, but it's the ability to stay with it and to make sure that it continues to be the most important thing, that you finish it and actually see that it works and that you can get people to continue to stay excited and engaged in that project.\n\n(00:07:13):\nBecause I think a lot of when we talk about product, it's like, oh, what should you build? What should you ship? But then you actually have to ship that and that can take a week, a month, three months, six months, a year. And so as a PM, your job is to stay on that and be the person who's beating that drum over and over again, and the best PMs are the ones who can do that and have the resilience and the energy to stay with it.\n\nLenny (00:07:38):\nEnergy. That's a really important part of that. I'm going to ask you how you suggest people get better at these things. So, either we can go into how you found you get better at simplifying or we go through all three and then we can come back, however you prefer.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:07:51):\nLet's just do all three really quick and then we can dig in.\n\nLenny (00:07:54):\nSounds great.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:07:55):\nSo, yeah, first one, simplifying. I think the second one has to do with this point about sticking with something and it's following up on results. So many people in the spec or the one pager or something will say, okay, here's the metric that I care about. Here's what I want to move. Awesome. Maybe they'll even write a SQL query, get a dashboard going, figure out what the number is today, that gets you some extra points, but the really, really good PMs remember to follow up. Because especially when you're in management, couple layers up in management, I'm not going to remember to follow up on that feature, but if a PM comes back to me and says, \"Hey, remember we did that thing, here's what happened.\" I can't tell you how rare that is and how many times as a leader you might have to ask for that and for the people you don't have to ask that of is one of the best things when I'm looking at PMs and it's easy.\n\n(00:08:43):\nIt's not hard to do that, especially if you've set up metric tracking or you know how to pull that information or you have somebody who can help you get that. It's pretty easy to do and it's really high value activity. And then the third thing, and I think maybe we'll talk about this later too, is that a phrase actually we were talking about David Cancel before we started carrying the water, and this was a big theme when I joined Drift, and this is about how you can't be a good PM if you're not willing to do the hard boring unglamorous work of customer support, sales, marketing, writing, copy, project management, you have to do that stuff. It's your job. No one else is going to do it, because at the end of the day, you're responsible for outcomes and results. So, you're the person that has to do that, and if you're willing to do that work, that's what's going to make your product successful, which is what makes you successful.\n\nLenny (00:09:33):\nIt's such an interesting list because when you ask most people what you need to get better at to become a great product manager, it's always communication skills, collaboration skills, vision, strategy, and it feels like these are input metrics to what it's normally what people think about.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:09:50):\nThose things to me, communication, super important, analytical ability, really, really important. The ability to look at a, especially if you're doing something that has a user experience component, the ability to look at that and understand if it's going to work and build up intuition around that, also really important. Those are things that I would see as sort of basics of the role. These are the things that make you great at the role and strategy to me, and hopefully we'll talk about strategy in a bit. It's one tiny slice. You do a strategy, but it's 5% of the work that you do. Yes, it's important because you want to get your strategy and you need to pick the right products, but at the end of the day, the person who has a good strategy will not be as successful as the PM who ships more stuff, gets more reps and has the ability to actually create impact. So, to me, you could be great at strategy, but if you're not good at this stuff and your stuff isn't getting out the door, you're never going to be that great at the job.\n\nLenny (00:10:48):\nAnd impact is the other one. Everyone's always like, what makes a great PM? Oh, drive a lot of impact. And again-\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:10:52):\nBut they never say how.\n\nLenny (00:10:54):\nRight, exactly.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:10:54):\nIt's like, cool, let's do a strategy, let's have impact. Then when I was starting off as a PM, I was hearing this advice and reading about it and I was sitting there saying, awesome, I want to create impact. And I'm looking at my job thinking, now what? Yeah, impact. Let's do it. Where is it? How do I find it? Someone help me.\n\nLenny (00:11:14):\nI love it. Okay, so let's go back to these three and I'm curious just what you found helps you become better at these things and also just an example if you can share. So, say what's simplifying? How does one build that muscle?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:11:27):\nThis is a tough one because some people, a broad generalization that I think comes up in things like when you're interviewing PMs for a job and you say things like are they a simplifier or are they complexifier? Do they make things complicated? And so some of it's a little bit of just who you are and how you think. But having said that, there's one tool that I use that I actually learned from my dad when I was in grade school, which is when you write something, for example, and a lot of what we do as PMs is written, when you write something, read it out loud, literally just read the thing you wrote out loud and half the time you'll realize it's way too complicated, it doesn't make sense. Or what happens is when someone comes to me and they say, okay, I'm working on this thing, check it out, can you read it?\n\n(00:12:10):\nI read it and then I put it down and I say, \"What are you trying to say?\" And 99% of the time they say, \"Oh, users are really struggling with this problem. We found this in research and we think that the way to solve it's to do X\", but that's not what the document says. And so my reaction is always, and if anyone who I've worked with is listening to this, they're going to laugh is always, \"Just say that. Just say that thing. The thing that you said to me in conversation is the thing you should write.\" There's no reason why your pros in a document has to be a certain way. We're not in school. Our goal is to get things done. So, those are just some simple tricks that I've used to help simplify what I've already been working on.\n\n(00:12:54):\nAnd as for how to boil things down and really find the most important thing to do, which is another part of simplification, I think the best thing you can do is just get as many reps in as you can, have people review your work and listen to them. There's a thing that happens I think with PMs where you join a company and then all of a sudden it's like my boss doesn't know what they're doing and the highest paid person's opinion and the founder wants to swoop in and mess everything up, but those people had an insight on the market that you're in that made the company worth founding and they probably know more than you and so you might want to listen to them. And so find people who can review your work, listen to them and ask them to help you simplify.\n\nLenny (00:13:39):\nI'll share a couple other things that came to mind as you were talking, because this is a very hard thing to teach and you kind of have to do it again and again and honestly, I have this one manager who taught me to simplify in my writing and strategy docs one-pagers and things like that, and I think that actually had a big impact on my newsletter success is learning just to strip down as much as you can and anything that isn't necessary. So, there's a couple things that I'll share real quick. One is there's this book I read called On Writing Well, that is one of the most impactful books for writing for me, and the whole book is like, I don't know, 20 chapters and every chapter is more things you should cut from your writing and they show all these examples of like, here's a before and here's an after.\n\n(00:14:18):\nAnd all these words were cut and nothing changed. They're completely necessary. So, I think that book can help and partly it's just like what is not necessary? You think all these adjectives are important. Another thing I found really helpful is the rule of thirds, I guess the rule of three, of just always having three. Try not to go beyond three when you're giving strategy bets or priorities or things like that. Just try to keep things under three.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:14:44):\nYeah, it's a very sort of business school ex-consultant point of view that I do agree with and share, which is there's always three things or fewer, never more than three things. You have to have a nice round couple and if you have a fourth, you've got to figure out how to squish it in there because it just doesn't look right if there's four.\n\nLenny (00:15:02):\nAgree. Yeah, even though I've been guilty of more than three, try hard to avoid it.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:15:07):\nYeah, you're using notion and you have your three bullets expanding and there's sub bullets, but at least you have that top line.\n\nLenny (00:15:13):\nThat's right. The other thing is I think that there's just a focus you need to get good at just like, people often want to lump together a bunch of ideas and then every time you do that it just dilutes everything. So, I think there's just a lot of power and pick the thing, pick the thing that's going to have the most impact and cut other stuff that may have some impact but is much less important.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:15:31):\nI think again, simplification is something and prioritization, which is sort of the same thing, gets tossed around a lot as a thing you have to get good at, but it's really challenging. Getting to the one thing you should do is extremely difficult and being able and having the gumption to say no to all those other things is really hard, because there's probably at any given time, 10 things you should do, but you can't do 10 things, you'll never be successful if you do that in a number of things. And so you have to pick one.\n\n(00:15:59):\nAnd so it's both figuring out how to get confident in your decision and then B, having the willingness, and maybe I should have added this to my what makes great PMs list, the willingness to make the bet and be responsible for it. And that's what I think separates the PM role from a lot of other roles and why it's such a challenging job when done right is because you have to be willing to take responsibility and it's your job to pick the thing and it's your job to be accountable to your team for picking the thing so you better get it right.\n\nLenny (00:16:32):\nOwnership such an important part of just being a PM. Again, coming back to this interview I just did with an ex Amazon guy, that's one of their principles at Amazon is just leaders, basically ownership, feeling like you have ownership of what you're working on.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:16:46):\nI agree, but to me at least the word ownership doesn't have the same oh shit feeling as you're making a bet. You make a bet, that means you know that there's a chance that the thing you're working on is not going to work out and you still have to be the one to do the thing, jump off the ledge, drop in on the ski run. So, ownership to me never signaled that risk that I think comes with being a PM.\n\nLenny (00:17:10):\nGood point. On the simplify concept, it reminds me at Airbnb, one of the core values at Airbnb for time was simplify. Is this idea that we should always try to be simplifying, and then it turned out the founders realized we're not actually great at this and it's unfair for us to say this is a value for not doing it. So, they actually cut it as a core value because their feeling was we shouldn't have aspirational values, we should reflect who we actually are, and they actually cut two different values to be more clear, even though they still want to simplify, they're just like, we're not actually good at this, so why are we pretending like we are.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:17:45):\nI think maybe I'm good at it on paper, but there's been many times where I've been in situations where things are not simple and you just have to keep fighting for it.\n\nLenny (00:17:54):\nSomeone's trying to think about, okay, I want to become better as a PM and I'm going to try to start simplifying. What are examples of simplifying? Is it reduce your email length? Is it one pager focus? What are these buckets of things? And then also if there's an example of something you've simplified that comes to mind\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:18:12):\nOn what to simplify and more specifics, I would say anything can be simplified and shortened. Maybe another way to say shorten it. Definitely emails. I read them sometimes don't love them. Make them short. The Minto principle is something that I would recommend everyone do, which is put the headline, the full conclusion first and then you're supporting argument second.\n\nLenny (00:18:36):\nI have a newsletter post about that exact concept that people that I will link in the show notes that gives you-\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:18:41):\nFantastic.\n\nLenny (00:18:42):\nThe Minto Pyramid principle.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:18:42):\nYes, everyone should do that. A lot of new PMs fall into the trap of thinking that they should have some sort of buildup. Don't do that. Just tell me whatever the thing is, everyone will thank you. Doing things like that, things like you said, limiting your strategy docs, your conclusions, your next steps to three things maximum. I would generally say a rule of thumb would be pretty much every doc you write, you can delete the first two paragraphs that you've written. You don't need them. My dad, again, to go back to my dad when I would write, and this sounds cruel, but I promise it wasn't. When I would write a paper for school, he would just, and this is we didn't really have computers, whatever, he would just take away the first page and he'd be like, just start here. He would go, \"Everything on the first page is crapola, don't use it.\"\n\n(00:19:30):\nAnd he wouldn't even read it, which would drive me crazy. He would just like, \"Oh, it's crap. I don't care about that.\" So, I would do that and then just get other people, there's probably somebody around you that's good and find people to edit your work and to look at it. I have a little Slack workspace that has three people in it, me and two other women who are product leaders, and we oftentimes send each other our work still and we say, \"Hey, I'm struggling with this. Can you read it? Help me make it simpler. Can you help me fix this up?\" And we do that for each other. So, find a peer maybe who's in a non-competitive space who can do that for you. I mean I still use those people to help me.\n\nLenny (00:20:10):\nThat is extremely cool. Can you talk more about this group that you have?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:20:15):\nYeah, I don't know if it's a group. It's like three friends. Shout out Alexa and Daphne. Yeah, I mean the three of us all worked together when we were at Drift. We've stayed in touch and I've just found that in order to be good at your job continuously, you need people who can help give you feedback, and the more senior you get, the harder that is. And so having people who can give you another point of view who maybe you can vent to if it's not appropriate as a leader who can give you other experiences that they're going through has been incredibly valuable. And so we just have a little group chat that is focused on product.\n\nLenny (00:20:49):\nThat is so cool. Is there a tip you could share for someone that wants to create something like this? Is it important for you to have worked with them before? Is Slack a good way to communicate? Anything there that's just like, oh yeah, here's a cool tip.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:21:00):\nSlack just worked for us where we are during the day, and I think having easy access to it was important. You could probably use WhatsApp or a literal group text. There are small community, there's one, I worked in healthcare for a year and a bit, and there's a Slack community that somebody organized for heads of products and healthcare startups that is similar to those really, really powerful and a really great space to be in. And so you just have to kind of suss out where these things are. You work with amazing people and there's people around you who are going to become your friends, and so keep an eye out for them and keep in touch with them when you leave a job because you never know when they might become your little Slack workspace.\n\nLenny (00:21:39):\nOh, I love it. Okay, I'm glad we talked on that. Okay, back on track. The second bucket you described as following up on results, is it just do that. Is there anything more you can add there?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:21:49):\nI put reminders in my calendar. I mean, yeah, it's just do that. But if you're launching a product, usually you release something and you have that initial push of a couple of weeks where you're finding bugs and you're maybe you're pulling metrics and everyone remembers it, then I would remember two weeks after that, a month after that, six months after that, put a reminder in your calendar to check your dashboard or check the metrics or check whatever it is that you were doing, and you won't forget and then share them with whoever might care about it. And it's as simple as that.\n\nLenny (00:22:20):\nAnd is the reason this is one of the three things you think are most consistent across great PMs, that it helps your manager see you like, wow, Maggie's so on top of everything, or is it more that you learn from that experience and drive more impact or is it both?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:22:36):\nIt's definitely both. I'm not going to pretend like if you're just great at your job quietly that you're going to get what you want. Just if you're toiling in the background, doing a great job getting results. If you have a great manager, maybe you'll be successful. Great managers are few and far between, and I am of the opinion that I never wanted to rely on someone else to get what I wanted. And so I would always make sure to share that, always make sure to share my progress because I didn't want to leave it up to chance that someone would notice. So, I would suggest doing it for both reasons. And that's one of those things that people want to pretend that everything's perfect and we're all great and we're always going to get what we want and always going to get that promotion, but you have to work for it.\n\nLenny (00:23:22):\nI love that point. It reminds me what I find one of the most important traits of a great product manager is they create this aura that they've got this, they put something on their plate and they're not going to drop it, that the threads are not going to be forgotten. And this connects to me there. They feel like Maggie's going to tell me what happened with this experiment. I don't have to think about it as a manager.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:23:45):\nYeah, that's a really good point. And then you mentioned this a little bit ago, the side benefit is that you learn more. You will go back and learn why something happened or why it didn't happen, and the more that you follow up on what you've been doing and the more you learn, the better you get every time you ship something. To me, the other answer of what makes a great PM is family shipped a lot of stuff. The more you ship, the more you learn. And that's why it can take years to build up expertise because you just have to ship a lot of stuff.\n\nLenny (00:24:19):\nThere's a lot of people that are always frustrated. They're not getting promoted quickly enough as a PM. They're not moving off the ladder like, oh my god, I've been a PM for two years. I'm not a senior PM yet. Can you speak more to just that thought and just how long it takes to get actually good? I guess I'll share briefly in my experience, it took me four years to actually know what the hell I was doing as a PM and then things started to really take off. What's your experience?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:24:40):\nI would say similarly, it took a lot of years to feel confident that I knew what I was doing. My first PM job was a product management rotation job at TripAdvisor. I had no PM background. It was after business school and I left those two years thinking, yeah, I've worked on four different teams over the two years. I've shipped all this stuff, I'm good. Went to a startup, there was another product person there, they left and I was the only product person at the startup. And I realized really quickly, I had no idea what I was doing. I had no one to learn from. I had only had two years of experience and I was not ready for that job. I didn't feel confident in the decisions I was making. That's why I joined Drift is because that team had all these really incredible product thinkers on it and they were shipping all sorts of stuff. They had all this momentum and I thought, okay, that's where I'm going to go to learn.\n\n(00:25:29):\nAnd so then two more years. So, that's five years until I really felt like I knew what I was doing. And that's because it takes a long time to ship stuff. And so to people who want to progress, you can progress by job hopping, you can progress by going in and out of startups. But to me staying at that, when I was at Drip, I was there for almost four years. I got to see two or three cycles of the same product and I learned more from that than I did out of the year or so I spent doing other things each at a time because you got to see the consequences of your decisions and that's rare. And people, myself included, of course you want to get promoted, of course you want to move up. I'm ambitious. Lots of people are ambitious, but for better or for worse, spending the time is really helpful and I think allowed me to move faster later because I had just spent the time grinding it out for a while in order to be better later.\n\nLenny (00:26:31):\nSo, is that advice you often give of go deep into a company or a product versus just bounce and track a bunch of different companies or depends?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:26:39):\nIt depends. There are lots of really good reasons to bounce. I've done it, many people have done it, but I was surprised at how much I value that experience of having stuck around for a while and how much I learned from it was something I hadn't expected going into it, especially because you don't hear that point of view as much or as I wasn't hearing that point of view as much when I was thinking about the sort of arc of my career, but I'm glad that I did it. And then of course people always want to get promoted, always ask that question and my answer is always create impact and that can take time.\n\nLenny (00:27:16):\nAt my first job, I was there for nine years and then I started a company for a year and a half and then we sold to Airbnb, and then I was at Airbnb for seven years. So, I'm very much on that train of just, not that I intended for that to happen, but I definitely went deep and I think there's pros and cons, but there's so many pros to that, so many reasons. Okay. Let's talk about the last part, which is the third point you made, which is carrying the water, I think is how you described it.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:27:42):\nYeah. This one, there's no tips and tricks. It's just do the work. If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster, their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion.\n\n(00:28:17):\nBecause we touched on this earlier as a PM for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going. And it's hard work. It's really hard work to stay positive and to keep people amped for that thing. And part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. Let me grab that, whatever. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.\n\nLenny (00:28:55):\nIt reminds me of one of your lessons that you shared, in one of your podcast episodes. It was one of your PM lessons of 2021, and the lesson was, when in doubt it's your job as a PM, which I think relates very much to which it just shared. Can you speak to that?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:29:12):\nIt might actually make sense to put this in the context of the other roles that are part of the team. So, as an engineer, your job is to write the code to really reduce this down and build the thing and make it work to spec. As a designer, maybe your job is to design the thing, design the solution, design the user experience. Obviously there's lots more complexity in that role. Design your amazing engineering, your amazing TLDR, caveat, whatever. But as a PM, you don't have that thing, right?\n\n(00:29:41):\nIt's not like, oh, my job is just to write the one-pager. That's not true. Your job isn't just to pick the problem. Your job is to deliver a business result. And so you're uniquely positioned to have to fill in all the gaps because no one else is incentivized to do that. As an engineer, you can finish your work and hand it off and say, I did it, and the good ones care, but you don't have to care. As a PM, you're not going to do your job unless that problem gets solved for the customer or the user at the end of the day. And so your job is to make sure everything happens for that product.\n\nLenny (00:30:17):\nIt reminds me of another interview you did where you talked about how a lot of the PM job sucks. It's not as glamorous as people often think, and most of the job is these really boring, annoying things. I guess, is there anything you want to add there of just a lot of people want to get into PM, they're like, oh, I'm going to run the show. It's going to be so great. I'm going to be a product manager and tell people what to do. But that's not how it is.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:30:41):\nIt's just one of those things that people, and when I joined product, it was just sort of becoming a cool job. It wasn't the hot job on campus when I was in business school. That was more private equity, venture capital. And now there's a sense of cachet around it. But again, it comes back to that earlier point, which is you do get to do cool stuff. You get to decide what gets built. That's cool. You have a lot of ownership like we talked about. You could see it as you have a lot of power, but at the same time you're responsible.\n\n(00:31:12):\nAnd so with that comes this responsibility to get it right, to make the right bets, ship the right products, get them out the door. And so there's a lot of bullshit work you have to do. Again, project management is one everyone hates on. QA is a really good one. You should QA your products. That's great if you have a QA team, you should QA them. You should know how they work. You should implement with your customers, you should be able to sell them, you should be able to find users. All that stuff is stuff that you should be able to do, and none of it is above you.\n\nLenny (00:31:42):\nIf someone is listening and they're not a PM and they are not convinced to not get into product manager, they still want to become a PM, what is your best advice for selling that is trying to get into product management of how to actually break into product management?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:31:55):\nI thought about this one a lot and I consulted the Slack workspace team. Because it's been a long time since I've tried to get into product. And so I didn't know what was going on these days because it's hard and I don't know if things have changed. I went to business school and that's how I got in. There was a program that took MBA students. I think there are some entry-level programs out there, big tech companies, if you can get them, I think they're really hard to get because they're very few and far between. And so the most common two paths that I've seen are people who switched laterally within a company. Again, challenging but can be done. Or people who joined startups. So, when I was at my last startup, I did hire someone who was coming out of business school who hadn't been into product into a PM role. And I can't say I wouldn't do it because it was awesome and she was amazing, but it takes a lot of work.\n\n(00:32:49):\nThe reason why people don't do it is because as a manager, it takes a lot of work because there's so much that these people need to learn. And what we ended up doing is she and I spent four months working together in a WeWork in person to help her onboard really quickly into the role, which was so rewarding. And I loved every second of it, and I wish I could do that again and again and again. But to get that, she basically just hounded me. Christina, if you're listening, you emailed me a lot. We talked a lot and we waited until the time was right and then you finally convinced me to do it. So, I don't know. I don't if there's a reliable path that I can say this is what my advice would be other than try a startup network. See what you can do.\n\nLenny (00:33:33):\nAnd you've made up this point elsewhere, which I think is an additional key piece is once you have a PM title on your resume, everything gets easier. As a hiring manager, I'm just like, I look at a resume like, oh, they've never been a PM. This isn't the role. It's rarely that someone wants someone that's never been a PM.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:33:51):\nYeah. And I tell people, I do unsurprisingly talk to lots of people who either are in product or want to be in product. And that's one of the things I always tell them because if they're deciding between roles and they have an opportunity to do something, and my advice is always, if you can get someone to stamp you with the product manager role, take it. Because to your point, it's what we screen on. It's for better or for worse, it's just like you have to get that first job. And then once you get that first job, it all gets easier. You can get in and then you can talk about your experience because then the second question I have is, what have you shipped? So, it's like, have you been at PM before? What have you shipped? And it's fascinating how quickly people can't answer that question. And the people who can are always several steps ahead of the people.\n\nLenny (00:34:36):\nLet's shift topics and talk about product strategy. Many people are told you need to get better product strategy. You're not great at strategy. A lot of people are also just confused, what is strategy? How do I get better at strategy? How do we describe a strategy? And you have a really great explanation and overview of how to think about this stuff. So, I'd love to hear your take on just how do you actually write out and describe a strategy.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:35:04):\nSure, yeah. And another thing that happens, and I'll give the outline, but another thing I hear, especially as you get further in your career, and unfortunately if you're maybe an underrepresented person in tech, is that you need to be more strategic. And so that's feedback that almost always happens, especially if you're a woman in product, in tech who's knocking at the door of a leadership role. You've probably gotten that feedback. And so I made it my mission to figure out what the heck is this thing? How do I do it? How can I do it in a way that is demonstrable so that I'm never getting that feedback that's like, oh, she's not strategic. And so what I did was something that I kind of did in the background because I had an engineer who I worked with who really wanted to understand why we were doing what we were doing, and he was not satisfied with sort of a surface level answer.\n\n(00:35:57):\nAnd he was just pushing and pushing and pushing. And so what I did was I just wrote out a Google doc and I started with like, okay, and not fancy, these are just bullets. What is the mission? What is the point of the company? What are our goals? Maybe we have some sort of high level framing of what we're working on. And then I had this big section that was just the landscape. And in that section I put in what's going on with our business? What's happening with our products? What's our point of view on the market? Who are our competitors? A SWOT analysis, key risks that we might be facing. Just dump that all on paper. Then what are the current quarters business goals or however you do planning, what are the current things that your company's working on? Then I put in, all right, that's sort of the context that we're operating in.\n\n(00:36:44):\nThen I wanted to understand where are we. So what is an honest accounting of the current state of your product, the business overall, and then the specific area that you're working in. What works, what doesn't work? What are your customers saying? Bottoms up feedback, users, customers, teams, what are your support tickets? Get that all out on paper. And then really importantly, where are your technical hurdles? What are the big pieces of tech debt? What are your engineering and technical teams always harping on that they want to invest in? Are there some big things coming down the pipe that you need to think about? Just get everything on paper. And then usually in the process of writing all that down, you'll start to see, okay, I kind of get where we are. I kind of get what the challenge is. And then you write a section that's like, what's the opportunity?\n\n(00:37:34):\nFrom all of that, what's going to bubble up as the top one or two opportunities for your team? Where do you want to play? Where can you win? Where's the unique? Based on your unique competitive advantage, where do you think you all should be and why? And then based on that opportunity, what are the challenges? So, what's going to be the hardest about taking advantage of that? What has to be, another way to frame it is what has to be true about the world for that to work? That's a one that's been helpful. And then what would you do? Take a swing at writing down your solution, what you would need to build, how might it work? Anything that you have, this is where I would say three bullets, maybe what you might want to do and then a plan. If no one else had an opinion, how would you go about it?\n\n(00:38:26):\nHow would you sequence it? What would you do? How might you get the team to work on it? What would your team have to look like? How much would it cost to do it? All that you can start to layer in all that kind of stuff. And then I just share the doc. Share it with everybody. There should not be any secret. And you should be able to walk all the way from your company's mission down to the individual priority on your team and see the logic chain and why you got there. And if anyone doesn't agree with it, they can call out where their disagreement lands in that landscape. But at least then you've put everything on paper, you understand how you got to where you're going, and then you can have an argument about the different pieces and points of data and feedback that you're getting, but at least people understand how you got where you got. And then it doesn't become like, I don't agree with you. It becomes, I don't agree with this point.\n\nLenny (00:39:18):\nThis is such a cool way of doing it. By the way, is there a template that we can point people to that has this sort of-\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:39:23):\nThere's not, I've only ever done it in a loose Google doc and then it just grows and changes. I can maybe try to write up those bullets, but it's just like I just make headers and then I just start dumping content in it.\n\nLenny (00:39:36):\nYes, that's all people need. If you end up creating that before this comes out, we'll throw it in the show notes. And if not, people can just bother you on Twitter and ask Maggie, where's that template that we talked about?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:39:44):\nYeah, I'm happy to write it on a piece of paper and take a photo of it and send it around.\n\nLenny (00:39:49):\nThere you go. Just make it really grainy and an artifact. We found Maggie's template. This is awesome. So, I've never heard of a version of this with so much depth into the landscape, and I think that's so smart because so much of conflict and disagreement comes from you just don't have the same information or the manager, exec or whatever doesn't think you have the information. So, if you just lean into, here's everything that I know and here's what's happening, and if you disagree with this goal, tell me, and then it'll change the plan.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:40:17):\nRight.\n\nLenny (00:40:18):\nAnd yeah.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:40:18):\nPart of it's also that typically speaking, when you're doing a strategy, you're doing it at a higher level. So, I don't think every product needs a strategy. Every feature doesn't need a strategy for example, you don't need to do this if you're working on a tiny slice of a product and you have user feedback, don't overcomplicate it, just do the stuff that makes sense. But especially as I've gotten more senior in my career, the questions are bigger and the impact is broader and the timelines are longer. And honestly, it was also because I wanted to get it right. I didn't want to make a bet on something and put a bunch of resources against a problem and get it wrong. And so this was also homework that I wanted to do for myself to know that I was going to do the right thing. For some reason, I'm always paranoid that other people have more information or doing it better than I'm doing it.\n\n(00:41:11):\nSo, I was like, okay, I have to write it all down and then make sure I got it right and share it with everyone and make sure that they agreed with me so that I didn't screw this thing up. And it just was such a useful exercise that I kept doing it. And of course people don't read it. People only read a tiny section. You'll run into the same problems you run in with everything else, but at least I knew that I had done the work and if people cared to engage with it was there.\n\nLenny (00:41:33):\nSo, along those lines, I was going to actually ask, how long do you find this should be depending either on the timescale, say you're doing a quarterly strategy or a year, how many pages should this doc be as any guide?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:41:46):\nIt's long. It gets real long.\n\nLenny (00:41:48):\nWhat is long?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:41:53):\nThe actual content, I end up writing a summary to go back to the Minto principle. I end up doing the whole thing, then putting a summary at the top so that there's one, within the first, above the fold, if you will. You can kind of get the point and the suggestion on what I think we should do or what the strategy should be, should be customizable in that section. But it can go 20 pages just because if you really want to get deep in a competitor or there's interesting market dynamics, interesting technological changes that are happening. Sometimes I'm screenshotting other companies marketing websites and dumping that in there. And that might be some interesting comments. So, it doesn't have to just be words or it can be all kinds of different things that you might want to put in there.\n\nLenny (00:42:37):\nAnd you made the point that it's not like you expect people to read this whole thing. There's the summary that gives them a conclusion and in theory if they want to really dig into it, they can. But I guess how do you find that balance of writing everything and making it so long that no one's ever going to read it to like this is actually going to be useful to someone and plus here's a summary.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:42:58):\nIt comes back to the reason why I write the document in the first place. And that's for me. So, it's my homework to do my job effectively. I just make sure to share it. And I find that my, especially my engineering and design counterparts, if you're working in a true triad, will almost always engage really deeply on the doc because they're pretty much also on the line and they want to make sure that when they sign their teams up to do whatever it is that they believe in the thing that you're working on.\n\n(00:43:28):\nAnd so I find that those people will engage pretty deeply. Sometimes you'll have more junior folks on the team that'll just be interested and they'll get really into it too. And then there's some people that'll skim the upfront part and either say, yeah, that looks great, or You're dumb, I hate this. And okay, sure. There's always those people. So, it never really mattered to me that people read the whole thing. It was more I knew I had to do it to be confident in my own decisions and then I could facilitate a conversation, so it didn't really matter.\n\nLenny (00:43:58):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alumni of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.

Is there an example of a strategy you were thinking about recently or that you worked on in the past just to give people something concrete of like here's what Maggie thinks of as a question she's going to develop a strategy around?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:45:28):\nYeah, I think, obviously this is where product content gets really challenging because obviously I can't really talk about the stuff I'm currently working on.\n\nLenny (00:45:36):\nJust tell us all of the secrets. And that [inaudible 00:45:38] know.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:45:38):\nThe toast PR department would be really unhappy with me. It's questions like, if you're a director of product somewhere, maybe you're running a section of a business and it's annual planning. We're in Q4. What are you going to do next year? How do you answer that question? How do you back up your choices for that? You use a doc like this. Maybe you are realizing that the product that you're working on doesn't really matter, it's not really making an impact. You're kind of treading water. I would use this as a tool to figure out, okay, well what else could you do? So, yeah, quarterly planning, annual planning. If you feel like your team needs to make a pivot or if you think that there's a really interesting new opportunity that your business or your team should go after, is another time I might use something like this.\n\nLenny (00:46:30):\nAwesome. This reminds me a little bit of, I keep mentioning this chat with Bill Carr that I had who is an early Amazon exec and how the narrative approach at Amazon, one of the benefits of that and the reasons they go there is partly for you to realize this is a bad idea before anyone even needs to give you feedback. And that's why they force you to write six pages in depth about your idea and then it goes in these concentric circles through the company. And idea is like, here's okay, and this is just not a good idea. Here's all the reasons why. So, I think there's a lot of similarities there.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:47:00):\nYeah, there are many, many times when if you combine this artifact and process with the point about simplification where through that process you just start cutting so many things because then what happens is, let's say you've gone through this exercise and you're like, okay, I know exactly what my three things are that I want to work on. Then there's a moment where you take the strategy and then you look at your roadmap and they're never the same. And the roadmap is just bloated with all of this random stuff that like, oh, well, we have to do that because of this, or we have to do that because of that.\n\n(00:47:37):\nThis thing we're still working on, this is like six months delayed, so we're still going to do the thing. And then all of a sudden you've got 90% of your resources committed to things that don't track against your strategy. And it's a really interesting moment as a leader especially to sit there and go, well, what do we do? What do you do when you have that problem? And especially if you're a PM, you probably don't have the agency to say, scrap the entire roadmap and work on my new strategy. But at least it allows you to think about critically about whether you should be doing what you're doing and allows you to evaluate whether those things are still the most important things to work on.\n\nLenny (00:48:09):\nI'm going to summarize the template real quick, and then I'm going to have another question kind of along the lines. So, if you're trying to create your own little template, you start with the mission of the business, and then I imagine you also share the mission of your team because oftentimes it's a little more specific, if you're working on it like a product team strategy. Then there's a landscape of what's happening. So, you include competitive, SWOT analysis of competition risks, product state, business state, things like that.\n\n(00:48:38):\nAnd then you share the current goals of what you're trying to achieve as a team slash business. And there's an account, honest accounting of what's happening in the product and technical hurdles and things like that that'll keep you from moving, I guess, achieving some of these goals. And then you share, here's the opportunity I see, how we win and how we actually achieve this opportunity where we place bets and things like that, or we could place bets. Then challenges of doing this, what needs to be true for this to be possible? And then you finally get to, here's what I think we should do, essentially the solution, ideally three bullet points, and then the plan. And I imagine the plan is step one, get sign off from exec. Step two, resource the team. Step three, start on this design research sprint.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:49:26):\nPretty much.\n\nLenny (00:49:26):\nAwesome. All right. Amazing. Somebody will create this template if you don't end up doing it.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:49:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:49:32):\nThere's another-\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:49:32):\nI hope somebody does.\n\nLenny (00:49:34):\nOkay. That'd be awesome. If they do, I will tweet it and we put it in the show notes.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:49:34):\nGreat.\n\nLenny (00:49:39):\nSo many promises already from this podcast. Along the same lines, you also have a one-pager template and process that I think people find really useful. So, how about we chat about that one briefly and then I'm going to go in a whole different direction.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:49:52):\nOkay. Yeah, I don't think I have much to say about this. That has not been said by many people many times, but whether it's a spec, a PRD, a one pager, I don't even know what else people call it. It's the document that you use to define the thing that you're doing as a product team, and that means product design, engineering, your little squad. And what I think is really useful about this process is that it's the PM's artifact. So, designers produce designs, engineers write code. What do PMs do? A lot of people might say nothing. In theory, we write at least this document and it can be a pain. I've seen lots of ways where it hasn't been done very well, but when I think it's done really well and when it's really effective is it's a tool that allows the PM to start with why. And if you structure it correctly, the most important section in my opinion in the document is the first part, which is like what is the background and context?\n\n(00:51:00):\nWhat is the problem, why does it matter and why does it matter now? And if you get those things right, the rest gets really easy, but it gives you a chance as a PM to center the team around the problem, why that problem exists, whether it's created by your own product or it's something the user is experiencing and why that problem is worth solving. That's a part that I think people sometimes forget to think about and why it's we're solving right now versus all the other problems you could be solving and then it can become the home base of the decisions that you make along the way. So, I think it's best when you have those sections and then also best when you write down on this day, we made this decision or we decided not to do this or we decided only to solve this part of the problem, not this part of the problem. Keeping a running list of that and a link off to all the different artifacts and research and things is helpful for a team.\n\nLenny (00:51:52):\nSo, just to summarize, what would be the headings again, just if someone's taking notes and wants to create the rule template?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:51:57):\nI don't think these templates have to be really complicated. It's like background and context. The problem. I would literally write why this problem matters and why this problem matters now. Don't make it complicated, just answer those questions and if you can do that, and then again, it's only really helpful if then you bring that document before you go any further to your team and you use it to have a conversation and you get the smart people around you to take shots at it. I should have mentioned this earlier with the strategy. The first person I go to is typically speaking my engineering counterpart and I say, shred this, go through it, rip it apart, vomit comments on it, tear this down how it gets better. And as a PM you can't be precious about your work. You need people to poke holes in it.\n\nLenny (00:52:48):\nThe why this matters now point is so interesting. I don't often hear that and I think it's such an important part of specs and plans and strategies because there's so many things you can do and there's certain things that are perishable that you can only do now. That if you don't do now you miss up the opportunity. And so I think that's a really interesting element that most people don't include and it reminds me of, I think I've done enough podcast episodes now where I'm just connecting all these things as people are talking. [inaudible 00:53:16] the John Nash thing happening where Karri, the founder of Linear talked about this concept of side quests as a founder. Because he's so good at staying focused and I was just like, \"How do you stay focused and just get stuff done when you have so many people coming out?\" He's just like, \"There's the main quest and then there's the side quests and side quest I don't need to do right now. There's the main quest which is build up really successful business.\" And I feel like this is a good example of that in action.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:53:39):\nYeah, I love his take on quality and taste too.\n\nLenny (00:53:43):\nYeah. What a gem.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:53:44):\nYeah, big fan of that. But yeah, I mean it's really hard to stay disciplined, it's hard to stay focused and to your point, there's a million things you could do at any given time, especially if you work at a bigger company. And so the why now is an important question to answer because if not, somebody's going to ask you. So, you may as well think about it.\n\nLenny (00:54:02):\nYeah, it's interesting why now comes up a lot in investing in startups but rarely in product building and it feels like it should. Although I will say in the research I've done, why now ends up not being that important for startups being successful or not. So, I think there's a two sides to that coin. Anyway, I'm going to move on to a different topic and this might become a new thing that we do and I'm going to call it contrarian corner. I asked you if you have contrarian opinions about things before we started recording this episode and you had some really good ones. So, there's a couple topics I'm going to chat about and we'll see if this becomes a recurring theme and you're laughing and nodding your head, what are you thinking as I say this?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:54:39):\nI'm thinking about when I had a podcast, you would do a show on a topic and we would click the end recording button and then every single guest would be like, I had no idea what I was doing. I made it all up, it was waterfall. None of that matters. I didn't know what I was ... People would say the wildest stuff and I would sit there as a PM and just think what. We just talked about this framework, we just talked about this thing and that's how you're supposed to do it. And then they would get off the official part and just say, yeah, it's wild. Nothing goes the way you want it to go. We're all just kind of making it up as we go. And so I hope that you get more of those takes in this part of the show.\n\nLenny (00:55:18):\nI'm very sensitive to that point right now because someone just tweeted about how they're just finding that many of my newsletter posts about how companies write product are the ideal version of what they do and I rarely or they rarely share, here's all the challenges we're having, which I think there's truth to that, but I also get into a lot of failures on this podcast. Actually, I think the podcast is a lot more of just here's things that go wrong versus the newsletter. So, I'm just like shit, I need to do more of that. So, I love that you mentioned that and let's see what we can get into. But I guess maybe before we get there, is there an example of something that didn't go just along the lines of some sort of failure slash mistake?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:55:59):\nI might be foreshadowing, but a question I ask in every product interview is what's the worst product you've ever shipped? And that's because I don't think you're a good PM if you haven't shipped something that's really shitty, you just haven't had enough reps, you haven't done it enough time. And it's not only that you've done it but that you can admit it and which one it is. That's so important. And I remember, it was so dumb, I'm still so mad about this, that we did this. I won't name which team, which company, I'm not going to call that out, but we decided we needed to do a rewrite, red flag number one of a existing product and engineer who I'd worked with many times. We had a really good relationship and this person was like, yeah, yeah, it's going to take six months, no problem.\n\n(00:56:47):\nCore part of the product been around for forever. One of those things that the code is still, it's still the code written by the founders kind of thing. It didn't take six months, it took two and a half years. It still wasn't done. It almost never, it went on for so much longer than it should have. It took us forever to get to feature parody. It was the worst project. So, many people rotated in and out of it. Everyone thought it was dumb, sunk cost fallacy, just the worst. And it's because A, we got arrogant and we thought we could do it. B, we skipped discovery. We didn't really write a one-pager, we just went for it. We didn't do enough technical and design research into what the requirements would actually have to be. And there you have it.\n\nLenny (00:57:34):\nAnd did not work out or was it a huge success in the end and it changed the trajectory of the business?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:57:39):\nAbsolutely not. But you know what, I didn't get fired, so it's fine.\n\nLenny (00:57:43):\nI feel like I've gone through those experiences and then three, four years later it's like another, maybe this rewrite and redesign may work because we haven't updated this thing in a long time.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:57:52):\nJust don't do it. Don't rewrite. If anyone ever tells you to do a rewrite, don't do it. A side by side re-write, nope.\n\nLenny (00:57:59):\nYeah, what I run into is once you get too far down a redesign slash rewrite everyone's building in that new world and then you launch an experiment's negative and then it's just like, oh, we just got to launch it. We're going to claw back. We're going to get figure out how to get back to neutral someday.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:57:59):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:58:15):\nYeah.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:58:15):\nYeah. Don't do that.\n\nLenny (00:58:16):\nGood times. Okay, well maybe we'll start a failure corner. That could be a new segment. We may have a little sound and theme music, but this time we have contrarian corner and you have a couple contrarian opinions about a couple topics. The first is product management. What is something that you believe about product management that maybe other people are less convinced by?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:58:39):\nThe one I like to have in this area is that people who are really excited about being data-driven, to me that is oftentimes a red flag for their product thinking, especially if it's an executive who's saying things like, oh, so we make all our decisions with our dashboards. To me that says that the team is over-emphasizing quantitative data at the expense of qualitative data and they're not using good judgment. They probably don't do a lot of direct user research. They don't really understand the humans who are using the thing, what they need, what they care about, and they're managing via a dashboard. And maybe if they got really, really good at picking metrics, it would be fine. And oftentimes maybe it is fine. Maybe you have a high volume business that's really easy to run experiments on and that works for you. But most PMs, most jobs, most products, you're going to be better off talking to 10 users and you'll get more and better insights out of why things are happening than you would with any dashboard.\n\nLenny (00:59:51):\nSo, the takeaway there is just be careful when someone is saying they're super data-driven. Our team is super data-driven or company company's super data-driven.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:00:00):\nYeah, and maybe it's true and that's great. I am not saying that you don't need data. You absolutely do need to instrument your products and understand if it's working at scale, but you can't forget that, you need to know why. It won't tell you why anything is happening. If you don't understand why it's happening, I don't think you can come up with good insights about what you should do next. One quick story on this. I remember really early on in my career, Adam Medros, who was a VP [inaudible 01:00:24] at TripAdvisor, we were in a room, just had this meeting called product review that was amazing when I first joined and someone was justifying this project and he just, I hope he is okay with me saying this because this is my memory of this moment.\n\n(01:00:38):\nHe was just like, this is an obviously better thing. Just do it. Stop. Stop it. Stop doing all the stuff that you're doing. Stop with these numbers, whatever it was that they were doing, if it's obviously better, if it's logically better, use your good judgment and do that thing and let's move on. And I've always thought about that, but you can just do the obviously better thing.\n\nLenny (01:00:58):\nYeah, I love that I pull that card sometimes, but I think you almost have to do it that way of just like, okay, everyone, this one's just obviously a good idea. Let's just do it. Enough research. Okay, another topic that you have some interesting opinions about his product content very close to our hearts, both my heart and your heart. Do share.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:01:20):\nReally if you're going to make good content, you have to sanitize and frameworkize the thing that you're working on. And then slowly, I think for a lot of people who are reading it and looking at it, their thinking starts to become, well look how well I did this framework. Look how well I implemented this thing. And they lose touch with the point which is creating impact. And so all of this content makes it really noisy and then makes people think that, oh, if I just do these things that I'll get what I want. And now I'll just check off my list and then I checked it off and then I should get my promotion at the end of the day. But it's like the best PMs have built up so many different frameworks and they can apply them in different ways. And then sometimes they throw them out and they say, nothing I have in my toolkit makes sense for this moment, but I know what to do because I have intuition and I have data and I've talked to users or whatever.\n\n(01:02:16):\nAnd so content sometimes can get in the way of the impact because you're trying to apply it and you think that the point is the framework and the point is the one pager or whatever it is that you're doing when it's not. And then if you're a leader and maybe if you've had the good and ill fortune of having published content, someone comes to you and says, well, you said in that one podcast episode that you don't believe in roadmaps, so why are you asking me for a roadmap? And then you're the who's sitting there being like, well, it's a little more complicated than that. And that was a fun take that I had, but I actually need to understand what we're doing because planning and I need to figure out what my budget is, blah, blah, blah.\n\nLenny (01:02:52):\nThat's so funny that I didn't think about you as a leader having put stuff out that people put back at you. And I think your point about one for you, for people to consume content online about how to do product management, you have to really distill it. And to your point, it often loses the nuance. Because if you had all the ones, no one's going to even read it so complicated and long. And then the other point of there's also just it has to be interesting. So, if it's another just like, here's how a roadmap really is successfully and it's like what everyone's already done, no one's going to read it. So, you always have to have a new take. And with that comes, it's not actually always true. I just wanted people to react to this idea.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:03:32):\nYeah, I mean it's helpful. I think there's some people who create, I mean there's many things at my last role, we all had your newsletter and we listened to the show and then people would bring, I should have found a clip, but I can't remember, there were a couple of moments where we would listen to a piece of it or find an article and say, oh, this could help. Or what if we did it that way? I think there was a newsletter article about Figma and they had some templates. They're like product review template for FigJam. Love that one. Use that one all the time.\n\nLenny (01:04:06):\nAmazing.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:04:06):\nSo, yeah, I mean the stuff's really useful. It's just like you have to be smart about when you apply it. And then if you're a leader and there's all this content available, you have to know why you're not following the rules.\n\nLenny (01:04:18):\nIf they're just like, hey, look at this newsletter post letting you write, we should be doing it this way. Versus I think people assume these are the one way to do it or innately will work at your company. And I really like your point, which maybe counter to what I do, but I think it's an important nuance that I feel like I should add to every newsletters. This isn't necessarily going to work at your company. Sometimes the culture is different and this won't fit or this isn't a complete version. As much as I try to give people, here's everything you need to do this thing well, there's always a little bit missing\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:04:55):\nAnd I think if you don't have that context, it can be a little demoralizing like, well, how am I ever going to do that thing that they get to do at this magical company? But again, if you view it as more like here all the tools that you can add to your toolkit and you pull them out when you're in a situation from which they can be useful, that's how I think about it. Versus this is the one way to do it like you said, the only way you can write a one page or the only way you can write an experiment, it's more like you can do it in many different ways.\n\nLenny (01:05:19):\nAnd I find myself, I'm not actually, I rarely tell people here's the way to do it. Usually what I try to describe is here's how the best companies do it, as much as I can get into and leave it to the reader to decide is this going to be a fit for me, should I try to implement it? But still, I think there's an implication. This is the way to do research, here's the way to do roadmap, here's the way to prioritize. But I think it's interesting that you also, yourself create a lot of content and you actually found a lot of value from being, let's not call you content creator because I don't like being labeled as a creator myself.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:05:55):\nSomeone one's called me a product influencer and I'll died like a little bit.\n\nLenny (01:05:59):\nThat's how I feel. I'd love to hear just the impact you've seen from spending time creating podcasts and blog posts and tweeting about really great stuff because a lot of people are thinking about investing in this stuff.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:06:11):\nYeah, it's probably the best thing I've ever done for my career and I am so grateful for the people whose idea it was, who supported me and especially at Drift, when that became such a part of what we were doing at that time. And it's been helpful for a couple of reasons. One is just networking and access. I probably wouldn't be here today if I hadn't done that and if a friend of a friend had read the thing, it's like it just creates so many more connections. And so access to people and networking is one of the first benefits.\n\n(01:06:51):\nAlso building a personal brand is really helpful if you want, one of the things that I always wanted to do with my career is try to make it so that I'm always employable. I just didn't want to, I'm an 08 grad not to put my age out there, and it was a hard time. And so I've always had this in the back of my mind, you want to be able to have a solid career. And so I thought that investing in my personal brand would be a way to help me get access to roles. It helps in recruiting as well when I'm trying to hire people. Because a lot of my job now is bringing people in and because I've been vocal about how I like to work and who I am, a lot of people and they will send me a note and say, I want to work with you, or I want to work on a team like that.\n\n(01:07:35):\nAnd that's huge because if my job is to hire people, then that's great and people can get a sense of who I am without needing to be on the phone with me. My favorite benefit outside of those things has been that it's helped me learn more from the work I've done than I otherwise would've been able to. Because in order to make content, you have to think through what you did, you have to summarize it, process it, make it interesting for people. And then especially if it's in a podcast meeting, talk to somebody about it. And the process of doing that means that you're paying attention to what you're learning along the way. And so often we don't do that because we're busy working, we have our lives, things are happening. And that to me is, I think what's made me a better product person faster is because I spent the time to think about what I was doing in a way that I wouldn't have if I didn't have to write something down.\n\nLenny (01:08:28):\nSomething that comes across in your content that you've somehow figured out is to avoided being cringy and very thirsty for followers. And I think when a lot of people here build a personal brand, it's like, I don't want to.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:08:44):\nI know. It makes me ill even saying that, it's like too gross.\n\nLenny (01:08:47):\nI never thought of it or wanted to think of it that way. And I'm just curious what advice you'd give to people that want to go down this route without feeling, I guess one, is just feeling like they're being cringey, and two, avoiding content people be like, oh my God, I can't believe this stuff [inaudible 01:09:02].\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:09:02):\nYeah, the clickbait tweet thread situation. I think the step one's going to be cringe. Your first 10, 20, however many posts are going to be bad. I would imagine if you went back and listened to your first episode, you would be cringing just because you've learned so much since then. Right?\n\nLenny (01:09:02):\nYeah.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:09:22):\nIt's natural.\n\nLenny (01:09:23):\nAlthough randomly the first episode ever is the most popular episode. So, with [inaudible 01:09:29], which I could see why it was so popular.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:09:30):\nSo, it went really hot with your first guest.\n\nLenny (01:09:34):\nThat's right. That's right.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:09:35):\nSo, yeah, first get over the fact that it's going to be cringe. It's going to be cringe. Like anything, you just have to get started and it'll fade away eventually and you don't have to think about it. Two B, this is such gross advice, but you have to be authentic. It has to be real. And I think what came through in the show that I did was those were my real questions that I was really working on.\n\n(01:09:59):\nSo, we joked about how we would turn off the recording and then we would get the real story, but I would turn the recording off and I would say, okay, we talked about this thing. Here's actually happening in my job today, what would you do? And so those were real questions that I had, real processes that I was working on and real advice that I needed at that time. And I think that's why it was valuable is because I was actively a PM and the way that I'm still actively in product, that was always something that I wanted because it meant that the content had to be relevant for me and wasn't just for likes and share.\n\nLenny (01:10:34):\nI think there's some two really important points there that stood out to me. One is your stuff's going to be terrible if you don't actually have any background or experience in the things, you're just pretending. It's like you're acting like someone that knows about this thing, but you don't actually. And so I think that's an incredibly important part of this is don't try to become an online creator person if you haven't done the thing, because people will see that you don't know what you're really talking about and you'll run out of stuff and it'll be like, okay, well I did it for two months and I have nothing more to say.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:11:03):\nRight.\n\nLenny (01:11:05):\nAnd then the other piece is there's a guest who shared this quote that has stuck with me from Einstein, which is something like, \"Seek not to be successful but of value.\" And I find that that's a really good framing for sharing stuff is just share things that are interesting to you and useful and come at it from this is useful, not from, I'm trying to build a following. Because people can tell if that's the-\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:11:30):\nYeah, people can absolutely tell. And the other thing is there's a little bit of too cool for school mixed in here and there are definitely people who will tell you your content is cringe or make fun of you or whatever because that's what they want to do. And I'm not even going to get into psychology of that, but people will do that. And I've always been of the mind that the really interesting people out there, people who are unashamedly interested in stuff and who are like, yeah, I'm nerding out about this and I'm sharing it because I'm interested in it. And for better for worse, I love working in product. I love the job.\n\n(01:12:08):\nEven all the gross stuff you have to do, it's super interesting. You meet really cool people, you get to ship stuff, you get to see the stuff get used by people and solve problems. It's a really cool job and I've always been interested in how to do it better and it doesn't matter to me that some people might think that's cringe because that's cool, but this is what I do all day long, so I'd like to get better at it.\n\nLenny (01:12:26):\nI think that's such a big part of it. I didn't even mention that. Just it needs to feel really authentic and clearly for you is just like, there's just stuff I want to share because it's really interesting to me.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:12:37):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:12:37):\nThe way I actually started writing was exactly the two reasons you just shared. One is I wanted to learn the thing and so writing helped me figure things out. And then two is I just thought it was interesting and I found it useful and I just assumed other people might find it useful. So, I did also learn, and I wonder if you found this too, is that you think the things are not going to be that interesting or useful to people, so basic for you, but people find the most basic stuff so interesting. Because there's always more to learn about how to roadmap, how to prioritize, how to hire, how to talk, to have difficult conversations, performance review.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:13:15):\nAll of that is absolutely true. And I think one of the first pieces of content that I was really happy with was I was working with somebody and they were making a PowerPoint presenter slides or whatever, and I just wrote out in my notebook like, okay, here's how I do that. I start with an outline on paper and then I draw little boxes for the slides and I write out the headline of the slides. And then once I have a tight outline and I have the literal text that will go across the top of each of those things, then I sketch out how I want the slides to go. And then I go into Google Docs and I actually make the slide.\n\n(01:13:51):\nAnd it was like some silly little thing and this person sat there and said, holy, you just totally changed the way I did this and this took me 75% less time than it would've taken me otherwise. And I was like, I may do this dumb drawing. Why is this a big deal? And yeah, that's when I realized that the stuff that's easy for you might be a stuff that is most interesting because it's something that maybe you're really good at that you don't realize.\n\nLenny (01:14:13):\nI think people need to really internalize that point. If there's something that you're doing that you consistently find useful and works often, that is going to be really useful for someone to hear. So, that could be a good place to start. Maggie, we've gone through everything that I was hoping to get through and more, which is awesome.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:14:32):\nGreat.\n\nLenny (01:14:32):\nBefore we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share or touch on think might be useful to leave folks with?\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:14:41):\nMy hope is always that people listen to stuff like this and realize that it's messier than you think you can fail a lot and still be successful and that they should have fun. I think that gets missed in a lot of the product content is like, have fun, enjoy it. People are weird, people do weird stuff and you build stuff for people, which it makes it all very entertaining. So, I've always found a lot of joy in the job.\n\nLenny (01:15:04):\nAnd to your point of carrying the water as a PM where you're kind of doing all the things, it's like you can create that fun. You can make the team your own fun and change the culture, create the culture. I find that so underappreciated for PM.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:15:16):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny (01:15:17):\nOkay, well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:15:21):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:15:22):\nMaggie, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:15:27):\nFirst, most common one is probably the Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, the little tiny one, really great way to improve your speaking skills and your presentation skills and to get distracted executives to agree with the point you're making. So, that's one. Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke is the second one. Coming back to the point about being able to make bets, I think that one's a really interesting one. And then bonus third one, this is more like a desk reference that I now have on my desk, the Scaling People book by Claire Hughes Johnson. I really enjoyed the way that one is working and it just sits on my desk and I reference it every once in a while, especially as manager.\n\nLenny (01:16:11):\nI have it both under my laptop right where I'm sitting and then also way behind there and it's one of the most popular episodes I've done with Claire, so if folks haven't listened to that one. Highly recommend. She's incredible. Great choice. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:16:27):\nOkay, so my husband is in the industry, as we say here in LA, and so we watch a lot of good and bad shows in TV, but I think my favorite one that I've watched recently was Slow Horses. Gary Oldman is incredible. Highly recommend.\n\nLenny (01:16:43):\nWow, I haven't heard that one yet. Good tip. What is a favorite interview question you really like to ask which I think you already gave away, but let's touch on it again.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:16:51):\nI did. Yeah, it is what is the worst product that you've ever shipped? I think the best answers are ones, and I don't even care if someone listens to this and then I do this in an interview, people immediately laugh a little bit. They remember the horrible thing they did and then they share that horrible thing with you. And it tells me you have some humor, you're humble and you can point out when you've made a mistake. You've done enough to be able to confidently say, of course I've made a mistake. Because none of us are perfect. And you know how to spot those mistakes and you can learn from them. And I've always found that those conversations are the most interesting.\n\nLenny (01:17:29):\nWhat is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:17:33):\nOne because I've seen you on Twitter, you're a future fit guy.\n\nLenny (01:17:36):\nYeah, I'm.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:17:37):\nIs that correct?\n\nLenny (01:17:37):\nI use it three times a week. I love it.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:17:39):\nYes. I was also a future fit person. I think it's great. It's a great product. I'm now on Ladder Fit.\n\nLenny (01:17:46):\nI've heard of that.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:17:47):\nAnd personally, I love not being, I don't have to talk to the coach every day. I don't need the accountability, so that's not a thing that I needed as an ex athlete. So, for me, that didn't serve me and I like the anonymity of it and it comes with a totally unhinged group chat for your whole team. It's fantastic. I'm really enjoying it.\n\nLenny (01:18:07):\nSweet.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:18:08):\nSo, that's one more of a funny one. And the second one, not to get real niche, but I think good products are products that are focused. They do one thing incredibly well and they're not, to your point about side quest, there's no side quests. I'm a new mom. There's this app called Pump Log. I have never seen an execute so well on one problem. There's not a single thing where I think, oh, I wish it did this. It does it. It's like I paid $14 for it. I've never paid for an app like that in my life.\n\nLenny (01:18:40):\nOkay, I'm downloading it right after we finish. Do you have a favorite life motto that you either repeat yourself, often like to share with folks, find useful, and just kind of living life?\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:18:51):\nI'm sure there's mottos' I could say that would be aspirational mottos', but the real one is if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. And again, from being in sports to going to school to being in product, in my opinion, if you're going to do something, do it to the best of your ability because that's what you do with your day. You spend so much time working, you may as well be good at it or trying to get good at it. And that's always how I've lived my life.\n\nLenny (01:19:20):\nI so love that message. I always think about that. Final question, you are an Olympic speed skater, which I don't think people would know necessarily. That's insane. My question is there some bad speed skating that would surprise people that would be like, what?\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:19:38):\nOoh, that is one I've never been asked before. The whole experience, I've obviously learned a ton from it, and I think what might surprise people about being a small sport athlete is that you have to think in four or eight year chunks. And so it's one of those things where you grind for so long in a dark corner and then you get a chance to get the light to shine on you and you learn how to love the process. Especially for speed skating, I was a long track speed skater, it's a 400-meter rink.\n\n(01:20:15):\nYou just are always turning left and going in a circle. There's not a lot going on. It's just you and your thoughts and you just really, really learn how to get good at perfecting something over and over again, and you learn how to grind, you learn how to focus, and I think it's also cool you get to go superfast. But yeah, I don't know if that would surprise people about speed skating, but I think just about being a small sport elite athlete, it's really about years and years and years of toiling and silence to get maybe one shot at something great.\n\nLenny (01:20:46):\nSo, much of what you just said would apply 100% to product management and I love that. Maggie, you are awesome. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask you any follow-up questions, and then two, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:21:00):\nYou can find me on Twitter for sure. By LinkedIn, but just speaking of cringe, I just can't get into LinkedIn posting.\n\nLenny (01:21:09):\nLinkedIn's gotten better, I'd give it a shot. It's actually pretty interesting now, which sound weird to say.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:21:16):\nThinking about it, I better go back to work in a couple of weeks and thinking about LinkedIn. But yeah, Twitter for sure, LinkedIn for sure, and I've always tried to be helpful to other people, so I don't have an answer for how people can be helpful to me, my goal is really to share what I've been doing, the rooms that I get to be in, the access to the content and the people and the learning that I've had. So, hopefully I can find ways to keep sharing that.\n\nLenny (01:21:39):\nMaybe check out Toast and use Toast when they're at restaurants.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:21:42):\nOh yes, Plug, Toast. Come work with us. We're the best. I get to work with John Cutler. It's phenomenal.\n\nLenny (01:21:50):\nLegendary, previous guest. Are there roles you're hiring for just for folks that are listening and just like, hey, maybe I should go do that.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:21:56):\nThere are always roles that are open. I don't know what the most open roles are right now, but yeah, check it out. It's a great place.\n\nLenny (01:22:01):\nWilling to the careers page.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:22:03):\nAwesome.\n\nLenny (01:22:03):\nMaggie, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:22:05):\nThank you, Lenny. It was awesome.\n\nLenny (01:22:07):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

After leaving Uber, he spent most of his time working on a product to help people avoid getting COVID, called CVKey, and most recently he took on a role at Microsoft as Corporate Vice President leading many of their consumer efforts.\n\n(00:00:25):\nIn our conversation, we cover what he's learned about building successful consumer products, how to structure and higher product teams, building consumer apps, a concept called the consumer stack, company market fit versus product market fit, what it's like to be CPO, what he learned working at Microsoft versus Uber versus Google, and also a ton of career advice for anyone thinking about becoming a CPO someday. I hope that you enjoy this episode with Manik Gupta.\n\n(00:00:53):\nThis episode is brought to you by Mixpanel, offering powerful self-serve product analytics.

What do you love about Coda?\n\nCasey Winters (00:02:00):\nCoda is a company that's actually near and dear to my heart, because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, you know I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a Coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create OKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those Codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it. They're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.\n\nLenny (00:02:36):\nI actually use Coda myself every day. It's kind of the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts, organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode, and so many more things. Coda's giving listeners this podcast $1,000 in free credit off their first statement. Just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny.\n\n(00:03:03):\nManik, welcome to the podcast.\n\nManik Gupta (00:03:06):\nThank you, Lenny. It's great to be here, man.\n\nLenny (00:03:08):\nI don't know if it's obvious, but I am quite honored to have you on this podcast. You've had such an illustrious career as a founder leading the Google Maps team, as CPO at Uber for, I believe, four years. Now you're kind of a fancy VP at Microsoft on consumer stuff. It's this incredible career and trajectory. My first question is, looking back at your career, what would you say is maybe the one or two main things that you did that helped you get to where you are today? For folks that are maybe earlier in the career, of what they should be focusing on.\n\nManik Gupta (00:03:39):\nYeah. Thanks, Lenny, for having me. I'm also a big fan of yours, by the way. I love your newsletter and it's been incredible to just see how you have also grown both the set of topics that you cover and this podcast. Just really a big fan, so again, thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:03:54):\nAppreciate that.\n\nManik Gupta (00:03:55):\nLet me start by telling you a little bit about my philosophy of this. I'm maybe a little bit late to the party, but I recently read this book from Morgan Hausel on Psychology of Money. And I highly recommend your listeners read it if they get a chance. There's a chapter in there, he talks about luck and risk. What he says is, when you look at individuals and you think about, or you ask them, or you think about what they have done that have made them successful, we tend to put a greater amount of emphasis on effort and a little less emphasis on luck and risk. I think I strongly subscribe to that. The important thing when you look back is how much luck played a big part, and of course the risk that somebody took played a big part.\n\n(00:04:45):\nThis is something that I've been thinking a lot about myself, which is what are some of the patterns of people who have had multiple careers and have gone through a journey where they've learned a lot and they've contributed and things like that? I think there are two patterns that stand out, both when I look at myself in terms of what I've been through, and also when I talk to a lot of my friends who have also gone on and done interesting things, and I wanted to cover both of that. The first one is really about people. It's about surrounding yourself with the best people you can find.\n\n(00:05:16):\nIt was so funny. I was watching the Warriors game last night, and yeah Warriors, we won the NBA championship. That's great.\n\nLenny (00:05:22):\nGo Warriors.\n\nManik Gupta (00:05:24):\nOne of the reporters, I think she asked Steve Kerr, the coach, \"What's the secret?\" And he goes, \"Well just hang around superstars.\" That's what he said and he just passed the mic over to somebody else and said, \"Look, this is a team that's hanging around superstars.\" And that's exactly what it is. If you're create enough opportunities, especially early on in your career as you asked, around hanging around people who are doing interesting things and they're doing things which really are different, or they're doing things in a different manner and it's exciting, the right things will happen.\n\n(00:05:55):\nI was lucky in a way that I caught myself in that situation. I grew up in India and when I was 16 I got a scholarship to move to Singapore to do my high school and then my undergrad studies. It just turned out that during those days, Singapore... I mean it still is, but it was a melting pot for the best and brightest folks that you can get from all over the Asia diaspora if you will. Among my colleagues and my fellow students there were a bunch of really, really smart people, so I just learned a lot from them and that gave me a great start to just go on and do something interesting. Right out of college, I started my own company and I did that with two of my classmates. One of them happens to be one of my best friends whom I grew up with who also came on the same scholarship with me to Singapore. We were just part of that ecosystem and it gave me a lot of opportunities to try out different things in college and so on and so forth.\n\n(00:06:44):\nI think the main thing that I would say here for people who are early in career is just surround yourself with people who are really good at what they do. Learn from them. And by the way, play the long game. Once you find someone like that, stick to them. As long as they want to hang out with you, but just stick to them. Because you will go on to do multiple things over your career with the same set of people. And the shared trust and experience that you build with A plus people is just going to go a long way. Anyway, that's pattern number one. I think that has helped me a lot and I also see a lot of that in other folks whom I talk to.\n\n(00:07:19):\nThen the second pattern is... This is something I resonate a lot with personally, is I'm a strong technology optimist. There's always a lot of narrative these days around technology and maybe a little bit more pessimism, and I find that bizarre. I'm just such a strong technology advocate and optimist, because I feel technology's such a strong force for good. I grew up as an engineer myself, and I've always been attracted to projects where we can use technology to solve a real human need. I did that with my startup, I did that at Hewlett-Packard, I did that at Google and at Uber as well. The passion that you get if you're a strong advocate of technology and how it can really help, it just gets you to choose a set of things that you want to do at scale.\n\n(00:08:06):\nFor instance, when I joined Google in India to work on Maps, it was all about helping millions of users, around Asia particularly, navigate their world. There wasn't a good solution like that, so how can you bring technology to really solve those problems?\n\n(00:08:21):\nI think those are the two patterns, Lenny. One is surrounding yourself with A plus people, and the second is just having very strong optimism and passion about technology. At least if I connect their dots looking backwards, those are the things that have really helped me and a bunch of other folks that I see in a similar situation. I'm hoping that folks early in their career thing through that.\n\nLenny (00:08:40):\nI bet there's a big overlap between those two points, technology optimist and just superstars. That's interesting.\n\nManik Gupta (00:08:46):\nYeah, there definitely is. That's actually really good. I hadn't thought about that. You're right. I think there's definitely that overlap, because folks who are in that mode, they really get around more together. I'm also an angel investor and an investor in a bunch of companies. Lenny, you and I have invested in a bunch of companies together as well. And it's like that. It's really about people who have the same kind of frequency in terms of thinking about the world outlook and they want to go on to do interesting things. I think that's really what drives the narrative forward.\n\nLenny (00:09:14):\nSpeaking of technology optimism and technology in general, of the things that you've worked on, what would you say you're most proud of project wise, product wise, feature wise?\n\nManik Gupta (00:09:23):\nYeah. Again, I've had just the incredible opportunity to be part of phenomenal companies that have created world changing products. I had a small, small, small part to play in that. I always emphasize that. It's not me, it was a team. And I really mean it. I'm not just saying it because I'm on your podcast, but it truly is. I'm particularly proud of the work that I did both at Google and at Uber. I'll give you a couple of examples to illustrate that point.\n\n(00:09:47):\nWhen I joined Google in India in 2008, I started off working on Google Maps and I remember how counterintuitive it was for anybody; my friends and family, a bunch of other folks whom I talked to. Counterintuitive in terms of why would anybody ever use maps on their mobile phone in India? The reason was because the norm was that, firstly, the country's unmappable because there's no good addressing system. So how do you even look at places? Then the second one was there were always people around that you can just roll down your car window and just ask people, \"Hey, I'm going here and can you just give me guidance or directions?\" That was the norm. That's how people navigated for a really long time.\n\n(00:10:32):\nWhen I started working on it, I think for me, my belief was, again going back to the tech optimism aspect, is why can't we in India have the same quality maps like we have in the United States? Why not? Why shouldn't we do it? Why are users here not getting the same benefit and same productivity gain, if you will, and less stress in their daily commute and things like that?\n\n(00:10:55):\nSo we started building it. We started building the data. We went ahead and really mapped the country as much as we could. Both ourselves and through a lot of amazing work from our users who co-mapped the world with us. Over time, India became, I think, the second largest country for Google Maps in the world in terms of users. Of course, a lot of that happened because of Android. Android took off and Android had Google Maps on it. But it's just incredible to see how, in a short span of a few years, it just went up to becoming so useful. It's not that we were just distributing Google Maps on Android, people were using it. People were actually using it to go from point A to point B.\n\n(00:11:35):\nI feel really proud about that. I think the team did an incredible effort. It wasn't even a big team. It was a relatively small team, very passionate about going and doing this, and we made that happen.\n\n(00:11:43):\nThen at Uber, initially, before I took on the CPO role, I was leading maps and marketplace. When I was doing maps and marketplace, again, how do you get the ETA that you see on Uber when you open the Uber app and you request a car... The average ETA's went down to less than five minutes globally. Just think about that for a minute. In fact, it was 75 countries, more than 300 cities, if I remember correctly, where you could just open the Uber app and get an Uber in, average, less than five minutes. A lot of operational work need to happen for sure, but the technology, the marketplace technology especially to be able to connect the right rider to the right driver, have the mapping infrastructure underneath it to ensure that the car actually reaches you in that amount of time; I just feel very proud of all the work that happened during that time to make Uber really successful in terms of providing that kind of a service.\n\n(00:12:37):\nOne fun anecdote I'll give you where my world came together and it just blows my mind even today, I remember I joined Uber in late 2015 and I made a trip to India to see my parents in sometime around 2016, 2017. I forget. It was around that time. And I was at home in Bangalore and I ordered an Uber. And the guy shows up, the driver comes in, and I sit in the back of the car. He starts the trip using the Uber app, and then he clicks Navigate and he goes to Google Maps. And I was sitting there. I was like, \"Man, I built these two to a certain extent.\" It was just crazy to think about how two of my worlds came together at that point. I still vividly remember that moment where I felt really proud that I had a little bit of a part to play in both those products.\n\nLenny (00:13:26):\nThat is some unbelievable impact. It boggles my mind how many people have been impacted by the work that you've done on the teams that you've been on. Like a billion people in India and everyone in the world using Uber. It's unreal. I would feel very proud myself, watching that experience.\n\n(00:13:41):\nSomething people may feel when they see a career like yours, they're like, \"Man, Manik's just killing it. He's done everything. Everything just is clicking, always winning.\" I imagine there's been a few times when you've made mistakes or things have been really challenging. What would you say has been one of the more challenging projects or points in your career?\n\nManik Gupta (00:13:59):\nYeah. No, absolutely. This is really important to talk about as well, because we glamorize successes and we don't talk enough about challenges. I'm really happy that you're asking this. I would give you two times which... I had a lot of learning from both of them, but they were pretty tough times for me. The first time was, I had started my own company at the height of the dotcom boom. We incorporated our company in June '99, and then in March of 2000 we sold our company to another company from Norway. That was the peak of the dotcom boom. Then within a few months right after that, we had the dotcom bust and it was terrible. Terrible. I know we have a pretty bad economy right now. There's a lot of stuff going on. It was really bad, because people around me, my friends, were losing their jobs.\n\n(00:14:52):\nLuckily we had some funding. We had secured some of our funding and we had had an acquisition. The parent company was pretty strong in terms of their balance sheet, so we could continue to do it. But things didn't get better, Lenny. 2000 went by, 2001 came in. We kept waiting for things to improve, but they never improved. So we had to pivot. We had to pivot as a company. My co-founders actually left the company at that point. I still wanted to be there, because I really believed that I can keep moving this company forward. Then I was working with the founders of the parent company. We pivoted multiple times, we tried a few things. I even relocated back from Singapore back to India to set up an engineering office so that we can get into a SaaS kind of a model versus an eCommerce company that we were.\n\n(00:15:35):\nI tried many things over those two or three years. And remember, this was my first, quote unquote, \"job\" out of college. I was doing a lot of that and it was a very tough time. But at the same time I learned a lot. I learned a lot about myself, I learned a lot about managing ambiguity and just keeping people motivated through a tough time. A lot of that also has to come from keeping yourself motivated, because people can smell fear and pessimism from far. Just like optimism is infectious, so is pessimism. If you're not feeling great as a leader, people will see it. Absolutely. People are not stupid. You have to not fake it. You have to really be motivated to stick it out, and that's what I tried to do at least, and I learned a lot in that. That was one really challenging time for me.\n\n(00:16:21):\nThen the second one was, man, during Uber. 2017, 2018 was crazy at Uber. Oh my God. There were just so much going on with leadership changes, with the brand issues we were getting. For me, there were times when I would commute up from my house to the office, and while I'm in the car I will be listening to some news or whatever and I'll hear about things that happened at Uber that day from the news before I got to hear it from within the company. It was that crazy during that time. So again, a lot of chaos, a lot of churn at the company as well. It was something where you just had to keep your head down and just keep staying focused on what the core is.\n\n(00:17:03):\nI think that is where, Lenny, the optimism in me in terms of, what am I really doing? Is this a service that really benefits millions of people around the world? Are we creating true change? Those are things that I just have to dig deep into to make sure that I stay grounded on why am I here and why I remain to be here and then at the same time motivate my team. But yeah, those were the two really challenging times that I have encountered, at least in my career.\n\nLenny (00:17:26):\nThose are awesome examples. I imagine a lot of founders are going through a lot of challenging times right now with the market, and imagine these experiences for you were really important and impacted your ability to take on bigger roles and bigger challenges in the future. Is that how you see it? These are important experiences to have over time as a product leader and just leader in general?\n\nManik Gupta (00:17:46):\nOh, absolutely. Because like I said, you learn a lot about yourself when you go through a situation like this. You learn both things that bother you or bring you down, and things that give you energy. It's sometimes counterintuitive to think about this. When you're going through a bad time, often then people will say, \"Well, during a bad time I only learned things which are bad.\" But you also learn things that are good. Which is, maybe during a bad time you did something and you suddenly felt relieved or energized, and then you look at that and say, \"Wait, I should do more of that even during a good time, because can you imagine the compounding power that I would get? Because stuff is good and I'm doing this and I'll feel even better.\"\n\n(00:18:26):\nI learned a lot in terms of my own personal energy, things that get me going, things that really stop me in my tracks. And at the same time, how do you work with a team? How do you motivate them? How do you keep your head down and focus, versus getting distracted? What are some of the decisions you make around your product roadmap?\n\n(00:18:47):\nI'll give you an example. During my startup, when we were going through that, in order to motivate the team, one of the best tricks that I came up with, and I learned this from a bunch of other people also, is you just give a team a win. Winning really, really drives a lot of energy. We had a choice to make between launching something which will take six months, versus launching something that we can launch in a very small-ish kind of way, but launch it in a month. And we chose the latter, because when we did that, I remember people were giving high five to each other, people were saying, \"Hey, you know what? This is great. We put something in front of customers.\" We had, I think, 10 customers who used it or something, because we were so soft-scaling that feature. But that didn't really matter. The point was that you get confidence from getting things out, putting it out there, and you feel good about being a builder and being someone who is actually creating a difference. That really grounds the team and focuses the team that there is some real value here.\n\n(00:19:45):\nSome of those things I picked up. Both going through that turbulent time, I picked up. And I have used that even in good times to make sure that we keep building good products.\n\nLenny (00:19:56):\nThat's such a good tactical tip. Find a win. Keep people motivated. Speaking of wins, coming back to Google Maps and Uber, they're probably two of the most widely used, successful consumer products in the world. I don't know if I can think of other products that are used by more people for this long. Then now at Microsoft you're helping Microsoft get more into consumer on the communications side. I imagine you know a thing or two about building successful consumer apps, and so I want to ask a couple questions along those lines. What are two or three surprising or counterintuitive things that you've learned about building consumer products?\n\nManik Gupta (00:20:32):\nThe good news is that there's just... Because of Twitter and a bunch of other channels, including your newsletter by the way, I feel like people are very well informed these days. And I love that.\n\n(00:20:43):\nLet me digress for a second and then I'll come back to your question. One thing that I'm observing a lot, Lenny, which I feel very, very happy about, is the quality of learning and insights and frameworks and best practices is so universal at this point. It used to be that you had to be in the Valley or being part of a small group of folks who are doing things at the cutting edge to have those crazy insights about how do you find product market fit and do all that kind of stuff. Today I talk to people from all over the world for various reasons, and it's incredible how fast people pick up all these insights and frameworks and then they apply them to their local setting and so on. I find that to be one of the most wonderful things ever.\n\n(00:21:32):\nI think folks like you have obviously played a big part, because you have global subscribers and you share some of the best practices. But just generally, that's actually a really good thing for the world, that people have so much access to clarity of thinking. And the best people are actually putting themselves out there, which is great.\n\n(00:21:47):\nIn terms of the counterintuitive stuff, I think two things. One is building consumer products is very hard. I think people think it's easy, because each of us is a consumer. We think of ourselves as a good user, we think of our friends as users, we think of our family as users. And we say, \"Well, if we just build it for ourselves and for our family and friends...\" By the way, a lot of great consumer products started that way, so I'm not saying don't do that. But man, it's hard. It takes a long time to get things right. Because you're essentially trying to get so many things right when you're building a successful consumer product. You have to be able to reach out to a vast, heterogeneous set of users who have different needs, who have different perspectives. The go to market is always very interesting, because you can't force people to use your product. People have to choose you, you don't choose them. That's the part where... How do you drive virality? How do you drive that real love for a consumer product? And it has to create real value.\n\n(00:22:52):\nThe other thing about time is that, in order for you to find product market fit and then scale from there, you just have to try a lot of different things. There are theoretical playbooks around it, but you got to just get into it. Going back to the point I was making earlier about wins, get some wins and see the results and then iterate from there. I think it's just hard and it takes a lot longer than what people imagine consumer products do. Versus, let's say, enterprise products or products of other nature. That's one counterintuitive thing that at least I've learned.\n\n(00:23:21):\nThe second one is the global patterns that you see in consumer products in terms of the user interface; the core things that people do or expect. At this point along of that is pretty universal. There's always this debate where people would say, \"Well, need to have one product for the U.S., another different type of product for Asia, another different type of product for Africa. I think we are past that point. That's again another counterintuitive thing, where people spend a little too much... I've seen this in many companies. People spend too much time debating that, \"Oh, the users in market X are different.\" Well yes, they're different, but they use the product the same way.\n\n(00:24:02):\nThat's the part which I think... And I'm not making an argument against localization. Of course you need localization around language, pricing. There are some legal requirements, all of that stuff. Obviously you have to do that, otherwise you don't even have a right to exist in that market. But by and large the patterns are very similar. You look at global products, even like Facebook or Google Search or Maps or Twitter or TikTok and so on, all of them have a similar pattern or similar app for the entire world, and they keep on innovating or localizing at the edges.\n\n(00:24:33):\nThat's the other counterintuitive thing that people should know about consumer products. Build for the world from day one. Understand that there are going to be some nuances that you'll have to solve as you drive adoption in certain markets, but don't over index on building market specific solutions, because consumers have moved on from that kind of a model. Those are the two, in terms of product building, counterintuitive trends at least I have picked up over the years.\n\nLenny (00:25:02):\nThis episode is brought to you by Unit. What did Gusto, Uber, Shopify, and AngelList all have in common? They've all decided to build banking into their product. According to AngelList head of product, banking makes every single feature more interesting. With it our platform functions as financial mission control for our customers.

How it's an approach to building new products within big companies. Can you just talk about that idea?\n\nManik Gupta (00:26:17):\nYeah, absolutely. I've been noodling a lot on this, especially since I took on my role at Microsoft as well. And prior to that, even at Google, this was always an interesting discussion. Let's say you are building a new product or leading a new project, if you will, at a larger company. In fact, this also applies to medium-sized companies. I wouldn't say for startups, but medium-sized companies. Usually the narrative in the room when you're discussing this with your team and with your leadership team would be, \"Okay, we got to go find product market fit.\" Absolutely. Yeah. We have to do a bunch of stuff, as we just talked about. Consumer products take time. All of that stuff.\n\n(00:26:57):\nBut I think there's a question before that question, which is how do you find company product fit? What I define as company product fit. Which is a company essentially is a portfolio of products, and every large company, medium-sized company also has a portfolio. They'll have 10, 20, in some cases hundreds of products in the portfolio. Every company has unique strengths and weaknesses. This is pretty tried, but it's obvious. And I would encourage a lot of folks, when they start embarking on this journey where they're trying to really build out products and so on, is to ask that question. How does that product, assuming it's successful... If it is not successful, it doesn't matter anyway. But assuming it's successful, does it actually serve the right place in a company's product portfolio? Or not? And if it doesn't, don't do it. Why waste time?\n\n(00:27:57):\nOftentimes companies will be like, \"I want to do this because some other company is doing it.\" That is not a good reason. You should only invest in products, or projects for that matter, because you can play to your strengths and you can create some unique consumer, customer value. And by the way, you can do it better than anybody else out there. That's what I mean by company product fit. Take that first step and understand does this even resonate and is it part of the portfolio? Does it make sense?\n\n(00:28:26):\nBecause if you can answer that question with enough conviction, then your road to the next step on finding product market fit becomes much easier, because you don't have distractions then. Everybody gets it. Everybody gets this is a strategic effort. You have the right sponsorship at the right levels in the company, and you're executing towards it and you're finding it out. Let's say things don't go well. That's okay. People will step in to help. A lot of that will happen, because people innately get it. That this is the right product to go after from a company product fit perspective. That's something that I've been thinking a lot about and also executing as we move forward.\n\nLenny (00:29:00):\nIs there an example of that gone wrong that you can share? Whether it's a company you've worked at or a company you've seen do it badly.\n\nManik Gupta (00:29:05):\nI'll have to think through specific examples, but companies do this all the time, where they do these line extensions. Where they'll say, \"Well, we have a lot of traction in a particular segment. Why don't we just go to an adjacent segment? If we just add two more features, suddenly this will be appealing to an adjacent segment.\" A classic example would be you're doing something for, I don't know, small and medium businesses and you say, \"Well, now I just have to add two more features and now I'm going to go up market and I'll get to compete in the enterprise.\" Or it could be the other way around too, where you have something in the enterprise business and you want to suddenly go down market to SMB.\n\n(00:29:44):\nIn my view, it's hard. Because again, the capabilities that you need, the thinking that you need, is something you have to really be clear about. This is not to say that it will not fit in the company's portfolio. It's just that when you're making a choice like that, make sure you set it up well to succeed. That's the other part of the equation as well.\n\nLenny (00:30:02):\nSpeaking of setting it up to succeed, you also have this idea of a consumer stack concept that I think you've been talking about at Microsoft. Can you talk about what that's all about?\n\nManik Gupta (00:30:11):\nYeah, sure. One of the things that I'm doing at Microsoft right now is, while I'm working on a lot of the consumer communication products, the other thing that I'm really helping the company think about is how do we get more at scale consumer products built at Microsoft. Part of this is just distilling some of the learnings that I've had over the years. I think there are like five things that I would talk about, which I call the consumer stack, which is essentially a set of capabilities that companies need to have a good chance of success at building a consumer product. Remember, nobody can give a playbook to build a successful consumer product. That does not exist. Because as we were discussing earlier, it's so fickle and so many things have to go right for you to build a successful consumer product. But at least you have a set of capabilities, so you set yourself up the best.\n\n(00:31:01):\nThe first one I would say is around design-led thinking to delight users. Going back to your days at Airbnb, Lenny, I'm sure this is something that resonates with you. Design for consumer products is such a critical part of how you build the right pull from consumers these days. Poorly designed products have no chance at this point. Your craftsmanship and the design capabilities have to be A plus. And if you don't have that, then you should really invest in that. This is not just about having the best designers. Of course you should. It's just the thinking. It's a attention to detail. It's the attention to how things are pixel to pixel, moving from one screen to another screen and so on. You really have to sweat it out and really be clear in terms of how it's adding value to a consumer. That is, I think, a core capability in these days to build a consumer product. That's number one.\n\n(00:31:54):\nNumber two is strong focus and prioritization. You can apply strong focus and prioritization to anything in life, but I think it's even more important for consumer products. Because oftentimes people, when they think about solving a problem, they think about coming up with 20 features at the same time, and it's not needed. You don't need 20 features to solve a problem. You just need one or two features which work really well. This whole concept of critical user journeys. How do you make sure that, if you're solving problem X, any feature that you build in the product... Firstly your product should have very few features in the beginning. But even if it has those features, it should be well designed and it should have the focus and prioritization so that you're only getting things for the critical journey so that the user can use it and not get confused. That's the second one.\n\n(00:32:38):\nMost PMs totally understand that. That's their job description, to focus and prioritize. But I feel like a lot of times the PMs do get very confused and distracted, because the number of ideas that people have is so large that they want to just throw everything into the product, and that doesn't work. You have to keep a very high bar for focus and prioritization. That's capability number two.\n\n(00:33:00):\nNumber three is having the right metrics and instrumentation. This talks to the data aspect of the culture, which is, if you don't have the metric with regards to what you're optimizing for at the initial state of the product, middle state of the product, late stage of the product, you're just not going to choose the right things. How will you measure success? How will you convince yourself, your team, and broader stakeholders that this is actually working or not working? Having the right metrics is important, but it's incredible how many times people have the metrics but they don't instrument them. They'll have all these debates, because the product is not instrumented properly. And everybody will talk about the same metric, but they'll have different nuances in terms of, \"Oh, what does it really mean? What is a daily active user? Okay, daily means... Okay, I understand it's on a daily basis. What is active?\" And there'll be debates about what is active. Pick a definition, instrument it, codify it. No confusion. That's number three.\n\n(00:33:59):\nNumber four is more on the engineering side, which is how do you get to a very high ship velocity, and the ability to experiment and learn fast. At a broader level, especially during the initial phases, if you're not learning, you are really not doing anything well. You've got to be learning. You've got to be learning good things, bad things, doesn't matter. You've got to be learning. Having the experimentation velocity, having a building culture where engineers are able to check in code, see the results, and then quickly come into another release and stuff like that, I think that's really important for a consumer product.\n\n(00:34:29):\nFinally, underpinning all of this is just having strong talent. Assess your talent; your product talent, your design talent, your data talent, your engineering talent, your marketing talent, all these functions. You just have to have a talented pool of people who like to build stuff, and they're the people who understand and have the empathy for consumers.\n\n(00:34:50):\nTo me, I think these five capabilities... And as a leader, or product leader, or an engineering leader, or anyone who's basically responsible for running products in small company, big company, medium-sized company, it doesn't matter; if you're in the consumer space, my thinking here is that if you look at these five categories and five capabilities, you should really have a report card and say, \"Okay. How do I rate these?\" If I were to look at my own team, what do I think about design thinking? What do I think about strong focus and prioritization? Are we doing an A job? Are we doing a B job? Are doing a C job or D job? I would argue that if you get to an A job over time, because not everybody will be at A on day one, but if you get that over time, I think you will start seeing results which are very meaningful. That's how I've been thinking about the consumer stack.\n\nLenny (00:35:34):\nAwesome. I was going to ask how you operationalize this. It sounds like it's going to turn into Manik's consumer stack scorecard, and bigger companies can leverage this at their own company and show their manager, \"Hey, we're moving really slowly. Maybe this is an area we should focus before we bet big on consumer.\"\n\nManik Gupta (00:35:50):\nYeah. I'm trying to operationalize this myself right now in my current job, and I have used some version of this. I mean, this is not something I just came up with. It's something that has been in my mind for a while. I've used it in some shape or form. But during my break, especially before I joined Microsoft, I think this came together for me as something a little bit more tangible that I can use. Then I started applying it, so I think it's been pretty interesting to see.\n\nLenny (00:36:15):\nAwesome. I'm hoping that this proliferates through larger companies and becomes a thing that we can root back to this chat.\n\n(00:36:23):\nShifting a little bit to the CPO role and the VP of product role that you've had at a few companies, in theory this is kind of an end state for a product leader. Every PM, if they stay down the PM career track, they'll become a CPO or VP of product or head of product somewhere. A couple of questions here. One is, do you have a sense of how many PMs actually stay on this track and end up in one of these roles, versus move on to some other role or place?\n\nManik Gupta (00:36:47):\nYeah. That's a great question. I would say that the percentage for CPO in particular, you having a C title and being a CPO, I think that percentage is still relatively small. This is just my sense. I haven't done the numbers to give you a more accurate picture here, but I think my sense is relatively smaller. Because I think a large part of it depends on how companies are organized. Companies can be organized functionally, companies can be organized through business units, and oftentimes these days it's a mix of both. If you look at any company, they'll have some C level functional executives, but underneath them they'll have GMs. The organization design is just such an evolving field always. And as they say, companies will go one... they'll swing the pendulum one way and they'll say, \"Oh, over time it's not working,\" and then they'll swing the pendulum the other way and then they keep going back and forth. I think the percentage for CPO in particularly in my mind is probably not as big as what people think it is. Like I said, because of the way that companies are organized.\n\n(00:37:50):\nI think the interesting thing here is I am just seeing personally, having been a CPO myself and also talking to a lot of people in my network and just observing a bunch of different companies, I think the CPO role is evolving. Or the head of product role is also evolving. I think a lot of it is morphing more into the GM model where you're running not just product management but also perhaps PM and engineering, and design to a certain extent and data science too. You're essentially becoming the overall technical product leader at the company.\n\n(00:38:27):\nThe reason why I feel that is happening is because it's all about accountability. It's about who has the single threaded leadership model where this person can make all the decisions when it comes to trade offs and running the roadmaps and all of that kind of stuff. It's not ideal, by the way, in all cases. Because what that means is, for somebody to be doing that, that person has to be really, really good at all those other functions too so that everyone who is in their organization respects that. Otherwise people feel like I'm the second class citizen in this model where this person doesn't know anything about, whatever; my function and so on. So it's harder, but I do feel that for optimization around decision making, around having a single threaded leadership and accountability, I feel like that's the direction where the product leadership role itself is going more and more. At least based on my experience.\n\nLenny (00:39:19):\nIs your sense that maybe CPO might fade away as a title and GMs become the common path across companies?\n\nManik Gupta (00:39:26):\nIf you were to push me on this, I would say that's probably the direction we will go. I think it's interesting to also think about CTO. If you look at the CTO roles versus SVP of engineering or a VP of engineering, I think it's an interesting debate too, what's happening with CTO roles. If a company is organized purely functionally, I think that's absolutely the right call. But as companies are changing and thinking about how they drive more accountability and more business units and so on, I just feel it probably will become more GM oriented. That does not mean that the VP product is going to go away or the VP engineering is going to go away. I think those roles will still stay. But the C-level title, reporting into the CEO but you're just running that one function; if I look at over time, maybe that role is lot less prevalent than what we have right now.\n\nLenny (00:40:15):\nDo you think that's partly because there's this weird overlap between CPO and CEO, and there's often tension of who's leading the product? Is that something you've seen?\n\nManik Gupta (00:40:24):\nYeah. I think that's definitely an interesting one as well. I mean, if you think about it, just based on my experience, what does the CPO really do? What is their job description? I think it's useful to think through that. Generally speaking, and again, we can always talk in generalizations because that's how you should think. And every company is unique. But generally you would say the CPO is responsible for driving the product vision for the company, and that product vision cannot be divorced from the company vision. Oftentimes this is actually what also creates conflict within the leadership team, where the product vision is... people are coming up with these grandiose plans. Like, \"Oh, we'll do this, we'll do that,\" but then it's not really grounded in the reality of where the company is. Anyways, it's around product vision and making sure it's coherent with the company vision.\n\n(00:41:09):\nThen the second big part of a CPO job is execution of the roadmap on the priorities. People sometimes think that, hey, I get to a C-level position. I don't have to worry about execution. Absolutely not. If you're a CPO in particular, even the CTO and the head of engineering, execution matters a lot. The operational excellence. Because things are so complex. I mean, we are in a situation where a lot of people are working remotely, there are all these different tool sets, there are all these different technologies that are coming up, you have different competitors. Execution is super important. And if people don't understand that that's a big part of their job when they get to the senior level, I think they're mistaken. The execution is another one.\n\n(00:41:50):\nThe third is, for a CPO, especially for a tech company, because you are really driving the product roadmap, it's a very leveraged job. Meaning you have to really work with all your other peers, whether the marketing person, or the sales person, or the business unit person and so on, and just make sure that you are really even deeply connected in terms of what is really needed, so that your product roadmap is how things are going to actually come to life. It's a very cross-functional, on steroids kind of job in that sense.\n\n(00:42:19):\nIn terms of the CEO, CPO, I think the important thing again is... And this is actually advice I've given to CEOs of some companies as well, when they first start looking for a VP of product or a CPO. This is almost like a questionnaire that I give them. The first question I ask the CEO is, what do you want to do? That's the most important question. Because a lot of times the CEO has either been the technical founder, or they have been the product founder. They can be a sales founder too. All that is fine. But what do you want to spend your time on? Because if you are going to get a CPO or a VP of product and then still want to own the product roadmap and own the execution, then don't do that. Because what is that person going to do? That's the first question that I tend to clarify between a CEO who's looking for a CPO or VP of product.\n\n(00:43:10):\nThen the other thing is really about, are you trying to optimize for process? Are you optimizing for strategy? Are you optimizing for team building and attraction? I think that's a really big one. Sometimes you have to get the right level of leader to attract more talent to the team. Because people say, \"Oh, this person is working there. Now I want to go work in their organization.\" How do you think about engineering and data science and design? How do you think about GM and operations? There are a bunch of all these things in terms of the design that you need to do before you decide whether VP of product, CPO is somebody you want to get and what kind of person you want to get.\n\n(00:43:43):\nI think that's where the intersection of the work between this... especially for a tech company, the CEO, CPO have to be... And even the CTO I would throw in the mix. That has to be very clearly articulated, otherwise it creates a lot of confusion. Those are some of the things, at least that I observe from different patterns and different companies that I've worked with and also guided and advised, those are things that always come up.\n\nLenny (00:44:06):\nIt's interesting how much similarity there is to that experience as there is to the first PM at a company. It feels like they have to have the same conversations with the founder. What do you want to work on? What am I going to take on? How do we avoid stepping on each other's toes the whole time?\n\nManik Gupta (00:44:21):\nThat's actually a... I never thought about it that way, Lenny. I think that's a really good point. You're totally right. Obviously, if you're at a bigger company, then you're looking for a VP of product. Or if you're a super big company, then you're looking for a CPO. But you're right. The first product hire that you make as a founder, you'll pretty much have the same conversations to ensure that there are clear swim lanes and accountability for that group.\n\nLenny (00:44:39):\nInteresting. I want to make sure to ask you, as kind of a big deal leader of product at larger companies, I'm curious, what do you look for in PMs that are looking to get promoted, or just deciding somebody's ready for promotion or ready for more responsibility? What do you look for and what should people focus on if they want to come across as promotion material?\n\nManik Gupta (00:45:01):\nI'm a big fan of looking at both the what and the how. So what did they accomplish and how did they accomplish. Because they're a package. And if you just look at one versus the other, then I think you end up making a mistake. Usually. On the what, I think the what is usually more objective. What I look for... And again, it depends on the level of the person. Don't try to calibrate someone based early in their career. You have to think through that. That they're in learning phase. If they're more senior than you have to of course calibrate them differently. But ultimately, if I were to boil it down on the what, it's really about real demonstrated impact. An ideal example is someone who had a strong product hypothesis, they rallied a bunch of people around them. They may not have come up with the hypothesis. That's fine. Somebody else could have come up with it, it doesn't matter. But they believed in it, they rallied the team behind it, they drove towards it and created impact.\n\n(00:45:58):\nThe impact not necessarily always has to be positive. It could also be a lot of stuff that we learned, but we learned from it and then we moved on and we did the next rev. By the time we did the next rev, we were smarter about it. Clear demonstrated impact from an end to end product cycle to me is probably one of the better indicators of readiness for someone to take on more. And you basically want to give them more, because now they have a pattern of doing things properly. That's one.\n\n(00:46:23):\nOn the how, I just love people who are able to create both energy and create clarity. Think of the flip side. PMs who don't create clarity is such a time sink and the teams struggle so much. I'm sure all of us, when we think about back in the day, maybe we were in that position at some point. But we also worked with folks who were always confused and didn't really summarize, or didn't really follow up, or didn't really create that level of clarity in terms of what we need to do and so on, and how broken that felt. People who can create the clarity and then have the energy around them to get things done, I think that's the how in my opinion. Which is really important for determining somebody's career trajectory.\n\n(00:47:11):\nThen the last thing I would say is followership. Really important for PMs. Do people want to work with them? Do people at some point, as they go up and become more senior, do people want to work for them? Ultimately people make choices. And if you have a bunch of smart people and they're making smart choices and they're choosing this person to follow or to be with and work with them and reach out to them, and you keep hearing things about, hey, so and so wants to work with this person because this person is amazing; there is a ton of value in that.\n\n(00:47:45):\nThose are the three things that, if I were to really boil it down, not looking at a certain level, I think I always look for those attributes.\n\nLenny (00:47:51):\nThose are awesome. So simple and clear and succinct. I like the way that you framed it as followership versus leadership. There's a lot of PM attributes leadership, and there's something really nice about just a way to understand that as how many people are following you and excited to work on the things that you're trying to get them to work on. That's very cool.\n\n(00:48:11):\nAlong the same lines, when you think about PMs that had an inflection point in their career, do you find that there's anything correlated with something that leads to a large inflection in the progress of someone's career where they all of a sudden started doing incredibly better?\n\nManik Gupta (00:48:24):\nI've gone through a few inflection points myself, and almost always they've happened because something in the organization changed, so I got a shot. There's always that luck factor, going back to the first question that we discussed.\n\n(00:48:37):\nBut generally speaking, I think the inflection points happen in two places. One is when someone has really successfully changed the dynamic, or the trajectory rather, of a particular product. That's a huge inflection point. That doesn't happen very often, to be fair. But when it happens, you know it. You know, as a leader, this person worked on this and they actually led this change and now we are playing a different game. We are playing a bigger game, we are playing a different game, all of that kind of stuff.\n\n(00:49:16):\nIn other words, what I'm saying is the inflection point for a career is correlated strongly with the inflection point in the product. If you can connect those, the cause and effect... If there's causality and not just correlation, if there's causality in that, I think that absolutely means that you've got a winner. And you really want to bet on them and you have to give them a lot more to do, because they have the ability to do it. That's one.\n\n(00:49:38):\nThe second is, oftentimes as people go up in their career, they start managing teams. They become a manager, and then you become a manager of managers, and then you become more senior. I mean, that's the organizational trajectory that happens. One inflection point that I've seen is, when you go from being a manager, a first line manager, to becoming a manager of managers, and if you're able to navigate that with very strong effectiveness, then you know. If you're their manager or if you're their leader you know this person has got their act together. Because managing ICs is so different from managing managers, because then you now need to create a structure. You need to be able to determine how much you delegate. How do you coach? How do coach your managers to do the right thing? If you see somebody making that transition effectively... And you have to give them some time, but if you see that and you know that they're actually doing it, and again, a lot of followership, a lot of other things are happening, good things are happening, then you know they're at that inflection point where they're ready to take on more.\n\n(00:50:41):\nBoth product inflection in terms of real output and this management prowess inflection in terms of being able to effectively lead going from one step to another, a manager to becoming a manager of managers; I think those are the two places where I feel like, if I see somebody doing well, I know they're ready to put more onto them.\n\nLenny (00:51:00):\nDo you find that second piece is this filter for PMs that do well in this manager manager role and go on to do better and better and then a lot just fall away because they can't handle that?\n\nManik Gupta (00:51:12):\nYeah, I think so. Maybe I'm a little bit more traditionist on this point. I know there are other schools of thought on this, which I respect. Which is there are a lot of times where people are like, \"Well, oftentimes the best PMs are PMs who are IC PMs. They have this crazy, incredible, unbounded energy and they don't want to waste their time on management and whatnot and do that. Because a large part of a PM's job, by the way, is managing by influence. PMs typically don't have large organizations. In fact, one of the most leveraged teams in almost every company... Because you talk about PM manage ratios, PM design ratios, they're never one-ish to one, or one-ish to five, or one-ish to six. Sometimes it' going to be one-ish to 10. At Google it used to be one-ish to eight to one-ish to 10.\n\n(00:51:52):\nI personally see that transition... If somebody's making that transition successfully and they're getting good scores out of it and delivering the product and the output of the team is significant, I definitely see that as a good filter criteria for someone whom we can bet on.\n\nLenny (00:52:06):\nDo you find there's common habits or pitfalls PMs make to shoot themselves in the foot in their career, especially early on?\n\nManik Gupta (00:52:14):\nOh, I see that all the time. There's a few of the things that I have picked up. And by the way, I was doing this too early on and I learned the hard way. The first one I would talk about is you are early in your career and everyone expects you to just manage things and manage the process and all of that. Make sure that trains are running on time and all of that. Which, by the way, is really important for an early in career PM to understand. That that's actually a big part of your job. Let's not over glamorize a PM. A large part of being a PM initially is just basically doing whatever the team needs you to do. But I think one of the pitfalls of that is, if you start putting process over progress, that's a problem.\n\n(00:52:58):\nWhat I mean by that is, you want to introduce process into almost everything that the team does and not be flexible on shipping things out there and all the things that can come in the way of progress. If process is helping progress, great. But if process is hurting progress, you should not be the person saying, \"No, no, no, no. We can't do it, because I'm just so married to the process. Because as a PM, that's what I own.\" I mean, as a PM you don't write code typically, you don't write design specs, you write product specs. Sometimes you feel like, what is the set of attributes that I own? Especially early in career PMs. And you're like, \"I own this process. I own this weekly standup meeting, or I own this sprint planning, or whatever.\" And then you get so married to it that you forget the fact that that's just a means to an end and the end is what you're going to be actually measured on. That's one mistake that I see people making early on.\n\n(00:53:48):\nThe second one is becoming really too self-centered. It's all about me, not the team. I'm the PM. There's this myth that keeps going around. The PM is the CEO of the product. That's one of the most incorrect things in the world. The PM is an enabler. I said earlier, it's a leverage job. Your job is to really make the team successful. Of course you have to have the product thinking and the roadmap and all of that, but sometimes this can go to their head. Then people become too self-centered and that's a red flag.\n\n(00:54:21):\nThen the third one would be just not admitting your mistakes or learning from them. Early in career, the only thing you should optimize for is learning. Sure, you'll make a lot of mistakes. You don't know much yet. You're just coming into this journey and you should be humble and you should be learning and you should be saying, \"Oops, I screwed up over here.\" And that's okay. That's fine. And by the way, if you work in a company where that is not accepted, you should not work in that company. What's the point? You should really be optimizing for learning and learning from other people. And people should be saying, \"Yeah, don't worry. It's okay. You made the mistake. Learn from it. Don't make the mistake again. That's fine.\" But that's the kind of culture you want to choose for yourself.\n\n(00:55:01):\nThose are the three pitfalls that I see people get into, especially early on in their career.\n\nLenny (00:55:05):\nYou touched on how different companies work in different ways and look for different things in different PMs. And something I wanted to ask you is just to chat a bit about the difference between working at Google versus Uber versus Microsoft as a PM, and also just generally how product is built differently at these companies. It's something I'm trying to do with this podcast as much as possible. Just give an overview of what product is like at different companies. You've worked at three of the biggest, and so I'm curious to hear what you can share around that.\n\nManik Gupta (00:55:32):\nYeah. It's actually really interesting. I mean, all the three companies are so different. Google, the core DNA of the company was very much engineering. In fact, there used to be a framework which was around technology insights drive innovation. It was always about what is the best tech we can come up with, which is going to indeed drive innovation, and have a longish view so that the market will get there. That was the Google philosophy always. As a PM, your job at Google... It might have changed in the last six, seven years that I've not been there, but at least when I was there from 2008 to 2015, especially working on Google Maps, it was all about how do you take good long-term bets grounded in strong technical insights, and then use the power of Google Search distribution to really get your product out there. That was it.\n\n(00:56:33):\nOn the Maps team, our innovation was pretty much around crowdsourcing everyone's location signals for traffic. Huge, huge accomplishment. We had the best traffic models in the world. And then being able to do this crazy route optimization for driving directions. Then on top of that, we had the search stack, which came from Google Search anyway. So that you can search for any address, any business and so on.\n\n(00:56:55):\nAnyway, as a PM it was partnering very closely with engineers and really amplifying the engineer's ideas and so on. I think at that point also a lot of Google PMs were very technical. Very, very technical. Because that was just part for the course. It was expected that you will be able to at least have engineering discussions. A large part of what I did as a PM at Google, especially initially, was getting into the technical details with my engineers and really geeking out on what we can do. That was the Google model.\n\n(00:57:25):\nBy the way, one thing I should say about Google before I go to... At Google as a PM, at least all the way up to the time even when I became a director, I never had to think about business models, man. Never. It was fascinating. You were in this weird state where you could just build and have the consumer traction and all of that, but you never thought about P&L, never thought about revenue and so on.\n\n(00:57:48):\nThen I landed at Uber, which was very different. Uber was very operations, very business driven, very P&L. In fact, one of the most incredible things that Uber did was they had a dashboard which every employee in the company could look at, and it had last week's revenue, last week's number of trips that we did, and you could slice and dice it and all of that. I think that changed over time as we became a public company and so on. But the point was that it was really in your face all the time. When there were weekly newsletters sent out, it was all about growth, it was all about business, all of that kind of stuff. It was very operational and business, so as a PM over there it was a lot about managing a bunch more stakeholders. The operations teams, the marketing teams, the policy teams and so on. And how do you work with them to deploy your product into each of these markets. Of course then a large chunk of your work was still working with the engineering team. It was different in that sense.\n\n(00:58:47):\nI think at Uber the other thing was it was also much more of a real time business. I mean, Google was also real time. Google Maps was real time. Billions of users were using it. But Uber was... every day there was something going on in the market and you had to keep on that hustle in terms of how do you make sure that your staying competitive, your product is working well, there are no outages. All of that kind of stuff was really important.\n\n(00:59:09):\nThen finally, on Microsoft... I mean, Microsoft has been around for quite a while. The company went through so many different things and then over the last several years, especially under Satya's leadership, it has done so well. Incredibly well in terms of how the company has changed the culture, the kind of products that they have in the market, the traction they have in the market.\n\n(00:59:29):\nI think I would describe Microsoft as both... first and foremost, it's a very strong tech company. The engineers here are incredible. Oh my God. I am so privileged to work with some of the best engineers that I've worked with in my career. At the same time there's a lot of legacy. There are a lot of products that have been around for a really long time, which is good and bad. The good part is that they have seen pretty much every pattern there is to see. In fact, they came up with a lot of those patterns themselves. The bad part sometimes can be that change is hard. How do you convince people that we're going to go down a different path? As a PM, a lot of it is around bringing outside in perspective, bringing clarity of like, \"Hey, this is how it has actually worked somewhere else.\" Bring a specific example. Let's try it out and see how that works.\n\n(01:00:13):\nThe final thing I would say about it is the company is so grounded in trust. If there's one word that I would say about Microsoft is trust. They really care a lot about customers. Customers trust Microsoft a lot. I've been in some of the customer meetings myself and I can totally hear what customers say. It's all about trust. They expect resilience, they expect the products to work, and they expect that when they have a problem on the surface, that Microsoft will take care of it. They built that over time. A lot of that goes into your mind as a PM when you're working in that company, that a lot of the stuff that we are doing here is to really help our customers.\n\nLenny (01:00:48):\nGoing back to your point about company-product fit, these cultures and the way they work just fits perfectly with the thing they end up building. I wonder which one comes first.\n\nManik Gupta (01:00:57):\nIt's true. That's a whole nother conversation we can have at some point. I have a lot of thoughts on that. But I'll just echo what you just said, which is that's the reason why it's so important for companies, when they embark on new initiatives, to be really, really thoughtful. Is this the right area for us to get into? Or rather, what are the conditions and the reasons why we are getting into something? We have to be super clear on that. Because if the starting conditions are not right, then you will just trash the team. The team will keep working on something and people will never find the right internal fit. So that's super important.\n\nLenny (01:01:35):\nYou worked on Google Maps and Uber, which I imagine you still use often and maybe billions of people use every day. Is there a feature that you wish that you built back when you were on the team, or that you think should be killed, that annoys you about either of those products?\n\nManik Gupta (01:01:50):\nWow. Okay. This is a super interesting one. I don't know if that's something that I could have built at Google Maps, but one of the things that's interesting is the self-driving technology has just not gotten there fast enough. I feel like the best and brightest actually worked on it and are still working on it and it will get there. I'm a big believer. But of course the timelines have shifted for various reasons, because it is a really hard problem. It's actually really interesting to see what Cruise is doing right now in SF. They have started the pilots and so on, so I'm really happy to see some progress happening. I know Waymo's been doing a bunch of this already.\n\n(01:02:29):\nBut it would've been amazing. One of the things that we used to talk about all the time at Google on Maps was how would we design a navigation product when people are in self-driving cars? We had some really interesting ideas at that point, but we never got to it. Not because we didn't prioritize it, but the technology isn't there. I still keep a close watch on that and see at what point are we going to get there. It's going to take years, but it is just such a different paradigm. It's like computers talking to computers, algorithms talking to other algorithms. Then there's a human in the mix in terms of serving the human at the end, but it's like the human is not initiating that much. It's just, stuff is happening around it.\n\n(01:03:08):\nAnyway, that's one thing that is unfinished business, if you will, in my mind. And hopefully, as the technology comes together, that will happen.\n\nLenny (01:03:16):\nAmazing. Manik, you've been extremely generous with your time. Just two last quick questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out maybe, or learn more about what you're doing? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nManik Gupta (01:03:28):\nYeah. You can find me on Twitter, you can find me on LinkedIn. Those are the two places. I have not been very active on both those recently. I've not been active as a contributor, but I'm very active on those two platforms as a consumer. If you have any questions, if you have any thoughts, would love to hear from you, so please send me a note.\n\n(01:03:47):\nIn terms of how listeners can be helpful, I just want to learn what's new and what's out there. I've had the privilege of being in these incredible companies. The reason why I'm still doing what I'm doing is because I still want to learn. If there are better patterns out there that you're seeing, particularly around how to build products, would love to know if there are other ways people think about finding product market fit. Because that's such an elusive thing that I just keep thinking a lot about. If you have some techniques, some tips, some best practices that you have learned and it has worked for you, please, please, please reach out to me. I would love to learn that, because it's so important for us to keep having that conversation.\n\nLenny (01:04:24):\nAwesome. It's always such a pleasure chatting. I always learn a ton. And this did not disappoint, so thank you again for being here.\n\nManik Gupta (01:04:30):\nLenny, thank you so much for asking all these questions and giving me the opportunity to share my learnings over the years. Thank you.\n\nLenny (01:04:36):\nAbsolutely my pleasure. That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast.
