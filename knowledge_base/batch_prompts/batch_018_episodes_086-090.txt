Most people rely on their history department way too much. If you instead send things to the more experimental, open-minded science department, the more creative art department, you get dramatically better answers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:13):\nI know you have a bunch of awesome advice on becoming more influential.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:16):\nIt's almost like you're playing Elden Ring or some video game. The starting point is to choose your character. Hey, I'm the devil's advocate approach, or I'm the break it and see if it still stands after I hit it really hard with a sledgehammer kind of guy, your personality kind of has a natural fit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):\nHow do we create better relationships within our teams?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:33):\nIt's critical to ask what kind of experience am I? Not how good am I at my job, how much do I know, how critical am I to this process, but am I a miserable experience? If the answer is yes, don't worry too much about the other pieces yet. You got to fix that first.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):\nI'm really excited for this episode. I think it's going to be unlike any other conversation I've had on this podcast.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:52):\nThen here's the surprise ending.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):\nToday, my guest is Evan LaPointe. Evan is the founder of CORE Sciences, which teaches companies and individuals how our brains actually work, and through that lens, how to more effectively work with other people on teams, how to build better products, how to grow your business, and how to make smarter and faster decisions. Evan is a four-time founder, including founding a company called Satellite, which is the fourth largest analytics product on the internet today, which was acquired by Adobe where he later ran product strategy and innovation for Adobe's digital business.\n\n(00:01:31):\nIn our conversation, Evan shares a simple way to understand how our brains work, and through that framework, how we can get better at vision work, influence, running meetings, having more focus and building better and more productive relationships with our colleagues. This conversation is a beautiful mix of science, theory, and also, a ton of very actionable and concrete things you can do to be more effective in your work.

With that, I bring you Evan LaPointe. Evan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:02:16):\nThanks very much for having me. I'm excited to share some stuff with people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:19):\nI am really excited for this episode because one, I think it's going to be unlike any other conversation I've had on this podcast. Two, I think it's going to really stretch our brains as we learn about how the brain works. Three, I think it's really going to make an impact on how people work and how they relate to other people and work with other people. I thought it'd be great to start by laying a little bit of foundation for people to get a sense of just what they need to understand about how the brain works before we get into how we can actually apply some of the stuff. Could you just share some of the stuff that is really important for us to know about how the brain works?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:02:53):\nThe brain is like a big galaxy. There's a National Geographic quote that we throw up in all of our programs that when we train teams, for example, that says the brain is more complex than any known structure in the universe. It's easy to read a sentence like that and just run straight away from the problem. I think that's important for people to not run away from this problem but more run toward it. It's our job to translate the complexity of the brain into really simple, straightforward systems that you can remember. The three or four main systems to stack on top of each other like layers, start with the fact that the brain has systems. I think of it like the brain is like a college campus that has different departments in it, and your brain has a science department responsible for open-minded experimentation.\n\n(00:03:39):\nIt has an art department in it responsible for creative boundless thinking. It has a history department designed for looking stuff up that you already know. If you think about sending your thoughts to the right department on the campus or just different departments, you're going to get super different responses back from your brain. Where we're stuck largely is most people rely on their history department way too much. That's because the brain is actually built to conserve energy, and that's the lowest energy form of generating an answer to a question that the brain can pull off. If you instead send things to the more experimental, open-minded science department, the more creative art department, the humanities department of your compassion, et cetera, you get totally different answers. Certainly, if you ever build products as a company or offer services, those departments are going to give you dramatically better answers than the reference material just in your history department.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):\nThis episode is brought to you by Webflow.

The pathways thing is really important to understand because there's a likelihood that thought will go down certain pathways in each of our brains. Some of that has to do with personality, which predisposes us to have a higher-anxiety or a lower-anxiety response or a higher-creativity or lower-creativity response. You can also be more intentional with these pathways, and that's a big component of self-awareness is to know what are my preferences and then am I actually letting those preferences take over in the situation or might be more intentional steering down the pathways to activate these best regions and systems of the brain. The simplest way to keep track of the systems is there's three, there's three really big ones.\n\n(00:07:25):\nThere probably are more than three that you can learn about, but the ones we want to have everybody learn about are your safety system, your reward system, and your purpose system. Out of those three, two of them sound really real and one of them sounds like fantasy, to most people. The safety system is pretty obvious to most people. When we're scared, afraid, uncertain, we have doubt, we're resentful, angry, apathetic, etc. This system of our brain is trying to restore our standing in the universe, like I need to get out of this stress, out of this danger, out of this anger, etc. you have an objective that, that part of your brain, that system sets, and you go chase that objective, like I want to get safe. If you're in a meeting, a practical everyday situation, and you're exposed to a statement that makes you feel unsafe, your objective now actually isn't to contribute to the meeting productively anymore.\n\n(00:08:19):\nYour brain's objective is to get back to safety. The same thing of rewards that if somebody says you'll get something, if you do this, which is the opposite of safety, that if you don't do this, something bad will happen, then yeah, your brain gets into this pursuit, desire state, which seems great and can be great in a lot of cases, but also, can be pretty narrow. When you hear people say, \"That's not my job.\" That's actually the reward system speaking, saying, \"I get rewarded for the things in this list and this thing that you're talking about is not on my reward list and I therefore am not interested in it.\" I have an easier time pushing away from it because the reward system of the brain is more transactional in a conceptual way. Then you get to this vague and ridiculous sounding purpose system.\n\n(00:09:08):\nUntil you realize what purpose is, and we've all felt it, if you understand the impact of the thing that you're doing and you understand and care about the people that are impacted by your actions, those are the conditions for purpose, and that can be really big. Like curing cancer, I understand the impact on the people, that's huge. It can also be like I'm writing an email, I understand the impact of this email and the people affected by it. You can feel purpose at this tiny little grain of sand level of your life, not just at the whole beach and shoreline level, and we teach people that, that's super important. That's the foundational layer. Then on top of that, there are a few layers that have to do with your focus because the brain can dramatically shift focus from open mindedness to deep, deep focus.\n\n(00:09:55):\nThen there's the final layer of ability, which is less science- y, less neuroscience, and more just practical that your ability is regulated by how much reality you know, like do you have the context for the decision or you just know you're supposed to make the decision? People with context have higher ability than people without. The same thing with imagination and logic that if you push those boundaries in your mind further, your ability increases almost disproportionately to how much you've pushed, so these layers just stack on. I think it's approachable, it's simple. It's like, we can all understand, is my safety reward or purpose system active right now? What is my level of focus? What level of connection with reality, reason and imagination do I have right now? Then there's your output as a human or as a team, and all these things are like levers we can pull, which is super fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:49):\nAmazing. Just to summarize here, so we have these three systems, safety, reward, purpose, then our level of focus, and then there's the ability, are we able to actually do the job? Those are the puzzle pieces.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:11:02):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:03):\nWhere I want to take this is when we work with other people, working with other people is very hard, and some of the struggles people have at work in building product, in running a company and building teams, hiring, all these things, is they often get really frustrated by the way other people operate. Some people want to just start building a thing, some people want to really think about it. Some people are very customer qualitative, anecdote focused, some people are very metrics focused. Some people are very collaborative, want to work in groups, some people are very, I want to work alone. Just first of all, we just talked about here's how the brain works and then there's this idea of people work very differently. Can you just talk a bit about just this idea of why people behave so differently in an effort to help us learn to work better with people that are just like, \"Oh, that's so strange. This person wants to just their billing.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:12:02):\nMaybe one of the worst pieces of propaganda that people walk around with in their minds is the phrase we're more similar than we are different. My theory on why we walk around with that phrase or why we're told that phrase, if we zoom in on the situations where we hear that is that we have this theory, it's easier to get along with people that are like us. If we fantasize that this person is like me, then I might get along with them better. When in fact, we should probably be building the muscle that we have the capacity to get along with people that are extremely different than we are. That fourth piece that we talk about in our coursework when we train managers, for example, is personality. We talk about your brain systems, your brain focus, your brain's ability, which sort of paints the picture that humans might be similar to each other and we can activate these things kind of unilaterally.\n\n(00:12:54):\nThen we have to drop this bomb at the end, which is, and here's why that doesn't work consistently across different types of people. I know you took our profile, our big five-based profile, and that's just one tool out of many that can help a person understand where on these various spectrum of personality traits and motivations they sit. We often use the metaphor in our training of culinary school that we're more culinary school for human performance instead of cooking class. That helps people conceptualize that I'm used to going to cooking classes in my training, here's how to do a one-on-one, here's how to offer feedback, here's a framework for generating product ideas through to prioritization and backlog. We're like, \"Well, what's going on beneath the surface? What are the underlying principles and forces at work that all the stuff that comes to life on the surface really originates from?\"\n\n(00:13:50):\nIn this culinary school metaphor, one of the things that's really important for a chef is to actually understand what are my preferences? What do I like to eat? Because if I don't know what I like, then I assume everybody else likes what I like, then I'm not going to be a very dynamic chef. I'm going to be like, \"Everybody likes lots of salt and acidity in their dishes.\" Then you're going to go to Germany and open a restaurant and be like, \"That is absolutely not what we're looking for in this cuisine.\" Self-awareness is a really important step, not just of culinary school, but for everybody. You sit somewhere on a spectrum, your brain has these pathways and these traffic cops directing traffic in your mind. You have to start with square one with yourself and understand, am I prone to try to say things politely, and so that they're received well? Or am I prone to be super blunt and direct and maybe even mean and harsh? Am I prone to sit back in conversations and let things happen, or am I prone to take over?\n\n(00:14:48):\nAm I prone to go to intellectual abstract thinking and try to deconstruct ideas or am I prone to stay very pragmatic? If you don't know who you are and you think that the universe resembles you, then you're going to get super lost in that broader spectrum. I think the big five, I mean there's a bunch of models. You have Myers-Briggs, disk, etc. They're just all imperfect ways of measuring personality, but also, useful despite the fact that they're imperfect and especially useful if you take a growth mentality instead of a justification mentality to reading them. If you say, \"okay, I'm low in politeness, I'm super direct.\" Your justification mentality of that would be like, \"Yeah, damn right. I'm awesome that everybody knows what I really mean and how I really feel.' Versus the growth thing, which is like, well, maybe there are situations where I can try a little harder than 0% to phrase things in a way that if we work backwards from the outcome, we want to choose our actions right now, would these actions so direct actually increase or reduce the probability of that outcome?\n\n(00:15:54):\nThat's when we become more dynamic chefs, more dynamic people. Personality is a broad spectrum and self-awareness is the starting point for the whole thing. The big five model gives you a really good list of attributes to scan yourself through, and then you should be making a game plan for how to do that. Then you can turn your attention to the network of humans you're a part of and say, \"Okay, well in what ways, because I'm me, am I so different than these other minds?\" How can we create a mesh mentality where thought shifts among the group to fit most naturally? In product work, especially, whether you're a founder, entrepreneur, thinking about product at that level and your team at that level, or you're in the thick of product work pushing your mind and other people's minds to get this right, then you're going to benefit a lot from understanding these traits and these differences.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:48):\nI think the big unlock here for a lot of people is that the reason you are struggling, getting something done, working with someone, being successful at your company, with your manager, with a partner in your team, is they have a very different way of their brain operating, and so they think in a very different way, they react in different ways. You may think the entire world thinks the way you do, but they don't, and these tests help you see that. To make this super concrete for people, are there a couple of examples or wins you often find that you can share of just ways to use this to become better in your job, say this week? Whether with meetings or convincing someone of something, anything along these lines?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:17:28):\nI think one more layer would be helpful to this, especially if you're a leader or a manager, which is the business world isn't just hand-to-hand combat between a bunch of individuals on the blank matrix loading screen. You're actually in a habitat as a company and your team is like a habitat. I think of companies and teams, almost like little terrariums that we're inside of, and is this terrarium set up with sand and a heat lamp and we're a bunch of frogs, like we're going to turn into frog bacon, simply because we're in this habitat? A lot of it is you want to actually create a habitat or an environment that's predisposed to high-functioning thinking and high-functioning interaction between people.\n\n(00:18:15):\nBecause if the habitat is working against all of you to begin with, then all the hand-to-hand combat that's going to show up is actually largely a function of you just being in this heat lamp, dry, devoid of life, devoid of productive ways to grapple. That's where a lot of teams and companies sit today, especially more established teams. They've either lost their way in the habitat and haven't really set the scene for good, kind of thinking and interaction, or they just never had that to begin with. Some of this stuff, like when you've talked to a couple of other people in the past, your conversation, the Canva conversation, the Figma conversation both come to mind as like it is super obvious the energy that has gone into the habitat to predispose people to high function.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:09):\nYou're referring to in my interviews with the folks from Figma and Canva.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:19:13):\nExactly right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:14):\nI see. Oh, say more about that mean.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:19:17):\nYou think about the, even in the Canva context of coaches instead of managers. I love this, let me back up for just a second. There's a great quote, I think Dan Pink has summarized the problem better than anybody when he said, \"There's a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.\" In that gap, it says, \"Well, what is it that business is doing that science knows better?\" You can almost look at this as an equation of science knows minus what your business does equals dysfunction. That is a pretty crystal-clear thing. If you take this managers versus coaches, they're taking intuitively, I think. I don't know if they're neuroscientists, but intuitively, I think a lot of great founders understand humans don't work a certain way, and this whole paradigm of managers seems to be failing a lot. This whole paradigm, like mantra, fail faster. Seems to be failing a lot, and mission statements seem to fail a lot.\n\n(00:20:22):\nYou look at this, science knows business does as a lens to examine yourself through and stuff that fails very often is worth a look. When you look at, okay, do we really want managers, because that seems to fail a lot? Or is there a paradigm that works better for human beings that activates more human potential and hit the nail on the head? If you do the math of Canva, what science knows versus what Canva does, whether they know they're doing it scientifically right or not, the math equals zero. There's no difference between what science knows and what business does in that case. Also, the Figma conversation, I loved the phrase from that conversation, imagination is a hypothesis generation engine, I think is what the word was.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:13):\nOh, the Dylan. Yeah, the chat with Dylan.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:21:14):\nI loved that idea. Because when we talk about imagination as a part of ability, we talk about imagination's capacity to generate alternatives for you, that's its purpose. It's not just to doodle in the margins in the middle of boring meetings. That's part of it, it's a side benefit. When you look at imagination's purpose, if you have a great imagination, you always have a lot of choices in life. Mickey Mouse was a choice. It was like a new alternative way to send messages through a talking mouse. Like, that's okay, that's interesting. The other part of the hypothesis generation engine that we focus a lot on is it's not just the ability to generate choices and hypotheses, but it's also the ability to load them into your Oculus headset and walk around a world in which that choice already has been executed. That's akin to vision in a sense that do you have a really good ability to load that one branch of this imaginative tree, this one hypothesis into a simulation and then explore what the world looks like with this in place?\n\n(00:22:23):\nIf you look at this coaching thing, it's going on at Canva instead of managing, you load that in the simulator and you're like, \"Boy, this looks pretty nice. This is higher-performance thing.\" With advocacy instead of regulation, we have growth. There's a whole bunch of aspects that are inherent in that approach where science, and if you ask a neuroscientist, would that work better? They'd be like, \"Oh, hell, yeah. That would work way better.\" Because it activates this in the brain, it reduces cortisol, it does all these things that science knows work much better. There's a whole list of stuff from very deep to very tactical of things we can do differently that reduce the gap between what you're doing and what science knows and the dysfunction just shrinks and shrinks and shrinks as you do those things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:16):\nAre there things that you've found people can change in the way they work based on the way the brain operates, whether it's run better meetings, be better influence? What are some things people can try to do this week that will make them more successful at their work or working with colleagues?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:23:32):\nIn the list of what science knows and what business does, everything is in there. Culture is in there, meetings are in there, goals are in there, deadlines are in there, team dynamics, all this stuff is in there. We'll probably just pick a few things out of that very long list. Meetings are a good one. Meetings, I forget what the statistic is, but it's some insane 12-figure amount of, no, not 12, nine-figure, no, 12-figure, hundreds of billions' amount of waste is caught in meetings. We spend gazillions of dollars on waste of time and meetings. For us, like in our programs, the average delta is between 10 and 20%. People save anywhere from a full half of a day to a full day per week of work as a result of just cleaning up the way they're using meetings. Some of that is just the design of meetings, like treat meetings like a product and treat them workflows that should be organized and used intentionally, but a lot of it is inside the meeting, like what's the tactic?\n\n(00:24:38):\nHere's something super tactical, which is, meetings, generally speaking, are a combination of priming and decision making, if you look at meetings through the lens of the phases that they are. A lot of meetings skip the priming step altogether. They launched directly into decision making. It would be safe to skip the priming step if we began the meeting under the assumption that everybody here is on the same page, has the same information, and generally speaking, intends for the same outcome. I think that's a ludicrous assumption for most meetings, and yet most people are actually shocked to find out that we're not on the same page even though we literally never have been, and as long as you're on day two plus of working together. It's a crazy thing that we don't do priming, and priming can be simple. It can even be done in the invite. One of the things that's crazy about Outlook and Google is you can put a very terrible useless meeting into Outlook and it will never look at it and be like, this is probably useless.\n\n(00:25:46):\nJust like you can go into Trello and put the dumbest project in the company's history into Trello, it will ingest anything you put into it without any discernment as to its value. Now, imagine we're going to have to do this ourselves for now until a better calendar comes out, but imagine if Outlook or Google Calendar or Cron, which now is part of Notion, would just be like, \"Uh, uh, uh. What is the point of this meeting?\" You could say, \"Okay, this is here. This meeting is about the generation of options or creative problem solving or very tactical problem solving or efficiency seeking, or what is the category of conversation we are about to have? What are some of the basic principles that should apply? Are we honoring sacred cows or are we eating sacred cows in this meeting? What is the mode mentality, the priming? How can we all say this is the mindset and the ultimate purpose that applies to the meeting?\"\n\n(00:26:52):\nYou can write that and you can read that in under three minutes. It's not some arduous process. Amazon does it in an arduous process, they're known for that. That's wisdom to know, like we need priming. They're wise enough to realize the need for it. They make that a very robust execution. It doesn't have to be that robust. Skipping priming is pretty bad. Other meetings get the priming and the decision-making backwards. We start to open the meeting. You've heard of diamond-shaped thinking, let's open the meeting with expansionary thought and let's end the second half of the meeting with convergence. Well, we start the meeting instead with convergence, realize that we can't reconcile the various party in the room, their needs for convergence.\n\n(00:27:39):\nThen you might hear in the middle of a meeting like, \"Well, let's start over again and remember why we're all here.\" We do the priming in the second half of the meeting just in time for the meeting to end. That's a super obvious thing that people can do, but that people very rarely do in priming. I'm happy to generate a list so we don't have to talk through everything, but maybe make some little PDFs or something that people can download that say, \"Here's what great priming looks like.\" Then when you move to the decision making, here's what great decision making looks like, and that way, you can have a little bit of a guide, and again, do your own math, what science knows what we're doing in this meeting. We're skipping a bunch of steps, that's growing the probability of dysfunction or things will going wrong, and let's shrink that probability instead of growing it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:28):\nAmazing. That'd be sweet if you have that. We'll definitely link to that on the show notes. The advice here is make sure when you're starting a meeting, running a meeting, prime everyone around the problem we're trying to solve or we're trying to get out of this meeting, the context, versus just diving into decision making.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:28:44):\nVery notably, the principles that apply. I think that's really, really important, not just what we're here to do, but how we can think about this best. You can even have a debate about the principles, and it's way better to have a debate about the principles than it is to have a debate about the tactics that are rooted in the fact that you have super misaligned principles. If somebody is trying to make the decision with speed in mind and another person is trying to make the decision with accuracy in mind, it is completely inevitable that they're about to have a cat fight in the meeting. It's not resolvable until they come back and revisit the fact that deeper down, we are approaching this in a completely different mentality with completely different objectives.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):\nAwesome. If you end up having these PDFs of waste to prime successfully, that'd be great.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:29:36):\nFor sure. Will do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:38):\nOkay, great. Other things that people can do to work with better. I know you have some advice on how to influence more effectively. I know you have some advice around strategy and vision, so maybe we go into those two directions.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:29:50):\nLet's start with strategy and vision, because I think it's nice to be better at strategy and vision before you start influencing people. What you'll encounter in life, in your mind, is ideas are swirling. Whether you're generating those ideas or other people are, is your brain is going to sort those ideas into believed, believable, kind of conceivable and inconceivable. You can come up with your own words for that, but that's like a starting point, which is if somebody says something you've already experienced, it's something that is believed to your brain. If we said we should implement an OKR framework and you've experienced it in a prior workplace or you've read all about Google doing it, then you're going to be like, \"Yeah, we should. It would clean up a lot of junk around here. Okay, great.\" Your brain is already in a yes.\n\n(00:30:47):\nIf it's believable, maybe you're reading Harvard Business Review and you're reading about things that your business has never done, that you've never done, but there's all this evidence that it works and it makes sense to you mechanically, so you're like, \"Okay, yeah, I find that believable.\" Now we're leaning toward yes, or we're still in the yes bucket. Now we get into these unbelievable, yet maybe conceivable. These are the things that seem to be far-fetched. Going back to the Canva conversation, the conversation with Uri that you had. Most of the things that are totally believed by these leaders are unbelievable to most other leaders. We don't need managers? I don't believe it. Now we've shifted the mind from inbuilt kind of tailwind to inbuilt headwind. This is why minds struggle with strategy and with vision, is that every mind based on personality we talked about earlier, that line of demarcation between believed, we all have different lived experience, so the more experience you have, the more believed you have.\n\n(00:32:03):\nThen the believable and then the unbelievable, but yet conceivable, these lines shift a lot from person to person. An idea that totally makes sense to Uri, he's probably been in a thousand meetings where other people are like, \"That'll never work.\" Even though obviously, science knows, for example, it totally will. One of the great benefits of science in culinary school is let's not reinvent ideas that are already proven. We already know that certain things activate people's purposeful state and the full brain that seeks comprehension seats deeper problem solving, seeks human connection. Those are known things, and the same thing as the debate about the value of design sits in the strategy and vision. How do we know there's an ROI to a better design here? Well, if you could disprove that instead of proving it, because the last million people who asked this question proved it.\n\n(00:32:54):\nIf you could disprove it, you'd probably win a Nobel prize for being the first human to disprove something that is like ironclad. Like, we're done. We're done with this debate. That, I think is what we have to recognize in ourselves. Big part of self-awareness is where our unbelievable threshold begins, where our believable threshold ends. Then the inconceivable is like, get out of my office level stuff. A lot of the vision thinking and dialogue that happens inside of businesses directly activates people's inconceivable response without any self-awareness that, that's a personal problem, not a objective problem. I think it's a really, really important thing for companies and individuals to invest in themselves to kind of say, \"Do I have the capacity to recognize the situation that I find inconceivable, but that could be totally wrong?\" Then we can avoid the months potentially of arguing that sit between us and experimentation.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:34:00):\n... that sit between us and experimentation. So I think that's the starting point for that. And if we were to do paint by numbers on that, what dominoes do you want to knock down? Know your personality, what you're looking for in the Big-5 model which we lean into is openness. If you are low in openness, your brain essentially has abstract, creative, intellectual, complex thinking wired to the pain systems of the brain. That's how your wiring is. As soon as things get abstract, not only are you like, I don't like this, you have a much more visceral negative response to these types of ideas, and you are now going into your pain cave while somebody else in the room may have all that abstract, creative, exploratory thinking wired to their reward systems.\n\n(00:34:55):\nSo that's something to really know, and vulnerability is the best approach to this because if you think about the domino two, once you know this stuff, then the question is how do we socialize this knowledge in a team? Let's say it's a C suite, a leadership team, a founder and co-founder and the rest of the leadership team. And we work a lot with YC companies on this here, because it's super important. As they hire people, every incremental hire is an increment of psychological diversity, and it changes everything about how these conversations go.\n\n(00:35:27):\nSo knowing this, okay, what are our options to socialize this knowledge? Vulnerability is the best option. But Brené Brown will sell vulnerability for its own sake, not everybody buys selling vulnerability for its own sake, because it's a scary thing. But it gets a little less scary when we consider how much scarier our alternatives are. I can pretend to hide this, that's my other option, or I can not hide it, be a Tasmanian devil, and then be unapologetic. So those are your three options, and when you realize I can be vulnerable, I can attempt to hide it, or I can be unapologetic, those other two options are ruinous compared to vulnerability.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:13):\nThe thing you said about openness and not being good at big vision, brainstorming, super resonates with me, because that's exactly me. So I took your test, what is it called? What do you call this test, by the way?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:27):\nCORE identity is what we call it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):\nCORE identity test.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:29):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:30):\nOkay, cool, and we'll link to it in the show notes.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:32):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:32):\nSo I took, it's basically the Big-5, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, and formerly known as neuroticism, now called need for stability. I'm looking at it right here. And I'm actually, and I knew this about myself, I'm pretty low on openness, which I don't like to see, but it very much aligns with exactly what you said, I'm not great at big vision thinking. Like when people propose, say a designer on my team proposes this whole redesign big vision rethink of the way we, I'm like, no. It's my pain cave, like you said, and that's exactly what this test reflects.\n\n(00:37:10):\nSo I think it's a really powerful example of just understanding this is the way your brain is going to respond to things that are totally out there, inconceivable, or how would you call it? Somewhat conceivable but not necessarily believable, and that being aware that that's how your brain works is really powerful, being aware other people have a very different experience with that is very powerful. And your advice here is one, this combination of this habitat, create this habitat where you have all these versions of people's ways of thinking, where some people are in their happy cave when they're thinking big, and then along those lines, your point about vulnerably sharing, hey, this is me, I am low in openness, people need to understand this on my team, and let's work together to not let that hinder us. Is that right?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:38:04):\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, because if you think about these ideas as pegs in holes, we're going to take a creativity shaped peg and try to put it through a more pragmatic shaped hole, there's a translation problem there, and it's a huge burden. If the team actually needs to be innovative, it's a huge burden just in terms of time spent on that translation, to translate the visionary strategic ideas that are accurate but are inconceivable into ideas that feel believable for those who need that more grounded thing.\n\n(00:38:45):\nAnd of course the most common scenario here is ROI, which is the classic question to ask about any idea, what's the ROI? Well, if the idea is inherently generating nth order effects instead of first order effects, like what is the ROI of having fresh flowers in the lobby of a Four Seasons hotel? There's two possibilities for the Four Seasons, they either have an answer to that question which satisfies the pragmatic shaped hole, or they have said in their habitat, we don't ask those types of questions because they're a huge waste of time.\n\n(00:39:28):\nAnd if you're thinking about a competitive market, most of the people that you interview are in highly competitive markets, the team that spends less time translating satisfactory language before they move, which inevitably they'll move, and sometimes they'll move because the market forces them to. They spend so much time locked up in the ROI conversation or the justification, the translation conversation, that eventually customers start leaving, employees start leaving, and they're like, oh, okay, it's becoming more believable now. Well, because moved out of the realm of ideas into the physical world that we can see right in front of us.\n\n(00:40:05):\nAnd that team, because they got stuck in the translation phase instead of the experimentation phase, has a huge disadvantage in the market, and if you're competing head-to-head with one team, this is what I loved about the Figma conversation, that habitat inherently is built for speed because the habitat itself, words are tattooed to your brain that are like, we will not spend time in the translation phase, we will not spend much time. And we see this a lot in the interplay between finance departments, product departments, and things like that, where an overpowered CFO can start asking questions for which there are no answers, that just we're dragging the team into a different language that is much more literal than the more experiential language of the business, so you can see this play out all the time.\n\n(00:40:59):\nBut I think vulnerability is great because if you are sitting in a meeting, you Lenny, and you say, this is not my thing, basically everything you're saying is inconceivable, now I'm being honest with you, nobody's going to hate you for being honest, they're actually going to be glad that you are honest about the gap instead of glad that you are super certain that you are the right human to index off of in the decision-making process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:26):\nAnd the thing you recommend being open about is this is my personality, this is my CORE identity, I don't know the language you'd use, but it's not I think all this is inconceivable, it's I think all this is inconceivable because this is the way I think.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:41:41):\nAbsolutely, yeah, unpack the detail, for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):\nGot it.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:41:43):\nYeah, I mean tell people, this takes my brain, all this abstract and creative future-centric thinking that's not rooted in the concrete is where my brain goes, alarms go off and I'm like, I need something concrete. So if you can give me something concrete, I'm more comfortable, but at this point I have to maybe move into a lot of trust, and trust may be my alternative to agreement, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):\nYeah. And there's also, I imagine, what I always do is I recognize, hey, I'm not amazing at this, let me push myself to be more open to these things and find partners that are really good at this and let them drive the ship more.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:42:26):\nYeah, and it's great, one of the things that's so cool about the YC teams that we work with is they're so sophisticated and so smart. So even though they might run into this roadblock, A, they're going to do exactly what you just said and they're going to push themselves. You may notice in your profile the dot that you scored is surrounded by rings that represent how hard it is for you to push yourself to think in different ways, to think beyond the home base way of your brain working.\n\n(00:42:55):\nNow at a certain point your brain breaks and you move into foreign territory, and there's a level of, I mean, if you are a very conservative person and somebody's like, \"Let's go to Burning Man,\" that will break your brain. You don't go all the way to the other side of the spectrum necessarily.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:13):\nFor the record, I've been four times, even though I'm apparently low in openness.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:43:17):\nPerfect, and there's lots of reasons to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:20):\nGot married at Burning Man. Makes me feel better about my low percentile.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:43:25):\nBut you're pushing your brain. I mean, Burning Man's actually a great example because there are a bunch of different reasons you might go. And if you go for one reason, then you're exposed to the other reasons. And that may be interesting, and you may kind of venture closer to those other reasons. You may be like, I'm going to stay in my reason bubble within the greater context of this place.\n\n(00:43:44):\nSo there's a whole bunch of... And business is no different, you can say, okay, I'm going to push myself, and I may get into these places that go beyond my brain's flexibility, where the elastic band reaches its limits, and then from there I'll trust people and I'll have people, what I was going to mention about the YC founders is so many of them are so smart that they're really able to efficiently translate what they see beyond where your band stretches into the language you feel comfortable with, quickly. Other teams do that really badly and they just accuse you of, \"Why can't you see this?\" And then you get even more stuck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):\nHow much shift have you seen in people, say they take this test and they're like, as I am, 23rd percentile in openness, do you see people move meaningfully across this if they work on these sorts of things, or is this just like, here's who you are, you're not going to change significantly?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:44:41):\nPersonally I'm more concerned with the effect on teams than on people, because if you look at this through the... I've been a four time founder, and if I look at this through how is my company working? How are my teams working? I don't need all the individuals to get to perfect, I need, especially in cases where there's this translation issue where a team is working on something and some part of that team is saying, \"Let's stop here and let's dwell here.\" If they can move enough that the team, the effect on the team is now freed up, that's what we really feel as a business.\n\n(00:45:23):\nSo to answer your question directly, people can move a lot, especially through the first three rings of that range that we depict, really, really well. Self-awareness is actually kind of the key, and self-awareness and self-consciousness, the difference here is that self-awareness is simply being intentional with your brain, whereas self-consciousness is being worried about your brain. We don't want people to be worried about their brains and insecure, we just want you to say, this is a situation in which my brain can work this way, and this is a situation where I want to push myself.\n\n(00:45:56):\nSo it's being intentional, and we talked a little bit before this episode about this instinct versus intellect duality in the mind, and essentially you're just using your intellect to either verify or improve your instinct. You're always going to have instinctive responses about risk and fear and uncertainty and doubt and need for data, and all these types of things, but then your intellect can come in and watch that part of your brain thinking and say, you're super worried about the risk of this, but it's actually pretty low stakes for us to jump in and try. So your need to stabilize that is a little misplaced, and your intellect, that's really what you're doing is saying, how much do people change? I don't really worry too much about how much they change, it's more about how much they can spot with their intellect something that's misfit to the situation, and then take what they're motivated to do, and what they choose to do, and separate them. It doesn't matter if we change your motivations, if your choice of behavior and your underlying motivation can be different from each other, that's awesome, those people are super. And we all know people like that, where you're like, I know this person is uncomfortable right now, but they're totally making it work, and I really appreciate that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:12):\nYeah, part of the reason I ask is, I was talking to you about this before we started recording, I want 99th percentile at all these, I just want to nail this. And I know that's not how it works, I know you have strengths, you have weaknesses, you can't be amazing at everything. But that's funny my mind goes there.\n\n(00:47:28):\nJust to close the loop on this advice around getting better at vision and strategy, if I were to reflect back what I'm hearing its be very self-aware about what you are not strong at, say openness. Is that specifically the one to focus on if you're trying to figure out how to get better vision and strategy?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:47:46):\nSo there's a whole bunch of stuff... Well, let me try to make the list simple. Openness is the biggest one because it is essentially your tolerance of vision and strategy, and the lower that is, the lower you will tolerate the abstract pieces of the puzzle, for sure. The outlandish and purely creative and rules-breaking components of strategy and vision, lack of precedence, those types of things. Now the other thing to look out for is as your conscientiousness rises, which is essentially your desire to be efficient, effective, busy, not waste time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:23):\nI'm high on that one.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:48:25):\nYeah, structured and organized, that is another contributor in the negative, which is it's objectively great to be a conscientious person, there are so many benefits, until we have to waste time productively, or we have to break order in organization. And then that strength that four days a week, or 28 days a month is great for you, on those days where we go and have the offsite and say, what if we blew it all up, to your example of new design, new website, blow it all up, start over again, different direction, that's where the conscientiousness is going to be like, why are we doing this? Why are we having this conversation? What's the need? This is inefficient, I could be spending my time doing something else.\n\n(00:49:09):\nAnd sometimes that'll express itself even in meetings of, I was in a meeting one time after we were acquired, this was eight or nine years ago now, and when you're a founder and you get acquired, there's a new flavor of habitat that you find yourself in with very new rituals. And one of the rituals that I find myself around a lot was the ritual of saying, we can't talk about this for the rest of our lives. And we would be about six minutes into a meeting when somebody would drop the, \"We can't talk about this for the rest of our lives\" line, and I would look at my watch and be like, \"I didn't realize that you were terminal, I mean, why are you even in this meeting if you're about to die?\"\n\n(00:49:53):\nBecause my take on this is we are super far away from the rest of our lives right now, why are you saying that we can't talk about something for six minutes when the diminishing return of added information in the priming of this meeting, to use that again, you knowing X quadruples your decision quality, and you are resisting knowing X. Now we're going to hit a point where you knowing Y, Z, etc, we've hit a diminishing return and now I'm improving your decision quality by 1% instead of by 4x. But we haven't established any sensitivity in this room to the diminishing return curve of incremental thought and incremental information. And this is like a new habitat, I'm like, in this habitat do people really hate thought? Do people really consider themselves to be the police that watch the mean streets of intellectualism for any activity? It's just kind of crazy. But yeah, that's kind of the practical side of this, is you got to watch out and you got to be careful, and that's why I habitat is such a big deal because that's a perfect example of a well-intentioned room with mostly people that are there for the right reasons and the right outcomes, but where this normalness of saying a phrase like that, or saying, \"I disagree.\" Same meeting person goes, \"I completely disagree,\" and I was like, \"With everything?\" \"Absolutely everything.\" And I go, so let's look at the meta, the overhead camera of this meeting.\n\n(00:51:33):\nThis was the initiation of combat, that's what the brain is seeing. All the brains in the room are like, oh, fight, right? And now what are our objectives? My objective now becomes win, their objective, because they've taken a huge risk of saying, I disagree with everything, becomes win, and because they are disagreeing with a lot of stuff that they don't understand, the inevitability is they're about to be annihilated in this room where they have both said, we can't talk about this forever, and now put all of their chips onto the table to say, \"I completely disagree,\" instead of, \"I have a question,\" or, \"Can we pull that thread?\" Or, \"I don't see how these dots connect.\"\n\n(00:52:15):\nSo that on a super tactical level, there's things we say that activate the amygdala, the combat mode of the brain, versus a different choice of phrase which is going to activate the prefrontal cortex which is like, \"Hey Lenny, you're connecting these two dots, I'm not seeing how they're connected,\" logic, now let's activate the prefrontal cortex with this sentence instead of, \"Lenny, that's dumb, I completely disagree,\" let's activate the amygdala instead.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:43):\nI want to talk about this habitat point you're making which I think is really important, but just to close the loop on the strategy vision piece, so just to give people some very tactical advice is, basically understand your personality, maybe take this CORE identity test, or something like that, understand if you're low in openness and high-end conscientiousness, maybe you're not amazing at vision and it's going to be hard for you to think big and think of it-\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:53:06):\nYeah, your brain is just going to feel agitated when you're around vision. But, I mean, you can still do it, right? You can still ask people to translate. The key tactic is, okay, it's not this you're predestined to suck, it's more if you're low and openness, especially if you're also high in conscientiousness, then recognize your native language for ideas is a mismatch for the native language of vision and really, really good strategy.\n\n(00:53:35):\nAnd then you can be open about that and you can ask for some translations, and you can ask for... I mean, trust doesn't have to be non-participation, you can actually say, it would help me trust if you could explain this gap. A great example would be a second order effect, why should we have awesome documentation? How are we going to make more money if we have awesome documentation? Great question, don't be hostile in the way you asked it, but just help me understand, what thread are we pulling? Well, we're pulling this thread of customer satisfaction, retention, recommendation, et cetera, Stripe is really good at this, especially from the early days, that great documentation justifies all sorts of second order effects that then will lead us to this first order effect you're asking about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:20):\nAwesome, okay, that's really great. And I was going to go one direction, but I want to talk about this real quick. Something that comes up a lot on this podcast is the power of leaning into strengths and not feeling like you have to be amazing at everything, and that in this example, I have a low openness, high conscientiousness, I can still be very successful in the role by, in my opinion, leaning into things I'm actually really strong at, say conscientiousness, and I'm also high in agreeableness. I don't like the sound of that. Thoughts on just, it's okay if you're not amazing at vision because your openness is low, but you can be better at other stuff and together you can be really successful no matter how your personality.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:55:03):\nAbsolutely right, yeah. I mean, the truth is we look at, taking that Canva example of coaches and managers, not only does that change the way an employee feels about the way this connection they have is invested in them, but it also changes inherently a lot of the meeting dynamics and teaming dynamics from hierarchical feeling things manager to more mesh based intellect. And within the mesh, you don't have to worry too much about the hierarchy anymore. You can say, this is the nature of my contribution.\n\n(00:55:39):\nSo even in the vision and strategy piece, maybe your contributions to idea generation, there are going to be some, and they're probably going to be good. But those are not ideas to protect in the state that you brought them to the table, they're ideas to set on the table so that people can surround them and improve them. And then as other people contribute ideas that aren't as natural to you, kind of just realize we're not in the phase yet of judging and ranking and prioritizing these ideas, that's not where we are in the overall storyline. So let it happen, and then if you can improve those ideas, improve them.\n\n(00:56:15):\nAnd once ideas have that early stage, that kind of like what Jony Ive described as the infancy of an idea, when it's really weak and delicate and susceptible, if you can nurture that idea to adolescence where it has a little bit of ability to defend itself, then now you're in a situation where your conscientiousness can start to think about things like how would we resource this? What sequencing makes the most sense? What is the ROI of these things relative to each other? And consider the second and third order effects, and so on. And what would the project plans, and to your point of being both conscientious and agreeable, you are this master of coordination and alignment naturally.\n\n(00:56:56):\nSo when that phase of the project begins and we have to get people bought in, high functioning together, getting on the same page, staying focused, getting the project done, all of the people that were good at the beginning with all the vision and strategy, they are just a complete disaster in that phase. That's just how things really work in the real world, and I think we're so, again, focused, like we talked about at the beginning, we alluded to the fact you have to unpack enough complexity. I love the Einstein quote, \" Make things as simple as possible but no simpler,\" and we've made things way simpler than possible in business by saying this is the right way of doing the whole thing.\n\n(00:57:41):\nIt's like, no, no, no, if you've ever lived a day in real life, building a real product, the dynamics shift a lot throughout the course of product life cycle, as an example, or really any life cycle as an example. And the peak humans as the dynamics shift are very different, peak humans. Lenny is awesome here, contributes here 10%, contributes here 98%. Evan contributes 98% here, please get Evan out of the room when it comes to these meetings, that's great. And yes, we should lean into our strengths, but not so much that we don't know our weaknesses, because another human strength on your team is the patch for the bug of your weakness. And we run buggy software in companies and we say, \"Oh, I am leaning into my strengths, I don't need to worry about my weaknesses,\" well, then you become the person who needs everything translated into your language because when your weakness flares its head up, it slows everybody else down.\n\n(00:58:41):\nSo it's really, just from an operations business fluidity perspective, a team that is highly unaware of its weaknesses is going to have a lot of slowness and a lot of problems as a result of that. They don't have to fix all their weaknesses, but be aware of them and know who is a patch to your weakness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:58):\nEvan, this is so interesting. I love that we're digging deep on this. Is there one tactical thing you could recommend for someone to become better at openness in, say, a brainstorming experience when they're doing vision, or when they're low at this, say me.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:59:13):\nI think the best exercise for a conscientious person especially to feel more open is to become obsessed with reverse engineering. And it's to say, there's two forms of reverse engineering that I think are really helpful here. Number one would be reverse engineering against a desired outcome, to truly understand the inputs that generate that outcome. And if we think about that at a big level, like, okay, we want to win a market, what are the real inputs to deconstruct that outcome and understand what our strategy should look like to attack all of the most relevant inputs that generate that outcome? I think that's the specific form.\n\n(00:59:55):\nAnd then at a super tactical level, if you want to give feedback to somebody, and let's say, for me, I'm low in politeness, you're probably much higher in politeness than I am, and I struggled for years with feedback to generate the intended outcome. I delivered the feedback, but the delivery wasn't the intended outcome, and the way that I delivered it actually reduced the probability of the intended outcome because I was being too impolite, too direct in many cases, too harsh. And what does harshness do to the brain? Well, that's crystal clear. So what I was doing and what science knows were very different things, and that's why I failed in those cases.\n\n(01:00:35):\nBut as soon as I started closing the gap and realized I need to try harder to think about the story arc of this feedback, that becomes clearest to me how to do it when I have the intended outcome in mind for the feedback, I really would like this person to start turning the corner on this particular way of thinking. If you and I worked together and it was about openness, we'd be like, what are some things that I could do right now to increment and set the stage for a big shift in openness as time goes on that you are bought into? And that's a very, if I'm impolite and be like, \"Lenny, what's your problem? Why can't you do this? Everybody else can do this.\"\n\n(01:01:13):\nYour willingness to start turning that corner, I mean, it may be there, the safety system is activated, like, oh, bad things could happen if I don't do this, but I don't want your safety system to motivate this change.I mean, in most cases, that's an optics based change instead of a material change that will occur. And that's why a lot of people, accountability is a great example, asking for accountability is the best way to not get it, because asking for accountability activates people's safety systems, or especially saying, \"I'm going to hold people accountable.\" Then everybody's like, oh, great, we should set up a whole movie set of facade houses that pretend everything's great with no substance behind them, and that's why so many companies end up that way. But yeah, I would say that's the tactical.\n\n(01:01:58):\nThe second thing to understand about openness and reverse engineering is just situational awareness. Very few conscientious people spend, in my opinion, as a very open person, enough time immersing themselves in the reality that is every day situational awareness necessary to do their job. Simplest example of this is how many executives have ever talked to N greater than five customers? That is a... Because, well, I'm busy. I got a lot of stuff to do, I don't have time to go take a world tour, which is like we don't have the rest of our lives to talk about this. I'm not asking you to take a world tour, I'm asking you to stuff into your brain enough situational awareness that the decisions you make every day that affect all those people you're not talking to are considering those people that you're not talking to.\n\n(01:02:49):\nSo less about an intended specific outcome in this case, and more about, do I really know the... I would think about this as if we think about aeronautical engineering, do I actually have an understanding of the conditions, the flight conditions, that I'm in every day in order to fly really well? And the answer to that for a lot of people is no. So reverse engineering is probably the whole category. I don't know if that makes enough tactical sense, I'm happy to be more descriptive, but that's the category I think is have you reversed engineered how to get outcomes and have you reversed engineered to predispose your mind to come up with really good ideas and good decisions, as opposed to come up with decisions that are super disconnected from reality.\n\n(01:03:37):\nGreat example being PLG, I mean, if you haven't done enough situational awareness work, you have no idea if PLG is a remotely viable strategy for growing your business. If it's remotely relevant strategy for growing your business. And company after company after company has leadership team obsessed with this concept that in principle we should be able to let people just sign up and swipe a credit card and onboard and great. No, we have a hyper technical solution, that is never going to happen, or that's not the way they do budget, or there could be any number of ways that that's not going to work out, and those are just some concrete examples.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.\n\n(01:04:49):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more, with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/Lenny, and 10x your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/Lenny.\n\n(01:05:38):\nIt feels like there's a fractal of stuff we could talk about and endless threads of things that I want to dig into. Let me shift a little bit to influence, we mentioned this a little bit earlier. I know you have a bunch of awesome advice on how to build your skill at becoming more influential, that's something a lot of listeners of the podcast, or product managers, also founders, need the skill. Who doesn't need to become better influencers? What can we learn about how to become better influencers?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:06:05):\nWe'll probably unpack a second topic and open up an off ramp here right at the beginning, but there's two things, there's influence itself and then there's relationships, and we should probably talk a little bit about relationships. Trying to exert influence through a dysfunctional relationship is not going to go great. And most human beings, especially when they go to work, are pretty out of sorts when it comes to relationships.\n\n(01:06:36):\nAnd you even hear crazy mantra like we have to each other to work together, which are like, good luck with that. I mean, just watch a text message pop up on a phone of a person who doesn't like you and watch their response time to the text message, or their Slack message, or whatever. I mean, you're talking about you've built in a multi-day, at least multi-hour delay into responsiveness purely because the relationship isn't good, and then you compound that effect over whatever size your company is. That's massive operational inefficiency just because I don't want to respond to Evan right now. So that's the one piece.\n\n(01:07:19):\nNow assuming the relationship is in place, and we'll come back to that and talk about that because a whole very actionable framework to unpack, assuming the relationship is good, I think the starting point for influence is to choose your character and choose your mode. It's almost like you're playing Elden Ring or some video game, and you're going to be like, am I going to influence him this way as the hero or the exemplar of these things, or am I going to influence through back channels, what is my character? And everybody for your personality has a natural fit for the character you're going to select as this mode of influence, and then you're going to pick a speed of influence, which is slow, moderate, or fast.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:08:00):\nThen you're going to pick a speed of influence, which is slow, moderate, or fast. The habitat can help a lot with this. If a founder is listening to this and you haven't created a habitat where fast influence is easy and the permission isn't there, then you're slowing the company down inadvertently by just not clarifying this with the team. So slow influence is the we'll let them find out the hard way influence. They're going off a cliff, we know they're going off a cliff. And a lot of times we find ourselves in what's called the Abilene paradox.\n\n(01:08:39):\nThe Abilene paradox is where everybody in the room knows it's a bad idea, but we're all like \"We're in.\" And the classic Abilene paradox kind of if you look up memes on Google, it'll be like the dad thinks that the kids might want to go camping. Mom doesn't want to go camping, the kids don't want to go camping. Dad also doesn't really want to go camping, but everybody's like, \"Dad probably wants us to go camping, so let's give it a go.\" And they all go and don't enjoy it. And we see that play out all the time.\n\n(01:09:09):\nAnd a lot of people will just say, \"I can't do anything. I don't have any influence in this case. We're just going to let him fail and they'll learn.\" Or this impolite person like me giving feedback the wrong way years in the past, I'm not going to sit Evan down and talk to him about this. He'll figure out on his own through failure that this doesn't work. And that can take months, that can take years, that can take a lifetime for people to learn the slow way. And it is a form of influence. You are being intentional to say, I think the world will create enough failure that adaptation will occur. That is a form of influence, just the slowest one.\n\n(01:09:48):\nAnd a lot of people listening probably realize, \"Oh, that's what I'm doing. How can I go way faster than just letting things fail?\" So that's where moderate influence comes in. And a great book to read for a moderate influence is the Challenger Sale. And in the Challenger Sale, what we're looking at is the concept of teaching people something. And then when they live with this new knowledge, they'll see things that they weren't seeing before. So for example, in the feedback example that we can keep using over and over again through this is, \"Hey Evan, you might want to notice people's body language while you're saying these things and here's some signs to look out for that when you've done this and you get this, that's probably a sign that people are bought in and still with you. And when you see this, that's probably a sign that people are pushing back.\"\n\n(01:10:37):\nAnd you can ask this question in that moment and you'll probably hear answers like this. So you're like giving somebody a tool that their future is going to unpack. And the Challenger Sale kind of assumes a long enough sales cycle where you're not going to land the sale in the meeting, you're not trying to close them right there. You'll teach them some stuff and you'll, \"Hey, if you see this stuff, that's a pretty clear sign that you need to take action. So why don't we call you in 30 days, and 30 days later we get on phone, \"Hey, have you been seeing this?\" And they'll go, \"Everywhere I look, I can't not see it now.\"\n\n(01:11:13):\nAnd that's how you influence a person in a few days, a few weeks, maybe a few months at worst, way faster than letting them fail.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:22):\nWe actually had, I don't know if you know this, we had the author of that book on the podcast, Matt Dixon, I think his name. And the Challenger Sale, the idea there is challenge their perspective and view on what is actually real about the market and what they need.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:11:36):\nExactly. Yeah. I think yes, there's the challenge component to it, but I think the underappreciated piece of that methodology is that you're still letting that person see the world, but you've given them new information that is breaking some calcification in their brain challenge. It's not the moment of the challenge where all the magic happens. There's moments that occur later that continue kind of putting that calcium, lime and rust melting formula on this expectation or this kind of decision in their mind to the point where sometimes they'll turn around and be like, \"Thank you for even telling me this.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:19):\nSo the advice here is if you're trying to influence someone, try to figure out what they don't know. Find information that you know they may not know because once they know that and they may be like, \"Oh wow, I totally see what you're saying.\"\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:12:33):\nYeah, exactly right. And let them know it and let them live with it. Don't cram it down their throat and make them accept it If they live with it just a little bit, even just a couple days, that might be enough to come back to a much softer conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:47):\nDoes this connect to what you said earlier, which I love this idea of pick a character, like pick your influence style based on your personality, whether it's back channeling and that makes me think of a very specific person. He's coming on the podcast actually, he's this Jedi that just gets people aligned but very behind the scenes, very the meetings before the meetings. So that's one character or it's just telling a compelling story probably in a deck. Or there's other character I guess. Does this idea of sharing information, is that a type of character or is that just something that everyone should just do because a really effective strategy?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:13:27):\nI like the idea of intentionality in just about everything. Are we letting trade winds push us into certain things or are we actually making choices? And I think that step of being intentional about your style and this kind of notion of a character is a wise step to take so that you can kind of have some guardrails as you go through this and some consistency. It helps other people understand the role you're playing in influence. If you are consistently coming from the same place, you're about that style, like I want to try to influence this organization by doing this way and you're going to see that from me over and over and over again.\n\n(01:14:07):\nYou kind of have given yourself a little permission and also you can get some buy-in from people. If you do want be more the barbarian kind of approach, you can say, \"Hey, I'm the devil's advocate approach, or I'm the break it and see if it still stands after I hit it really hard with a sledgehammer kind of guy.\" Is it okay if I do that over and over and over again? And now you've bought future you the permission to approach things in certain ways that would yield meaningfully different influence outcomes, like meaningfully different. I was able to do this and it accelerated something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):\nSo the way I am hearing this is there are many ways to get what you want, think about your personality style and find the path that is most aligned with the way you operate.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:14:52):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:52):\nWhether it's behind the scenes, whether it's a compelling story. Awesome. So this character is basically figure out what your... It kind of comes back to leverage your strengths, what are you good at? And use that channel to convince people of the thing you want them to be convinced of.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:15:08):\nYep, absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:11):\nMy mind goes to what are the list of ways, what are the character options in this list when I'm opening up the game and choosing? You went through a few, but just to give people like, oh, okay, I see I could try it this way. Is there a small list you could share of just like here's ways you could try approaching influence.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:15:27):\nProbably the dimensions are most valuable to people. I would say one of the dimensions is compassion, which is do I want to influence by trying to help people, by trying to make sure that we get it right and that people get value. And then the permission I'm seeking there is can I ask questions about why are we not thinking about the user right now? Why are we not concerned with the value they're getting and challenge us in that way?\n\n(01:15:59):\nI think there are characters based on logic and even belief, which is I would like to be the one to insert more knowledge and insert more causality into conversations and challenge causality in conversations to make us think harder and challenge what we believe and break up the sacred cows of the stuff we walked in the meeting with so that we feel differently about things walking out of meetings.\n\n(01:16:27):\nSo I think there's a bunch of different very useful dimensions. One could be very creativity based. If you follow this big five format, they're kind of spelled out for you. Enthusiasm, interesting dimension. I want to challenge us through the lens of what do people get excited about? What makes people feel good? Does this make people feel good? And are there tweaks we could make to the product or this marketing campaign or whatever.\n\n(01:16:54):\nLook at what Siki just did with Runway. I mean I love that guy so much and there's so many components of his character and obviously the characters he surrounded himself with that contribute to really next level stuff. And they're definitely challenging each other using these dimensions of compassion to be the character of caregiver or the character of protector. And so there's a bunch of different ways you could turn those dimensions into characters.\n\n(01:17:28):\nBut I think when you see the value of each of those perspectives, especially in product, I'm a really big fan of product. If you have dysfunctionally high compassion, dysfunctionally high openness, you have internal rewards and motivations to explore regions of product that other minds aren't exploring as intuitively. And you don't have to have the whole deck to be amazing at product. But you have some unfair advantages if you are super prone to reverse engineering just by your nature. You are going to be more situationally aware and probably make a series of vastly better decisions than the team that has a lot less situational awareness than you do. It's a huge advantage.\n\n(01:18:16):\nBut when it comes to the concept of influence. I mean figuring out these dimensions that define who you are and then using them to kind of say, \"I want the permission to ask a series of questions and challenge our thinking through this very intuitive strength that I have.\" Can we all see the value in that or do I need to further sell myself? And then you'll find you can take on that character and play that role really well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:45):\nI imagine the ultimate unlock is that combined with what is that person's personality style and what is the best way they receive information, which is a little harder. Because you can't force them to take some tests and you can't make them give you the results. But I know a lot of teams do these tests together as a team and share the results. And so it's I guess a reminder of just that's really powerful if you and your team, especially the execs at company.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:19:09):\nYeah, exactly. And when you move into this vulnerability out of your three choices state, we don't need a bunch of data for that to work really well. If you said, \"Hey, I'm not super strong at this,\" and the rest of the room was like, well \"Wait, this other person's super awesome at this, why don't not the two of you work together,\" then it's like under 30 seconds we've unlocked potential that wasn't there.\n\n(01:19:34):\nSo you want to get business.... I kind of think of extending the video game metaphor. Not only are we choosing our characters or we are a certain character, but the business has a difficulty setting that we chose based on the habitat. And I've worked in and with way too many companies where we are playing the game in nightmare and every enemy takes a thousand shotgun shells to bring down instead of just switching the difficulty setting to easy, which is like the enemies somehow become our friends as we go through this journey.\n\n(01:20:06):\nI mean, it really can be that transformative, especially with a case like yours that you talked about. Okay, I am not as high in openness. I'm very high in conscientiousness. If I can admit this and ask different types of questions, everybody else in the room will be like the difficulty setting of this just went to zero and the speed of it just went to way higher than it used to be.\n\n(01:20:32):\nAnd we underestimate this kind of less concrete part of the business world. And I mean that's the genesis of this whole business that I was crazy enough to start after starting other companies in the past, which is like we are underestimating how much of our operational reality is a function of our human reality. And are we doing enough? Are we doing the right things to close the gap between what science knows and what business does? And do we even know what the science is? Have we educated ourselves to close the gap? And then it becomes super obvious, oh, this makes a lot of sense to be open and find the patch to my bug. And here we go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:13):\nThis fractal of topics continues to grow. I'm trying to contain it. There's three things I want to try to talk about in the rest of our chat, that stuff we've touched on that I think will be really useful to people. One is relationships. You mentioned there's more to talk about there just how to build great relationships. Two is I want to come back to the habitat and building a habitat that is very conducive to innovation and speed and success and those sorts of things. And then I want to talk about focus. We talked a bit about just how important focus is and how differently our brains operate in different states of focus. So maybe we start with the relationship piece just because that connects to what we were just talking about of how do we strengthen relationships, create better relationships within our teams.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:21:53):\nYeah, so we were talking about relationships kind of as this off ramp or this kind of sidecar to influence. And real quickly the fast mode of influence and relationships goes really well together. So we talked about the slow and the moderate. The fast mode of influence is cognitive dissonance. It's essentially saying in the moment, I'm not going to wait for you to experience anything. It's saying in the moment, how does this formula compute? Explain to me, Evan, how you being too blunt in feedback is going to end up in a human being changing. Why do you believe that?\n\n(01:22:29):\nAnd especially it's that second phrase of why do you believe that drill below the behavior down into the belief. What do you believe that has you doing this? And then we can explore how preposterous the belief itself is, which then bubbles up to the surface level of this.\n\n(01:22:47):\nAnd if in the environment, the habitat's a huge component of this as our relationships, which is if you have great relationships where people trust each other enough to have this kind of cognitive dissonance conversation, and we have a habitat that is very clear that we are free to discuss cognitive dissonance and logical disconnects, that is really important to do. Then you activate fast influence mode basically. So that's a really important thing. And then as you transition to relationships, well what are... The question that everybody kind of glosses over in my opinion is what is a relationship? I don't know how you feel about answering that question, but it's a really hard-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):\nI would just go to ChatGPT. What is a relationship?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:23:33):\nExactly, right. Yeah. At this point we have some help that we didn't use to have. But the other thing that goes along with what is a relationship is how good is my relationship with person X? Like, you and I both know Shreyas and how good is our relationship? I would say it's awesome. Why is it awesome? I don't know. It just feels great. So let's double click on a good definition and a good framework because once you actually know why a relationship feels great, that example or why a relationship feels super difficult, now we can start to build some strategies, some actual action plans for them.\n\n(01:24:14):\nSo what we propose to people is if you take that third component of your brain ability, that is one piece of your relationships, especially your professional relationships. So if you know an engineer and you have an idea of something you want to build and they have the ability to build it, their ability and their utility to you is a function of your relationship and it will contribute to the positive or negative force that you feel in that relationship. Like, wow, this person has a lot of ability. My appreciation is higher, my faith in them is higher, my cooperation with them is higher.\n\n(01:24:50):\nIf you question a person's ability or they've proven that ability is kind of unreliable, those things start to kind of vector downwards and we will pick on Shreyas through this as a good example? Because I think most of the people watching also know him. What is his ability? What is his utility? As high as I've ever seen. I mean every conversation he's intellectually conceptually additive to. You're better after you've talked to him every time. At least that's been my experience with him.\n\n(01:25:20):\nAnd we all know people like that, with various fields and various abilities. So that's one piece that's really important. And why as an individual, it's so important to invest in your ability because it is so integral to every relationship you have, particularly professional relationships and your ability, knowledge, your reasoning, your imagination, your skill set, these are all incrementable facets of you.\n\n(01:25:50):\nAnd that's really, really key. Now here's the plot twist. Your ability is actually not the most important part of a relationship, biologically speaking. There's two more that matter quite a bit more. And the surprise ending is that the third one matters the most, which is scary in some cases.\n\n(01:26:11):\nThe second factor of relationships is trust. So trust in the brain. If we go very primitive back to the amygdala that we talked about earlier, trust is simply risk. Human level risk and trust can span from strongly negative to strongly positive in a relationship. And we felt that full range with different people in our lives. Strongly negative trust is the brain saying, this person is dangerous to me. They're very likely to try to undermine me. They're very likely to not deliver something. Personal harm will occur by essentially kind of interacting in this relationship.\n\n(01:26:51):\nAnd then on the other side of trust, we kind of try to create some levels to this to keep it clean. And the fractal continues to grow a little bit, but we'll try to keep this simple. But I like to think of trust one, two and three. Three distinct levels of trust. And trust one is, let's say we're having a cookout. Trust one is Lenny, could you please bring the chips, ideally sealed, but it's a delegation of a simple non-critical task knowing that it is likely to get done and get done decently well. But it's not like this huge level of trust. It's the people that we work with where this type of delegation, and especially if people delegate under the thesis of \"I want to do the high value work, so let me put the low value work on other people.\" That's all the low value work that we put on other people, and it allows us to purify our focus on the high value work, and we don't need all the low value work to go beautifully well or be artistically brilliant.\n\n(01:27:53):\nSo trust two is when we step up to almost like \"I need to do this myself. Is there anybody who could do it as well as me?\" That there's no risk to me having them do it instead of me doing it. And that's where you get true scalability of teams. So if you can trust people enough, your brain's assessment of risk of giving this task to someone else or giving this knowledge even to somebody else, that they'll treat it the way you would treat it, is a significantly higher positive trust that you can feel in a relationship.\n\n(01:28:26):\nAnd then finally, trust three is when we do hit these breakpoints in our brain where we say the way your mind works is beyond the way my mind works on this topic. So the classic example at the cookout would be if Wolfgang Puck was a neighbor, we're going to have Wolfgang Puck do all the most critical stuff and maybe even set up the music and the decor and whatever. Or another example would be like when Steven Spielberg has John Williams score a film, he's not hoping John will do it as well as Steven would do it. He's saying, \"Just send me the bill. Try not to go too crazy.\" But he is not going to sit down with the invoice and be like, \"Why did you need 13 horns instead of 11?\" John just gets to do what John does because there's so much trust in this kind of beyond my event horizon kind of risk. It would be riskier for me to do it than for him to do it or her to do it, right?\n\n(01:29:25):\nSo that's kind of the level, but that matters more to a human being because the safety system, if it activates, your utility is sunk. So if you're an awesome engineer but you damage people, it doesn't matter that you're an awesome engineer because in the social network, the mesh of your organization, you are a node that has a protective covering around it. Information is not flowing to you the way it would normally, and delegation is not flowing to you and access is not flowing to you the way it would normally. So you are a kind of protected, deactivated, sequestered node of the mesh at this point in time. And a lot of people really don't get that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):\nYeah, that's a really good way of visualizing.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:30:16):\nAnd then here's the surprise ending. The last piece of every relationship that you have is appeal. Appeal is how your brain interprets the shared experiences you have with other people. Whether or not you look forward to being around that person, whether or not you like their style, the feel of what shared experiences really are. And if you think about, let's pick on Shreyas one last time. What is his ability and utility? Off the charts. To what extent can he be trusted? Trust three, off the charts. Will he ever damage somebody? I mean, not to my knowledge. He may have some really dark past that we don't know about, but as far as I've seen, not a lot of damage in his wake. And then thirdly, what kind of experience is he? He's an extraordinarily positive experience. So he naturally accumulates great relationship after great relationship after great relationship.\n\n(01:31:15):\nAnd again, if you're that great engineer with a ton of ability, now let's flip the middle dimension. And we trust you a lot, but you're a horrible experience. Are you coming to our offsite? Are you in this meeting? No, you're gone. We don't want you there. You're like a hurricane. So biologically speaking, the biggest bug in our programming as we transfer this to the business context is what makes the most sense in business is the most, if it's a meritocracy, the best people with the best knowledge that we can trust should be in the room and we will fight it with every fiber of our being if they're a terrible experience. And that's a bummer. And what's funny is you can flip it. We all either have friends or know people who have friends that you cannot trust, they have no ability to speak of, but they're a super awesome experience. What a great friend.\n\n(01:32:16):\nSo how is it that we get this thing completely flipped? And I think that's the thing. As you parse that list, as anybody listening parses that list, it's critical to ask what kind of experience am I? That is where to start? Not how good am I at my job? How much do I know? How critical am I to this process? But am I a miserable experience? And if the answer is yes, don't worry too much about the other pieces yet, you got to fix that first.\n\n(01:32:48):\nAnd to this point of the profile, as you parse the profile, you'll find things like obviously not a pleasant experience, like being really impolite, obviously not a pleasant experience, being super overbearing and assertive, obviously not a pleasant experience, being hyper low in openness and enacting out of that and telling everybody they're overcomplicating everything all the time. Not a great experience for people who are actually well-intentioned trying to get it right. So there's concrete things that you can do with this knowledge in mind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:16):\nThis last piece makes me think about why some of the most effective PMs are the PMs that bring a lot of energy and positivity to the team and just get people excited, which is such a soft skill, but such a powerful thing you can do for your team because people kind of look to you to lead them. I had a PM I was working with in every meeting, he is like, \"This is going to be awesome.\" He just comes right in every meeting, \"Oh, who's ready to make some decisions,\" and it really changes everything. And so this is amazing advice.\n\n(01:33:46):\nSo basically if you want better relationships, which will make you a better influencer, start with what kind of experience am I, when people work with me, ask me for stuff, ask me questions, and you shared a bunch of specific things you can do.\n\n(01:34:03):\nSomething I always tell people is just try to smile, just look happy. That makes a big difference.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:34:07):\nLook happy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:10):\nBring energy, look happy. Just try to be excited. Yeah, so if you want to build better relationships which have all these amazing trickle down effects, your advice is think about the experience you are to other people when they work with you, work on trust and ideally get to the place that third level of you are doing it better than them. But that's a high bar for all things. And then the last thing is, are you actually amazing? Work in your abilities, that's kind of the last piece.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:34:38):\nYeah, exactly. And it's not that none of these become unimportant because the other are kind of the gateways. I mean your relationships require all three, especially your professional relationships. So yeah, it's more just like if experience is the only thing undermining you when you're otherwise very trustworthy and very skilled and able, that's a shame. Just fix it.\n\n(01:35:03):\nAnd there's a whole bunch of ways to go about that. But I like to leave that to people to explore that creatively. Like well, \"Oh gosh, okay, I can change this to this to this.\" On the trust thing, do you hurt people? I mean, that's it. Do people have a reason to believe that you are risky or dangerous? And unfortunately in a lot of habitats, the habitat itself either allows or even rewards people that are super untrustworthy to play the system in advance of the system. And as you talk to Jeffrey about the power conversation, the worse the habitat, the more his suggestions work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):\nI could see that.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:35:49):\nAnd the reason that he's correct, he used the phrase, \"This is how the world always has been, is how it is, and it's how it always will be.\" Well, it's how the normal dysfunctional world always has been, is and will be. And if you want people in your organization to rise on merit and for influence to work to generate better decision-making, make better products, have a better company, move faster, et cetera, you need to create a habitat where what Jeffrey's observed about the normal dysfunctional world largely doesn't work within your habitat. So if it's effective for people to harm each other in your habitat, you are performing at a much lower level than if harming each other was extremely ineffective. And that's up to you as a leader, as a manager, et cetera. And then of course, skill is what it is. It's your ability to convert your intents into outcomes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:48):\nI'm glad you're talking about habitat, that's exactly where I wanted to go. So just two more things I want to spend our time on, habitat and focus, how to create more space for focus and get better focus. So you've touched on this many times at this point, this idea of a habitat. I think another way to think about this is the culture of your company. Is that right?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:37:06):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:06):\nOkay, cool. So are there a few things you could recommend to people to create a habitat that is conducive of good stuff?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:37:15):\nLet's start at the start here. So in the difference between what science knows and business does, let's kind of zero in on the fact that the way most companies approach culture has a very shaky track record. Like if mission, vision, values was an airline, you would not allow any family to fly on that airline. It does not arrive at most of its intended destinations. That is just a super important starting point because I'm going to kill a sacred cow here while we talk about this. And I don't want anybody to feel like I'm trying to be mean or anything. It's just it's worth looking at stuff that doesn't work and wondering if there's something that could work a lot better. So if we look at habitat and culture, it's really about what people believe. It's what people believe is acceptable, permissible, productive, and the biggest flaw in people's approach to culture. And interestingly enough, even at YC, they talk about this mission, vision, values, culture, stuff that comes later, let some stuff happen with the business that comes later. They're right to say that if that's the paradigm you're going to use because it's not going to work either way. So you might as well do it later.\n\n(01:38:31):\nBut if you're going to do it the right way and investigate human beliefs, and we talked about priming for example, culture is just the macro priming of the entire business of what your central belief systems are and then the permission that forms from those belief systems. So if you've done that really well, you should do that right at the very beginning. In what way should we approach this company, building this, working together, et cetera? That would be really, really helpful to get right from day one. And the belief system that people have, there are two approaches to changing people's beliefs.\n\n(01:39:10):\nMission, vision, values is what we call a performative approach. Meaning I'm going to come up with some expression of an inspiring mission, inspiring values and inspiring vision, and it's going to be performed well enough. It's going to be like if we were busking in the park, this is going to be a cool enough mission, vision, values that people throw some change into my guitar case and they buy into it, they gather around. And I think that's just completely the wrong approach because we're hoping to inspire people. We're hoping to be artistically talented enough to pull that off. The other approach is to be deductive, logically deductive, which is centrally speaking. There is hopefully a market out there that's glad our company exists, who is glad we exist, why are they glad we exist? And that's shifting our mission into something that we call your role, the role you play in the world around you.\n\n(01:40:08):\nWho is glad you exist? Why are they glad you exist? And that is a fact. That is not an inspiring idea. That is like, okay, we work with this company that does AI-based optical character recognition, document ingestion, et cetera. Why is the world glad that they exist? Well, because we get 95% of the documents scanned into structured data that normally people have to transfer by hand. That's pretty compelling. Why is the world glad Warby Parker exists? Because before you used to choose between looking dumb and it being cheap and looking cool and it being expensive, and now you can look cool and it's cheap. The world's really glad we exist.\n\n(01:40:50):\nNow that's true. I don't need you to be inspired to believe that that is true. And now everything that we're going to think about for the rest of our beliefs, we're going to deduce from that. So we're just going to use logic to build our culture, not inspiration. So this next thing we need to figure out is how can we understand the specific value that's created when we play this role in the world? We save people money, we save people time, we open up markets, we help people explore possibilities and potential they couldn't tap into otherwise, etc.\n\n(01:41:21):\nSo what's the role of Core? People are glad we exist because we tap into potential they had no access to before. And at the team level, at the company level, that could be a really big deal. So we know that and we say, \"Okay, well gosh, that implies so much.\" There's so much we got to do now what value does that produce? And then I could say, okay, once we understand the definition of value, which comes out of our role, now we can change the definition of done. So a lot of teams talk about bias to action. And hamsters have bias to action. They get up out of their straw and they turn that wheel as hard as they possibly can and they go absolutely nowhere. But if you understand the role you play-\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:42:01):\nBut if you understand the role you play in the world, and you understand the value you produce in terms of time savings, cost savings, upside, whatever it is that you do, then you can say, \"We should have a bias to impact, not a bias to action. We shouldn't just do stuff, we should have an effect that has the result of value creation. We should save people time.\" And now when you're a product team, looking at this, and you're saying, \"Well, here's a cool new idea, Lenny, let's do this.\" You can now use that as a habitat level permission to be like, \"Oh, how does that produce value for people? How does that make people go faster, save time, get smarter, do something they couldn't do otherwise?\" And then you can still use that exact same vocabulary when you go sell it to them, \"This is how it makes you faster, smarter, more efficient, save cost.\"\n\n(01:42:50):\nSo it's like really logical deduction. And if people think that we should do something, build a product that doesn't create value. Now instead of being inspiring, we can be logical. We don't build things that produce no value, that is not a priority until we can turn it into something that does produce value. So you're turning culture into something highly usable, in getting away from performative culture into logical deductive culture. And I think that's really, really the key for most people is to say, \"Let's understand why the world's glad we exist.\" That's why we have a team, that's why we have customers. And what does that imply about our standards for ourselves when we execute in value creation? Even down to the email. If I send some wonky email reply to somebody's question and it doesn't produce value for them, I'm not done. I need to finish the job until it produces value for them.\n\n(01:43:43):\nQuality standards are baked into this, that again is implied. Would I be happy that Warby Parker exists, if they shipped me something that's a two out of 10 in quality? No. So we can't make things that are two out of 10. And everybody has a belief. There are plenty of people that probably interview at Warby Parker that think, two out of 10 is perfectly fine, just get it to them. And no, we need an antibody to that belief. We have decision-making intelligence, which everybody believes we should go fast, break stuff, or we should be super slow, and get everything right and wherever in between. That's a fun one to talk about. And then finally, you have a teaming dynamic belief, which is essentially every single human's belief of what is acceptable treatment of other human beings. What state does that put the other human in?\n\n(01:44:35):\nAnd a lot of people, particularly like I'll pick on myself with the low politeness, will spend years thinking, \"I'm giving honest feedback quickly. This is efficient.\" And you're like, \"How is it efficient when it takes people six months instead of six minutes to act on your feedback because they just don't like you so much, and you have this appeal problem that keeps you out of all the rooms?\" Actually your utility, which, your politeness is a utility transferred mechanism, but we don't want you in the room. So you're not a business benefit in this case. So that's kind of the starting point. That's ground zero of habitat is do not build an habitat on the roots of inspiration. It doesn't work. It can work, right? If you do it super inspiring stuff and you're super inspiring people, then you probably have the artistic ability to pull that off. But even then, you'd still be better off if you would do it through logical deduction instead of inspiration.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:45:36):\nSay someone is like, \"Okay, I'm going to improve my habitat, I'm going to improve my company culture. Or I'm just going to start setting up a good habitat.\" What's something they can do? What can they do today, this week, to just start to do that? Is it, sit down and think about what is the value we provide? Why do we exist? Is there something else you'd recommend?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:45:54):\nSo the brain craves an answer to the question, why am I doing this? And not only are there things we should start doing, but I like to deepen the commitment in people's minds to what we should start doing, by thinking of it as, we should start doing things that we've been negligent in doing, right? Not just, oh, this would be even better, but we are actually causing some habitat problems by being negligent in certain things. So the primary thing that people are negligent in is answering the question, why should I do this, to their team. And saying, you should do this because it's your job is a form of negligence, right? You're not actually answering that question in any useful way. Because I could also answer that in the safety way, which I sort of just did by saying, it's your job. I'm implying that there's a consequence. But I could be like, because if you don't, here's the specific bad things that will happen.\n\n(01:46:52):\nYou could be giving them a why in terms of reward, because, oh, if you do this, you get this, or if we do this, we get this. But you could also be giving them a purposeful answer to why, which is not a form of negligence, which is to say, because our work actually matters. There are people out there waiting on us to ship this product to improve their situation, and they also want us to get it right at the same time. So bias to impact through that lens. We do need to ship this. It needs to happen, and it needs to be right, or at least right enough in its first version.\n\n(01:47:28):\nSo if you have been negligent, and we all have at times, right? I'm not trying to judge, but I'm trying to convict, right? To build some conviction, to build some commitment. If you have been negligent in answering to all these minds that work with you, why we're even doing this. That's the starting point, is make sure everybody knows why. And that why is a shared why across the team. And not just the Simon Sinek big picture why? I mean, very specific why. That for my team, when we build training materials, when we look at it through that lens of, if we get this right, this is what happens to teams, and companies, and products and their customers.\n\n(01:48:12):\nThere's a through line at the big deal and that's why we can't do it this way, or that's why we should get more obsessed with quality, and why we should get more interdependent as a team and stop doing things that are just our own ideas. But say, \"Hey Lenny, I'm thinking about doing it this way. Is there anything you'd add before I hit go?\" And then you'd be like, \"Oh, I think it would be 10% better if you did it this way.\" And then now our product is 10% better. So that's kind of the square one is ask yourself, when's the last time our team had a conversation about why we're even doing any of this? What value it produces? Who is affected by our decisions? And if that hasn't happened in a while, that's not good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:57):\nIs another way to think about this, your mission, is that a term?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:49:02):\nYeah, I think it's an alternative to mission, I try... And I don't want to stomp all over mission, vision, values because I think they can work. But I think it's easier for people to conceptualize the importance of their work, if they understand, we are playing a role, not fulfilling a mission. And role implies obligation. There's no obligation in mission, unless you feel the inspiration so powerfully. And these differences are subtle, but neurologically, it's different. If I tell your brain, \"Here are the people counting on you to get this right, Lenny.\" Your brain activates a region called the anterior insular cortex, which starts to think about other people in the context of the solution you're creating.\n\n(01:49:45):\nAnd if I say, \"We are here to change people's lives through this,\" in a more general sense, your prefrontal cortex will still activate to solve the problem, but your anterior insular cortex will not, to more deeply consider the humans affected by the problem. So you're kind of adding to the toolkit of what the brain will bring to the table to generate solutions. And if you activate more good regions of the brain, you get better solutions. So I lean into this. Personally, I'm like, \"You really don't need a mission statement. You need to understand the role you play, and people need to have some response, some physiological, like, 'I get it, to my actions impact people.'\" And if they don't have a response, you should go find a human who does, for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:50:35):\nOne last thread I want to follow, focus. You have some really cool advice on how to help. And this just comes from everybody wants to get better focus. Everyone wants their team to have more time for focus. Everyone wants their engineers to sit there and build things faster, their designers to get stuff done. And it all comes from getting really good at focus and creating space for focus on your team. What advice do you have for folks that want to personally learn to focus better, and to help their team have more time for focus, get stuff done essentially?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:51:10):\nI mean, isn't this the question? Because this is where it all ends, right? First things first, let's look at the neuroscience that we have available to us. Which is, the study of focus either is or is tightly associated with the study of what's called brain waves. That's becoming a lot more popular. We're seeing it even in athletes, like professional golfers, or studying how their brain waves are focused on the golf shot and which mode to put the brain into to play golf at the highest level. Same thing applies to work. There's a bunch of different kind of bands of brain waves. Most of them actually are when you're asleep. So your REM cycles, your deep sleep cycles, your kind of drowsy cycles, those are brain waves. You can feel your brain turning off, you can feel your brain turning on when you dream. But when you're awake, there's really three primary modes that your brain is in.\n\n(01:52:03):\nThe nerdy side of this, kind of the nerdy language is alpha, beta and gamma. Those are the distinct ranges of brain activity, and they basically represent how focused your brain is. So alpha is quite simply daydreaming. So your brain is very quiet and empty. Easy metaphor is if you're in your house at night and everything's quiet, you hear things that you don't hear during the daytime, and that's what alpha is like in the brain. Your brain is actually working subconsciously a lot. But when you're busy, which is beta, your brain is too noisy to hear any of those little creaks and pops in the house. But when you're in alpha, you hear stuff.\n\n(01:52:41):\nSo the most common setting for alpha for most people is the shower. So it unlocks this mystery of like, why do I have all these ideas in the shower? Well, it's because your brain is in alpha. It hears these little creaks and pops inside of the attic, and it unpacks them. He goes, \"Oh, that's an interesting idea,\" it comes out of nowhere. It can be driving, gardening, car washing, cycling, whatever. As long as there's not too much cognitive load, then you can be daydreaming. And I'll come back to this in a second because there's a big permission problem at the habitat level for some of these focus levels.\n\n(01:53:14):\nBeta is productivity mode. So if you've ever seen somebody with a poster on their back wall that says, \"Get shit done,\" that's basically just a poster that says beta on it. I love beta. And answer emails, have meetings, write code. And there are some gamma code, deeper thinking scenarios where you're writing code, delivering presentations, making presentations. So much of our workday is beta, and it's just... I mean, some of us have an infinite amount of demand for beta work. There's just a never ending stream of stuff we could do and get done.\n\n(01:53:55):\nAnd then gamma is your brain's intense focus. So if you're learning something really complicated, you're learning thermodynamics in college or something like that, and you're just like, \"Wow, this is not easy.\" And you have to really push your brain to grapple with these concepts, connect the dots, even remember certain things, that's gamma. And we feel that sometimes at work, that here's a problem, a complex issue that we could tackle in beta by slapping duct tape on it, or we could tackle in gamma by reverse engineering, and going deep. And that's where we start to connect the dots that we talked about earlier, that focus and reverse engineering are related. That in beta, you have no intention to learn anything new to get something done, to think more deeply to get something done, to reconsider an existing process, or structure, or framework in your mind to get something done, you're going to utilize those things to get something done.\n\n(01:54:52):\nGamma is where we go, \"I would normally do it this way. I can see why that's not the right way. I need to make something new. I need to break my framework and build a brand new one right now to do something.\" So we generally spend too much time in beta in work, and that's both a judgment call, because I certainly have my own opinion about beta. I call it the conscientiousness crisis, which is conscientiousness wants beta, openness wants gamma. I'm kind of thinking of tying these pieces together. And it's not that conscientiousness is inherently a crisis, but when you meet teams that haven't done any innovation, haven't rethought the market, have become insensitive to changes in the environment around them, have become insensitive to their own employee problems and are still just kind of like this locomotive that keeps on going, irrespective of what's going on around it. It's that heads-down form of conscientious beta, that feels like, \"Now's not the time, let's stay focused, let's stay focused,\" et cetera.\n\n(01:55:53):\nSo we don't want to get rid of beta, we got a lot of work to do. But let's put a rule of thumb out there for people to explore, because it's going to be subjective to every team and every company. But as a rule of thumb, if 25% of your year is spent in gamma and alpha, you're probably a lot better off than the teams who spend less than 25% of their year thinking deep, and being in this more daydreaming mode. So what I wanted to circle back on is, how could we possibly daydream productively? Well, that's preposterous. And this is where you can build in your mind... And I do have another PDF for this, if people want to see it.\n\n(01:56:32):\nBut you can build in your mind a 3 x 3 grid where we have the safety system, reward, and purpose system in columns. We have alpha, beta and gamma in rows, and we basically have a list of nine channels that the brain can activate to generate different types of thinking. And most of the companies out there, most of the teams out there, are primarily, all their programming comes from safety beta and reward beta. How can I be busy to get rewards, ROI, customers, deals, whatever? Even promotions, more self-centered kind of rewards? And beta safety, which would be, how can I be busy? Optics, manage my reputation, avoid risk, that sort of stuff?\n\n(01:57:19):\nThe crisis is basically realizing, spending too much time in those two out of our nine available boxes, is probably not generating anywhere near the ideal outcomes. And if we could instead shift to the purposeful column by answering that brain's craving for why, with an answer that explains, it's not about you, it's not about us, it's about other people are counting on us to get this stuff right, does that matter to you? Because for most people, they're like, \"Yeah, that's actually really cool. I can have an impact on real stuff happening in other people's lives and in the world outside of me?\" So that that activates, now all of a sudden we can say, okay, let's look at alpha across the top row.\n\n(01:58:06):\nAlpha safety is when you get in the shower, and all of your anxieties, worries, et cetera, come out of nowhere, out of the attic of your mind. What happens in alpha reward? It's when you have these breakthroughs of how to get a deal, how to win something. It's daydreaming, but your brain is primed to daydream in a certain way, whether it's about anxiety or anger, or whether it's about rewards you care about. If it's purpose, this is where from a vision perspective, a possibilities product perspective, you're going to have all sorts of crazy cool ideas pop into your mind if you've primed your brain to being purposeful and then you daydream.\n\n(01:58:44):\nAnd you can do this in the middle of a day. Certain companies, it's easier than others. But if you can push away from your desk, and just go sit in a park or something for 10 minutes, 20 minutes and calm your brain down, listen, something cool will probably happen in your brain. I can't guarantee that, but you have to experiment with it to find out how it works for you. And then the same thing for gamma, when you hear phrases like, \"We can't talk about this for the rest of our lives,\" that is the gamma prevention team kicking the door down and saying, \"We're here to get you back into beta. Everybody, put your hands behind your backs,\" sort of a thing.\n\n(01:59:22):\nAnd that's where the habitat and the focus kind of matters because you will not ever get a gamma idea from a beta mind. You will never get an alpha idea from a beta mind. So if your business needs some breakthrough, daydreaming, interesting ideas in order to create adjacencies to build new products, to seek new markets, to better fulfill the role you're playing within this market, then team has to have permission to enter that intellectual focused state, or that you're turning that channel off. You're taking that off of the programming available through your particular subscription.\n\n(02:00:04):\nAnd the same thing applies to gamma. The habitat basically needs to establish that gamma is a viable channel for a lot of work, and there's permission to go into it. You can certainly overdo it. That's why I say 25%, you don't need to spend half of your year, three-quarters of your year in gamma. It bonkers how smart you can be if you spend three or four hours in an afternoon in that deep-focused state, you'll just do stuff you'd never do. And if you can get the team to have off-sites that are gamma-focused, everybody's scatter and be alone, and do this stuff that are gamma and alpha-focused, that are productive and you bring ideas back. You're just simply going to generate thinking and outcomes that you wouldn't otherwise. And it may be that 10 percent's right for you. It may be that 30 percent's right for you, depending on how dynamic your market and customer base are. But just to challenge yourself with the question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:00:58):\nThis stuff is so fascinating, I wish we had another hour just to dig deep into this. Because it feels like just this alone is going to really transform the way companies operate. So let's try to give people something tactical they can do to create more space for alpha and gamma waves. And essentially your advice is, a fourth of your time should be spent, if possible, in alpha and gamma time. Is that right?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:01:22):\nYeah, I think that probably is overabundance, in all honesty. But if you think about it through the lens of a quarter, if you're going to be on a set of cadences, and this is probably the tactical advice. It's like, look at your cadences and say, at the quarter level, that's probably the right level of fidelity for most people to look at their calendars in terms of what big stuff should we be doing? Because six months is usually too long to do anything big. Too much has happened in the world. Year is definitely too long to wait for a cadence to kind of kick in. So quarterly is really good. And what's nice is when we cluster our gamma time on this quarterly cadence, we can take a lot of the stuff that would be what we call calendar invaders, these random conversations that come up out of nowhere. And we can be like, \"Well, we're getting ready to have an offsite, this quarter's offsite in two weeks. Can this idea wait until then to be processed?\"\n\n(02:02:16):\nSo you kind of get this nice little black hole effect, where a lot of distractions have a new home, because you've actually said, \"We're going to distinctly do stuff.\" You're saying, \"Yes, but not now,\" to a lot of distractions. But yeah, I think that's the ideal cadence. And that, for some teams, it needs to be maybe a half a day or a full day. You'll figure it out based on your own business. But what per quarter is a necessary amount of time for us to break beta and go into deep thinking analysis mode? How healthy is our operation? How smart are we being? Are we delivering value? What needs to be reevaluated from the market's experience, the customer's experience, the team's experience? Let's look at these different views of the business, and make some prioritized decisions about, we're going to make specific improvements this quarter for these areas.\n\n(02:03:10):\nAnd then even once a week, maybe just find half a day if you can, maybe, but maybe less than half a day, couple hours to be in gamma, once a week. And you'll kind of feel it out from there. But the reason the rule of thumb of 25 is out there is 25 is kind of the risk point. Because most people will be like, \"We're not even spending 5%.\" Or the perfectionist team might be like, \"We're 50.\" So if you're far away from that rule of thumb, that's a pretty good indicator it's a good time to audit yourself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:03:42):\nWhen you hear the term, deep work, is that generally referring to gamma time?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:03:47):\nYeah, people can use that term in a couple of ways. I think a lot of people call deep work, don't bother me beta, which could be one. And other teams might call gamma deep work, but that's probably more appropriate. I think, don't bother me beta is for some teams, they need to be told, \"No, no, use this time not just to not be interrupted, but to think differently about problems. To think about is the architecture even right? Is the way we are thinking about this even right?\" Not just get a lot of stuff done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:04:18):\nYeah. So it's not just sitting in your email and write documents, it's actually try to think about bigger problems, things that are challenging your brain, not just like, \"I'm just productive getting stuff done, getting stuff done.\" Awesome. Something that worked really well for me, similar to what you just recommended is having, I had two blocks of time during the week that were two hours or three hours long, where it's just, \"Don't bother me, deep work time.\" So I had it I think Wednesday morning and Friday morning for two or three hours. And actually in the calendars, if you book something during this time, I'll slap you. And that worked really well. And nobody complained.\n\n(02:04:54):\nWe covered a lot. Here's the things we've covered. I was just taking notes and all the advice that you've shared, how to help people run better meetings, how to get better at developing vision for their team, and company, and product, how to be a better influencer. How to build better relationships, how to create a better culture for your company, how to create more focus and more productive focus. That's a lot. I'm very proud of our conversation. Before we get to a very short lightning round, because we've gone pretty long, I want to keep it short.\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:05:22):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:05:22):\nIs there anything else you want to share, leave listeners with that you think might be helpful before we close-\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:05:28):\nNo, I don't think we need... I mean, there's certainly a lot more that we could talk about, but I think we don't want to melt any minds. So we want people to kind of walk away and be like, \"I can do that, I can do that, I can do that.\" So definitely pick two or three wins. I kind of call them pots of ocean to boil instead of oceans to boil. So get a few pots of ocean to boil first, and focus on that for sure. And definitely make one of those pots, if it's a problem area for you, what kind of experience you are. I mean, that's central to everything. Everything else works better in the whole system once you've boiled that pot of the ocean, and then things get easier.\n\n(02:06:05):\nAnd then I guess the only last thing I would add is, think of everything we've talked today. It might help to put some language to it as floor risers and ceiling risers. Because your company has a horizon of performance that you're heading into, and there's a bottom end of that range and a top end of that range. So as you get better at meetings, not only are you increasing... You're raising the floor to get rid of bad meetings and waste, and you might be saving a ton of time or converting useless time into useful time, but you also might be raising the ceiling.\n\n(02:06:35):\nAnd I would be really specific with yourself and your team about, which outcome are you chasing? Is it both? Is it one or the other? And say, we're actually trying to raise the floor so that our performance never goes below a certain range. We get faster, smarter as a result, fewer mistakes. Or are we actually trying to uncap a ceiling that we're dealing with right now, especially around things like strategy and vision? If we feel that those conversations always end up feeling like inconceivable arguments, we have a ceiling on our business's performance. As a result of that, can we raise that ceiling and explore a higher horizon of performance for the business?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:07:12):\nAmazing. Evan, with that, we've reached our very exciting and very quick lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:07:18):\nYes, let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:07:20):\nAll right, so let's start with what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:07:26):\nWell, the obvious first one is Never Split the Difference. I recommend that book to everybody in the universe. I think if you haven't read it yet, you shouldn't get your driver's license. For those who don't know, it was written by Chris Voss, he was an FBI hostage negotiator. And it explores how to negotiate with people, and not just hostages, but your colleagues, your parents, your wife, like everybody. And there's some very surprising technique in there that is unexpected, not trying to get people to agree with you, but getting them to say no, more often. Instead of saying, \"Hey, Lenny, are you willing to do this?\" Say, \"Hey, Lenny, are you opposed to doing this?\" And it's just this reversal. And \"I'm giving you the out,\" is the way he explains it. There's a whole bunch of other technique, but the more of that technique is in a team, the better. The better the team does. That's a no-brainer.\n\n(02:08:16):\nThe second one I would say, since we've kind of covered this topic a little bit about habitat today. If you enjoy reading books that are sort of root canals, but you're better off because you read them, there's a book called Never... not Never Split the Difference, there's a book called The Person and the Situation. It was written by some researchers, some psychological researchers. And what it explores is the difference between how personality influences your behavior, and how the situation you're in, or like we talked about, the habitat you're in, influences your behavior. And if you're not yet convinced that either of those matters, like, \"Oh, it doesn't. I'll do what I do regardless of the habitat, or I'll do what I do regardless of who I am,\" that book will melt the face off of that existing mental model conclusively. It's really valuable knowledge to understand the mechanics of how the situation influences a person, and how the personality influences the person.\n\n(02:09:12):\nAnd then I guess the last, maybe we'll put a fork in the road of a choose your own adventure. If you're a real student of the game, and you want go 10,000 leagues under the sea on this stuff, there's a series of books called the Cambridge Fundamentals of Neuroscience. You can find it on Amazon. A lot of them, you can just get on your Kindle for a lot cheaper than the library-decorating version of it, but that is bonkers. It talks about how your brain applies to intelligence, emotionality, relationships. It's incredible knowledge. If you instead want to keep it more in the part of the world you experience and can see and not the brain. Thaler wrote a book called Misbehaving. It was kind of the major book about behavioral economics.\n\n(02:09:58):\nAnd again, we spend a lot of time in companies talking about the way people should act, instead of the way people do act. And behavioral economics is essentially the version of economics that's about how people do act, not how people should act. So I think that's a great field of study. And then again, Robert Greene's whole library is super valuable, especially Human Nature, if you're into that. He's a little darker of an author, certainly kind of doesn't pull punches about human nature. So those are all great books to explore.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:10:28):\nDo you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:10:31):\nI look more at the category level of products. I really like products that have great ergonomics. A lot of people underestimate the value of what it feels like to use the product. Are things in the right place at the right time? I just started this newsletter that's kind of like, how do you break all of what we do in a bite-sized pieces for people who are super interested in this stuff to get something weekly? And it exposed me to Beehiiv, which is a very well-designed newsletter platform, high ergonomics. I don't ever find anything hard to find. I can get things to work the way I want them to work.\n\n(02:11:07):\nSo just, I like that example. And I remember even back to when I was obsessed with finding the perfect backpack to travel with, and then you find these brands where you're going through security, and you didn't even know it, but there's a pocket designed for your phone in exactly the place you would want the pocket for your phone to be. And you're just like, \"That's so great. I love that this team designed this pocket just in the right spot.\" So that's really my focus is ergonomics in product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:11:32):\nFinal question. I saw you tweeted that people are telling you that you look like JD Vance, which is hilarious. Do you think this will be a net benefit or a net hurdle?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:11:42):\nIt'll be an incredible benefit to Halloween, because it's totally clear what I'm going to do for Halloween. Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm going to have to see what people in the street... Fortunately I live in Park City, so I don't run across a lot of people in the street who want to yell at people. But if I lived in Chicago or something like that, I would've no doubt somebody would come up and throw something at me. But yeah, I'm neutral on the topic so far, minus the Halloween bonus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:12:09):\nWe'll see. We'll see how your life changes. Evan, this has been amazing. There's so much richness to this conversation. And like I said, we've covered basically everything people want to get better at as product manager, you could say. Two final questions. Where can folks find the stuff that you do to dig deeper, to learn more, to learn more deeply from you? And two, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:12:31):\nYeah, I mean, they can certainly find a lot of the stuff we do on our website, core-sciences.com. Find a link to that profile you talked about on there, which can be super fun to take and insightful. The newsletter, all the stuff that we do, you can kind of find out there. And then certainly Twitter. I mean, I've always been really prickly about people that get on Twitter to post only and not to interact. I'm kind of the opposite. I really love people's questions and pushback. And just yesterday, I probably spent way longer than I should have out of my portfolio management approach to time, just on a thread where I was talking to this really interesting woman about this debate almost, about the probability of people doing things based on their beliefs, which was... And then we had some kind of bystanders watching the whole thing happen, and I had a meeting with a good friend Rod afterwards, where we talked about how that all went.\n\n(02:13:28):\nSo I love to talk to people and answer questions, and I'm sure people will have plenty of questions that they'd love to dive deeper into. So I'm on Twitter for sure. And then how you can help me. I mean, fortunately for me, I'm in the business of helping other people, whether those are individuals, teams, companies. So the most helpful thing to me is you helping yourself. So if you find our content valuable, if you want to have awesome managers or anything like that in this sort of science-based, kind of more efficient approach to getting there would be interesting, then reach out. We don't bite. We're pretty easy to work with. And that would be super fun to have a conversation about what your team needs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:14:08):\nEvan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:14:10):\nThanks for having me. This has been really cool. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:14:12):\nSame for me. Bye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

First up, we've got Katie Dill, who is head of design at Stripe and former head of design at Airbnb and Lyft sharing this amazing story of how the entire design team at Airbnb basically rebelled against her soon after she joined and what she learned from that experience.\n\nKatie Dill (00:03:42):\nI'm happy to talk about it because frankly, it was the biggest learning experience of my leadership career, or at least that happened in one moment, and it happened in my early days at Airbnb. So I was hired to take on the experience design organization, that's basically the product design team, which was 10 people at the time.\n\n(00:04:02):\nAnd so they had been reporting directly to one of the founders and they were going to start reporting to me. And during my interview process, I learned a lot about what was working and what wasn't working and some of the trials and tribulations with the design organization and its collaboration with others. So it seemed like there was room for improvement in how engineering and product management and design all work together. And there was also really low engagement scores in the design team.\n\n(00:04:29):\nAnd so I came in ready to go and excited to try to help make some change based on all the things that I had learned from various leaders and people across the company. And I came in swinging ready to go, and then about a month into my time there, I got a meeting on my calendar. Thursday 8:30 AM, was an hour and a half with half of the design team, so that was five people, and our HR partner.\n\nLenny (00:05:00):\nOh, no. That's never a good sign.\n\nKatie Dill (00:05:01):\nUsually it's [inaudible 00:05:01]. Yeah. And I remember this so vividly. I remember walking into the office and all the rooms in Airbnb's office are very unique spaces that look like Airbnbs, but of course this was the one room with all white walls and just a gray flat rectangle table. And I walked into the room and there were five of them seated around the table and they had a pack of papers in front of them, and they went on taking turns quietly reading from the papers all the things that they saw that I was doing wrong and all the things that they didn't like about me. And it was a really hard moment there. I went through all the usual stages of grief when one hears feedback, which is just immediate want to respond to be like, \"Oh, well there was a good reason for that.\" And, \"That's not how it actually was,\" and, \"This is why I did that.\"\n\n(00:05:59):\nBut luckily I had, thank goodness, I had the sense to just listen and not respond in that way. Clearly, what they were telling me is that that was one of the things that was missing. And so I heard them out and took it all in. And regardless of each individual thing, what was very clear was that the missing piece, the theme that was across all of that is that I hadn't earned their trust. So whether how right or how wrong what I was doing was is the key piece is that I wasn't bringing the team along with me. They had no idea that they could trust in what I was trying to build and what I was trying to shape and that I cared about them and that I had their best interest and shared goals at heart. And that was absolutely my fault.\n\n(00:06:45):\nAnd in retrospect, as hard as that was, I'm very grateful and very amazed that they could come together and share that with me. It can be hard to bring feedback forward like that.\n\n(00:06:57):\nAnd so it was an extremely valuable learning experience and I took from that to then immediately shift how I was operating. And really a key part in building trust was to listen, to hear out what the individuals on the team were setting out to do, what they cared about, what motivated them. And so I started to make pretty fast change and still moving in the direction that was necessary for the org to make the really large impact in how we were operating, but bringing folks along with me. You can inflict change on people, but if you want to do it with them, really trust is the key element there.\n\n(00:07:37):\nAnd then a couple of months later, we had the best engagement scores in the company. So it actually, it did objectively improve the situation and since then taken that on into next steps in other companies that I've joined and just think about instead of coming in swinging, come in listening, so that you can really set out to make change that actually has true positive impact on the folks around you and you bring along with you.\n\nLenny (00:08:04):\nNext up, Paul Adams, chief product Officer at Intercom, sharing the nightmare experience of freezing on stage in front of thousands of people, having to walk off stage, and then people hearing him curse because the mic was still on, and then how he recovered. Plus a few stories of building some of Google's most infamous product failures.\n\nPaul Adams (00:08:24):\nSome things have happened in work, are very memorable at the time and they don't really scar you. This goes in the book that have scarred for life. Yeah, let's go long story short, I was at Facebook just over a decade ago, loved it at the time. I think it was a great place to be at the time. And basically San Francisco, I did a lot of talks for Facebook internally and externally. Facebook had a keynote slot, always have a keynote slot at Cannes, the world's biggest advertising festival. And the year prior, Zuck had been interviewed. He was the speaker, he'd been interviewed, gotten a hard time on privacy. It didn't go well, as well as they'd hoped.\n\n(00:09:00):\nSo the next year they asked me to do it, maybe it was the Irish accent that made the offer come my way. And yeah, I got out into front the stage of the world's biggest advertising stage, and I'd say I was like three or four minutes into the talk, a talk I'd given, a very similar talk that I'd given lots of times.\n\n(00:09:19):\nAnd I just froze. I couldn't remember what I was supposed to say. It was the first ever time in my life I'd rehearsed a talk word for word. Usually, I have talking points and I'd ad lib and things get mixed around and it's kind of informal. This was media trained, do not say the wrong thing kind of talk. And I just could not remember what to say. I had some version of a panic attack, walked off stage, I was still mic'd up, cursed. I was laughing. I was like, \"Geez, are they laughing at me. Oh my God, this is...\" But I can manage to turn it around, I walked back out, I'd kind of been disarmed internally in my head, and the rest of it went well. And I was famous that night out in Cannes afterwards on whatever the seafront, it's just like rosé everywhere. I was famous and infamous for my performance.\n\nLenny (00:10:13):\nI feel like you lived the worst nightmare that everybody has when they're thinking about giving a talk. And I think what's interesting is you survived, and I think that's a really interesting lesson is you could freeze in front of thousands of people, walk off stage, and then it works out okay.\n\nPaul Adams (00:10:30):\nAnd it all happened organically, I guess, or very naturally. But yeah, ever since then, every time I walk out onto a conference talk stage, still today, I ask myself, I have this tiny doubt in the back of my head. It's never happened since. But yeah, I think you have to go with it with these things. When life kind of throws you these whatever curve balls you have got to kind of adapt, and it's not that big a deal. None of these things are that big a deal. At the end of the day you kind of move on, live and learn. Yeah, but I still hope it doesn't happen again.\n\nLenny (00:11:02):\nI also hate public speaking and I always fear this is exactly what's going to happen to me. And so I think this is nice to hear that even when the worst possible thing basically happens, things can survive.\n\nPaul Adams (00:11:13):\nYou can turn it around. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:11:15):\nA second area I wanted to hear from is your time at Google and there's a couple products you worked on at Google. Both of them were not what you'd call big successes, and then there's kind of a transition to Facebook, which was also kind messy. Can you just share a couple stories from that time?\n\nPaul Adams (00:11:31):\nYeah. Similar to the walking off stage thing, you live and learn, and I was at Google for four years. I was at Facebook for two and a half years or so. At Google I worked on a lot of failed social projects like you mentioned, Google Buzz, Google, and later Google+. I think a lot of the motivation for those projects came from a place of fear. It didn't come from a place of let's make a great product for people,.let's really understand the things people struggle with when communicating with family and friends. That's really, really try and create something wonderful. It came from a place of fear.\n\n(00:12:10):\nAnd so during those times I learned I think how not to lead in places. And by the way, I should say at the time in Google, there was other things happening that were amazing, like Google building Google Maps. Incredible product, one of my favorite products. I think one of the best products ever made. They were building Android. I was in the mobile team, in the mobile apps team at the time that Android came out. So incredibly good product. So I just happened to be in the social side, which wasn't as good.\n\n(00:12:37):\nAnd yeah, Google Buzz was kind of a privacy disaster, and Google+ similar. And so kind of halfway through I kind of published research about groups, and I've done a ton of research. An interesting kind of side note there is at the time I asked, I was working in the research, in the US team as a researcher, I was being asked to do a lot of tactical research, like usability study type stuff, like can people use these products? And I ended up doing a lot of formative research as well in the same session. So I'd kind of say to the team like, \"Hey, I'll do the research, I'll answer your questions, but also I'm going to do this other thing, and I'm going to take 20 minutes doing that.\"\n\n(00:13:16):\nAnd so what we used to do is, what I used to do with people was map out their social network, all the people in it, their family, their friends, how they communicate. We'd map on all the channels, we'd talk about what worked well, what didn't. And we did this with dozens and dozens of people over the course of maybe 18 months. And the same pattern emerged every single time, which was people need way better ways to communicate with small groups of family and friends. And I kind of look back now and go like WhatsApp, or it maybe iMessage if everyone's on Apple, but really obvious in hindsight, but at the time, not obvious. And so we kind of tried to build a product around that called Google+, but again, it was kind of came from the wrong place. And so halfway through the research that I've done, all this research had been made public through a conference talk and Zuck and Facebook noticed, got in touch, one thing led to another and I left and joined Facebook, which was an amazing thing for me, personally.\n\n(00:14:13):\nFacebook was amazing, an amazing place at the time and exciting. And they were trying to do things for the other reasons, the kind of good reasons, like, \"Hey, let's build an amazing product for people.\"\n\nLenny (00:14:22):\nAnd this was during Google+ being built? You basically shifted.\n\nPaul Adams (00:14:26):\nYeah, midway, I'm stressed to even telling you about it. The project hadn't been launched. It was still under wraps. It was highly confidential. Google had done a lot of things at the time that were the first for them. I don't know if they've done them since, but things like everyone worked in Google+ was sent to a different building. That building had a different key card. If you didn't work on Google+, you could not get in. All sorts of counter-cultural things at the time. And as a result, there was a lot of antagonism internally for Google+. And so when I left in the middle of the project, leaving with all of the plans in my head to the enemy, some people saw me as a traitor, understandably. Other people thought I was enlightened. It depends on who you talked to, but it was the right thing for me to do. But at the time it was a hard thing to do.\n\nLenny (00:15:17):\nI know there's also a lot of scrutiny in what you took with you and the process.\n\nPaul Adams (00:15:23):\nWhen I left, Google kind of assumed that I was one of the spies. I was quarantined when I told them I was leaving. They forensically analyzed my laptop, all sorts of stuff like that. So it was pretty intense. Looking back, I can understand why that happened, but the root cause for me is that the project has been run from a place of fear, competitive fear, which I don't think leads to good things.\n\nLenny (00:15:53):\nSo one of the themes through the stories you just shared is, let's say failure is... I don't want to make it that harsh, but just things not working out. And I'm curious as a product leader, how important you think that is for people to go through if you think that's something that is almost a good thing. And I guess just is there anything there that you find helpful as a coach, as a mentor, as someone, to people that are trying to become basically you?\n\nPaul Adams (00:16:19):\nIt very, very... It still is. It still is. I've personally failed so many times. There are two stories and the Google one is long deep tentacles. There are two stories. I've failed a ton of times like at Intercom. I remember when I was at Facebook, I was very happy and I knew I wanted to [inaudible 00:16:39] the co-founders of Intercom and they're trying to persuade me to join Intercom. It was like 10 person company at the time. But Owen said something to me at that time, which has stuck with me ever since. He said, \"At Facebook you can design the product, but at Intercom you can design the company.\" And that was extremely appealing to me, a great pitch. He's like, \"Just design the company with us that you want to work in.\"\n\n(00:17:03):\nAnd so part of that was a company that embraces failure that says it's okay to try things. I'm a big believer in big bets, higher risk, higher reward. I don't get as excited about incremental things. Now I haven't said that, there's of course a place for that too, especially as companies get bigger. But I get excited about big bets and if you make big bets, you're going to get a lot of it wrong. So a lot of the principles that we built here at Intercom, on building software, we have a principle called ship to learn, and we've actually changed it since, still on the wall here. Ship fast, ship early, ship often is what it says now. Used to say ship to learn. Ship fast, ship early, ship often. It's like in that idea is the idea of failure. It's not going to go right, and it's going to go wrong more often than not. But if you ship early and fast and learn fast, you can change fast, and you can improve fast. And that's the kind of culture that we as much as possible try to embrace and teach people. But it's much easier said than done.\n\nLenny (00:18:05):\nEspecially when you're in the moment. Like Go damn, it, everything's going to fall apart. I really messed this one up.\n\nPaul Adams (00:18:09):\nYeah. And there's a trade-off with quality that people really struggle with. We've high standards of ourselves. A lot of Intercom comes from a design founder background. We value the craft a lot. We never want to be embarrassed by what we ship. So there's a real tension there, a real trade-off where people have these high standards, which we encourage and we encourage them to ship fast and learn and make mistakes. It's a constant kind of tension that we're navigating.\n\nLenny (00:18:38):\nNext up, we have Tom Conrad, who is chief product officer at Quibi and engineering leader at Pets.com. Two of the most memorable failures in product history, sharing his lessons from those wild experiences. Tom is currently CEO of Zero Longevity Science, which is a killer business and an app in case you haven't come across it. I'd definitely check it out. Here's Tom.\n\n(00:19:00):\nYou brought up this phrase of notable disasters and I want to talk about that. You've worked at two of the most famous notable disasters of product companies, Pets.com and Quibi. I think it's really rare someone sees the inside of so much hype and then such a fall at a company. And so I just want to spend some time in these two areas, and maybe the way to set it up is just what's a lesson you took away from each of these two experiences that you've taken with you to future work, and maybe advice you share with people?\n\nTom Conrad (00:19:30):\nProbably the biggest lesson, it's not really about the specifics of the business. The biggest lesson really is these things make you better. In some instances, actually I think in both instances, they became kind of dominoes that opened doors for me in my own ambition and my own sort of professional life that maybe just wouldn't have opened at all if I hadn't gone to those companies and learned those things and had those experiences. And frankly, even in the case of Pets.com, like even the high profile nature of it, I could have worked at one of a thousand e-commerce websites in 1999. And when I went on to some subsequent job interview or something and talked about my experience, I had never heard of the thing that you worked on, but everybody certainly heard about Pets.com.\n\n(00:20:17):\nIt's a pretty funny example too of how some struggles are timeless. That was 23, 24 years ago now. And while as a leadership team, we made, I'm sure, all kinds of mistakes. One of the things that happened was that there were three kind of over-funded pet e-commerce sites, and we all raised in excess of $50 million, which is a tremendous amount of money now. It was a tremendous amount of money then, and we all thought it was a zero-sum game and that we as one player started to spend on promotion or to spend irrationally on national broadcast television advertising. We all did, and it became this kind of unwinnable arms race. So there is, I think a fundamental lesson about having an excess of investment can be its own albatross or lead you to make decisions that maybe would be unwise.\n\n(00:21:28):\nAnd then of course, it's just like timing is really important. Chewy is a online pet store. It's worth $9 billion today. They were a private company and bought by PetSmart and then spun back out. But when they were bought by PetSmart, they were acquired for 3 billion, biggest e-commerce acquisition of all time. And while I think it's probably unfair to compare, Chewy who executed exceptionally well over a decade, grew their business brick by brick, and turned it into something really remarkable. To Pets.com, which was in a very, very different moment in time and tried to go to market in a really different way.\n\n(00:22:07):\nThe critique that is often leveled at Pets.com or at least at the time, was like, this is just a stupid business. They're shipping dog food around. You could never make that work, and that's just wrong. You absolutely can make it work. Probably can't make it work when 80% of the country on the internet is still on dial up. It's really, really early.\n\nLenny (00:22:25):\nI saw a stat I think you shared somewhere that you took Pets.com from nothing, to a public company, to completely out of business in 19 months.\n\nTom Conrad (00:22:33):\nYeah, yeah, I think that's about right. The other thing that's forgotten in the tale is that we actually didn't go bankrupt. We shut the company down and returned the remaining balance to the investors, which no public company had ever done before. And the leadership team just reached the conclusion that given the way market conditions had evolved, there was just no way we were going to be able to get more capital into the company. And it was a company that required additional investment to get to profitability. And so it was better to wind down early, take the money that we had in the bank and get it back to investors than to just spend every last penny on what was sort of a fruitless attempt to salvage it.\n\nLenny (00:23:22):\nDid not know that. Let's talk about Quibi. What went wrong there? Do you think there was a path to Quibi having worked out? Any big lessons that you took away from that experience that you bring with you?\n\nTom Conrad (00:23:33):\nThe kind of miraculous thing about Quibi for me was it relit my enthusiasm for the industry for doing this work. I had left in, I think it was December of 2018, and I thought that maybe I was just done making software. I had done it for a really long time, I had done it for twenty-five years or something. And I had changed a lot. The industry had changed a lot, and I thought maybe I just didn't have the same passion for it that I had a decade before. And it also seemed like maybe it'd be fun to have another chapter of my life that was just completely different. And I had a whole list of things that I thought I might want to do. They were really, they were kind of ridiculous. Maybe I want to be a pastry chef. Maybe I want to be a landscape photographer. Maybe I want to learn to make bad music to put up on SoundCloud or something. Really the only thing they had in common were they were all things that I knew nothing about. People would be like, \"Oh, you think you might want to be a pastry chef? Do you like to bake?\" And I'd be like, \"No, I don't know anything about baking.\" \"Oh, you might landscape photography. Do you take photos?\" \"No, I don't make photos.\"\n\n(00:24:41):\nBut I was kind of committed to the bit, actually to the point where when TechCrunch interviewed me about my departure from Snapchat, I was like, \"I'm out. I'm going to do something else entirely.\" So that story is very much out there. But a few months after my last day at Snap, I got a call from Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg who were starting up, it was called New TV at the time.\n\n(00:25:07):\nAnd the pitch was, \"We're going to try to take the best of mobile and Silicon Valley and Consumer Tech and sort of weld it to the best of Hollywood-style content production to build something completely bespoke and purpose-made for consumption on the phone.\" They were looking for both technology leadership and product leadership and wanted to know if I was interested in one or both. And I took the meeting, even though I wasn't really taking these kinds of calls from anybody. It just seemed like who's going to pass up the opportunity to have lunch with the two of them? So I listened to the pitch and politely declined and told them that I was going to be a pastry chef or something. And we kept doing that every couple of months for seven months. We'd go to lunch, they would give me an update on the progress they were making, and I would decline the invitation to get involved somehow.\n\n(00:26:05):\nAnd then late in that year, I went to lunch one more time and Meg explained that they brought on someone to lead technology and they brought another person to lead product, and both of them really truly for reasons that are completely disconnected from Quibi itself, both of them had left after about six weeks. And Meg's like, \"We've raised all this money, and we've told the world that we're shipping this product in about a year. We got an awful lot to do, and I really could use some help, and I would consider it a personal favor if you would come and spend just a couple of days a week helping.\" She's like, \"I'll continue to look for someone who actually wants the job, but it'd be great if you could help me get this off the ground.\"\n\n(00:26:53):\nAnd my wife is a freelance writer, marketing strategist and loves her life as a freelance contributor. And she's like, \"You should do this. Why not? It's two days a week, it's just a few months. What's the worst thing that could happen? Maybe you'll like it.\" And I'm like, \"No, no. Here's the thing that will happen. I won't do it two days a week. It will immediately be three days, then four days, then five days, then six days. I just know myself.\" And she's like, \"No.\" She's like, \"Just on Wednesday night at six o'clock, close your Quibi laptop and be like, all they're paying me for is for Tuesday and Wednesday and then open it back up on Tuesday morning. That's all you've got to do.\"\n\n(00:27:35):\nWell, she's right about most things and she's wrong about this. I fell deeply into it right away, and it was just so fun to get to build a team from scratch and to design and build a product from scratch and to take advantage of all of the sort of modern software architecture stuff that had come into being over the course of the 15 years since we had started Pandora. And I'm embarrassed about some of the what happened with Quibi for sure, but I'm super grateful for the experience, because I just really fell in love with the industry again and was reminded of just how rewarding it can be to build something and to try to put it out there even if you stumble pretty mightily along the way.\n\nLenny (00:28:28):\nIs there something that you took away from that experience that taught you what to try to avoid, to try to pull towards?\n\nTom Conrad (00:28:36):\nI think I sort of misunderstood or misjudged companies sometimes by thinking about them really focused on the product execution. If you find an interesting problem that people care about and you solve that problem in a really beautiful, elegant, delightful way, that's 10 times better than anything else that they can get in that same space, they'll tell their friends and all the rest will take care of itself. And so that was always my ambition. Find a thing that I cared about building, do a great job building it in a delightful way, go really deep on listening to people and their feedback and iterate your way to success and breaking through that membrane that we all strive to get across, the really great word of mouth.\n\n(00:29:27):\nBut I think the thing I've come to better appreciate is that companies are also, they're kind of a math problem that describes how you take investment and pour them into the equation, and out the other side comes returns on some time horizon. And yes, there are variables in that equation that are influenced by the product that you build and all of the little details and decisions that you make about making that product great. But if the equation is fundamentally broken or a big swing in and of itself, no amount of iteration and execution can get you out of the failed outputs of the broken equation.\n\n(00:30:14):\nAnd I think Quibi made a bet that you could build an entirely bespoke content library that was sufficiently scaled to get people to subscribe and retain for a couple billion dollars. It was a huge amount of money, but we made 70 shows in 18 months, which is more content than all of the major broadcast networks combined made in a single year. So it was a pretty major accomplishment. And we made a bet that we would augment those sort of episodic and serialized or Hollywood style shows with a bunch of daily content that we produce at the level of network television, nightly news, and so forth that would be an alternative to some of the sort of daily content that you might otherwise get on YouTube. And that was going to be about a third of the content spend.\n\n(00:31:19):\nOne super interesting thing that no one talks about is that all of that content was designed to be made day of or day before it aired. So there was no back catalog of it, and it was all designed to be shot in these professional studios that we built out, and it was really expensive. Like I said, it was a third of the investment we were going to make in content, almost half the investment we were going to be making content. And we launched two weeks into Covid, and we couldn't make any of that content except literally in the garages of the host's homes. And so we had this thing that was supposed to seem really set apart from YouTube that literally now was being made exactly YouTube content, which is sort of like self-produced at home with very little sort of the support infrastructure of Hollywood.\n\n(00:32:10):\nNow you can argue, I think the content on YouTube is really, really exceptional in this category, and maybe we were never going to do better than that. But I think what was really fundamentally broken with Quibi was that the actual foundational equation of can you make enough premium content that's totally bespoke and made for the service and takes advantage of the nature of the phone, is that enough content to get people to sign up and retain, and can you do that for a couple billion dollars? And I think the answer is no. The library has to be much, much bigger and you have to have, like any company, you have to have sufficient time and energy to iterate on the content format itself. Our roadmap really wanted to innovate on the content format. And so I think part of what happened is pretty quickly it became clear that the math was just wrong. It wasn't going to take 2 billion, it was going to take six or eight or 10 billion. And the risk reward profile of betting 10 billion on the format was just more than anyone can stomach.\n\nLenny (00:33:20):\nNext up, we've got Sri Batchu, former head of growth at Ramp who shares something that I've thought about ever since we had this conversation, which is this idea that when you fail, make sure you fail conclusively to make this failure an actual learning that you can build off of versus just a waste of time. Here's Sri.\n\nSri Batchu (00:33:38):\nGrowth experiments in my history are typically like 30%-ish success rate. So the vast majority of things that you try don't work. And so you want to create a culture where people aren't afraid to take risks and aren't afraid to fail. And for me, failure is not that you didn't drive revenue, failure is not learning. So it's really important that you learn when you fail. And so we celebrate failure as long as you're learning, and you can only learn if you've designed the right test and you failed conclusively, because otherwise I think many of us have been in situations where there's intuition that something might work and it doesn't work, and then you end up doing it over and over for years because every time a new executive or somebody else has the same idea, you try it again. And it's because you haven't been able to design the test to fail conclusively.\n\n(00:34:31):\nIt's hard to do. But at the end of the day, there's only two ways to make an experiment successful. Either you have a very large M or you have a very significant treatment, which is what you're doing in the experiment itself. And in B2B, you don't usually have the luxury of large M, which you [inaudible 00:34:54] consumer.\n\n(00:34:54):\nFacebook can get [inaudible 00:34:56] in two hours. A B2B company could take two years to get to the same number of touch points. And so to counteract that, I recommend people just trying to maximize the treatment effect, which is like if you have a hypothesis that you're testing, just throw all of the possible tactics and resources that you think would move that needle because you can always cost rationalize later if it works.\n\n(00:35:22):\nAnd so just maximize the treatment effect. And if with all of that it didn't work, then you can say, \"Hey, we're not going to try this again because we literally did try everything that we could to test this hypothesis. And if it doesn't work in the best version, and it's expensive as it is, this is not worth spending more time on.\" But if it does work, great. Then you do another version of the test with half the tactics or whichever tactics you think work better or worse and you optimize over time.\n\nLenny (00:35:49):\nIs there an example you could share when you did that?\n\nSri Batchu (00:35:53):\nAccount-based marketing is something that is very common in enterprise software where you've selected certain customers that you think are high priority and you're saying, \"I want to touch them in as many nuanced ways possible to see if that drives conversion.\" And this is something I've seen tried many times where people do it, but they kind of do it halfway where they're like, okay, tried these three things. Conversion of the control group wasn't higher, and so we think it is not going to work. And then a new go-to-market executive comes and they have to do it again. They have to do it again. They have to do it again. It's like a very common one wherever this happens. And so when we did it at Ramp, we did exactly what I just described, which is like, let's really be thoughtful about the experiment design, both in terms of maximizing the number of people as well as maximizing the number of ways and types of ways that we're effectively touching these target customers to show the value one way or the other.\n\nLenny (00:37:03):\nSo what it sounds like is the hypothesis isn't like this email will have a big impact on conversion. It's like this strategy of coming after customers is what we're testing.\n\nSri Batchu (00:37:15):\nThat's the example there. And I think for example, if you had the... This kind of framework is more important for cross-functional, larger scale, bigger tests rather than an email modification. But we can even use it on a micro example like an email modification where you are like, \"Okay, I think this particular email is underperforming because it's not talking to this part of the customer's pain point or journey or what have you.\" And you could just, the simplest test would be, okay, let me make some tweaks to the text and edit that, and that could be the end of that test. And if that doesn't work, you're like, \"Oh, maybe those weren't the right text edits. Let me do a different text edits or whatever.\"\n\n(00:38:02):\nAnd that's fine, that's low cost. It's not the end of the world and it's for you to be wrong there. But an alternative that you could do is like, \"Oh, what are all of the things that I could change about this email in the same test?\" Is it the trigger of the email? Is it the text content of the email? Is it additional personalization? Is it the design of the email? Trying to think of what are all of the various levers that you think could be wrong and put them all together to test your hypothesis of this touch point is wrong, and how do I improve that?\n\nLenny (00:38:34):\nWell, obviously the downside of that is you, if it doesn't work, you don't know if it's like, oh, maybe it was this thing could have worked in the subject.\n\nSri Batchu (00:38:40):\nYeah, so there's always trade-offs on this, but what you're hoping is you've done a complete refresh where you did all the things that you thought were intuitive that should work. And if it doesn't work, then you're like, okay, maybe my hypothesis wrong. But you're right. There's always going to be a challenge if maybe the execution is wrong. And I did too many things potentially in that case.\n\nLenny (00:39:01):\nOur next story is from JZ, who is a colleague of mine at Airbnb, head of product at Webflow when we recorded this episode, and this is her sharing the story of one of the biggest product misses at Airbnb.\n\n(00:39:13):\nYou've seen a lot of new PMs, and you've seen these PMs succeed, you've seen some fail. What are the most common mistakes that you find new PMs make in this experience of helping new PMs get into the field?\n\nJiaona Zhang (JZ) (00:39:27):\nI think something that is really hard to untrain, but I think every human does it, is you jump to solutions. And so one of the biggest things I see, not just in my course, but also just as a PM and some of the mistakes that you make as a PM is the idea of you get really attached to a solution, a way of implementing something, something that you can see in your head that you want to build. And so that's the first thing I really want to like unteach in our course.\n\n(00:39:50):\nAnd so a lot of people will literally come in, they'll be like, \"I want to build X startup,\" or, \"I want to do this thing,\" or, \"I am in blank school, and I've been doing a lot of research on this particular area.\" And so untraining that and being like, \"Hey, we're going to go out there. We are not going to think at all about the thing that you want to build, but instead we're going to be focused on users and people in the real world and their problems. And the first step is to understand their problems and then understand if there's an opportunity here as opposed to, hey, you want to build X thing for Y person.\" So that's the biggest mistake that you really have to unteach and retrain thinking around.\n\nLenny (00:40:25):\nSo let's go to the other side of this question. We talked about what mistakes new PMs make. I'm curious, what's the biggest product mistake that you've made?\n\nJiaona Zhang (JZ) (00:40:34):\nWow, that's a good one. It's so interesting. I feel like as product people we're always making mistakes and we're always learning. Maybe I'll give an example from Airbnb since you and I were both there.\n\n(00:40:43):\n And this one does stand out to me. So we're working on this concept called Airbnb Plus. If you took a step back, what we're really trying to do is to be like, \"Hey, not everyone trusts Airbnb in terms of it's a platform. It's not like it's managed inventory, it's not a hotel. How do you go in and really make sure that we're all the Airbnbs are meeting the quality bar?\" But I do think we were very solution first, and I think we're also competitor afraid at the time. So it was during a time where there were managed marketplaces, there were the Saunders out there, and I think that as a company we're very much like, \"Oh, look at this. What are we going to do in the world of managed marketplaces?\"\n\n(00:41:19):\nAnd so we went really hard down the solution space. We essentially were like, \"Let's go inspect our inventory. Let's actually try to manage our inventory more.\" And really what we should have done is taken a step back and be like, \"What's the real problem?\" The real problem is people want to know what they're getting themselves into. We need to represent the homes a lot better. And I think the other piece here that's really important is what, as a company, is there strategic strength? And what's in your wheelhouse? So for example, Airbnb, we weren't that strong in operations. We again, we're this platform with this marketplace. And so if you don't have that muscle and then you're asking the company, the teams to essentially build it from the ground up, that's really, really difficult. Not to mention the unit economics. Are the unit economics actually going to work, even as you scale?\n\nLenny (00:42:03):\nYeah, I feel like Airbnb Plus is an untold story that somebody should tell, and that could be its own podcast, I guess.\n\nJiaona Zhang (JZ) (00:42:09):\nYou and I can tell it.\n\nLenny (00:42:10):\nWe could tell it. This could be Airbnb Plus the hidden, the story. As you said, the problem it was trying to solve was people don't really trust, they don't want to even consider Airbnb. Like, \"No, I don't want to stay in someone's home. I don't know what it'll be. It's unpredictable.\" And so as an outsider, it felt like a really clever approach. We're going to get them, we're going to make sure they're awesome. There's a minimum bar. And I guess this is the question is do you think it was just like this is never possible because we'll never make money as a business doing this, because we don't make that much booking and investing time, resources, sending people pillows, all that stuff is ever going to be economical. Or do you think there was a path, and it was just not executed well?\n\nJiaona Zhang (JZ) (00:42:51):\nI think there wasn't really a clear path. I think there was [inaudible 00:42:55]. Exactly. And it was more just like if you understood, again, this is my point around unit economics, there are things where I think you have magical thinking around unit economics. You're like, \"Well, when we get to the scale of X, it's all going to work out. We can make these things happen.\" I think you actually need to really make sure the unit economics work right at the beginning. So that is definitely one lesson.\n\n(00:43:14):\nAnd I think the other thing is, and going back to the spirit of what are you trying to achieve. If you're trying to achieve this idea of really knowing the quality of the place, and for a platform like Airbnb, the right way to go about doing is through our reviews, through our guest reviews, which are essentially free as opposed to literally sending out inspectors.\n\n(00:43:32):\nAnd I think that the other things are if you can get signal on what are the things around quality that people care about? Is it cleaning? Is it the, \"Hey, I'm locked out.\" And I think that there are other solutions besides inspection that then get at that. So for example, it is actually cheaper to go send everyone a lockbox than to deploy an inspector and go look at your property, right? It is actually cheaper to maybe do a partnership with a bunch of cleaners in different local areas, and then get that as part of the feat as opposed to doing inspection.\n\n(00:44:04):\nSo again, it's really about what are you really trying to achieve? What is the user problem in each of these areas, and can you target that problem with the particular listing that you're looking at? And so yeah, I personally don't believe the unit economics ever would've really worked out. I think we should have known that, or we should have dug into that more at the very beginning, and then to get very tailored instead of one blunt instrument to solve it all. Hey, we're going to go inspect. It's like, what is the problem for this listing, and what's the best solution to fix that problem?\n\nLenny (00:44:33):\nOur second to last story is from Gina Gotthilf, who was an early growth leader at Duolingo. She's currently COO of Latitud, and this is her sharing a wide-ranging and important point about how everyone has both an A side and a B side to their career, and people often only share their A side. So this is Gina sharing her B side.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:44:53):\nWe are very encouraged in our lives, especially professionally, to talk about our A side all the time because that's what impresses people. That's what opens doors, that's what allows us to keep growing, and it's so important. So it means that a lot of what you hear in podcasts and on stage ends up being the Instagramable version of someone or a company or a country's trajectory. It's just the highlights. And when I talk about my A side, it's very impressive. I did things like, we'll talk about, I met President Obama, I worked on the Mike Bloomberg presidential campaign. I helped Duolingo scale from three to 200 million users. I worked with Tumblr, helping them scale Latin America, Andreesen Horowitz invested in my company, etc.\n\n(00:45:34):\nBut between all of those highlights, there were so many B moments that get shoved under the rug because it's just easier for me and it's more impressive for others. But I really like to highlight those because I think that most of us have a lot of B moments every day, every week, every month, and every period of our lives. And it's easy to think that things aren't just not going to work out for us because we're in one of those B moments if we don't recognize them as moments.\n\nLenny (00:45:59):\nI love this concept. We're going to talk as you expected about a lot of your A side stuff. Is there any example of a B side story of your life that would be interesting to share?\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:46:09):\nLook, I think those are the most interesting because they're funny or ridiculous. I had a lot of B sides, and I still do. For example, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I actually wanted to be. I thought I wanted to be an actress. I either wanted to be that person in Sea World, who goes like this with a dolphin. This is before Sea World was canceled. Or I wanted to be an actress. I applied to schools. I didn't get into any Ivy League. I didn't get into any of the top schools I wanted to go to. When I got to college, I actually ended up dropping out because I got so depressed, incredibly depressed, couldn't get out of bed depressed. Ironically, I dropped out of Reed College, which is the same college that Steve Jobs dropped out of. So I was just destined for greatness. I knew it at that moment.\n\nLenny (00:46:53):\nIt all makes sense looking backwards, as he said.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:46:55):\nTotally. I was dropping out, being like, \"Yes, this is exactly the path.\" No, I was miserable. I thought there was no path forward. And I finally went back and graduated. The college counselor looked at my curriculum and said, \"What have you even done with your life? There's nothing to show for.\" And it was shocking because I was always the overachiever who wants to do the maximum curriculum and ace all of my classes and do whatever. I did three diplomas in high school, the international, the American, the Brazilian.\n\n(00:47:22):\nAnd so that for me, I think my one learning there that has stuck with me, and I think it can work for other people too, is that it's not just about doing things that actually matter and learning. It's about being able to tell the story, and it's about understanding what other people perceive as valuable. I applied to a hundred companies. I didn't hear back from most of them. I finally got an internship at kind a tier B/C digital marketing agency in New York City because I wanted to live in New York so badly. And they forgot to apply for my visa on time. So I lost my visa and had to go back to Brazil, and then I ended up leaving that organization to go work for another one. And I won't even go into the details of the shadiness of that company that I worked for, but then they ended up laying me off. So I lost my visa again, had to go back home, found another opportunity, got fired that time. So there was just a lot of rockiness in my start that I don't think you would imagine when you see someone up on stage leading a conference for 5,000 people. That I think is important.\n\n(00:48:26):\nAnd even when I started working for Tumblr, I was like, \"This is it. I made it. This is a really interesting company. This is going to work out.\" That was super rocky because it was an early stage startup. So for example, they couldn't figure out how to wire money to Brazil. So I was not paid for six months. And at one point, me and my colleagues were trying to get money out of the teller to pay contractors because we had no money to pay them, and we borrowed money from people. And finally they also laid me off because they decided to sell to Yahoo.\n\n(00:48:54):\nAnd then I had to figure out what am I going to do? No one's going to hire me. I've been fired and laid off so many times. So this is all before I started an agency to help US-based tech companies and startups grow in Latin America because I figured I was in this really great place to make that happen. And it eventually worked for, well-known companies such as Duolingo. At the time they weren't well-known. They were a tiny little startup. They didn't have an Android app. And that's how I started working with Duolingo because their head of marketing connected with someone they had worked with at Flickr and said, \"I noticed Tumblr grew a lot in Brazil last year. Can you recommend a company or an agency to help?\" And they said, \"This girl.\" And I was twenty-six. And so that's how they connected me with Duolingo. And I started helping them grow in Brazil as a consultant. They were like, \"This is great. Can you help us grow in Chile, Argentina?\" And I was like, \"Yes.\" They were like, \"How about Mexico?\" And I was like, \"Yes.\" Did I know anything about these places, Lenny? Did I know people there? No, but you can figure it out.\n\n(00:49:51):\nAnd then they ended up asking me to come on full time, do that across the world, Japan, China, Korea, Turkey, Spain, France, et cetera. And then to own growth, which ended up meaning communications, social media, government partnerships, anything to grow. And then eventually became an A/B testing growth engine with engineers and PMs and designers of which I knew nothing about.\n\n(00:50:15):\nAnd even after that, I left Duolingo five years later, didn't know what to do with my life. You'd think, \"Oh wow, you have it figured out now. You left Duolingo, you have the world in front of you.\" And I'm like, \"Maybe I can finally go work for nonprofits,\" which is what I actually wanted to do in the first place. Tried a hand at that. Had a couple of experiences before going to work for the Mike Bloomberg campaign.\n\n(00:50:36):\nWorking for the Mike Bloomberg campaign is impressive. But you know what? Mike Bloomberg didn't win. He's not the president. So that was not a successful campaign if you really look at it. And yeah, Latitud seems like it's a really promising path, but there's A days and B days. So it's just a lot of that. And just staying resilient and believing in yourself and getting back on the horse when you fall on your face.\n\nLenny (00:51:00):\nAmazing. That's such an important message. I think one of the threads from what you're describing, something that I think about a lot is people kind of underestimate how long their career is. There's just so much time to do stuff and for things to start to work. This going to sound really fancy, but I think Marcus Aurelius has this quote about how our life is actually very long. We just use it really badly and we just waste a lot of our time.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:51:21):\nI think you're so right, Lenny, and I love that because people are going around being like, \"Life is short, life is short.\" But that's so true. We waste so much time. But also I think we don't recognize how much opportunity we have in front of us. And as a 26-year-old, I definitely thought my career was over. I was like, \"I blew it.\" And looking back, it's funny.\n\nLenny (00:51:40):\nYeah, I know exactly what you mean. I spent nine years at my first job at a random company in San Diego in a startup. I was like, \"What am I doing here so long?\" And it turned out that was really useful for the thing I did next. And then eventually, wow, things started to really take off. So I think that's a really good lesson for people. It's just a long time. This is my fourth career. I've switched careers many times. I was an engineer then. I was a founder. Then I was a product manager, and whatever this is. Whatever you call this thing.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:52:06):\nI guess me, too. I was an operator. I was a consultant. Well, I was an employee. I was a consultant. Then I was an operator, which is a fancy way to say employee at a startup. And then now I'm a founder and a VC and an angel and whatever this is..\n\nLenny (00:52:22):\nAwesome. Awesome. So I think that's a really important takeaways. Just there's a lot of time to do stuff and don't stress if things aren't moving as fast as you want. I'm curious, what's a mess-up or a big mistake maybe that you made or your teammate that was like, \"Oh wow, that was a big waste of time.\"\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:52:38):\nYeah, look, a lot of things didn't work out. More than 50% of our A/B tests didn't work out. We made bets that didn't make sense. I will say though, that in the spirit of A and B sides, I, and I think in general, we are really good at forgetting the B stuff. I talk so much about all the stuff that worked that it's hard to remember all of those moments that didn't actually work. And the thing that I tend to talk about, which is this mistake that we made as the growth team is almost like one of those, when you get asked in an interview, what's your biggest weakness, and you're like, \"I'm a perfectionist.\" It's like one of those things that actually makes you sound good because it's the story about how my team really wanted to implement badges. We spent a lot of time playing all the games that were popular at the time, trying to understand how those gamification growth hacks that we could find in those apps would potentially overlay onto Duolingo and how we would do that.\n\n(00:53:35):\nAnd badges was just pervasive in all of the top games. And so it seemed like a no-brainer, but since we ranked all of our experiments in terms of ROI and return being like how many users we think we're going to get from this DAUs, and time investments, it never made sense to focus on this because we thought that the time sink would be too high. So I actually ended up not letting the team run this experiment for six months so that we focused on lower hanging fruit. So that's a mistake on my end.\n\n(00:54:04):\nThen we decided to run this experiment in the most lean way possible. We're like, \"You know what? There's MVEs. There's minimum viable experiments. We don't have to run a whole badges thing. We can just do something more simple and actually see if that leads to growth in an interesting way, and then we'll know.\"\n\n(00:54:20):\nAnd we ran this very simple experiment that was like, you signed up and then you get a badge. And it was like this girl with a balloon. I don't know, she was happy or whatever. And of course in retrospect, it led to no results, because no one is proud of signing up. It's not an exciting moment, and you don't even have badges to collect. You can't show it to other people. None of the things that make badges compelling were there, but we were like, \"Okay, well, we tested it didn't work.\" And then we moved on.\n\n(00:54:42):\nSo we moved on for another, I don't know, eight months and we didn't look back. And then when we did look back, first of all at that point we discovered that we hadn't been dogfooding, which also was embarrassing. Looking back, we hadn't been dogfooding in the growth team. We just come up with hypotheses. We were super careful about prioritizing them and making sure that we were doing the best possible write ups and all these things. But the dogfooding piece, I didn't come from a product background. I was a marketer and I didn't really understand the term dogfooding, but when we thought, we had a conversation, we were like, \"You know what? If we had just tested that, we would've all known that this was a super lame badge.\" And I was like, \"Why are we not testing our experiments?\" And so that became part of our practice.\n\n(00:55:26):\nIt's still relevant. I just had a conversation yesterday with engineers at Latitud. I haven't explained what we built yet, where we're building it. Maybe we'll get there, but I was talking yesterday, [inaudible 00:55:35] at Latitud, and they're awesome. In terms of product team, we have the number eight employee at NewBank. You might've heard of NewBank, but it's this massive banking fintech in Latin America. And we have people from other fintechs. And then we have this guy who was a lead PM at Twilio, and I was explaining to them why we should be dogfooding. And they were all like, \"Oh yeah, we should dogfood.\" It's just easy to forget stuff like that.\n\n(00:55:58):\nSo that was a mistake that we could have probably gotten to the growth that we got to with badges much earlier on. And not only did we get to growth with badges, but it became this amazing treasure trove of opportunity because once you have badges and people want them, you can now ask people to do anything. Go find friends, go buy things, whatever it is. And so we impacted almost all metrics across the company positively, including some we hadn't expected, but it's easy to talk about a mistake that ended up being a win. So that's why I compared it to the interview thing in the beginning. But we tried making Duolingo a social app really early on and failed. It was called Dual Duels. Dual Duels. You could duel.\n\nLenny (00:56:42):\nVery clever.\n\nGina Gotthilf (00:56:43):\nYeah, I know we were clever, but people didn't use it and we didn't figure out why. We tried making a Duolingo for schools platform. We couldn't get it to pick up. I went and watched dueling go in China and it got downloaded by a million people in the first day, and then the app got blocked because of the government, and then we couldn't figure out what to do. And then everyone rated the app like one star because it didn't work. And so then we had a lot of trouble actually recovering from that. We launched Duolingo in India and didn't realize because we couldn't have unless we went there, which we finally did, that most people set their phone UI in India to English, because typing in Hindi is hard. And of course there's a lot of languages throughout India, and we were making it so that when you downloaded Duolingo, whatever UI you open your app, your phone was set to, we offered not that language for you to learn. That was your base language. So we were telling people learn French, Spanish, German from English, and they were all trying to learn English, so they didn't find what they were looking for and they left. There were so many mistakes and luckily I think we were able to bounce back from most of them in terms of how Duolingo was doing today.\n\nLenny (00:57:53):\nAnd our final story is from Maggie Crowley VP of product at Toast, and one of the most beloved episodes of the podcast. This is Maggie sharing something a little bit different, her favorite interview question about failure and what it tells you about the person you're interviewing. Plus a story of her own product failure. Here's Maggie.\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:58:12):\nA question I ask in every product interview is, what's the worst product you've ever shipped? And that's because I don't think you're a good PM if you haven't shipped something that's really shitty. You just haven't had enough reps, you haven't done it enough times. And it's not only that you've done it, but that you can admit it and which one it is. That's so important.\n\n(00:58:34):\nI remember... It was so dumb. I'm still so mad about this that we did this. I won't name which team, which company, I'm not going to call that out, but we decided we needed to do a rewrite red flag number one of existing product, and engineer who I'd worked with many times, we had a really good relationship and this person was like, \"Yeah, yeah, it's going to take six months. No problem.\" Core part of the product, been around for forever. One of those things that the code is still the code written by the founders kind of thing.\n\n(00:59:07):\nIt didn't take six months. It took two and a half years. It still wasn't done. It almost never... It went on for so much longer than it should have. It took us forever to get to feature parody. It was the worst project. So many people rotated in and out of it. Everyone thought it was dumb. Sunk cost fallacy, just the worst. And it's because, A, we got arrogant and we thought we could do it. B, we skipped discovery. We didn't really write a one pager. We just went for it. We didn't do enough technical and design research into what the requirements would actually have to be. And there you have it.\n\nLenny (00:59:46):\nAnd did not work out, or was it a huge success in the end and it changed the trajectory of the business?\n\nMaggie Crowley (00:59:50):\nAbsolutely not. But you know what? I didn't get fired, so it's fine.\n\nLenny (00:59:54):\nI feel like I've gone through those experiences and then three, four years later, it's like another... Maybe this rewrite and redesign may work. We haven't updated this thing in a long time.\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:00:04):\nJust don't do it. Don't rewrite. If anyone ever tells you to do a rewrite, don't do it. A side-by-side rewrite, nope.\n\nLenny (01:00:11):\nYeah, I've never had... What I run into is once you get too far down a redesign slash rewrite, everyone's building in that new world, and then you launch, and experiment's negative, and then it's just like, \"Oh, we just got to launch it. We're going to call it back. We're going to figure out how to get back to neutral someday.\"\n\nMaggie Crowley (01:00:26):\nYeah yeah. Don't do that.\n\nLenny (01:00:28):\nGood times.\n\n(01:00:29):\nAnd that is a wrap. I hope you enjoy these stories of failure. I want to give a huge special thank you to all of our amazing guests for being vulnerable and sharing these stories of failure in their career. I hope you leave this episode with a new perspective on how setbacks and challenges and failure can often be exactly what you need to get to the next step of your career or your life.

  "transcript": "# How to build trust and grow as a product leader | Fareed Mosavat (Reforge, Slack, Instacart, Pixar)\n\n## Transcript\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:00:00):\nYou can't do homework. You can't do exercises. You can't do fake stuff. You have to work on real products at real companies with real customers, with real data to get better at product management. So any kind of training, mentorship, reading, et cetera that you do is just a layer on top of that. The real acceleration happens from doing it and getting more reps. There are ways that I think great PMs use to go faster on this loop, but you still have to do the work. At the core is you have to actually execute and deliver great products, and you have to do it over, and over, and over again.\n\nLenny (00:00:40):\nFareed Mosavat is the Chief Development Officer at Reforge where he's been for over two and a half years. Before that, he spent three and a half years at Slack leading a lot of their growth efforts, about a year at Instacart leading a number of their key growth analytics and product efforts. He's a GM at Zynga, he's VP of Product at Runkeeper, and something that I only learned during our chat is that he spent six years at Pixar doing character simulation, rigging, and building 3D animation tools. In our conversation, we focus on the journey of becoming a great PM, including crossing the canyon from IC to manager, the importance of expanding your scope, and how to create opportunities where you get more responsibility as a PM. Fareed is such an A-plus human full of so much insight, and I'm really excited for you to learn from him. With that, I bring you Fareed Mosavat.\n\nLenny (00:01:32):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda is an all-in-one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place. I actually use Coda every single day. It's my home base for organizing my newsletter writing. It's where I plan my content calendar, capture my research, and write the first drafts of each and every post. It's also where I curate my private knowledge repository for paid newsletter subscribers, and it's also how I manage the workflow for this very podcast.\n\nLenny (00:01:59):\nOver the years, I've seen Coda evolve from being a tool that makes teams more productive to one that also helps bring the best practices across the tech industry to life with an incredibly rich collection of templates and guides in the Coda Doc Gallery, including resources from many guests on this podcast, including Shreyas, Gokul, and Shishir, the CEO of Coda. Some of the best teams out there, like Pinterest, Spotify, Square, and Uber, use Coda to run effectively and have published their templates for anyone to use.

Hey, John.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:03:03):\nHey, Lenny. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:05):\nJohn, give us a behind-the-scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:03:16):\nWell, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop. Think collect data, inform, vet, ship experiments, and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So the big aha was seeing how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach, and send data to other destinations. Experiment and CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.\n\nLenny (00:03:37):\nSupporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:03:41):\nYeah. So Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.\n\nLenny (00:03:50):\nAbsolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John, and head to amplitude.com to get started.\n\nLenny (00:03:58):\nFareed, welcome to the podcast.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:04:01):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. I'm super excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:03):\nSo to set a little context for listeners that aren't super familiar with you, can you give us just a 45-second overview of your career and all the wonderful things that you've done?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:04:14):\nGreat. Hi. I'm Fareed Mosavat. I live in Berkeley, California with my wonderful wife and two children, but I've been a product leader across a variety of different companies over the course of my career. Today, I am the chief development officer at Reforge where I help run all of our content teams, parts of our operations, and our partnerships with wonderful experts like yourself.\n\nLenny (00:04:33):\nAwesome. What about all the other things you've done?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:04:35):\nSo, previous to this, I spent almost four years as the director of product for a team called Lifecycle at Slack that is effectively a growth team. We're responsible for the self-service business at Slack all the way from first sign up, first team creation through to the first invites, activation, expansion, modernization, and even connecting the dots with our SMB sales team to help nurture some of those small self-service teams into larger commitments through our sales team.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:05:02):\nI came to that through a variety of different growth and product leadership roles at a bunch of different startups on larger companies. I built one of the first growth teams at Instacart for about a year and a half in the middle of their acceleration. I was VP of Product at a company called Runkeeper before that in Boston, health and fitness tracking company. I was a general manager at Zynga. I got there through a startup that I was an engineer at, basically started as an engineer, ended as a head of product over the course of a couple of years, and then got acquired into Zynga, and actually started my career with almost seven years at Pixar Animation Studios working on visual effects, software tools, and other creative tech to try and solve problems for a bunch of wonderful films you've probably seen or your kids have seen.\n\nLenny (00:05:45):\nPlease tell us the films that you worked at. I had no idea that you worked at Pixar.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:05:48):\nI am credited on Finding Nemo, Cars, Wally, and Up.\n\nLenny (00:05:55):\nWhat? I did not know any of this.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:05:57):\nYeah. Yeah. Basically, I started there right out of college. I was super interested in computer graphics. I'd actually been an intern there, was very lucky to be interested in that in the moment where they were really accelerating the growth of the company going from like the whole company is working on one film to like, \"Okay. We're trying to release a film every 18 months.\" So they really scaled up, and I had been studying computer graphics, and then I was an engineer focused on computer graphics and a little bit of research on that in college, was an intern there, and joined, and just got to see a fun growth period at that company, and really, I think in a lot of ways is the root of why I love doing product management because everything I worked on was at the intersections of interesting creative problems, interesting technical problems, and interesting storytelling problems.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:06:45):\nSo, in a lot of ways, it was like... I think if I connect the dots backwards to the Steve Jobsism is the beginning of how I got interested in solving high-level strategic problems across a bunch of different people doing different kinds of work and maybe how I got relatively good at it. It was because even as an engineer, I was sitting in the middle of those pieces, but I got bored, which sounds crazy, and decided to jump into a startup that nobody had ever heard of that had eight employees in 2006, and the rest is history from there.\n\nLenny (00:07:17):\nYeah. I wasn't planning to talk about Pixar, but I am so curious. One more question there. What's something that you learned from Pixar that has informed the way that you build products or think about product or your career?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:07:28):\nAt the foundation of it is when I first got there, I thought what was important was modeling how things work in the real world. They're making things look right, so to speak. What I learned there is that actually, you're trying to deliver an end experience, and product, and story to your viewers, to your audience. It doesn't actually matter what's real. It matters what you see on the screen. It matters the emotion that it creates, the story that it creates, how it reinforces all of the other pieces. So the technical pieces were just a means to that end. So, of course, we used real physics and real math behind the scenes to do stuff, but if you had to box the numbers to make it look right, that's the right thing to do.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:08:15):\nSo I remember as I was working on early effects, bubbles, sand, so this kind of stuff, I was trying to do things the way it would really work, and then the camel would look at it, and almost the first lesson I learned there was like, \"No. What matters is the end result, the end product, the end feeling.\" I feel like I go back to that a lot as I think about product development not just from an engineering and technical standpoint, but from what's in your strategy doc isn't that important. It's actually just an input into the end experience that you're trying to deliver for customers. When we're thinking about content development in our programs, it's not important that all of the principles fit perfectly together into this MEC framework. It matters that you help people solve actual problems. What's the end goal that you're looking for? I feel like that's the lesson that I just keep going back to for my time there.\n\nLenny (00:09:06):\nIt's a great segue to Reforge, which I want to spend a little bit of time on. Folks that listen to this podcast know that I'm a huge fan, and we have a lot of Reforge alumni on this podcast.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:09:15):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:09:16):\nSo a couple questions there. One, you said you're a chief development officer. Is that your title?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:09:20):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:09:21):\nWhat is it that you do as a chief development officer?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:09:23):\nIt's funny because in a lot of ways, it's not a made-up title, but trying to figure out how a role that I ended up sliding into as I grew my engagement with the company, how do we describe what it is? So I think what's unique about Reforge versus a traditional software startup, or a SaaS company, or all the other things you see is that we're not just a software company. Of course, we have a website. Go to it. You see things, you deliberate, but we also build a lot of stuff and experiences that fit into that. We build content. We build programs today. We're going to build all kinds of other content. We have live cohort experiences that are designed and thoughtful, and we build and try to make, solve certain customer problems.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:10:08):\nWe have a member slack that we try to design to solve certain problems. We have the people like yourself and a lot of the guests that you've had on the podcast like Elena, or Adam Fishman, or Casey who plugged into our system to help us build all of those things because at the end of the day, our job is to help unlock the expertise that's locked in the heads of the greatest operators in the world. So who do we work with? How do we develop that content? How do we make their ideas shine? How do we solve real member problems? How do we help people do work?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:10:38):\nA lot of that is a product experience that in some ways, like a Pixar movie, there's the technical aspects and the UX aspects, but there's also all of the content, and the partners that we work with, and those pieces. I own all of that piece, like the production, content, the new product experiences, and all of the pieces that fit in there. So we have a team of really talented, amazing people that work on these things, and I lead those teams.\n\nLenny (00:11:02):\nIt's interesting how that comes back to your Pixar experience of the combination of intersection of art and technology.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:11:09):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:11:09):\nThat's so interesting. Okay. Never thought about it that way. Yeah.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:11:12):\nLike we said, it's easier to connect the dots in reverse than moving forward. I have always been not that precious about titles, career roles, et cetera. I've really found myself drawn to, \"Is this an interesting problem that I believe I can bring something valuable to the table? Can I help solve this in some meaningful way, and will I learn something great and new from this role?\" At every step, I made those decisions. I've gone up and down the title stack from VP down to ICPM, from engineer to product, from product to this new thing and content. In every single one, I think it's a lot about, \"What are you bringing to the table to help solve that problem? What are you taking away from the job and learning from it, and how do you turn that into the next step?\"\n\nLenny (00:11:57):\nAwesome, and we're going to chat about a lot of those learnings from your experience going through these career journeys, but one last question on Reforge. Just like how big is Reforge at this point? How many cohorts? How many students? How many people work there? What's the operation scale at this point?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:12:11):\nIt's hard to count how many employees because it's growing so fast. I believe we are at just around 150 total employees across the whole company right now.\n\nLenny (00:12:19):\nWow.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:12:20):\nThat doesn't include our executives and residents, subject matter experts, and the partners we work with. That's full-time employees working on the business. Of course, we have a large product development, product design, engineering, and data teams, but also the teams that I run. We call them strategy leads, content producers, content strategists, content designers, building all of that content as well as our partners team and operations team. So it's a relatively large company at this point. When I first started working with it, it was a scrappy operation of just a handful of folks, but we've grown quite a bit of over the last year.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:12:51):\nWith that, we support, I believe, now 19 total cohort-based programs across product, engineering, marketing, and growth-related topics as well as a bunch of new experiences that we're working on for the coming future here in the next year. We have well over 10,000 active members on the platform, about a dozen executives and residents that work to help us deliver those programs, and hundreds of partners. We call them experts and operators in the space who contribute to our programs in different ways either as guests or as mentors, or helping us develop content behind the scenes.\n\nLenny (00:13:25):\nAwesome, and I taught a couple guest lectures this past cohort. I think my second ever lesson was with you. You were the teacher?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:13:32):\nYes. Yeah. We talked about instant buy, I think they're called, but I can't remember the name.\n\nLenny (00:13:37):\nInstant book. Close, close.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:13:38):\nInstant book, sorry.\n\nLenny (00:13:38):\nYeah.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:13:38):\nOn the Reforge platform for experimentation and testing program, which was, yeah, actually, also my first program that I helped lead at Reforge, and I think you were my first guest.\n\nLenny (00:13:47):\nOh my god.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:13:47):\nSo, thanks. Thanks for not making me look bad.\n\nLenny (00:13:51):\nThank you. So what's cool about your background working at Reforge and all the companies you worked at is that you've seen a lot of PM careers go well and PM careers go not so well. So what I want to spend our time on is talking through just the career development journey for product managers and in particular, the challenges that PMs face trying to become better PMs and just why it's innately tricky to become better as a product manager. It's such a weird job to get better at. So my first question is actually, why is it so hard to become better as a PM? Why is it innately a tricky thing to develop as a PM?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:14:28):\nOne of the trickiest bits about it is that there's no clear, obvious pre-training you can do that gives you a baseline set of understanding that you can use to be a product manager. People come from MBAs, people come from certain kinds of majors in college, et cetera, but it's not engineering where like, \"Okay. With a couple of weeks of bootcamp or a couple of years of a computer science education, I have some foundational knowledge that helps me go from zero to one in my first job.\" Not only does it help me break in because I have a credential that helps me land that job, and we can talk about why landing your first PM job is so hard, but also, there's not a lot of stuff that one-to-one directly correlates to the work you're going do on a day-to-day basis.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:15:11):\nI think there's an idea that Naval Ravikant talked about on Twitter and in blog posts a long time ago, this concept of specific knowledge that can only be gathered by actually doing the work. A lot of product management, really, is like that. You get better by doing it, and so you start in the same place, if that makes sense. Of course, there are different skills and intellectual capacities, et cetera that help different people be more successful at it, but at the end of the day, you don't know if a PM is going to be great until they start doing that work. So I think that's one of the pieces that's very hard.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:15:41):\nThe second is the thing I just alluded to, which is breaking in and getting your first role. It's just a very difficult situation for a lot of companies, and there are a couple of different paths to it, but none of them are straightforward. There's no clear linear path, except for maybe being a Stanford or Harvard grad, top-tier school grad, NCS with an internship, goes to Google to do an APM program. There are a couple of these things that are surefire, but I don't think they guarantee success, and they are actually very limited in terms of the number of people that they let into the business.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:16:13):\nSo I think this is what makes it so hard is that there's not any upfront training you can really do to prepare yourself or even knock down the door to break in. But then, also, it's not clear there's a lot of training within a company that would help you be successful generally on the job of product management. You can learn how to be a good PM at Google, you can learn to be a good PM at Facebook, but it is up to each individual PM to figure out how to generalize what they're doing to move from different kinds of product across different kinds of product work as they get more senior to solve bigger problems, et cetera.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:16:51):\nSo what we tried to do at Reforge is we are focused on helping people accelerate that learning loop. It's not, \"Hey, if you take this class, now you're qualified to be a PM.\" It's not really like that. I don't know if that's possible. I hope it will be someday, but it is very difficult. I think it's more, \"Hey, we want to help you when you encounter certain kinds of problems, not have to solve them from first principles, but following the footsteps of the people who have done great work in the past, generalize those lessons.\" But at the end of the day, you still have to get down and do the work.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:17:25):\nYou can't do homework, you can't do exercises, you can't do fake stuff. You have to work on real products at real companies with real customers, with real data to get better at product management. So any kind of training, mentorship, reading, et cetera that you do is just a layer on top of that. The real acceleration happens from doing it and getting more reps. There are ways that I think great PMs use to go faster on this loop, but you still have to do the work. At the core is you have to actually execute and deliver great products, and you have to do it over, and over, and over again.\n\nLenny (00:18:03):\nYes. Let's absolutely dig into that. Let me put out a couple mental models that I'm thinking as you're talking.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:18:07):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:18:08):\nOne is just if you think about a pie chart of a great PM's career and/or investments they make along their career journey, how do you break up that pie chart? Like some percentage is doing the work, some percentage is courses, maybe some percentage is books. So just putting that out there in case that's useful to think about, and then the other is thinking about the trajectory of a PM on a line chart, and what are these inflection points that you've seen most impact the career trajectory of a PM?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:18:34):\nSo let's start at the first one, the pie chart idea. What percent is spent on different things? Unsurprisingly because Reforge is all about growth loops, I think of this in terms of a loop actually, which is like, \"What is that learning or career acceleration, or ability acceleration loop? At the core, again, at the top of the loop is execution. You have to have a real problem. You're working on with real customers that you want to solve in some way. So, you're executing. You're delivering. You're learning at the beginning. It's all about execution. So we'll start with the pie chart at the beginning. It's almost all execution.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:19:06):\nWhat are the problems you give a junior or brand new PM? Known problem, known solution. \"Please work with engineering and design to deliver that thing on time, and then tell us what happened.\" So it's like a very tightly constrained problem. As you level up, then some of these things become more unknowns. So there's execution, but I think the next step that great product managers do is they think about how to generalize that execution a little bit. So it's not just, \"Okay. Now, I know what the best settings page for Slack is.\" It's, \"What generalizations did you make? What are the things that you can take that are applicable to other stuff?\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:19:49):\nSome of that is execution-oriented, how to best work with engineers, how to iterate on designs, what customers do and don't do, rules of thumb, those kinds of things. I think that's where reading courses, et cetera can help because sometimes by bringing other... or one-on-one conversations with experts, et cetera. There are a whole bunch of different ways, but is that the generalization step? \"Hey, I did this thing. Oh, other people have done something similar. How do I connect the dots on that? How do I make this experience bigger than what I've just done and lead me to help solve other problems?\"\n\nLenny (00:20:23):\nThese are things you're doing in your head, basically. You're just developing frameworks, mental models, things that you're just taking with you to the next project in your mind.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:20:31):\nExactly. So, to use an example, there was a time at Instacart where we were working on onboarding, brand new onboarding and activation flow for customers. We tried a lot of different stuff. We tried the slimmest, fastest, lowest friction, least number of steps path in, and then we had this hypothesis about helping people get set up. So we took the opposite approach, which was a really long onboarding with a bunch of different steps and wanted to see, \"Was that more effective or less effective?\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:20:59):\nThe generalization is, \"Oh, for products that had a high bar to activation, sometimes more set up and higher friction, good friction could actually help those customers be successful. There are other kinds of products that are high-intent where they know what they need to do to have simple actions where lowering friction might be the right thing.\" So, that's a generalization. It's a generalization of, \"Oh, I learned a thing.\" It's a hypothesis about how that might generalize other kinds of products or other kinds of problems that you approach. I think some of that can come from seeing it from the outside, listening to a podcast, hearing you say it, taking a course, et cetera. But at the end of the day, you have to experience it to see how it applies to the world.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:21:42):\nThen, the next bit is communication, and I think this is a bit that a lot of product managers, obviously, and any job miss, but you can't just do the work. You have to actually communicate the work. You have to talk about what you're doing, what you've generalized, what you've learned so that you can hit the next step, which is scale your opportunities. Go from smaller known problem, known solution to maybe known problem, unknown solution type of work, which is the next step.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:22:08):\nThen, eventually, to where you want to be as a senior, great, high-level individual contributor PM to the not quite known problem, maybe a goal with a set of problems and unknown solutions, unknown problems, unknown solutions, where you're actually identifying customer problems and moving towards on that. So scaling up your opportunity, and then executing again. I think of this as a loop of learning, and so of course, the percentages change over time as you move more senior in your career, but also, depending on where you're at in the step that the percentages change.\n\nLenny (00:22:40):\nGot it. So, just to recap, execute, just do the work, just ship.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:22:44):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:22:44):\nGeneralize learnings from shipping to build up your gut feeling of what will work and not work.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:22:49):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:22:50):\nLearn to communicate things you're doing, and then scale the things that you're executing based on this gut feeling you're building, and communicate that out, and just continue. Do you think scaling take on more scope or have more impact? Is that how you think about scaling, that last piece?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:23:06):\nYeah. I think it's one moving from knowns to unknowns.\n\nLenny (00:23:08):\nGreat.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:23:09):\nSo like you're being given a hairier, harder to untangle types of problems with more unknowns and more autonomy. I think the second is, yeah, of course, with... although I think for the beginning of your career, you tend to go deeper. So it's like, \"Okay. I'm going to work on growth, let's say, or core product, or zero-to-one products, or technical scaling, whatever it is. I'm going to go deeper on that,\" and then over time, that turns into width, but this is why the generalization step is important.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:23:39):\nIf you want to be a product leader, you cannot be seen solely as a specialist in that certain kind of product work, and so the generalization step is really important. If you want to move from growth to core product, you need to show that you're not just running experiments and driving numbers up. You need to show and communicate that you're learning deeper lessons about how customer psychology works, and what products people resonate with, and how to think about the business more holistically, and then communication. No one knows what you're thinking if you don't tell them. So if you don't communicate, you don't have control over those scaled opportunities. Usually, your manager, or the organization, or the company does. Maybe by switching jobs, you have some control, but you need to earn that right. You need to communicate. That's why I think there's pieces of the loop you can control and pieces that are externalized.\n\nLenny (00:24:25):\nI'm curious, in your own career, what the biggest inflections of growth have been either in terms of learning, or impact, or just opportunity?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:24:33):\nThe first big one was when I switched from being an engineer to being a product... I didn't even know it was product management, but a product leader of some kind. I think there are two things that happen. One is you got to be doing this stuff, but often, somebody needs to see it. The scale opportunity piece of the step often requires someone from outside to notice that you're doing something really well and trust you with a bigger opportunity. I think of this as sponsorship, not mentorship. I don't necessarily find that in my career. I've had a lot of managers where I'm like, \"Wow, their day-to-day help was super awesome at helping me be a better leader.\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:25:10):\nI hope that I've been that for some people, but I don't have a ton of examples of that in my career. But what I do have is a couple examples of people who deeply trusted me to solve big problems, and I don't know. I'm lucky to have had that or otherwise, but one was a CEO of that startup who's now a venture capitalist. His name is Nabeel Hyatt. I was like, \"Hey, you seem to understand the data better than anybody here. You're solving these problems. Help us figure out what we're going to do next,\" which now we call product management.\n\nLenny (00:25:36):\nBut he was at, by the way?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:25:38):\nit was called Conduit Labs.\n\nLenny (00:25:39):\nOkay. Yeah.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:25:39):\nIt's a game company. Then, eventually, I was the director of product for our Boston studio. The next was at Slack. I was an ICPM working on activation and growth on a team of three or four other PMs, and there were a couple of moments where by communicating my work and talking through how I was solving problems, people noticed that I knew what I was doing and gave me bigger and bigger opportunities. One of those was Merci Grace, who I think has been on your pod and was a wonderful sponsor for me. Then, again, when Merci left, April Underwood, who's the CPO, said, \"It seems like you have a handle on this. I'd like you to take on a bigger range of problems across all of this growth and not just the modernization piece that I've been working on before.\" So I think in each of those steps it's about creating trust and knowing that you have a sponsor there, someone who's going to go to bat for you.\n\nLenny (00:26:25):\nI really love this point of sponsorship. We haven't talked a lot about this on the podcast. There's a lot of talk of finding a coach or having a manager that teaches you how to do the job, but this idea of just getting to a place where someone gives you an opportunity to shine, and that's been really big in my career just like certain managers just, \"Here, Lenny. You take this, and let's see what you can do.\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:26:44):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:26:45):\nIs there anything else you can recommend to folks to create opportunities for sponsorship? You talked about communication, executing well. Is that just the core of it, like doing a great job and communicating the great job you're doing?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:26:57):\nThis idea that it's what you do and that's multiplied by your ability to show that work and communicate it, and that's the impact that you can have, but you have to have not just impact on the customers, but also on the organization. I think it is impact on the organization, changing the way people think about problems, helping generalize what works and what doesn't work, bringing learnings to the table.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:27:18):\nFor me, I've worked a lot on growth, and I've treated a huge part of my job as not just moving the numbers, but also teaching the organization how our growth model works, how the pieces fit together, what our customers care about, what's working, what's not working, and that creates a lot of, A, leverage in other parts of the organization because they can do better work by having more information, but also, B, trust. Trust from leadership, trust from your peers, and otherwise.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:27:44):\nSo, now, how do you get to that? Some of it is just luck. Someone has got to believe in you. You can create your luck by being good at communicating and solving hard problems. I think the other piece is knowing when you go into an organization, \"Is this a role that's important to the company? Is it on the list?\" I think it is easier to find sponsors, communicate, and create leverage if the thing you're working on is in the top four or five most important things the company is working on. I find myself drawn to those kinds of problems, and I think that's one way because then, all of a sudden, CEOs notice what you're working on, heads of product notice what you're working on, and your peers notice what you're working on.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:28:22):\nThe other bit is curiosity. I think to be in the seat where people want to sponsor you, I think you have to show a handle on not just what you're doing, but how that relates to all of the things around you. So I call this going two stack levels up, two stack levels down in terms of your curiosity and what you understand, and also, knowing what's to the left and what's to the right. So let's use the example of if I'm working on activation on growth, let's say, or monetization. It doesn't matter. One of those two pieces. When I say two stack levels down, I like to understand how we build customers, how it works in Stripe, what are our dunning policies, what are the technical things that work and don't work in the pieces maybe down to the database. Right?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:29:08):\nIt's like technical curiosity, those kinds of things, but also mental models for what's above you. How do we grow? How does modernization fit into that? What are the trade-offs versus free growth versus paid growth? How important is this to the company? How does it fit into our long-term strategy? Those kinds of things. So it's like the strategic things above you. I like two stack levels because it's like you should understand your boss's priorities and your boss's boss's priorities. Eventually, that means you have to know what the board is thinking, right? Then, left and right is, \"What are the core product teams working on that I could help advise on in terms of modernization or they could advise me on what they're thinking and what might be coming next? How do we fit together with the enterprise part of the business even though I'm working on self-serve? How do I think about sales? Do they have input, like interesting customer conversations or input?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:29:58):\nIt's this curiosity like walking around, getting to know what people are doing, and being seen as an expert. Are you the desk people go to when they have questions? Are you a person that people ask the opinion when you're trying to figure out how the dots connect? I have found for me, maybe this is just because this is a strength of mine, that connecting the dots of how the whole company works and how all the pieces fit together has been one of the ways that I've driven that sponsorship. I think for each individual, you have to figure out what your superpower is and where you can be actually top 10%, and then lean into opportunities and also problems that help you show that and shine it that way.\n\nLenny (00:30:34):\nThat is such cool advice. I think what's cool about that is I imagine you just go to your manager and even just ask, \"Hey, I'd love to understand just what are your highest priorities, and then what are your manager's?\" Just ask these questions. Just that alone I think communicates a lot about how much you care and your interest there, and that creates trust, even if you don't do a ton with it, and knowing what your manager cares about is just going to help in so many other ways just like, \"Okay. This matters to them. I'm going to make sure to do a good job there.\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:31:00):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny (00:31:01):\nSo that is a really cool framework.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:31:02):\nNot only do a good job there, but I'm going to figure out how to communicate what I'm doing to be only the parts that are important and matter to them. I'm going to know that when I hit a certain decision that needs to be made, whether I need their input or not. There are all these different pieces like understanding when to be heads-down, when to be heads-up, when to communicate, when not to, but I think understanding how all the pieces fit together, you really just try, and I always think of it as trying to build a mental model of how the company works, and what's important to it, and what's the equation, so to speak, or what are all the boxes, and then figure out like, \"How is my work creating leverage in that?\" I find that when you are thinking at that level, people tend to trust you.\n\nLenny (00:31:44):\nThe core of trust is people. Your manager and their leaders need to feel like you will do a good job and a bigger responsibility, and what gives them trust? Oh, they do a good job, or they're curious, and excited, and understand all these things that they need to understand. So it all makes sense, and I'm always weary of asking PMs to do more work. It's such a busy, long hours job already, and what's cool about these things you're talking about is it's not necessarily a lot more work. It's just a little bit of research and a little bit of digging and thinking.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:32:12):\nYeah. I think the hard part of this is I have not figured out how to do this well in a remote environment without throwing a lot of one-on-ones on people's calendars because sometimes you figured this out just by hearing conversations, hang out at lunch, and asking questions, and those kinds of things, but it's certainly not impossible. You just have to work out a little more,\n\nLenny (00:32:31):\nJust more Zooms.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:32:32):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:32:33):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell it to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table, but getting a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious, and expensive.\n\nLenny (00:33:20):\nEnter, Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Get started today.\n\nLenny (00:33:50):\nSo I know something you spend a lot of time thinking about is the transition from an ICPM to a manager, and you have this really epic post that I think you call the Product Leader Canyon that you think of this as a canyon that a lot of PMs don't cross. So I want to spend a little bit of time here. Can you maybe just talk about what this canyon is, and why it exists?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:34:08):\nYeah. We talked a little bit about the first of very hard part in product management career development, which is like, \"How do I land my first job?\" Not a pro at that. We can talk about that more, but then this path from IC to more senior IC working on bigger problems that have more business impact, et cetera, it's a relatively straightforward path. We just talked about some of the ways that you do that. You get a deeper understanding across a wider range of business problems. You solve more unknowns versus being handed problems to solve, et cetera, and you do that by being good at your job. You do that by being good at your job basically as a solo product manager on an island.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:34:48):\nWe talked about communication and those kinds of things, but at the end of the day, like we described, most of the work is execution. Most of the work is partnering with your engineering manager, partnering with your designer and your team to build stuff and deliver stuff. You've gotten there by being really good at that. Right? You've gotten there by getting in the weeds, getting in the details, sweating what matters, working hard at it. So someone says, \"We'd love for you to lead this team.\" Great. It's really easy to look at that and say, \"Okay. Now, instead of owning free to paid conversion, I own growth overall.\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:35:28):\nThe first thing you do is start to figure out, \"What are the most interesting and valuable projects that I can work on? As an IC, I can only have one person on my team to go dive in and work on those things to make a lot of leverage.\" This can create a little bit of a spiral of failure because it's the hard job. The IC part of the job is really hard. So, now, I gave you more work across more things, and you're already working 56 hours a week. Now, you got to keep track of more projects across more teams and more people, and maybe you kept the two or three most critical ones to yourself.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:36:04):\nSo that's one angle is learning about, yes, it's probably the right thing in the near term for you to focus, and work on this, and be really directive about what to do, and get in every single detail, and make sure you deliver the best product. But long run, you've taken a learning opportunity away from someone else, and you've taken the opportunity for you to be a leveraged person that is more valuable than just their time away as well. So I think that's one piece that drives a lot of failures, just this like, \"Okay. Now, I have more problems to work on. I'm going to go deeper on it,\" and handing the people on your team the least interesting, least leveraged, least fun stuff to do, thinking that's how you get to like, \"Oh, now, I get to work on the fun projects, and the interesting and high-leverage ones, and I'll leave all the other ones to other people.\"\n\nLenny (00:36:51):\nI think you call this the manager death spiral. Is that the same?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:36:55):\nYeah. Yeah, manager death spiral.\n\nLenny (00:36:56):\nYeah.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:36:56):\nThis is not unique to product management. This happens in almost every leadership role. You're in a position. You have broader responsibility. You got there by being the best IC on the team probably, so your instincts are to, \"I see a bunch of important stuff,\" and do management stuff too. Right?\n\nLenny (00:37:15):\nPeople may be like, \"Oh, shit. How do I avoid this death spiral?\" Do you have any advice? Maybe you'll get there, but just how do you avoid this death spiral of keeping all the good stuff and just not scaling yourself?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:37:24):\nI think the first is, honestly, just you have to start trusting other people, which is not common to where you've been till today, but you have to start trusting. You have to shift from doer to editor is the way I think about it. You have to shift from, \"My job is to do the work,\" to, \"My job is to make the work better. My job is to plus the work, to review the work, to help other people solve problem.\" Sometimes that's by being directive. Right?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:37:51):\nSometimes that's by letting them run because you're like, \"Lenny, you're great. Please go solve this problem. Call me when you have a problem.\" If you have people that are in that upper quadrant of like they understand the problem, they have the level of experience to solve it, it's maybe not 100% important. Maybe it is. That kind of thing. Then, there's the coach in the middle, which is like, \"How do I help make that work better?\" They have to start figuring out like, \"Where is each person on your team in their expertise, and what level of input is the highest leverage for me?\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:38:24):\nI actually think of it as start thinking in terms of being lazy, \"What's the least amount of work I could do to make this thing as good as possible?\" versus, \"How do I do as much work as possible to make sure it's great?\" So it's like looking in terms of ROI. The other is just hiring, bringing on great people you trust, making sure you're staffed appropriately, and there's just a second bit. I think one of the bigger mistakes that new ICs make on teams, that they still treat problems the same way they did as ICs, which normally, when you run a pod, basically, your job is, \"How do I deliver the most value with the resources I have?\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:38:57):\nWhen you're a leader, it's now your job to propose, \"What are the resources we need to have the most impact on this problem?\" I think I personally have messed this up a bunch of times where at the end of the core, I'll be like, \"Yeah, but we only had four engineers, and this is what we could do.\" I'm like, \"That wasn't what we asked you to do. We asked you to solve this problem. So adding four more people was what you needed or you needed the marketing team to do X, Y, and Z.\" You need to go out and do that work now. It is not just your job to get what you can get done with the resources in front of you. It's your job to marshal resources both inside your org and across your organization. I think that's another big area that's related to the trust bit because, again, it's this habit of, \"Oh, I got here by doing everything myself.\" You have to start realizing that your job is to convince other people to do work too.\n\nLenny (00:39:49):\nAwesome. So, going back to the canyon. So the first piece was essentially over-focusing on just being too good at the thing you're already doing versus going broader, is that right?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:39:59):\nMm-hmm. Yeah. So it's like, \"Hey, how do I maximize my output? I can do this myself faster than I can explain it to someone else, so I'll just do it,\" and then finding that you're blocking your team because you're in the middle of every single decision, finding that you're totally overworked, and finding that people aren't learning or growing because those opportunities have been taken from them. So what do you do to break that? You have to just slowly start to give up, trust, do that. So I think that's the one bit is that death spiral of what's getting stuff done.\n\nLenny (00:40:31):\nNo, no. You can curse all you want. That's all good.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:40:33):\nOkay. Great. Oh, you've just... Well, be careful with \"all you want.\"\n\nLenny (00:40:36):\nNobody has cursed yet on this podcast, and it's all allowed.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:40:40):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:40:41):\nIt's the internet. I don't know.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:40:41):\nWe'll solve that.\n\nLenny (00:40:42):\nOkay.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:40:43):\nDon't worry. I think the other is what I call the four types of product work, and I think this is not always right at the manager stage. But for every great product leader, you go from being an expert in some type of product work, and I'll describe what those are, to now owning a portfolio of work across a bunch of different dimensions. So the way I think about product work, and Casey Winters and I worked on this framework together, a lot of it comes from him. So I don't want to oversay it, but it's all part of our product strategy program at Reforge is first, feature work, adding new features, product experiences, et cetera into a product in order to drive engagement with your existing customer base and solve a wider range of problems.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:41:24):\nThe second is growth work. \"How do I help my customers or a broader range of customers connect with the experiences we already have, and drive acceleration and either top-line growth, or modernization, or whatever the most important metrics are. I think you've had many guests on to talk about growth type work. The third is related to growth, but I think is slightly different, which is what we call product market fit expansion. So it's not exactly feature work, which is like, \"Hey, now that I use your product more, I have this thing I need in order to keep using it because I'm a power seller,\" those kinds of things. But instead, we want to attract a whole new sub-segments of markets to the product by adding something.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:42:05):\nThere are two forms of product market fit expansion. There's either taking the same product and finding a new audience. Things like internationalization or vertical like, \"I'm going to sell the same product to a different vertical because we're a verticalized product.\" The other is selling a different product to the same audience. This is what bundling strategies basically look like. Right? So adding new marketing tools to a marketing suite, et cetera that attract a different kind of customer and that either drive upsell or drive new audiences to come to that.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:42:34):\nSo that's the third kind of product work, and then there's the fourth that is always forgotten by a lot of PMs which is scaling work. So what is the stuff we're doing that is because we are growing, there's new product work we need to do? Most people think of this as technical scaling, but I actually put things like trust, and safety, and other kinds of what we call user scaling problems in this as well. There are a lot of problems that come up at Airbnb just because instead of having 10 hosts, you have 10,000 hosts. Right? There are a lot of problems at Twitter and Facebook that are well puzzle-sized that are a result of their scale, and I think that's a chunk of work that I put in the same category as technical scaling, which is like, \"How do we make sure the product continues to work for the people who are using it?\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:43:15):\nSo the challenge of the four kinds of product work. \"Okay. Great. We have a framework. How is that useful, Fareed?\" It's not that useful. It is to know what kind you're doing, but I think as you go up the stack of product leadership, you are going from being probably an expert in one of these, so for me, growth, to needing to think about all these other ones, and you've probably never done them before. Right? Maybe you've done two, but how do you lead across a bunch of different things, and how do you make sure not to be over-focused on the one that you care the most about?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:43:46):\nWe've all seen this. Right? It's like growth leader takes over, and everything is a growth problem. Everything is an experiment. Everything should be measured. That's not necessarily true for some of these other kinds of work, and so how do you start to lead, and grow, and build a portfolio across those? I think that's where some of the stuff we talked about before, deep curiosity, looking across, asking a lot of questions, getting to a foundational understanding of what's important there, et cetera is really important.\n\nLenny (00:44:14):\nGot it. So part of this is learning new types of product work. So we're talking about trying to move from IC to manager and the things that get in the way, and so is the advice there just start to learn and understand... Maybe, say, you're doing feature work. You're just building a dashboard for your users. Is your advice there like start thinking about how growth works and understand the growth strategy of the company so that people give you this opportunity of, \"Okay. Let's put Fareed on maybe a couple other things here because he already understands a little bit more about growth?\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:44:45):\nYeah. I think there's a framework thing, and then there's like, \"What practical advice?\" So from a framework perspective, I think it's important to ask the question, \"For each of the things that I am responsible for, what category does this fall into? What's important about it? What are the right ways to think about building that, given that it is different than what I've built before?\" So, some of this, you can do within an org. If you're working on core product stuff, you probably have an adoption problem on one of your products, and there's growth work associated with driving usage of that thing.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:45:18):\nSo I think there's a piece at which even within a certain sub-segment that this can be valuable. You could be working on enterprise, which looks a lot like a lot of scaling work, right, and a lot of feature work, \"Get me the right administrative dashboards and these kinds of things,\" but also, maybe you have a problem that's a growth problem. \"How do I drive adoption? How do I actually drive usage? How do I make sure that our new enterprise customers are activated and retained?\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:45:43):\nSo I think at scale, any product leadership work has some pieces of these different kinds, and I think building a mental model for, \"What are the other things we need to do? What's the right portfolio allocation across these different types of product work, and do I have enough of a baseline understanding of the different ways to evaluate and think about those and what the goals are in order to drive leadership across work I might not be able to do myself very well?\" I am not a good technical PM despite having an engineering background. It's been too long, but I hope that I can lead technical scaling, technical debt restructure on my team or at least understand whether it's important to do or not.\n\nLenny (00:46:20):\nSo if you think about this concept of getting through this canyon broadly, it boils down to more scope. Maybe that's the way to think about it. It's like more scope of product work that you work on, being better at different types of work, scaling yourself so that other people can do work on your behalf or within your umbrella, and the point you made about not being satisfied with the resources you have and in helping people understand, \"Here's what we could do if we had this many resources,\" and making the case for that feels like that's the overview. Is that how you think about it?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:46:49):\nYeah. I think that's exactly right, and the last one is really important because now, you have moved to owning the impact. As a leader, you now own the business outcome, the impact, the delivery, not some sub-problem or known answer. You have to define the solutions. You have to talk about how many people you need to do them, and you need to figure out what do you need from the rest of the organization to do that. So, yeah. I think those are the three big buckets of things that I see trip people up.\n\nLenny (00:47:14):\nAwesome, and just add plus one to that last point. Just like a lot of PMs end up being victims of the resources they get and like, \"Oh, how could I have possibly had this impact with the resources you gave me?\" versus, \"How do I avoid that and empower myself to help people understand, 'Here's what I need to do this thing that you want me to do. If you think this is important, here's what we need,' and put it on other people's plate?\" It doesn't mean you'll get it, but it's important to put that up front.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:47:38):\nYeah, and that goes from a \"would be nice\" and makes you a better... more junior or even senior PM makes you a more effective one. It's extra credit. At the leadership level, it's baseline. The baseline is, \"Okay. I believe this is the outcome we need to get to by this time, and this is what it's going to take. Here are the trade-offs. Here's what I need. Here's what I can get you if I can't do that.\" The reason I drum this one home is I feel like this is the mistake I have made now multiple times in my career, and I can't... At this point, I'm embarrassed to have seen it happen over and over again because you just get caught up in like, \"Okay. Here's the team I have. I've got to build a roadmap. I've got to make sure everybody's got work to do,\" and you say focused on feeding that beast, and you forget to ask, \"Is this even the right group to solve this?\" Maybe you need a smaller team even, maybe you need a bigger team, or maybe you need different people. I think often, you find yourself victim of the circumstances instead of owning the situation.\n\nLenny (00:48:39):\nI love that. When did you realize this was something you should be doing?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:48:42):\nI've learned different versions of this lesson now multiple times. I learned it at Instacart. I had a very small team, and we've got a lot done. But honestly, I think I failed to make the case that we should grow it faster and only... It was only when someone was like, \"We should add more people.\" I was like, \"Great. Yeah. Let's do that.\" I don't think I was hurt by that, but I think it was a, \"Oh, you have permission. You should have asked,\" kind of thing. I think at Slack, the lesson I learned was about cross-functional. I think we did a good job of making the case for why we needed new teams or add more things to drive more impact, but I still took a very product approach to solving activation and monetization expansion type problems.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:49:25):\nWhat I think is I look at what could have moved the needle more and what it could have made me a more successful leader at that company. It would've been partnering more closely with marketing, for instance, to figure out how we could be working on things together, helping drive their roadmap, and vice versa. Same with sales. Same with the data org. Same with finance. Those kinds of things where I don't think I was driving enough of the high-level outcome I owned, which is driving growth in the self-service business across the other parts of the company that needed to do that. I was a product leader, so I did product work, and I... Lesson learned.\n\nLenny (00:50:05):\nYeah. Thanks for sharing that. So we've been talking a lot about the regular path, and getting better and accelerating your path as a product leader, and staying on this track. There's also this alternative track that I know you're passionate about, and Reforge just become a beacon, it feels like, of folks that are moving away from working at one company to working at many companies and scaling their impact. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on what you've seen there. There's this large trend of just senior people becoming advisors, writing things, newsletters, for example. I'm curious what you think is happening there and how you think about that.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:50:41):\nIt's interesting. The whys are hard to pin down, but it's definitely happening. I think some of it is maybe COVID-induced, some of it is remote work driving these trends, and some of it is just like there are a lot more leaders who are a lot more in demand. So, just to recap, a trend that I think we are seeing and that has been really interesting is a trend of senior leaders, people with meaningful operating experience, first, diversifying their impact maybe while they're still at a full-time role. Someone like yourself, Lenny, maybe was full-time at Airbnb or a similar company and said, \"Hey, I'd like to do some advising, some angel investing, some speaking. Maybe I'll start writing a newsletter on the side,\" and then moving to this new category that I don't feel like really existed. Maybe it did in certain pockets of executive leadership around tech and startups, but really seeing it in product management of a shift towards, \"The best use of my time and my career is to work across a portfolio of problems that a variety of different companies.\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:51:47):\nSo we are seeing a larger percentage of our executive network. It's still small, but working on things like newsletters, podcasts, those and the like at the edge of the content creator side, but also, full-time advisors, fractional heads of growth, fractional heads of product one day a week, et cetera. Long-term advisory relationships, running workshops. These kinds of things that are more like a la carte. I think they love it because of the flexibility that it creates for them. They love it because of the high upside and non-linearity of possibility of results now instead of having equity in one company for four years of 100% of my time. It's a portfolio approach to not just the time and energy, but also the upside and opportunities that are there as well as the fact that they're just so in demand.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:52:41):\nFor senior leaders who have been in meaningful seats at well-known companies, you're getting hit up by recruiters all day long, and the decision, \"What do I want to spend the next four or five, six years of my life on if it's just one thing?\" is a very difficult one. So what we're finding is people seeing, \"Hey, you don't need me full-time. What you need is me here a day a week to help your up and coming leaders be awesome.\" We're just seeing more and more of that in the industry, and it's been a really interesting trend to observe. Of our executives and residents, I would say most now are exploring this kind of advisory, fractional, or otherwise portfolio-based approach to their futures. Whereas most of them came from full-time roles beforehand.\n\nLenny (00:53:24):\nYeah. A program at Reforge is designed for that. The idea there is, \"You don't know what you're going to do next? Come teach a class at Reforge to help some folks out, and then use that as the time to explore what you're going to do next.\" Right?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:53:35):\nYeah. Yeah, it is, and the hypothesis... I was one of the first EIR, so I started as an EIR at the company, and then ended up joining full-time as an executive. The hypothesis was, \"Hey, let's give people six months to a year so that they don't just hop from one really high-stress, really difficult job into the next one. We also want great operators teaching and meeting our programs. How do we build a win-win situation?\" So what we did was we created the Executive in Residence program as a way to help top operators have a transition point, but I think the hypothesis was that most of them would take on the next VP product role, or CPO role, or CMO type role, and what we're finding is that more and more of them are using that space and time.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:54:17):\nThey are building up their understanding of where they're experts and what their real TEDx value is, and then finding ways to do that across a variety of different companies and organizations versus just the single one, one, because they want to try before they buy, so to speak, in terms of of like even if you do end up somewhere full-time, it's nice to be able to really work with them and get to know them because at the executive level in particular, it's a really high level of commitment, and you have a lot of opportunities, so you want to be really careful about it. But also, two, because it may not be the best use of your energy. When you have a lot of frameworks and you have a lot of broad understanding, you have a lot of examples, your value to the ecosystem is often by helping lots of companies be successful, not just one. I suspect that's how you feel about what you're doing as well.\n\nLenny (00:55:07):\nYeah. When I started down this path of experimenting with a newsletter back in the day, I called it Project Avoid Getting a Real Job, and what I was trying to do is figure out, \"Can I make a living doing this thing even though I don't know if there's any way to make money writing a thing?\" My wife is always like, \"There's no money in writing. What are you doing? I thought you wanted to start a company, that you wanted to do some advising.\"\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:55:28):\nYeah. Well, let me talk about why I think the generalization there's no money in writing is true, but I think it's true because it's... In general, maybe not, but what's happening, I think, is people are figuring out, \"What is my specific knowledge,\" just to tie the knots back to the thing we started at the beginning, \"that because I've taken so many reps at this is actually not easily replaceable in a focused area?\" So modernization or building zero-to-one paid channels as a marketer, or whatever it is. Just narrow enough that I know I'm one of the five best in the world at or I can make the case that I'm one of the five best in the world at it. You as a company probably can't hire that person because you're too early, don't have enough money, don't have enough clout, et cetera, and that I have generalized enough in my mind that I can actually be really effective in a small amount of time.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:56:25):\nSo what works for you, I don't know a lot about the mechanics of your newsletter, but it's not just writing. You're writing about a very specific set of topics that you have unique experience in that has harnessed a very focused community, and I think we're seeing this across a bunch of different things that there's a lot of sub-expertise. No one can be an expert at company. Some people claim to be, but when you get down to it, I feel like an expert on bottoms-up SaaS activation strategy is like, \"I can speak pretty confidently about that. Somebody has a problem in that space, I can usually at an hour accelerate their learning pretty dramatically.\" I think as we're finding what these things are and people are getting smarter about what they're looking for, I think it opened up this space where you can be the best in the world at a relatively narrow topic and make a real meaningful living out of it.\n\nLenny (00:57:19):\nThere's two thoughts I want to go into here, and then I think we should probably wrap up, but one is I do worry there's like... everyone that gets to a certain point, it just exits the career track, and who's left to build things? I worry that just everyone is trying to become an influencer/creator person. So what I wanted to chat about briefly is just downsides of this path in life.\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:57:41):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:57:41):\nThe other pieces is for folks listening that want to pursue this direction, what could they do to set themselves up? So the first piece is just like, what are the downsides? I'll share a few already. So in this life that I lead now, I get no health insurance benefits. I get no time off. I get no 401(k) matching. None of that. I have to basically pay an absurd amount of money for health insurance and find ways to take time off, invent PTO policies for myself, and all these sorts of things. I've gotten used to it, but it is weird. My wife is also an independent self-employed person, so we both don't have... If we have a child, we have no mat leave, pat leave. We just have to figure that out. I don't know how I would do that. So that comes to mind for me. What else have you seen as the downside of this path?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:58:25):\nYeah, the second is it's unclear what the longevity is. How far can you be removed from your full-time experience and still be valuable? This is why I actually think this is a better path than what used to happen, which is all the great operators turned into VCs, venture capitalists. Right? In there, you're pretty disconnected from the ops. I think this advisory type path, I'll leave the creator piece alone because I'm not as familiar with it. But in the advisor path, you are still maybe spending a day a week with these companies. You are still doing. You are helping grow the next generation. I don't like to say generation, but next crop of up and coming leaders. So the question mark for me is longevity. Is it possible to build more and more amazing companies if more and more amazing operators are leaving the full-time workforce?\n\nFareed Mosavat (00:59:20):\nI don't know, but I hope that it's better than what it's been because actually, they're building and doing, et cetera. So I think that's the other question mark and downside, and I think we think about this as part of our ecosystem. I think as long as people are doing, and generalizing, and executing, as I talked about it at the beginning, I think they can still be valuable in a meaningful way and maybe provide access to that kind of knowledge for a broader range of companies. The other is just like if everybody does it, then maybe it's not so unique anymore. So I think there's a question there as well.\n\nLenny (00:59:55):\nThe other piece is like you're constantly having to do sales and BD as an advisor like, \"Who's the next company?\" You're always wondering if there will be more, if they stopped. It's a real part of it.\n\nFareed Mosavat (01:00:03):\nThat's why it has not been attractive to me personally, I will say. I like being focused on a singular problem for some amount of time. I do a lot of portfolio-type stuff outside. I advise casually. I do some coaching. Not coaching exactly, but mentorship for a couple of different up and coming product leaders. I do some angel investing, those kinds of things. I like to see what's happening around me, but I do like having an anchor. That's like my main thing, and I don't like selling. It turns out I don't, and so you have to like that, I think, to do some of this stuff. But I think there are things our platform at Reforge will be able to do for these kinds of offers. There's a long period of time to make that easier and easier. No promises, but stay tuned.\n\nLenny (01:00:46):\nOkay, okay. So then, going back maybe as a final question. For folks that are just like, \"That sounds great. Maybe in the future, I want to become a full-time advisor, EIR person, writer person,\" what advice do you have for folks to set their career up for a place where they can get to a place where they can become full-time advisors, let's say?\n\nFareed Mosavat (01:01:04):\nThis is this generalized step I talked about in the learn loop. It becomes even more important if what you want to do is not just do your current job well, but be able to communicate why that expertise is valuable to other people, other companies across a wide range of things. So I would say choose your opportunities carefully to be building the right balance of depth and breadth across different things. You need to connect dots, so you do need different data points from different types of product work and different types of organizations because you don't want to be so narrow that only DDC eCommerce company that sell once-a-year purchases or whatever is the only thing you can work on. That's just an example. I could have come up with a bunch of others.\n\nFareed Mosavat (01:01:51):\nYou need to have some breadth, right, but it's like same problem, different industry. It's one way to think about depth that's focused. Different problem, same industry is another way to think about it, but you have to come up with a unique intersection that is clearly you are in the top tier of the people who know how to do that. That's a little bit nuanced. There's an art to it I think in some respects, but I think that's an important piece of the puzzle.\n\nFareed Mosavat (01:02:14):\nSecond, work at great places. I think this is good advice for almost all product managers in particular, but really, anybody working in tech, for better or for worse, where you worked matters to people for two reasons. One, it's easier to do great work at a place that is fundamentally working. When the tide is rising, there are tons of opportunities to make meaningful, deep, awesome impact. The second is what you talked about. You're going to be in the sales business eventually, and it's a lot easier to sell experience at places people have heard of than places nobody has heard of. Unfortunately, that's I think a big piece of this puzzle as well. I don't have to spend a lot of time talking about what Slack is. You probably don't have to spend a lot of time talking about what Airbnb is. I think that helps, and it is a meaningful piece of the puzzle.\n\nLenny (01:03:04):\nAbsolutely. Fareed, I feel like anybody that listen to this episode is going to be a better product manager. I'm very confident of that, and I'm really appreciative.\n\nFareed Mosavat (01:03:13):\nI hope so.\n\nLenny (01:03:14):\nI'm sure of it. So, just to close, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nFareed Mosavat (01:03:21):\nYou can find me on Twitter almost most days, F-A-R-3-3-D. That's been my handle since I was a young man.\n\nLenny (01:03:29):\nSo complicated.\n\nFareed Mosavat (01:03:30):\nSo check me out there. It's just threes instead at Es, right? That's probably my social network of choice and best place to communicate or hear what I'm thinking about or what I'm doing. Obviously, I do a ton of work at Reforge. On our events, I toast a bunch of different things, do a lot of stuff. If you're interested in these kinds of topics, please, I don't want to make this a sales pitch, but we have a lot of programs that are dedicated to deep dives into the problems that we've talked about here. I'm dedicating this next chapter of my career to helping a wider range of product leaders be great at their jobs, and that's what we do for a living. I hope that we can help folks there.\n\nFareed Mosavat (01:04:06):\nAs to what people can help me with, I don't know. I'm always looking for people working on interesting stuff or with interesting, unique problems. If you're a founder working on something interesting and you're looking for an advisor, practical advisor, not for me, but we have a wide range of network experts that I'd be happy to connect folks with. If you're a product manager on a team that's looking to figure out how to break through on certain problems, reach out. Maybe we can help with Reforge or maybe I can help individually.\n\nLenny (01:04:35):\nThanks for being here, Fareed.\n\nFareed Mosavat (01:04:36):\nYeah. Cheers. Thanks for having me, Lenny. I think what you're doing is wonderful and making a big difference for PMs everywhere, so thank you.\n\nLenny (01:04:44):\nSame. Thanks, man.\n\nFareed Mosavat (01:04:45):\nCheers.\n\nLenny (01:04:47):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How Shopify builds a high-intensity culture | Farhan Thawar (VP and Head of Eng)\n\n## Transcript\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:00:00):\nIf you do the hard path and it doesn't work, actually you still win because you've now done something hard. You've probably worked with smart people. You've learned something along the way that is valuable. I meet lots of job seekers. I go, what are you doing to try to find a job? Are you really learning anything from sending out 10 resumes a day? Why don't you look at the API Docs and build something? Even if you don't get a job at Shopify, you've learned something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):\nFirst, I want to talk about another theme, creating intensity in your organization.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:00:24):\nEveryone says, \"Oh yeah, work hard and do more hours when you're young, whatever.\" I'm like, \"What if you just did more per minute?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:29):\nThe more I dig into the Shopify way working, the more fun stuff I never expected emerges. There's been a drive to delete code and simplify.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:00:37):\nWe have a Delete Code Club. We can always almost find a million-plus lines of code to delete, which is insane.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):\nI found this great quote from you, \"Not everyone can look stupid in public over and over, but I believe it's my superpower.\"\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:00:48):\nI have been in many situations with many sharp people who have said to me, that's the stupidest fucking question I've ever heard. My goal there is not to annoy the person, but it's to understand the content.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):\nI was looking at your LinkedIn and your career history, and I noticed that you've worked for a different billionaire every decade of your life.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:01:05):\nThey're mostly different people, but they're similar in one thing is that they haven't...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):\nToday my guest is Farhan Thawar. Farhan is Vice President and Head of Engineering at Shopify. Shopify is an incredibly interesting company because they have over 10,000 employees who are fully remote, and even though they were founded almost 20 years ago, they continue to operate with urgency, velocity and have very first principles, ways of thinking, which translates into them seeing record usage, blowing away their earnings calls just recently, and building a beloved product. A lot of this is thanks to Farhan, who in our conversation shares very specifically what he's done to maintain intensity and urgency within the engineering team. Including their meeting cadences, the counter-intuitive power of pair programming, how they run meetings, how they cancel meetings constantly and so much more. He also shares his experience with indexing towards choosing the harder option when you have multiple options to choose from and why that ends up making your life easier.\n\n(00:02:08):\nHe also shares a bunch of great hiring advice and a bunch of hiring stories which are going to blow your mind. He also talks about their engineering intern program where they're going to hire over a thousand engineers just for their intern program in 2025. I've had a lot of people on this podcast from Shopify, but that is for a very good reason because this company and its leaders have a lot to teach us about how to run an incredible business and build an incredible product.

Farhan, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:02:51):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:52):\nAs I was preparing for our conversation, I talked to a bunch of people that you've worked with over the years, and there's basically three themes that kept coming up over and over and over. One is hiring, two is creating intensity in your organization, and three is choosing the hard path. First of all, does that resonate? Second of all, does it sound good to talk about these three themes in our time together?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:03:16):\nYeah, I mean, I have ideas on where all three of those things came from, and I think that it is something that if you looked back on my career, I've hit points on each of those things, but I don't think at the onset I knew that that's what I was doing, but it turns out in retrospect, that's what I ended up doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:32):\nPerfect, so this is the Steve Jobs. Everything looking backwards it all connects.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:03:36):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:37):\nToday's episode is brought to you by DX. If you're an engineering leader or on a platform team, at some point your CEO will inevitably ask you for productivity metrics, but measuring engineering organizations is hard, and we can all agree that simple metrics like the number of PRs or commits doesn't tell the full story.

Okay, so let's start by talking about the hard path.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:05:42):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:43):\nAdvice that I've heard you share with people often is when they're trying to decide amongst a bunch of options is to choose the harder path because that makes life easier down the road. Share this advice why it's so important, where you learned, where you developed that this is the right approach.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:05:59):\nBut the short version is that if you have a choice and you choose the easy thing and it works great. If you choose the hard thing and it works great, you did more work, but if it doesn't work and you chose the easy thing, you've actually not learned anything because you chose the... You haven't done a lot of work, you haven't probably worked with the smartest people because they're not usually around on the easy path, and what happens is you've gone through this exercise and now you're like, I've kind of lost. I lost the choice, or I was trying to do something, it didn't work out for me. But if you do the hard path and it doesn't work, actually you still win because you've now done something hard. You've probably worked with smart people, you've learned something along the way that is valuable, and I can give you a quick example.\n\n(00:06:41):\nSo I meet lots of job seekers and they're like, I go, \"What are you doing to try to find a job?\" I'm like, \"I'm sending out 10 resumes a day.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" That sounds kind of easy, and are you really learning anything from sending out 10 resumes a day? Versus I would say to them, \"Hey, you know all these companies you're interested in, Shopify might be one of them. Why don't you look at the API Docs and build something, build a Shopify app, build an admin extension, build something on top of Shopify.\" Even if you don't get a job at Shopify, which is maybe your goal, you've learned something, you've built something, you have things in your GitHub repo now and you can show people. You're learning about the product that might translate to a job you might get somewhere else. So I think that even though it's harder, right? Of course, you can't every day build an app on a different platform.\n\n(00:07:23):\nMaybe you can once a day. You will learn something in the hard path. And the same thing happened to me in taking hard courses. I would get worse marks, but I ended up meeting smarter people in those courses because they were there for the same reason I was because the content was hard. And so that's something that I've just realized in my life that if I do the hard thing and I just naturally tend towards doing that, I ended up doing... I went to Waterloo and I did a minor in electrical engineering on top of computer science, and when I did my MBA, I did a minor in financial engineering because the smarter people were in that path and they're still my friends today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:54):\nSo building on the last point you just made, people could hear this and think, okay, if it's harder, that's going to be the right path. Sometimes harder is still a bad idea. For example, joining a terrible company that's extremely frustrating to work at or building, I don't know, a house in a really dumb way, but it's just really hard. What else do you find is important to think about when you're thinking it's not just harder, but also XYZ should probably be true?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:08:20):\nYeah, one real one is of course the people, because I find that my path has always focused on trying to pick the best learning journey. Where can I learn the most? And for me, everyone's different. Some people might learn better from books or the domain they're in, but for me, I learn a lot from people, and so I try to put myself in those harder rooms on purpose. There was a time when I was doing my MBA in financial engineering, by the way, and I'm a tech guy and still a tech guy, and all these people were going into finance jobs.\n\n(00:08:46):\nThere was a point where somebody said to me, \"Why are you in this class?\" Because they knew that I was doing it for fun, and so it was because it was the learning journey. And so I would say a big part of it for me is yes, there's the how do you win even if you lose, because if it goes poorly, you can still come out of it with skills, but if you actually take the hard path, you'll have these intense working relationships with smart people that again will continue on in your life.\n\n(00:09:12):\nAnd that also just forces you to be in this constant state of uncomfort by going into these rooms and saying, \"I don't know anything,\" and it's harder. And I agree with you. You don't want to do dumb things like, oh, let's just do this thing in a dumb way. That's not what I mean. I mean, let's try to do the hard thing that we can learn from. And by the way, it happens to be on the path. It's just is it might take more manual work or it might not be the way most people do it, but we think we can learn more from that path.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:37):\nSpeaking of that, I found this great quote from you, \"Not everyone can look stupid in public over and over, but I believe it's my superpower and I try to make it my whole team's superpower too.\"\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:09:49):\nYeah, I mean, it sounds funny, but again, I'm the one who's always trying super dumb things and sometimes they work, and even my wife hates that I try these things even at home, right? I'll just like, what's an example? It might be a new washing machine and I might try some weird mode with some clothes, and I'm like, \"Oh, you ruin the clothes.\" I'm like, okay. But now I know that this mode should not be used, but maybe I would've uncovered that there's some super fast, quick wash that I can do in 20 minutes that now saves us 40 minutes of wash time every single time we use the washing machine.\n\n(00:10:22):\nSo there's things like that, but I will ruin lots of clothes trying to do that, but the same at work. We'll try things and sometimes it can lead to disaster, hopefully not, but you can imagine people trying to like, oh, let me try this new configuration of GCP and maybe we'll get some benefit, but maybe we'll take Shopify down. We don't want to do that. So you want to have some sort of guardrails. But there is something around trying dumb things and saying dumb things. Half the time, by the way, when I say something dumb, people go, \"I had the same question.\" They just were scared to say it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:55):\nSo for folks that may want to, because I feel like this skill is so hard, but so important, being okay with failing, being okay with looking dumb, is there something you tell people to help them build this other than just like, I'm genetically good at this stuff? What helped you become comfortable with being wrong and failing before you were a big shot exec where it's like, oh, he's fine. He knows what he's doing.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:11:17):\nI don't know. I mean, I kind of grew up working in retail and people come into the store, and then I would say, \"Hey,\" and you're working on commission, and they're not always buying stuff, and if they don't buy it, you don't make any money. And so maybe just the fact of going up and forcing myself to talk to people and then trying to get them to, and maybe you spend an hour with a client and then they don't buy anything, but you're getting that reaction of a bunch of negatives, and all you have to do is say, okay, and just go to the next customer. You can't really well on it and be like, oh my God, my whole day is ruined. But instead, you have to learn from that and say, \"Okay, let me try this. Let me try that.\" And it's not easy, but it was a way to build up some confidence and people say, this telemarketing, or there's a bunch of things you can do to get a lot of rejection. Cold calling is another one, and that can lead you to actually building up resistance. I don't know if I'm genetically better at it or not. I just think that I literally don't care if I look dumb. I've always said the dumb thing, I'm not doing things on purpose to get nos, which by the way, is part of some sales training, which is go and get 10 nos. But I haven't done that. But I have been in many situations with many sharp people, business people, successful people who have said to me... Turn around and said, \"That's the stupidest fucking question I've ever heard.\" I've definitely had that happen to me. And I'm like, \"All right, let's move on to the next question.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:36):\nI love that attitude and I think that's key to it. It's just bounce off of it and not be crumble and I think it's empowering for folks to hear from someone like you that has done so well that people tell you that is the dumbest question I've ever heard-\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:12:48):\nOh yeah, still.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:48):\nStill. Okay.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:12:50):\nYeah. So how about this? That I heard that's the dumbest fucking question. And then recently I heard, I've already explained this to you three times because I kept asking and I didn't understand, and literally I got this message back saying, \"I've already explained this to you three times.\" I'm like, \"Okay, I still don't get it.\" So my goal there is not to annoy the person, but it's to understand the content. And actually, by the way, I say these were messages, I saved them. I literally screenshot it because I'm like, remember this? It doesn't matter. I'm trying to learn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:20):\nOne more question along these lines. I was looking at your LinkedIn and your career history, and I noticed that you worked for a different billionaire every decade of your life. So there's a guy named Joe Lemond in your twenties and Chamath in your thirties and Toby this decade, maybe yourself next decade, if things go well. Other than what you've shared or maybe it is what you've shared, is there a thread across these three folks that have been really successful that you've learned from that maybe is consistent across them all or even just specific to each one?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:13:49):\nIt's interesting because again, this is looking back, you're like, wait a sec, I didn't plan it this way. There's no way you could plan it, right? I'm going to work for a different billionaire every decade. That's not how it works but they're similar. They're mostly different people, but they're similar in one thing is that they have an irrational view of what the world should look like over the next decade or so. They're very long-term thinkers, very rational in that they'll look and say, \"Hey, in 10, 15, 20, 25 years, this is what the world's going to look like.\" And I'm not good at seeing that vision, but I'm good at trying to move towards that vision 1% a week. And so the melding of the two, I know where I'm good and I'm good at pushing the ball forward. And if they're good at the long-term vision, we can both align to say, \"You're good at this thing. I'm good at this thing. Why don't we merge forces?\"\n\n(00:14:35):\nAnd so that is something that has resonated with me is like, how do I find these irrational all progress depends on the unreasonable man. How do I pair with these people because I'm altogether too reasonable and there's no way for me to become unreasonable, and so I have to merge with these people. And so that is again, something that I specifically have sought out. And even when I was starting my own company in 2015, I actually sat down and wrote a list of all the unreasonable people that I knew in Toronto, and I went down the list and met every single one of these entrepreneurs to figure out are we API compatible and could I work with them? And I ended up picking one of them and starting a company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:15):\nThat is an amazing story. So first of all, I just love this insight that being aware of this is not a superpower of mine and I'm not going to try to build it. I'm going to find someone to merge with, and connect your APIs together and be the person that builds it, not the person that envisions what to build. I think that's awesome because a lot of people... I need to get good at all these things. I need to become the best at vision and strategy and execution and collaboration and then all these things. And so I think alone, this isn't really interesting instead it's just recognize your strengths and weaknesses and double down on your strengths.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:15:47):\nYeah, it sounds funny, but me and you talked about it that a framework I wrote down, which I tweet out, me writing that down changed how I picked jobs forever, right? Because I had this lull after my first job in between where I was trying to figure out why nothing felt as exciting as my first job. And it turns out that it took me to sit down and be like, what do I actually care about? And people can get confused. I get confused all the time, by the way, by things that are not on my framework. So for example, a good one, title, company, money, all these things can confuse you because you could have somebody say recruiter messages you and says, \"Hey, by the way, here's a new job and here's the compensation.\" You're like, \"Oh my God, this is exciting.\" And if you don't have a written down framework of the things you actually care about, it's very hard to be distracted. So very hard not to be distracted. You get distracted by that. So instead, I look at the framework and go, does this align with my framework? Right?\n\n(00:16:43):\nActually to the point of, I actually sent my framework to a recruiter one time and I said, \"Hey, this thing,\" because they kept going back and forth to me and I go, \"Hey, this doesn't align with my framework.\" So it really saves me time from not being distracted, but it also forced me to think about every year I can reevaluate what I'm doing and look at the framework and say, \"Is this true to my values?\" Now, my wife will say this, that I'm like a robot. When I realize that my framework is being violated, I will resign instantly and I've done that before. So without even having another job or anything, I just go like, oh, my framework is being violated and then resign. There's this thing where I know what I enjoy working on, and that framework helps me find it. And so I encourage everyone, anybody looking for a job I always say, \"Write down a framework. You can use mine as inspiration, but figure out what you care about and make sure that what you're working on lines up with that.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:37):\nAnd this framework is the questions to ask about where to go work. That's your framework. Okay, cool. We'll link to that so folks can check it out. The example of you resigning when it didn't meet your framework, is that a story you're up for sharing? Is there something to learn from that?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:17:50):\nYeah, sure. So this happened when I was at my previous, a few companies ago, we were running a mobile company called Xtreme Labs. That was the one that Chamath was the major investor in and so we worked with him directly. And what I realized was... And so that company was amazing. We worked on it for many years. It was a mobile app development company. We got to work on mobile apps for the biggest brands in the world, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Vine, the NFL, NBA, Bloomberg, Slack, you name it we worked on those mobile apps, and this is right when the iPhone and Android were really gaining steam in '09 to 2013 era. And then we eventually got acquired by Pivotal. And over time, my role at Pivotal, Pivotal, and Pivotal Labs changed from, hey, I was running the biggest office in the world. I was running the biggest pair programming office.\n\n(00:18:34):\nI'm a big fan of pair programming to one in which we were really trying to attach consulting to the product. And I ended up being a field CTO, which really, I mean it was fun to learn about that world, but it was different than what I was doing. And so if I looked across my framework, it was violating all the things that I was trying to work. I wasn't working with the smartest people anymore. I was on IC. I wasn't learning as much as I could be learning. And so I wasn't on this and I wasn't having a lot of impact. I was like, oh, wait a sec, this is completely not aligned. And then I just told the team, \"Hey, I plan on resigning.\" And that, by the way, led to great other things because I'm an investor in new companies that have spun out from there and it was a great experience. I'm just saying it at the time, lended me to say, \"Hey, you're not actually focused on the right things.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:20):\nI want to come back to Xtreme Labs. I know there's other stories there that are interesting, but first I want to talk about another theme of things that people often raised when I asked them about you. And this one is intensity, and it's specifically creating intensity in your organization and the value of that, the power of that. I've seen that the way you describe this and I love is how do you expend more kilojoules per hour versus spend more hours on work. So talk about just why intensity, first of all, is so important to an organization.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:19:53):\nYeah. So I think there's a few things. One, I have this fundamental belief that one hour is one hour. It's the same hour. If you spend an hour or I spend an hour, it's the same time that goes by. And if I just expend more calories in that hour. Let's say we both work nine to five. If I can just get more done in the nine-to-five, we have both... The time has elapsed the same for us, but I just got more done. And that allows me, of course, then I'd be like, \"Hey, I'm going to take my kid to soccer and do other stuff.\" We can still do the same things out of work, but during work, I just want to try to get as much done as possible during the time versus expanding the time and I can give you an example. I used to work at a company where it was like I worked 12 hours a day, but I was playing foosball in the middle of the day.\n\n(00:20:37):\nAnd then we'd go for a coffee break and you do these things. And of course, the time expanded to 12 hours versus trying to compress into that eight-hour day. And pair programming is a great example because, so it's such an intense activity. Two people on one machine, you can get so much done when two people are working together, not being distracted by the internet and distractions, and just focus on writing the solution to the problem at hand. And it's so tiring that usually when people switch on to pair programming, they sleep 10 to 12 hours a night the first few nights because it's so intense. You're working so hard. But for me, that intensity actually leads to extraordinary outcomes even if you don't have to put in more hours. I think most people, you probably hear this all the time, everyone says, \"Oh yeah, work hard and do more hours when you're young, whatever.\"\n\n(00:21:26):\nI'm like, what if you just did more per minute? Like quickly get through things. I think there's another unintuitive fact is that people who are really good can actually output high-quality collateral quickly. So take a person who is good and extremely good, the extremely good person can actually get a lot of output in a short amount of time, and the person who's good might take longer. I think there's a time variance there that people don't think about. So you can not drop the quality too much, but get the time down by 2X, 3X, right? Parkinson's Law of scale instead of, if I give you an hour to do something, a really good person can get a high-quality output in one hour.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:07):\nI want to talk about how you create an org that operates this way, but specifically, you just mentioned pair programming. I know that's one of your favorite tools. Talk about why this is so powerful when you recommended... I think as an outside observer, it's like two engineers on the same code. Why wouldn't we do things half as fast? Talk about just why you're a big fan of pair programming specifically.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:22:30):\nIt is the most underutilized management tool in engineering, bar none. It is just not used as much as it could be. So pair programming, for those who don't know, it's two people on one computer. So two keyboards, two mics, two monitors, but one computer, they work together and if it's remote, they use it. You can use a tool like tuple, which we use, and you can just remotely be on one computer, and you're totally right. The famous tweet about pair programming is, wait a sec, we have two engineers on one computer, won't they write half as much code? And the answer is, oh, no, no, they'll write even less than that because it's not about lines of code. The throughput limiter is not hands-on keyboard. It's not like we're both sitting there and the limiter is like us trying to get through the keystrokes onto the screen.\n\n(00:23:12):\nThe limiter is where is the good elegant solution? How do we think through the problem and build the right solution for the problem at hand? Tobi famously built a lot of Shopify paired programming, and what he would do is he would actually set a timer and him and the CTO Cody would pair program for one hour. And if they did not finish the problem in one hour, they would delete all the code and they would keep the tests and they would start over. And then what their thinking was, if we were not able to articulate and write the code for this feature in one hour, we must be on the wrong design. We must be building the wrong thing and so they delete all the code, kept the tests, and then wrote it again. And sometimes he'd be over by one minute and he would still delete the code and start over because his thinking was the right elegant solution should be able to be written in one hour.\n\n(00:24:03):\nAnd so pair programming, I mean, that's an extreme version of it, but even at Pivotal Labs, if your pair was sick that day and you wrote a bunch of code, the strong version is your pair would come in the next day, delete all the code that you wrote, and then you'd write it again the next day. And again, what better time to rewrite code than right after you've written it because you now know the problem domain? And by the way, it sounds like a waste of time. It sounds like I'm just deleting code but the reason is that code lives a long time. Code is a liability and the right solution, the usually shorter lines, more elegant solution tends to appear after you've done a bunch of pathfinding. And the only way to do that pathfinding is start and then delete and then start and be like, oh, no.\n\n(00:24:47):\nNow I know. Delete. And it's super hard to delete, by the way, because we're humans and we have this sunk cost fallacy, so it's hard to delete. But if you can do that, you will actually land upon a much, much better solution. And of course, pair programming has high, high rates of learning because you're just sitting beside... You're not only whether it's tuple or remote or directly, you learn keystrokes and you learn how somebody thinks about a problem. You go back and forth on the talking, and yes, you will write probably less code, but you will move faster along the path of delivering value for your customers than you would if you did it on your own. And there's all these studies that show happiness is higher, knowledge transfer is higher, less silos, intensity is higher, all the things. And at a price of 20% or something of what you would normally do.\n\n(00:25:33):\nThe analogy I have is the underhanded free throw in basketball, statistically known to sink more baskets, but looks dumb and nobody does it. Literally, Shaquille O'Neal, I'm not that big a basketball fan, but I read this about Shaquille O'Neal, who's a Hall of Famer, and they said, \"Why don't you throw underhand?\" Because he was notoriously bad at free throws and he goes, \"It looks dumb.\" Even though he's paid millions of dollars a year to do this thing. It looks dumb, doesn't want to do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:58):\nI remember those Shaquille O'Neal years when he had a special free throw coach, and I remember them talking about this-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:00):\n... When he hit a special free throw coach. And, I remember them talking about this and he's like, \"No, I'm never going to do that.\"\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:26:05):\n\"I'm never going to do it.\" Because it looks dumb. And by the way, go back to the beginning of the interview. I don't care what looks dumb or looking stupid, we're going to do this. And so, actually, I ran the biggest pair programming shop in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:15):\nOn that note, so what percentage of shop Shopify do this? Is this how y'all operate?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:26:21):\nYeah. So, Shopify, I mentioned that Toby and Cody did this at the beginning of Shopify. And the cool thing about pair programming is, and in my old world at XtremeLabs is that we knew exactly what to build, because we were building mobile apps that were almost like contract manufacturing. We're like, \"We have an iOS version. Can we build an Android version?\" So, we quickly were able to say, \"Here's the spec. Go quick.\" Shopify is such a different company, right? We are a pathfinding company. We are trying to find the right thing to build. And so, pair programming may or may not make sense all the time. Like Pivotal and Xtreme, we were doing 40 hours a week.\n\n(00:26:54):\nShopify is much more of a four to eight hour a week pair programming culture, where you're gathering together on a problem and saying, \"Hey, let's pair for half a day, or let's pair every Wednesday.\" And we use that tool in our arsenal to move quickly down a path. But a lot of other time is spent pathfinding and trying to figure out what to build, and trying to convince field be like, \"Hey, we're going to go down this path. Oh, now I know exactly.\"\n\n(00:27:16):\nAnd sometimes, by the way, 18 months later, we've now figured out all the things and that's the time we should delete everything and start over. And, that's something that we will do at that point. And so, you don't want to be pair programming for 18 months. You want to be wayfinding and pathfinding. And then go, \"I see the matrix. Let me just delete everything and now build it.\" Because the learning is what you're going for. We have all the learning, now let's write the code.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:39):\nGot it. So it's basically, when the code, you're pretty sure this is correct and it's really important segments of the code base pair program.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:27:49):\nYeah. And then also we do a lot of pairing during an incident or a way to figure out together, work with somebody and say, \"Hey, I'm not really sure and let's jump on a call together or jump on a tuple and go down the path.\" And say, \"Let's figure out together what's going on.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:01):\nI can't help but ask AI, how does that impact this way of working?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:28:06):\nSo, AI is super interesting. What's happening right now with an AI copilot like GitHub Copilot is it is your pair programmer. So, you now can feel like you're pairing actually without another human. You can pair with the AI. And so, what's happening too is that you're seeing people use Whisper, like they're talking to Cursor, and they're talking through Whisper to say, \"Okay, let's build a new React component that does this.\" And they're talking and then it's building. \"Oh no, that's not what I meant. I meant doing this.\" So you can actually not even have to type, just using voice, go back and forth with your pair programmer.\n\n(00:28:35):\nI would say, that's amazing. I would still contend take that experience and add two humans together. So you've got an AI copilot and humans, because what's happening is generating code. And the two humans can look and say, \"Oh, I know what it's trying to do.\" And, either delete the code, because you have inspiration and write it yourself, or just take the suggestion and move it forward. But, I love today's world of AI copilots, because you never have to code loan on your own right? You never have to code alone. You can try a different language now, because the API and the syntax is much easier to pull forward. And so, all of those things are a win for engineering and a win for everybody who wants to build any software.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):\nThat makes a lot of sense. Basically, everyone's going to be a pair programmer-\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:29:17):\nYes, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:18):\n... In the future. Okay, I want to come back to what else you have done at Shopify to create intensity. And I think, again, it's important to highlight the intensity is meant to, \"How do we get more done in the time we have and then go home?\" Not just work all day every day, weekends kind of intensity.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:29:35):\nYeah. So we have a few things that we have going for us, right? So one, we have this tool called GSD, which stands for get shit done, which you've probably heard from maybe talking to other Shopify folk, which is this notion of weekly updates to the whole company on what's happening. Again, Parkinson's law at scale. If you ask people every week, they want to show progress every single week. So that's one way I talked about pair programming as well. The other thing we do as a company is, we used to have twice a year was our cadence, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or we had an event in the summer. And now, we do six-week reviews. So, teams have this notion of every six weeks actually coming together and walking through the roadmap, the resourcing, and what they're working on with their immediate leadership, but then also, with Toby.\n\n(00:30:18):\nAnd so, what's cool about that, and by the way, it's a huge time investment, right? We all get into a room, it's happening tomorrow. So Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, a bunch of us will be in the office together and we're going to go through every project in the company, and we're going to talk about the project, the resourcing, how it's going, and we're going to make changes. And again, that creates intensity, because you want to show what has been done, what have you learned since the last six-week review. And, we find six weeks is a very good cadence, because it's short enough that you can remember the context and it's long enough... Six weeks is long enough, especially if you have, let's say, a team of a dozen engineers, you can do a lot. And not only that, you can do a lot in a day, but this is a check-in point.\n\n(00:30:59):\nAnd what I've noticed too with intensity is, let's say, we get a review and there's some feedback we get in that review. We don't wait until the next six-week review, right? The next day we are building things, we are iterating, we are tagging people. And then, by the next week's we're like, \"Here's the trajectory.\" Right? Actually, I want to get that Elon shirt made, \"What have you done this week?\" Because, Parkinson's law is real. It sounds funny, but I keep bringing this up, but whatever time you allot to something will be the time it takes, right?\n\n(00:31:26):\nSo, if you're doing something monumental, I don't know, you're doing a reorg or something, right? You can do it the slow way. \"Let's sit down, and plan, and roll it out.\" And it's probably six months in most companies. Shopify, this is a week or two. You sit down, you're like, \"Hey, this is the bones of it. Let's bring some more people and think.\" But then, it's going to start leaking. So we just launch it. Right? And, we do the same thing with lots of things. We just try to move more quickly and get out of the... We don't do change management, we just land it, and then go, \"Hey everyone, it's a volatile company. This is what's happening. But this is how we get things done quickly.\" And then, move on with our lives.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:00):\nWow, there's so much there. I have been through the six-month reorgs. And, I think that context you just shared of, \"We're at a volatile company, we're changing things. It's not going to be smooth, but we think this is for the best.\" It's just the culture of Shopify. It sounds like, \"We want to keep moving fast. We know this isn't going to be the smoothest thing, but we just know this better to make the change at this point versus wait.\"\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:32:25):\nIt's how Toby increased the resiliency in the company. He would walk around in the old days when we had a data center and just unplugged machines, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:32):\nChaos monkey.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:32:33):\nYeah, chaos monkey. You're right. But that actually works, because it just says, \"Hey, by the way, shit's going to break. And so, let's be resilient to that.\" And so, same thing here. \"Hey, by the way, someone's going to move your cheese. It's fine. We are here to create more entrepreneurs in the world. We're not here to have a six-month change management roadmap. And, that will just actually hurt the speed at which we can deliver value to merchants.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:52):\nSo, on all the things you shared, so there's weekly updates. So the weekly updates are each person shares what they're working on for the week. Is that the idea?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:32:59):\nEach project.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:01):\nEach project.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:33:02):\nSo, each project, it has an update, it might have a video of, \"Here's the experience.\" It'll have a obviously a bunch of writing on what's changed since last time. We have a process called OK1 and OK2, which is like, OK1 is typically at the director level where they're like, \"Okay, I'm aligned with the direction that this is going at.\" Or, \"I'm not aligned.\" And they can make changes. Then, when it goes to OK2, it's typically the VP level of the area, who's now looking to say, \"Okay. What you're working on actually aligns with the overall architecture. But by the way, have you looked at this context? Maybe you haven't seen this, this is happening, or the industry.\" And so, you're trying to align at that level. And then, again, like I mentioned, every six weeks we go through with Toby, and he's an intense guy himself.\n\n(00:33:40):\nAnd so, a lot of it is like, \"Hey, why is this taking so long? Are we overthinking it? Are we not trying to move forward on this thing, because we're blocked on something? Is there some piece of infra?\" Actually, I'll give you a good example. In one of the reviews from last time, there was an interesting AI problem we were trying to solve with LLMs that required us to have a very large output context window. And, most of the LLMs today have a very small output context window. But in the review, right, we have shared Slack channels with all the LLM folks, right? I messaged in the open AI channel, I messaged in the Gemini channel, whatever. And, within an hour we had increased the context on a bunch of major models and we were able to move forward through the thing, just because I asked.\n\n(00:34:29):\nAnd so, that's an example. It didn't take another six week review, but it increased the intensity, because the team was like, \"Oh, we were blocked because we thought we had to now chunk up this data and do this thing because we had smaller output context and we thought we could do a big input context, but we'd have to do this caching.\" And, it was like this whole thing. I'm like, \"Well, did we just ask them if we get bigger?\" And then, they were like, \"Oh, we don't have this as undocumented, but we'll just enable it right now for Shopify.\" And so, that created the intensity of the team to be like, \"Oh, we can now quickly get unblocked.\" So that's the example of just moving quick and trying to just, again, ask a dumb question. I'm like, \"This is probably not possible, but...\" And then, they came back and said, \"Oh yeah, we can do that.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:03):\nThat's a great example. And, as you're describing the ways that you create intensity and velocity within Shopify, it's interesting that what you're listing is a bunch of meetings and check ins, which to most people would feel like, \"Why do we need so many...\" There's all this like, \"Less meetings.\" And I know you guys famously cancel all your meetings and that's a whole thing we can talk about. But, it's interesting that more check ins and regular check ins allow you to move faster. I imagine it's partly because it just makes sure you're not working on things that are unnecessary, and dumb, and not going to be used. And it's just continue to refine, these are actually the most important.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:35:38):\nI mean, it's a combination of trust but verify, right? Because don't forget, the goal of the check-in is not for you to be like, \"Ha, ha, I caught you not doing your work.\" It's not like the Dilbert boss, \"Hey, did you do your thing?\" Right? Even when I look at the Elon text, which is like, \"Hey, what did you get done this week?\" It wasn't to try to catch Parag in a, \"You didn't do anything or you did a bunch of useless stuff.\" It was hopefully to pair on the problem, meaning, when I ask somebody, \"Hey, did we move forward on this LLM project, because we now have this larger context window?\" And then, they came back and said, \"Oh, here's what we learned.\" So then, I can then look at the answer and say, \"Oh, so now, have you thought of this? Have you tried...\" It's a way to pair on the problem.\n\n(00:36:18):\nSo, we have this word, everybody talks about micromanagement as a word, and we don't actually think it's a dirty word at Shopify, but the reason we don't think it's a dirty word is because it's not just, again, Dilbert boss saying, \"Where did you do the thing?\" It's like, \"Hey, can I work on this problem with you? And if I work on this problem with you, I got to see where you are pretty often, and then give you advice, or you're going to share context with me, because I'm not in the work every day.\" To then come back and say, \"Oh, based on what I know and what you know, can we move this in this direction? Maybe that's better for merchants.\"\n\n(00:36:50):\nI don't want to overuse the pairing paradigm, but it is really much like, \"Can I pair with you?\" And I learned this actually very early in my Shopify tenure, because Toby would have these one-on-ones with me and I'd be like, \"Toby, you don't have to waste your time, man. You hired me. I got this.\" Well, he goes, \"Oh, you misunderstand why you're here. We are here to work on problems together.\" And I was like, \"Oh, I didn't even think...\" I thought he hired me to take problems away. He hired me to work on problems with me. That's completely different than what I thought.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:18):\nI love that. Okay. One thing you mentioned is meeting thing. For people that don't know what you all did with meetings, I think it might be worth just sharing that briefly, because it's awesome and something a lot of companies can learn from.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:37:28):\nYeah, sure. Actually, the funny story about the meeting Armageddon, is that, I was messaging Toby prior to me starting at Shopify about meeting Armageddon. And so, I actually think I had a little hand in him doing this before I got to Shopify. I was like, \"Hey, have you seen...\" I think it was Dropbox, \"Have you seen a Dropbox is doing and Meetingageddon? And so, he was like, \"This is super interesting.\" This is years before I started. So, I think it's funny that it ended up being a real thing. But here's what we do. Once a year at a random time, we will delete all recurring meetings that have more than two people, so not one-on- ones, and are internal people only, so not interviews or external partner meetings. And then, we have a two-week moratorium where you're not allowed to add a reoccurring meeting. You can have a regular meeting, but not a reoccurring meeting.\n\n(00:38:11):\nAnd the idea is that there's a lot of inertia behind a recurring meeting. It just always is there, and you know it's coming up, and it's hard to delete, because you're like, \"Oh yeah, we talk about this thing every week.\" And so, what we do is we just do a meeting reset. And, I think, yeah, it's just called chaos monkey and the admins go in and just delete everything. Now what's cool about it is, it forces you to rethink, \"Do we need a recurring meeting? Or do we just need one meeting? Or do we need a different cadence?\" That's one thing. The other thing is it frees up so much crafter time, right?\n\n(00:38:42):\nOne of the stats I track across engineering is how many hours are individual contributors in meetings per week? And we noticed that after we did... We did two things by the way. And I have a spicy second one for this, but the first one was we deleted meetings. And the second thing we did was we moved a lot of our Slack into Facebook workplace, which I'll talk about. Those are the only two things we did. And we saw a huge decrease in the amount of time crafters were in meetings. And then, we saw all kinds of other productivity enhancements, because they were able to have that flow time and work on things.\n\n(00:39:12):\nSo, we're at something like three hours of meetings per week for an individual contributor at Shopify, which is phenomenal. Three hours a week is amazing. I think managers is not that bad. I think I tweeted this. I think it's six or seven hours per week. That's not bad at all, in order to get aligned. And then, all the rest of the time is work time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:29):\nAnd how many hours was it before Meetingageddon and Workplace?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:39:33):\nYeah, you're asking me a good question. I have to go look and see. But, it came down by something like 50 or 60%. It was something like five or six hours for individual contributors and came down to three. And then, the managers, I think it was 10 that came down to 6, something like that. But it was a huge difference. And the only two things, like I mentioned, were one was the Meetingageddon, the other one was like this, and I can talk about this. This is a-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:53):\nYes, let's talk about this.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:39:54):\n... Yeah. So, I mean, I love Slack. It's the IM tool. Everybody uses it. But it can for sure cause distraction. And so, what we did was we moved all announcement information. So, anytime you're sending a status update or large group announcement, we moved all of that to Facebook Meta Workplace, like Facebook for work basically, which is now being deprecated. So, we'll have to figure that out. But, it just moved all this stuff to a ML feed that you can consume differently than you would Slack, because Slack is like I message you and you see an alert and all this stuff, versus Workplace is like, \"Oh, I want to go and consume content from the company, and get updates, and share updates.\" And so, that reduced a lot of distraction as well. And so, I'd love to figure out what the next tool for us is, but it is probably something more like a river of information that I can dip my toe into, versus IM and chat everywhere.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:45):\nThat is super interesting. So, specifically, things that are just updates where you don't need a discussion, you almost want to discourage a discussion.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:40:50):\nYeah, I mean, it has the commenting, but it's not the same tool. And, by the way, Slack is amazing, we use it. It's just that for this thing, it wasn't working for us. And so, we wanted to move that somewhere else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:03):\nI feel like, the more I dig into the Shopify way of working, the more fun stuff I never expected emerges. I'm curious what else is going to emerge. So we've been talking about ways that y'all, and you specifically, have created intensity, especially in the engineering organization. And then, you've also shared just broadly Shopify. What else is on that list? What else have you found helps create more kilojoules per hour?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:41:24):\nYeah, so again, I think there's nothing, I would say again, start from the beginning, there's nothing more than pair programming, because literally you can't do anything else but be on your computer. So pair programming is the number one. I will say, the weekly cadence helps a lot, right, which you mentioned. Again, which is part of GSD, which is sharing the updates, and then the six-week reviews, that does a lot. On the other side, we also have a lot of metrics and alerts that help us see when potentially things might be happening in the system that can allow us to be like, \"Hey, wait a sec, there's too many things going on of this type. We probably have to sit back and reset and figure out what's going on.\"\n\n(00:41:56):\nSo one thing that happened, for example, was we started seeing that it was taking a lot of time to develop in our admin, like engineers at Shopify developing in the admin. So we called, what's called, a code yellow, which is before code red. But code yellow is this idea of like, \"Hey, we're going to call a code yellow on the admin.\" We want to make sure that the developer experience inside Shopify is really good. It should be easy to start up the repo. It should be easy to make changes, it should be easy to see the changes. And so, those are the things that, again, we can create intensity, because this code yellow allows the champion to tap anyone on the shoulder and say, \"Stop what you're doing and come help this thing.\" Which is an infrastructure layer thing. And by building out this infrastructure, it allows you to go fast. It takes longer to build infrastructure, but it makes you go fast forever afterwards, right?\n\n(00:42:41):\nI'll actually give you an example of one of these. So, we in 2020, 2021, the heyday of pandemic, obviously, there was a crypto summer again and crypto was going nuts. And we were sitting back and saying, \"Wow, a lot of our merchants are now asking for NFT gating.\" NFT gating, which is, \"If you have the token, you can now go into the storefront and see my products. You can see my prices and you can check it out, but only if you have the token.\" And, we were getting a lot of demand from merchants to be like, \"We want to do this. We want to sell an NFT. And we want our buyers to have the NFT to have this great experience.\" And we're like, \"We agree. We want you to be able to do whatever you want. And so, we want to build this for you too.\"\n\n(00:43:18):\nAnd, sitting with Toby, he's like, \"You guys are thinking about it wrong.\" He goes, \"How long would it take to build NFT gating?\" I'm like, \"I don't know. Two, three weeks.\" He goes, \"Now, how long would it take to build a platform layer, which exposes APIs so anyone could build NFT gating in one hour?\" I'm like, \"I don't know. Two, three months.\" He goes, \"Do that.\" He goes, \"Because you don't know what they're going to build on top of the platform.\" NFT gating is one thing, one use case, but if you spend the time to build out the infrastructure layer, he calls it putting gas in the tank, if you put the gas in the tank, people could drive on that gas for a long time going forward. And so, he goes, \"I always want you to think about...\" And the key part was, \"What can you build so anyone could build this in one hour?\" Right?\n\n(00:44:00):\nSo, he does this thing to us all the time where he goes, \"Oh, this should only be...\" He'll say it and people get the wrong thing. He'll say, \"Oh, you could write this in a day.\" And what he means is, \"What has to be true so that you could write this in a day? What infrastructure do you need?\" And, he actually develops this way. He will write code against an API that doesn't exist, because he's like, \"You know what should exist here? This API.\" He'll write the code, he'll go back and forth and refine the client on the server, and then he'll go, \"This is correct, the correct client code. Now, let me go implement the server code.\"\n\n(00:44:31):\nAnd this is notion of building things as infrastructure that sound slower today, because it's going to take... It's two, three months, instead of two or three weeks. But after that, the things that people built on top, right, were so easy to build, there were so many more scenarios that were emerged. It's just a different way of thinking about software. And, it's intensity in a different way, it's intensity around building this infrastructure layer, which we want to build quickly, but takes two or three months, in this case, but then can get everyone building on top of our infra in a much, much quicker way. And of course, who knows what can flourish from there?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:06):\nIt's interesting and it makes sense that so much of the way you all think is about building the best possible platform, versus the, necessarily, best possible point solution for someone. And it also explains why you spend so much time in crafting really great code and pair programming, because again, it's a platform for other people to build stuff on. So, I think, a lot of this is very useful, especially for platform businesses.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:45:29):\nNo, exactly. And actually, you're making me think of a stat. So, last year, maybe a tangent, but I tweeted out that GitHub Copilot has written over 1 million lines of code for Shopify. And people are like, \"Oh my god.\" And it got picked up. And everyone's talking about it. And I go, \"I don't know why is everybody getting so crazy, because what I want to see is GitHub Copilot deleting 1 million lines of code.\" That's when you know we're actually at this point where this is close to an engineer. Right? And so, we famously have deleted millions of lines of code this year, because we were trying to focus on, again, the sunk cost and rebuilding things elegantly, or you don't need this anymore and rebuilding. And I even tweeted out, I think someone said, \"Oh, Shopify is in the top 10 Ruby code bases in the world.\" And I said, \"I never want to see us on this list again.\" We shouldn't be gunning for number one, we should be gunning for number 100, right? We want to be not on this list. Right? Someone else can take the crown.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:22):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta. When it comes to ensuring your company has top-notch security practices, things get complicated fast.

That's V-A-N-T-A.com/lenny. Wait, talk about more about this. So, there's been a drive to delete code and simplify. What's behind that? What's going on there?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:47:22):\nYeah, so there's a few things, right? One is, the more context you can fit in your head around a code base. And you can never really fit all of Shopify in your head, because it's a big complicated set of tools we give to merchants. But, the more you can simplify, the much easier everything becomes, resiliency, performance, reliability, maintainability, all the illities become much, much, much easier when the code base is simple. Now, all you need really is the mandate of like, \"Oh, well, let's look at this code. And, if I could start this today, would I really build this thing? Or do I now have enough domain expertise to say, 'Oh no, this is the right solution?' So can I delete start over and build this more easily?\" And now, everything else becomes easy to build on top of.\n\n(00:48:04):\nAnd so, routinely, we have a delete code club, we have hack days, which happens two or three times a year, where there's always one team that is focused on deleting code. They even have a manual, \"Here's how to find things to delete.\" And, it's amazing. We almost always delete. I don't know if this is good or bad. We can always almost find a million plus lines of code delete, which is insane. But, at the same time, I applaud the teams for going after the cruft and the code base. And everything gets easier, right? Codelets loads faster. It's easier to understand.\n\n(00:48:34):\nThis is why when I look at GitHub stats, you shouldn't really look at... I think Google put out and said, \"Oh, 25% of all code is now written by AI.\" I'm like, \"Where's the delete? Where is the 25% of all code is deleted by AI?\" Right? This is where we have to start thinking about it. Because, the right code is never the volumous lines of code metric. It's always something else. It's always elegance. And that's where we have to think about. So, it is something that, as part of us being long-term infrastructure thinking, we really do care about that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:06):\nI love this, in part, because it connects to the topic we're talking about, which is speed, velocity, intensity, smaller code base, cleaner, better code base allows you to move faster. I used to be an engineer actually. But, both my engineering brain and my PM brain, I love the idea of killing stuff that's useless, fixing, making code cleaner, and better, and more durable. In reality, very hard for companies to prioritize this thing. Is there anything you found that helps you do that? You mentioned hack days and weeks are one part of that. Probably helps that Toby's an engineer and he understands the value of this stuff. But I guess, for folks that want to do this more, any advice?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:49:42):\nYeah. So actually, when we're building something, we think of it in one of three buckets. We're like, \"Are you building an experiment, a feature, or infrastructure?\" And, once you bucket things, you can say, \"Oh, it's an experiment.\" You're like, \"Cool. This is not infra. This is like, we're trying something to learn.\" And, by the way, that might turn into an experiment or infra, but it starts off as an experiment. Now, if you're building a feature, a feature is basically you're taking advantage of an existing piece of infra, right? So, token gating is the example I gave. If you could now build that in one hour, you would probably say, \"Oh, we have the right infra below it.\"\n\n(00:50:14):\nBut if you did what Toby does, which is, he's like, \"Here's the infra I wish existed. Here's the feature. The feature might be quick to build, but now I have to go and build the infra.\" You're now slotting yourself into infra land, which is like, that could take longer, but you're now enabling it for a bunch of use cases. You don't have to think about it at once, because you may have people using your API in a different way.\n\n(00:50:32):\nSo, I think you have to slot yourself. Now, how do people get into this mode? It is super, super hard. And, I would say, Toby is the secret sauce here, because he pushes us to think about things as infra almost all the time. I mean, one of the things that annoys me the most probably is that I'll always come to him and say, \"Hey, we can do A or B.\" And he looks at me and he goes, \"You know what I'm going to say, right?\" I'm like, \"You're going to say go back and generate more options.\" Because he doesn't like those. \"I don't like A or B. Come back when you have something else.\" Right? Actually, maybe I'll tell you a little anecdote. He has a story where he says, \"There are unlimited amount of wrong options for any problem. There's probably 10,000 right options, but everybody stops at the first right one, instead of what you should be spending all your time on, because the options that don't work, you're not going to spend time on. But you have to figure out which of the 10,000 options is the right one and spend time in what are all these right options? Don't just stop at the first one.\"\n\n(00:51:24):\nAnd so, when I come to and say, \"A or B.\" I'm picking two of the 10,000. And he's like, \"That's not what I... Go back and generate more options, because those are not the optimal ones.\" So, he is quite the philosopher on these things. And it does really change the way the company works, because he'll push you on these things. And then, we over time learn to spot the same patterns. And I learned to push my team on infra, and deleting code, and making things simple, because by the way, who doesn't want to get free stuff? Right? Free performance, free, easy to navigate code base, free maintainability, free resiliency,, because now, we went and did the hard work of deleting. It is hard. But that goes back to the beginning, right? Choose the hard thing. Don't just build the feature-\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:52:01):\nThe beginning, right? Choose the hard thing. Don't just build the feature, go make the feature easy to build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:06):\nI feel like there's just more and more good stuff. What else is there that might be helpful to folks while you're thinking about it? And interesting, I was reading your tweet where you shared a lot of this advice, and you mentioned this briefly, but I think it's important with pair programming, one of the benefits is there's no multitasking. You're not checking Twitter, Slack while you're working because you're there being watched. And I could see why that is more productive just innately.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:52:31):\nOh no, for sure. Again, like underhand or free throws not only looks dumb, it feels dumb. People don't... They feel like they're wasting time sitting beside somebody and being like, \"Well, I could be on my computer doing this thing.\" But together they are building a machine. Do you ever read the Undoing Project, which is about Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, the famous philosopher.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:54):\nBy Michael Lewis, I think.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:52:56):\nBehavioral economist. Michael Lewis. Exactly. And he said the famous line was \"Alone, we're okay, but together, we're a genius.\" Right? That's a pair programmer. That's like two people. You're like, \"Ah, we're okay. But together, we're a genius.\" And that's exactly what pair programming is. And hopefully me plus an LLM is a genius as well, but that's the genesis of that thinking. So I would say another thing that helps us create intensity is demo culture. So as part of the GSD updates, hopefully we encourage people to share high fidelity updates, which is not just imagery, but actually a demo. One of the things that can go wrong with just their screenshots is you don't really get the full experience. You can't tell how slow things are or whatever, but with a demo, so you can put a link. We have this tool called Spin, which is an internal development environment like a cloud dev environment where you can say, \"Hey, click here to try this on Spin, and then you can try it and you can see how it works.\"\n\n(00:53:52):\nOr they say, \"Turn on a beta flag in your own store and then try it.\" And so this short circuits a lot of misunderstandings, because you're like \"I'm going to try it.\" And you're not waiting until the end, especially with a beta flag. You're like, \"Hey, it's in my store. I just realized that I went in and now this page takes 20 seconds to load. Is that what you expect?\" You're like, \"Oh, we didn't find this use case.\" You're going to learn that much more quickly.\n\n(00:54:13):\nAnd that creates, again, intensity on the fidelity of the feedback you're getting because famously, some of our PM team will create a friction log. They'll be like, \"I am walking..\" They'll just create a screen share, create a video and go, \"I'm walking through. I turn on the beta flag, I'm walking through this experience. Here's my feedback on the experience.\" And you're getting this high fidelity throughput coming back to you that you're like, \"Okay, let's fix these things for next week's iteration and then share another beta flag and say, 'Okay, try it now. Try it now. Try it now.'\" And so you're not debating about status reports, you're kind of debating about the experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:46):\nSo I'm trying to think broadly all the things you've shared, kind of how they fit together that allow you to move this fast. And I just looked up a few stats to give people a sense of just the size of the company today and how successful it has been as they hear the stuff we're talking about. So you guys are about 11,000 employees, something like that according to the Googles. And you're hitting not necessarily all-time highs on market cap because COVID gave you guys a big boost for a while, but you're kind of coming back to this insane valuation that you all had during COVID. So it's essentially all-time highs at a 10,000 plus person company moving really fast, shipping constantly. People love the product. And it feels like one key of what you're describing is essentially this operating rhythm that creates these check-ins that keep people moving and focused on the right sorts of tools and getting them quick feedback if they're moving in the wrong direction.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:55:42):\nAnd having the leaders pair with those people on those problems, not just checking in, but actually pairing with them on the problems that they're facing. So you get both the crafters who are working on the stuff and the leaders who may have broader context working together to kind of unblock.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):\nAnd it's so interesting that it's like, again, people often are often like, \"We don't need meetings. Get rid of all the meetings.\" You guys do that, but also, there's a lot of power in strategic meetings and check-ins. Another kind of bucket is just the engineering environment, engineers working with engineers, pair programming, things like that. There's a tool you mentioned for pair programming, Tuple, I think.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:56:17):\nTuple. Yeah. It's funny because we use it exclusively, but we actually have this line internally, we call it, Shopify should be a crafters' paradise. It should be the place where crafters come to practice their craft and get better at their craft. Obviously, resonates from a lot of the engineering crafters, but it's not only engineering, it's UX and PM and ML, all the places where you'd want those people to actually have a great experience. We want them to come to Shopify because we believe this is the best place for that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:46):\nI love it. I just wrote a note down of just how you set up your teams for success. Oh, just avoid distractions. So I think the pair programming helps the workspace, workplace shift from Slack helps. I think you're also very firm on their working hours. You basically don't let...\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:56:46):\nNo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:03):\nNo. Okay. [inaudible 00:57:04]\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:57:04):\nNo, not really. Yeah. We're not super firm on working hours from that perspective, but we do have a lot of people on East Coast time zones. A lot of stuff happens then, but we do have people all over the world. But I did mention we do have the check-ins and the six-week reviews on the cadence. So that six week cycle does give you a little bit of the, what did you get done and are you blocked mentality. And you can expect coming in a couple of times and being like, \"Hey, we didn't get a lot done being unblocked.\" For you to change your approach to go, \"Okay, I don't want to go to another review where we didn't get a lot done.\" So what am I doing this time to make sure we unlock a lot of progress? And that check-in can give you that ammo to be like, \"Let's do this this time.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:44):\nAnd you're also remote first as a company.\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:57:46):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:46):\nWhich I think is especially cool. Now a lot of companies are going back to not remote. You guys are staying remote. Why do you guys decide to do that? What have you seen as a big benefit of that?\n\nFarhan Thawar (00:57:55):\nYeah, so we have this remote, so I like to call it 90% remote or 95% remote because we have these intentional IRL experiences. So every summer, we just started last year. Sorry, this year. We're doing this thing called Shopify Summit where we bring the whole company together, get together and it's a combination of talks plus hack days and it's a come together experience like food and parties and bands. And it's a super fun way to re-energize and rebuild your trust battery over time. And then we have this thing called bursts, which is, \"Hey, you want to work on a problem? You need to prototype, you need to hack.\" People can just say, \"Hey, I'm starting a burst. We're going to have five people. We're all going to go to Ottawa or Toronto or Montreal or somewhere else and we're going to talk about this problem and get together.\"\n\n(00:58:38):\nAnd so a combination of those two things mean throughout the year, you can recharge. We have the trust battery notion, which is how much trust can you have between people and it can deplete over time if you're remote. So then we have offices which are like, come in if you want. Like I mentioned, I come in once a week and now Toby moved to Toronto, so now I'm in three days a week. But it's like if you want to come in, you don't have to, right? Today, I work from home, but tomorrow, I'm going in. And that allows you, again, to have those random interactions and allow you to feel like, yeah, we're 90 plus percent remote. But I would say the main reason is we want to hire the best people in the world and those people can be anywhere and just happens to be that not all of them are near an office.\n\n(00:59:20):\nBut again, with the bursting, here's a good example. For Black Friday, Cyber Monday, I encouraged all engineering leadership to come to Toronto. We're all going to be in the office watching the graphs. And then for hack days, I try to get people to go to the ports, which we have four of them, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, and New York, which again are come in if you want, but then get that IRL. And so it's kind of a little bit of a combo. I wouldn't call it hybrid though because you don't really have every Friday you come in or don't come in. It's more like, come in if you want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:48):\nThere's so many things to talk about. This trust battery metaphor by the way is awesome. I've learned to use it also. And again, it's just basically everyone, your trust with someone is like, think of it as a battery that can deplete and grow and you should try to charge it up when you can and then use that charge over time.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:00:06):\nAnd it can be strategic by the way. I've seen people use it as a... I'm pretty sure Toby says he starts everyone at 50% and then he gets to know you. And then I've seen people use it as the opposite, saying, \"Hey, look, this team is hard charging. I'm going to start you at a hundred. Assume that you already have high trust, do the things, and only if you are doing things that are off alignment, does your trust battery deplete.\" So I've seen people use it, the terminology as a shortcut way to figure out how to work with somebody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:30):\nI love just how first principles you all are, and there are so many things are so unique to how you operate and clearly it's working. And so I feel like we just keep going on and on. I want to talk about hiring. I know you have some pretty unique perspectives on how to hire people that are awesome, but also, hire them quickly. But before we get there, is there anything else that you think might be really valuable to share in terms of intensity, velocity, moving fast?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:00:53):\nI think the personality of the leadership team is quite intense. We have a lot of founders on the exec team, which are impatient, intense people by design. But even some of the non-founders are just accomplished people who tend to be pretty, we all have this attitude of impatience, and so maybe, I don't even know if that's a learned skill you can learn or if it just comes along with your personality, like genetics. But we typically, even at the leadership team, for example, we try to do, here's my weekly thread of all the things that are going on so that we can not only share, but also show progress on things. And then someone can jump in and say, \"Oh, this thing you're doing, it relates to my thing that I'm doing over here.\" It creates this notion of, there's a lot going on all the time and we want to keep the vibes, keep the energy high. So a lot of high energy intense people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:45):\nIt reminds me while I was at Airbnb, it felt like no matter how well things are going, it always felt like Brian especially is just pedal to the metal. No matter how well things are going, it's not going well enough. How do we go faster? How do we do more?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:02:00):\nWell, I would actually go further. I think if you don't have two or three big projects that are on fire, you're probably not pushing hard enough because you're not really trying things that are outside of your... If everything's going well, are you really taking the risks you need to be taking? So I think you have to over-rotate a bit and there should be a few things on fire at all times, not because you should create that, but it should just happen because you're stretching into new things that potentially or you're going faster than you should have, or there's a new leader you've counted on early because all these things that should create this thing of it might work. And so you want to have a little bit of chaos at the edge.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:39):\nI love that. And it may sound stressful and why would I want that? Why would I want to work with chaos and fires everywhere? But in reality, if you don't, your business is unlikely to become incredibly successful and that is even more stressful and painful.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:02:55):\nCorrect. Yeah, it's like the opposite, right? It's like this idea of people feel like the comfort gives you stability, and really the uncomfort gives you stability because now you're constantly learning and that makes you more robust against things that could come across.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:11):\nChoosing the harder path, some might say. Okay, let's talk about hiring. You have some really interesting takes on hiring. One that I've heard about is that you don't like the interview process. You kind of like to prefer not to interview and do something instead. Talk about that.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:03:28):\nYeah. So throughout my career, what I've noticed is that, and I'm sure everybody, this is a dirty little secret, right? Interviews are not a good predictor of performance. We know this. We know this from studies. We know this. Everybody at their company knows this, where somebody interviewed well, wasn't as good in the job or the opposite, didn't interview well and then came in and was phenomenal. One example I have from my startup right before we came to Shopify was I hired two people for machine learning. One was a PhD, taught at the university, was like, oh my god, no brainer, was also recommended by an employee. We're like, \"Oh my god, this person's going to be great.\" The other person was a dude I met at the coffee shop who had never had a software job but was just so interested in machine learning and person A, we let go within a few weeks because not a fit for our culture.\n\n(01:04:12):\nAnd person B was at our startup and is still at Shopify today and is a phenomenal machine learning engineer who literally at our Christmas party was like, \"This is my first software job.\" We're like, \"How?\" It was just so cute. And we gave them both the shot. The key was I didn't use the resume in either way to bias. We brought them both in. We said, \"Here's the environment.\" It was all pair programming at my startup. And so they pair program, and actually as an aside, I really believe in pair programming when I made people work in pair programming with my own money. I paid for two people to be on one computer. So that's how you know...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:50):\nLess than half the code.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:04:51):\nYeah, exactly. Right. Less than half the code. But anyway, so pairing. And it was pretty clear after just a few weeks, I would say let's say up to three months is the amount of time I give people, that person A wasn't going to work out than person B was. So what I really like to do is use this race car analogy. If I told you, \"Hey, I want to go hire the best race car driver,\" there's not really that many questions you could ask them except for put them in the car. And so the same thing happens with us is that of course, we have to do interviews, but we do really spend time in the 30, 60, 90 days to make sure that the thing that they are bringing actually lines up with what we need at Shopify. And you should also be transparent with people because if it's not a fit, it's actually good for them and you to figure that out as quickly as possible because they could be amazing somewhere else.\n\n(01:05:39):\nWe mentioned the chaotic environment and fast moving environment Shopify is, that's not for everyone, but that's okay, right? We're not looking for... We've talked about that we want to be as the best 10,000 person company in the world. We're not looking for millions of people. We just need the best 10,000. And so if it's not a fit, it's in your interest and our interest to figure that out quickly so that you can go somewhere where you will be amazing and for us to have the people who will be amazing at Shopify. And so job trials, I'm a huge fan of, which leads me to intern programs, what a great interview process because you now have real work product from somebody for four months. They get to see what it's like to be at Shopify for four months. We get to see what it's like for them to be at Shopify for four months, and that can turn into a full-time gig.\n\n(01:06:21):\nAnd that's a great interview process because you literally know exactly. You don't have to... I'll give you a funny example. I think I've heard a company where, \"Oh, we have an intern process and then afterwards, we interview them for full-time.\" I'm like, \"What are you going to learn from let's say even eight hours of interviews that you're not going to have learned from four months of real work experience?\" And so there's just things like that. You just got to look at the work product. And so I'm a big fan of job trials, and in my previous companies, like you mentioned, I almost didn't interview anybody. I almost just said, \"Come in and work.\" And it allowed us... We had a much higher in the first 90 days, like 20% attrition before 90 days because it just didn't work out. But those after 90 days, we had less than 1% attrition because they knew exactly what they're getting into and we knew exactly how they were going to fit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:04):\nSo in terms of the hiring process, you're still at Shopify. You're interviewing people, they're doing technical evaluations, things like that. But it sounds like there's a very strong setting of expectations. \"We will hire you, but we'll actually clarify if this is a good fit in the first 30, 60, 90 days and we're going to do... We may let you go and there's a good chance we may let you go.\" Is that just the way you set things up?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:07:27):\nYeah, I think the way to think about, it's more like we want to make the interview process as close to the real job as possible because by doing that, we can likely assess the skills that you have in your interview closer to what's happening in the job. So that's one. Two, we have this interview step called the life story where we try to figure out if, are all the experiences you've had up until now actually going to be... Does it show that you are a curious person with range? Because if it does, that's likely more of someone who's going to be a fit. I had this famous line from somebody who said, \"You know what I don't like about resumes?\" I'm like, \"What?\" They go, \"It tells you what you did, but it doesn't tell you why you did those things.\"\n\n(01:08:10):\nAnd it's such an interesting insight. Your resume should be a why, like why did you go from this company to this? That's the interesting part. Not that you are a PM at Microsoft and a PM at Stripe. It's like, why did you switch from Stripe to Microsoft? There's something interesting there. And so the life story is trying to pull that out. It's like, why did you make the decisions? What did you do in your past that was interesting? Are you curious? I always thought... I read this great book, Range by David Epstein. That book was maybe one of the hardest books for me to read in my life because every page I was like, \"I don't believe it.\" I kept thinking I was a specialist. I kept turning the page going, \"I don't like this data that keeps showing that generalists are better.\" And then by the end, I realized that I'm a generalist. It took me so long to realize, and funny for me because I ended up redesigning the compensation system for Shopify, even though I'm an engineer.\n\n(01:08:56):\nSo I still thought of myself as an engineer through and through, even though I work on recruiting and HR and all these other things. But I think that that's what we're trying to tease. And then yes, in that first period, we actually have a survey that goes over Slack that says, \"Hey, how happy are you with the person that you hired?\" And that should, in conversation with the person, you should give them the feedback to figure out, \"Hey, are there things you need to adjust to better fit in and make sure the expectations are set up?\" But then also, together with the person, figure out, \"Hey, if you're not feeling this, let's find you either a different role in the company or somewhere else because we want the people here to have high impact.\" But that person should have high impact somewhere, could be at Shopify, could be in the same role, could be in a different role, could be at a different company. But that's a good thing for everybody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:41):\nAnd then do you actually do work trials with new engineering hires, or is that something you aspire to do?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:09:46):\nYeah, I would love to do it. It's hard to do with the volume resumes we get, but we do do it at scale with the internship program. So like 2025, we're going to hire a thousand interns, and that is going to give me a thousand job trials to pick the top X percent of those to come to Shopify full time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:03):\nSo just to double-click on that, so you're hiring a thousand interns over the course of the year. That's a lot. And the idea there is these folks are actually useful building useful things, and it's an interview process for the internship.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:10:17):\nYeah, I think it's two things. One is some people look at an internship program as community service. Let's give back to the community. Let's hire early talent. And I'm like, \"Hold on a sec. Are you telling me I could hire a thousand people over the year?\" And they will come to work with an LLM and a brain because they're growing up in the age of AI. They will be useful to us because they come from a different generation and they have, in our case in commerce, they have a different experience about shopping and AI and bots and chat and voice and all these things. They'll be useful to us. We'll teach them some stuff as well. And then together we can decide if they might end up going somewhere else, in which case, we have the Shopify imprint on them going to whatever other company, which is I think a positive, or they might stay at Shopify and be useful over a longer period.\n\n(01:11:02):\nIt seems like win, win, win. The other thing that was cool is after I did that tweet, a bunch of other CTOs messaged me and said, \"Hey, we're going to hire 1,001 interns to beat you guys.\" And I'm like, \"Great.\" Just from that one tweet, if I can get the early talent ecosystem restarted here after a really tough last few years and layoffs, it's great for everybody because now they're realizing that they also realize that these people are super valuable and they bring together a completely different set of skills. And by the way, here's a secret in pair programming, interns will always be more intense than the full-time. And so that also helps the flywheel of intensity go for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:40):\nIt all just keeps coming back. Did the internship program emerge out of this co-op system that Canadian schools have and a Waterloo has a big co-op program?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:11:49):\nYeah, I went to Waterloo. And so yeah, hint, hint. So I went to Waterloo and I did co-op and I did intern programs there. It was amazing. What a great experience, because what ends up happening is you leave Waterloo with your degree, but also with two years of experience because I did six four-month work terms, 24 months, and you end up walking. I think one of the big parts of it is just interview skills because I interviewed for 10 plus jobs every four months, and I did that six times. And so you come out having done lots... You have a lot of interview experience, but you also have work experience. And so just taking that to the next level, Shopify has always had interns. And what I felt like we needed to do was, again, restart this notion of early talent in the ecosystem. I would say one or two big differences with our intern program.\n\n(01:12:36):\nOne is we're making them come in three days a week versus full remote. And the reason for that is, and we're doing it just in three offices right now in Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa. And the reason for that is because we want them to have a cohort because early talent is different than you and I who've been in the industry. We worked in office, we worked out of office. We're more comfortable with navigating partnership discussions and talking to people in different companies. But these people have not. They may have never worked anywhere.\n\n(01:13:02):\nAnd so to not have the IRL component would do them a disservice. And so we specifically made it in those ports and the people are traveling by the way, they're moving to Montreal to do the internship. It's great. And then if you're a mentor or manager for one of the interns, you have to at least see them like IRL once a month. So we're kind of making these experiences. And of course, they'll have a cohort of dozens of people that will be with them along the way. And so we think that'll just make their experience better. And of course, nothing like tapping someone on the shoulder and be like, \"Have you seen this era before?\" And so it's easier in an early talent situation. And then of course over time, if they become full-time, they can still come to the office. It's come if you want, but they can also go full remote.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:39):\nThat is amazing. For folks that don't know anything about these co-op programs briefly, it's just basically while you're in school, before you graduated, during the summer, you go work at a company.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:13:39):\nNo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:48):\nOh, during the year. Okay.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:13:50):\nYeah, it's during the year. So what happens at Waterloo is, what I did was I did eight months of school at the beginning. So two terms. My first co-op term was summer, but then it was work, school, work, school, alternating for the whole rest of my time at Waterloo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:02):\nIt's like semesters alternating.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:14:03):\nExactly. So every four months I did either school term or work time. So I was doing work in January sometimes and September sometimes. And it was super good because again, it also allowed me to be super intense at school for four months and then go to super intense work experience for four months. But yeah, it's a model that... I was just at Waterloo this week doing a talk, so I love that symbiotic relationship between Waterloo and the employers, by the way, not just Waterloo. Lots of schools do a summer program, UFT and others, lots of schools in the states.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:32):\nFun fact. So total tangent, I had a startup called Local Mine, started it in Montreal of all places. I'm not Canadian, but moved there for various reasons. It was awesome. And our first hire was actually from the co-op program. I don't know if it was Waterloo, his name is Nick Adams. And he applied. Just he saw our job posting, I think, and were like, \"What is a co-op?\" And he came to work and then he went back to school, and then we hired him, and then he ended up at Airbnb when we got a card.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:14:59):\nThere you go. So for us, actually, when I did my startup Helpful, I had one or two engineers, and then I actually literally just hired four interns because you hired them in February for May. And because I was doing pair programming, I had to make sure I had four full times by then. So I hired the interns in anticipation of having the full times. And I literally had, I think I was off by one week, so one intern had no pair for a week, but then after that in May, I had four full times, four interns, and then they paired the whole time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:31):\nWhat a journey. I want to talk about just one other topic real quick and then we'll wrap this up. And it's around XtremeLabs. So there's a bunch of stuff here. It feels like it's just like this tech mafia of Canada that a lot of incredible people emerged out of, and there's a whole bunch of stuff we can talk about. One fact I heard while you were there is you had a hundred reports, direct reports that reported to you.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:15:56):\nA 120.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:57):\n120 direct reports feels like a complete nightmare to me. Tell me why you decided to do that, if you'd recommend that for other people.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:16:05):\nYeah, so what ended up happening there was we started off small. It was 10 people. When I got to XtremeLabs, I wasn't the founder, but I was very early on and I just had everyone report to me. And then as we grew, I just kept having those people report to me and I was trying to figure out, we talked about crafters and crafters paradise, this idea of people don't really... Their managers are useful, but I was trying to figure out could I solve the problems that they needed their manager for in other ways? So for example, what should I be working on? I was like, \"Okay, well, we have product backlogs\" or \"I'm blocked on something,\" or \"I need feedback on the product I'm building,\" or \"I'm stuck on this technical problem.\" I tried to figure out ways to not have managers be the answers to those questions.\n\n(01:16:48):\nI'm like, \"There should be another answer.\" And so pair programming really helps you get unblocked quickly because you have another person that you can bounce technical ideas off of. Having a product backlog can tell you what to work on. We had demos every week, demos internally, and then we had demos with the clients every week because we were a contract manufacturing for mobile. That gave them feedback on whether they were going in the right direction. We had set working hours, which made things super intense in the office. This is again like 2009 to 2013. So all these things didn't really need a manager. And what I realized was what the unblocking thing needed a manager. I'm blocked on this. Well, I said, okay, if... I had all these directors. I did two things famously. One, I had a lot of direct reports, and two, I did not do any scheduled one-on-ones because you can't have 120 direct reports and do a scheduled one-on-ones because you're never doing anything but one-on-ones.\n\n(01:17:31):\nSo I said, \"I'm going to be around a lot because I don't have a lot of one-on-ones. So we can do unscheduled one-on-ones.\" And what that means is if you are blocked, actually there's a famous picture where I had this weird cube desk where it was like a circle almost in the middle of the whole floor of engineers. And I was always there because I wasn't in a lot of meetings and people that were blocked, they could just come up to me. Actually, one cool thing about pair programming IRL is you can look across and just see if it's working or not. Because if two people are intensely on the computer, you know it's working. If one person is laying back or you're like, \"It's not working,\" so you can just walk up to-\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:18:00):\nIt's working if one person is laying back or you're like, it's not working. So you could just walk up to them and be like, \"What's happening?\" But they would come and ask me questions and I can unlock them. Like, hey, we're blocked on this. We don't have this API. We need money for this machine, whatever. And so the unscheduled one-on-ones ended up being a real clarifying thing for me. Because I did scheduled one-on-ones my whole career and I realized after leaving Microsoft for three years, I'm like, where are all those one-on-ones useful once a week for three years, right? A hundred and fifty one-on-ones.\n\n(01:18:26):\nSo the unscheduled ones were, though. I was like, when I knocked on my manager's door and said, \"I have this problem, those were important.\" So that's what I created at Xtreme. And the 120 directors, it just grew over time. I just didn't think I needed managers. So I was like, let me unblock these people on another way. And we came up with other things to systems to unblock them that didn't require a manager. And I just also had a good memory. I knew exactly everyone's skills and compensation. I knew all that off the top of my head, so that helps.\n\n(01:18:54):\nThe thing that I broke was actually, this is Chamath. He came in and became our biggest investors. He's obviously is a smart guy, but he said the right thing, which is not, this can never work, because then I would go into defense mode and explain to him why it would work. He just said to me, I'm not going to debate with you whether this works or not, but will it work at 400 people? And I said, probably not. He said, okay, so let's change it.\n\n(01:19:16):\nAnd so we did then ended up putting a little bit more of a structure, but I made a few people directors and I forced them to have 40 direct reports each. I said, we're just going to make it still pretty flat. And then that did end up working, because it still allowed them to use the system to unblock people versus having to do a one-on-one every week, or having to talk about things that potentially a system could unblock. And so I tried to figure out ways to systematize things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:45):\nI love it. Just another example of doing things differently, not necessarily just, here's how it's done and I'm going to do it that way and experimenting with it. Even if you knew, okay, maybe long term this isn't the way it's going to operate. I imagine at Shopify you don't have 120 reports.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:19:58):\nNo, we have fourteen or something. We do have these guardrails where I think we say, Hey, in engineering you should have between eight and 20. There are definitely people who have more and people who have less. But we do try to keep things as flat as possible, because we do believe that it doesn't make sense to have three people reporting to and then to somebody, and then they only have three people. You just make a very deep hierarchy. We actually do see, by the way, the farther you are from Toby, we can see things in the survey results. The alignment gets out of whack, and so you do actually see that you want to be closer, you want to have a flatter org in general, and that can be achieved by just having more direct reports per level.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:39):\nMakes sense. Okay, final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. We have this recurring segments that I call Fail Corner where generally people come on these podcasts, they share all their successes. Here's all the things that I've done, right. Here's all the big wins. And everyone feels like, oh man, I wish I was always successful people. When in reality, everyone that comes on has failed many times. Is there a story of a failure in your career that you could share that helps people see that even folks like you fail, and maybe what you learned from that experience?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:21:10):\nI have a few. I'll say one thing by the way, because I think I read this in Tim Ferriss's book or in the podcast where he said, create a failure resume and write everything down. And I would not recommend doing this because I did this and I got super... I'm like a high energy happy guy. I wrote down, I have a note on my phone called Failure Resume, and I wrote down all the times I failed and it is depressing. So I would not encourage people to do that, but I'm happy to tell you about a few instances.\n\n(01:21:33):\nSo well, one is actually I've been laid off twice and people would not expect like, oh, I'm doing this thing and I've been laid off twice. And I think in both times it was the right thing, it was the right thing for the company, the right thing for me.\n\n(01:21:45):\nAnd I kind of used that experience as a way to reevaluate and eventually came out with my framework of how I want to spend time. But that's maybe a different story.\n\n(01:21:54):\nI'll tell you about one at Shopify, the first week that I started, 2019, we were rebuilding our point of sale system, which now does billions of dollars of GMB. But back then we were like, well, let's rebuild it with a new UX and a new technology platform. And it was my first week and I'm the mobile guy, coming from Extreme Labs. They're like, should we build this in React Native, or should we build this natively on the mobile platforms? And so I went through this evaluation, spent a lot of time, blah, blah, blah, and I came back with a hedged solution, which is kind of dumb. I said, let's do iOS and Swift and let's do Android in React Native. And the reason I said that was I said, I want to learn about React Native and I think Android's the harder platform, so let's build that in React Native, but iOS on Swift because that guarantees us a product in market. And we didn't have any React Native apps in market at the time. A year later we launched the iOS version and it was a huge success. And we then spent another six months building the React Native version for Android and everything else. And we realized pretty quickly that React Native was the platform for the future. We were like, oh my God, this will allow us to have one platform. You could run it on the web as well, and we could use the React engineers from the web to work on it. It was a clear winner. By then, we had also launched a shop app, which is React Native.\n\n(01:23:11):\nAnd so we learned a lot about this. And I went back and I said, hey everybody, I made a huge mistake. We just spent a year building this thing. It's in market, but we're going to have to rewrite. We're going to have to rebase back onto this iOS version. And I think I burned 18 months of time with a hundred engineers, literally from the decision I made in the first week of joining Shopify, and Toby, when I went to Toby and I told him, I go, hey man, I think I made this mistake and we have to do this and it's going to cost us a hundred engineers, another six, whatever. And he looked at me and he goes, you should tell everyone this story. That's all he said. Not like, hey, bad, good. He goes, did you learn something? It was an epiphany for me, but he was like, this is a learning org, and I totally failed and I told everyone I failed and my mistake and everything else, but he goes, just tell everyone because he goes, do you know what mistake you made?\n\n(01:23:57):\nAnd first I was like, I don't think, like, what mistake. He's like, you didn't take. He goes, I will always come down harshly on people who do not take risks, and you did not take a risk in this case. But if you take a risk and it doesn't work out, you'll never get in trouble, because you took the risk and it was the right risk to take, but he goes, but you didn't take the risk.\n\n(01:24:16):\nAnd so what I should have done, and by the way, even now thinking back it would be super hard to do, first week at Shopify, right, is take a risk on a platform that we have not launched in production app on, but he was correct in that we should have, because we would've saved ourselves so much more time. So yeah, total failure, sorry. The product is super successful now and we're all on React Native and even the Shop Green app is on React Native. Everything's React Native, and we're core contributors. It's all good. But I literally burned I think 18 months of time for a hundred engineers as my first decision in the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):\nThis might be the best example of failure coordinator we've had yet. This is a great example. Both of them actually are, although I'm wondering, okay, that felt like a really good decision to me and it's-\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:24:58):\nIt sounds like it, right? But It wouldn't have been his.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:02):\nBut it's, obviously you don't want to just take risks. There's a limit of a risk but informed, I guess. Is there anything you missed there that would told you this was the right path? Because in hindsight, of course we should have done this, but looking back, what do you think you should have done other than we should have done the risky path?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:25:19):\nYeah, I mean one thing about my career as well is I don't really do anything halfway. And when I started looking into React Native, it was never just that I'm going, oh, let me look at the docs and read and build a thing. It's like I flew to Meta and met with the React team. I became a core contributor. I ran the React Native working group, like we became release captains for React Native. I knew that I was going to do all the things, so I'm like, and of course in React Native you can also drop down to native and do things there that are not possible. So I think I hedged incorrectly. I knew I was going to do all these things and I should have looked at my own thought process, say, if I do all the things, can I fail? And I didn't take that into account because again, I did five or six.\n\n(01:25:58):\nI literally, I put everyone together. I was running the group, I was like release captain. I would hang out with the React team and Meta, we're doing all the things. We became core contributors at React Native before we became core contributors and react because of all the things I was doing. And so I think just knowing that I was going to go all out, I should have said, you know what? This is not going to fail. And I didn't have the confidence in that path, so I hedged, right? Hedging is the worst. And I remember the CTO at the time said, I'm wondering if I should force you to go React Native. He literally said that. And I said, I will do if you say that, I will do it, but it would've been his decision. And so he didn't do it. He didn't tell me to do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:36):\nOkay, that makes a lot more sense. It's so funny that Facebook had a similar mistake early on in their career-\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:26:44):\nHTML5.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:45):\nYeah, exactly. I know. I don't know if you were at Zuck's interview at the Chase center that the Acquired podcast did, and he talked about this where their market cap dropped 80%. They were about to go public. They went with this app. No one thought they could do mobile ads. And he's like, that set us back a year and a half. He's like, but based on all the pain he's gone through back since then, he's like, that was not too bad.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:27:08):\nYeah, it's true actually, maybe what people don't know is, I was at Facebook, XtremeLabs, worked on the Facebook app and we worked on that app. I was in the office when we submitted the iOS app every single day that week, because it kept crashing. And we had obviously direct access to people at Apple, but we'd ship a new app on Monday and it crashed ship an app on... Not just us, but us, Facebook together. And so I remember that whole HTML five fiasco from the inside.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):\nI thought you would say you also told Facebook to decide on the HTML5 app to set them back a year.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:27:41):\nI did not. We happened to be there when they were doing it. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:45):\nThat's so funny. Amazing. Thank you for sharing that. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think would be valuable to leave listeners with, either touch on something you've mentioned, a last piece of nugget of wisdom, or we just go straight to the round?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:28:01):\nYeah, I'll say something maybe embarrassing for you. I've been using your performance management framework from your first round review article, not knowing by the way that it was you. I actually found it, you being the famous Lenny podcaster, but the old days, maybe the Lenny, the PM. And I remember reading this a long time ago and just copying, there's a Google link in there to a Google Doc link with a template for a performance review framework that I've been using for years.\n\n(01:28:32):\nLiterally every review I've done at Shopify uses that framework. And I was writing a post to my admin about how we can use LLMs to make it easier for me to write these reviews, even though obviously you have to read it all and go through it, but I was like, how can I generate some of this with an LLM? And so I wanted to send her the original article. So I went back to the first round review, I found the article and said, oh my God, it's Lenny, the same guy.\n\n(01:28:54):\nSo I will say one thing that's interesting about that framework is, I've used it now for, like I said, six years here, is that, and I don't think it's me. I think it's actually the framework pulls out good information. I've had multiple people in a review process tell me that, when I deliver the feedback in, of course the format, they would say, wow, I've been in industry a long time. This is the best performance review I've ever had. And it's because the framework pulls out good information. So congrats to you.\n\n(01:29:21):\nBut I think it was funny that randomly I was coming on this podcast and I just wrote that doc to my admin two, three weeks ago and realized it's the same person.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:29):\nWell, how about that? I love that. I'll also give credit to a four board guest on this podcast, Vlad Loktev, who was my manager at Airbnb, and that's where I was inspired to write about that framework.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:29:29):\nAmazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:41):\nSo it trickles down to him and I don't know where he boarded this, he probably invented it. So credit to Vlad also for that. Another fun fact along these lines, I have another first round of repost about the W framework, which is a framework for planning. They do annual planning. And that's one that I've slowly discovered many, many companies use and they don't know where it came from. They just call it, oh, we have this W framework. Someone flipped it and call the M framework. But that's another one that has trickled into the ether of tech companies, which is awesome.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:30:10):\nAmazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):\nWith that, Farhan, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:30:17):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:18):\nLet's do this. What are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:30:23):\nThere's one. So Toby has an annoyingly long set of books that he recommends, and they're all, not all, they're usually good, depends because we're not totally in sync on fiction, for example. But he recommended one to me that I think everyone should read right now called Manna, M-A-N-N-A, from Marshall Brain. It is a book, it's a book about AI. And I think the most interesting thing about it though is about a future in which the AI tells the humans what to do. So it's this idea of, imagine in the future you came into work and the AI would tell you what emails to pay attention to or what dashboard to look at because something weird is going on. It takes that to an interesting level. So I would recommend reading that book. It's not long. That's fun.\n\n(01:31:05):\nI think another book that I recommend to people, and it's a weird one to recommend, but it's Business Adventures from John Brooks, the famous, if you ask, I think it's Bill Gates, what his famous book of all time is, it's this book.\n\n(01:31:16):\nAnd the cool thing about the book is that it is not easy to digest for anyone with focus problems. Paul Graham wrote the post How to Do Great Work, and it's super long. The best part about that post is that you have to be able to read the whole thing. And so the same thing with Business Adventures. I think each chapter is, it's 12 chapters, 12 stories, no breaks in between. It's just each one is super long. But it just goes into a problem at such depth that if you can maintain your focus to get through the depths of each problem, you will just learn something, just like that post by Paul Graham.\n\n(01:31:51):\nI loved that it was so long because I sent it to people and I said, the test here is can you read it? Can you just get to the end? And not in a pejorative way, like in a... If you can get to the end, you will extract the alpha from this post if you can read it all. So those are... Manna is like the opposite. It's very easy and easy read.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:11):\nI'm excited to read these. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:32:18):\nA recent one was Challengers, the tennis movie, with Zendaya just randomly I was at home and I put it on and the cool thing about it was more the cinematography and music. They had this weird style, art house style, where they would be talking and music would get super loud. It was very strange, but a very, very good movie. And then you saw, you said movies and-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:40):\nOr TV show. Oh, TV show, anything like that.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:32:42):\nYeah, one of my all time favorites is probably Halt and Catch Fire. I don't know if you've watched that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:47):\nAbout the early tech industry.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:32:48):\nEarly tech. And I think there was an Andreessen podcast where he said this is the closest thing to what a real startup looks like. So Halt and Catch Fire like an all time recommend, everybody has to watch it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:59):\nDo you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:33:03):\nI don't know if I want to be in the zeitgeist right now, but the Meta Ray-Bans are amazing. And the biggest thing about the Meta Ray-Bans was just that I think I never got into it and I saw people around me wearing it, but I only got into it when somebody said I'd never take my AirPods with me anymore. And I was like, oh, I can swap two devices for one device. I always have sunglasses and AirPods because I'll go for a walk or listen to a podcast and now I can just have one device.\n\n(01:33:26):\nAnd this happened to me. I was in the summer, I was at a pool party and someone called me and I just took it from my sunglasses and people were confused as where I was taking this call from. But they are the right amount of tech. They're in unintrusive, you can't tell, they don't look like any tech. And then also I was playing soccer with my kids. I have three kids. I just turned the video on and I was the goalie and they were taking shots and I was watching them. They had no idea that I was just recording. And it was such a cool moment because I was in playing soccer with them. I wasn't with my phone and I got to get this amazing set of video that I would never would've gotten. So I really liked the Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:58):\nWe had Boz on the podcast who leads a lot of that work and he's got a to teach us. And I put on Ray-Bans while we were doing the interview just for fun. You could see my setup. Okay, cool. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find useful in work or in life?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:34:15):\nOkay, I do. And it's on a lot of my profile bios, and it is, everything you know is wrong. And the reason I like that one, and people always like, what would you put on a billboard? And people always come back to me and say, that's like they know that as my motto.\n\n(01:34:32):\nAnd the reason for that is it's this notion of if all the knowledge you knew was incorrect, could you from first principles build up a view of the world? And that's kind of how I like to think of things is that, anything could be incorrect. Even things that you think are correct, which is why, again, back to the, I like to experiment. I like to look stupid, because I'm always trying shit because I'm like, I don't know if even though you say this is correct, that this is going to work, right.\n\n(01:34:58):\nActually, one example, my wife hates this is I have a Tesla and I routinely will switch gears without fully stopping the car, which you cannot do in a regular car, but I'll be in drive and then I'll slow down to drive back up into my driveway and while it's moving I switch it into reverse.\n\n(01:35:14):\nAnd you never would know that that's possible except for trying. And sometimes it goes beep beep because you're going too fast. And she hates it. But I'm always trying weird things and so that's why I say everything you know is wrong. Who knows what's possible, just try different things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:29):\nI do the same thing with my Tesla. I used to do it with a non-electric car and my wife is always like, don't do that. Screwing it up.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:35:34):\nYes, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:35):\nI love that on an electric car, there's no gear you're breaking, it's just software.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:35:39):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:41):\nThis quote reminds me of that you shared of everything you know is wrong. The founders of Airbnb always talked about just this point that everything around you was designed somebody, another human. There's not necessarily that much smarter or insightful. It doesn't mean what they did was correct. Somebody else find some better potentially...\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:35:57):\nI think Steve Jobs had a similar thing like, hey, you can design anything. Everything's designed by people. I love that one too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:03):\nYeah. Final question. So you told me the story of this PhD you hired versus just a guy you met in a college, sorry, in a coffee shop. I read another similar story where you hired a waitress.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:36:14):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:14):\nIs that real? Okay, tell that story.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:36:17):\nYeah, so again, this is another long list of reasons my wife is in annoyed with me, but this is another one of them. Whenever we are out, I'm always scanning and I'm always scanning people and one, do I know anybody around, whatever. I like to scan for people and I have a good memory for faces. But in this case we were at a restaurant and I saw a waitress doing a very, very good job, an extremely, like she was running between different tables, she was smiling her face, taking everyone's order, making sure that there was a thing happening in the kitchen. She was kind of doing a phenomenal job of organizing the entire crazy busy restaurant. And so in talking to her, I said, what do you do outside of this because you look like you're super. She's like, what do you mean? I'm just the waitress.\n\n(01:36:59):\nAnd I said, well, would you like to, this is XtremeLabs. I Said, would you like to work at XtremeLabs? She's like, what's that? So I explained it to her and I got her contact info. She came into the office and she first started off as our receptionist, so she moved from the retail world into the office world, and then I brought her on as my admin and she became one of my recruiters. And I taught her how to recruit and talked to people and she came in with me to info sessions. And over time we actually hired many more people from the restaurant that were really, really good at their job. And what was amazing was, one, she was organized but not reorganized. I had to teach her at Google Docs and G Suite and everything else, but she was super smart but just never had the opportunity.\n\n(01:37:35):\nThe coolest thing about this is that she ended up being, she ended up taking over one of the HR functions for us. And she had a college degree and because of the work she had done with us, she was able to parlay that into finishing, doing one more year and getting a university degree. And now she's a director of HR at a company, which is amazing from, like, she went from that environment to this environment and a lot of her people, she pulled the smart and intense people she pulled from that environment also ended up on these amazing career paths. If I see someone doing a good job, I'm like, what do they do? How can I work with them? This is one example of pulling somebody out of that environment. I have lots of other ones where I overhear someone in their designer or an engineer and I try to hire them into my company as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:22):\nWow. That is such a good story. I love that. Maybe restaurants are the new feeder system for tech companies. Did not think about that.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:38:31):\nYeah, I mean, everyone's smart at something, so I was trying to figure out, she was really good at this thing. She'd be so good at something else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:36):\nAmazing. I feel like there's so many stories, more stories to tell, but we're going to wrap it up and let you go, farhan. Two final questions. Where can folks find you a line if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe apply to work at Shopify and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:38:50):\nSure, so Twitter's probably the place I try to hang out the most, X at FNThawar, and maybe I'll put that in the show notes. And then listeners for me. I mean, I love to be challenged. I'm sure that there are people who are like, they heard something that I said and they're like, oh, that's super dumb. We do this instead. Or here's research that says that that won't work. I would love to hear more about these because I'm just again, on a learning journey and if I did something stupid, very likely I would like to learn a better way to do things. So I would love for people to comment and say, hey, this is dumb. You should try this, or, that doesn't make any sense. I would love to learn more. So that's what I'm looking for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:25):\nAll right, well leave a comment in YouTube or on the Substack post with what Farhan got wrong.\n\nFarhan Thawar (01:39:31):\nAmazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:33):\nThank you so much for being here. Thanks for having me. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:39:38):\nThank you so much for listening.

The work you did actually was the spark that brought us out of AI winter.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:00:07):\nIn the middle of 2015, middle of 2016, some tech companies avoid using the word AI because they were not sure if AI was a dirty word. 2017-ish was the beginning of companies calling themselves AI companies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):\nThere's this line, I think, this was when you were presenting to Congress. There's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people. It's created by people, and most importantly, it impacts people.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:00:30):\nIt's not like I think AI will have no impact on jobs or people. In fact, I believe that whatever AI does, currently or in the future, is up to us. It's up to the people. I do believe technology is a net positive for humanity, but I think every technology is a double-edged sword. If we're not doing the right thing as a society, as individuals, we can screw this up as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):\nYou had this breakthrough insight of just, okay, we can train machines to think like humans, but it's just missing the data that humans have to learn as a child.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:01:03):\nI chose to look at artificial intelligence through the lens of visual intelligence because humans are deeply visual animals. We need to train machines with as much information as possible on images of objects, but objects are very, very difficult to learn. A single object can have infinite possibilities that is shown on an image. In order to train computers with tens and thousands of object concepts, you really need to show it millions of examples.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:36):\nToday, my guest is Dr. Fei-Fei Li, who's known as the godmother of AI. Fei-Fei has been responsible for and at the center of many of the biggest breakthroughs that sparked the AI revolution that we're currently living through. She spearheaded the creation of ImageNet, which was basically her realizing that AI needed a ton of clean-labeled data to get smarter, and that data set became the breakthrough that led to the current approach to building and scaling AI models. She was chief AI scientist at Google Cloud, which is where some of the biggest early technology breakthroughs emerged from. She was director at SAIL, Stanford's Artificial Intelligence Lab, where many of the biggest AI minds came out of. She's also co-creator of Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, which is playing a vital role in a direction that AI is taking. She's also been on the board of Twitter. She was named one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in AI. She's also United Nations advisory board. I could go on.\n\n(00:02:29):\nIn our conversation, Fei-Fei shares a brief history of how we got to today in the world of AI, including this mind-blowing reminder that 9 to 10 years ago, calling yourself an AI company was basically a death knell for your brand because no one believed that AI was actually going to work. Today, it's completely different. Every company is an AI company. We also chat about her take on how she sees AI impacting humanity in the future, how far current technologies will take us, why she's so passionate about building a world model and what exactly world models are, and most exciting of all, the launch of the world's first large world model, Marble, which just came out as this podcast comes out. Anyone can go play with this at marble.worldlabs.ai. It's insane. Definitely check it out. Fei-Fei is incredible and way too under the radar for the impact that she's had on the world, so I am really excited to have her on and to spread her wisdom with more people.\n\n(00:03:22):\nA huge thank you to Ben Horowitz and Condoleezza Rice for suggesting topics for this conversation. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. With that, I bring you Dr. Fei-Fei Li after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:03:37):\nThis episode is brought to you by Figma, makers of Figma Make. When I was a PM at Airbnb, I still remember when Figma came out and how much it improved how we operated as a team. Suddenly, I can involve my whole team in the design process, give feedback on design concepts really quickly and it just made the whole product development process so much more fun. But Figma never felt like it was for me. It was great for giving feedback and designs, but as a builder, I wanted to make stuff. That's why Figma built Figma Make. With just a few prompts, you can make any idea or design into a fully functional prototype or app that anyone can iterate on and validate with customers.\n\n(00:04:15):\nFigma Make is a different kind of vibe coding tool. Because it's all in Figma, you can use your team's existing design building blocks, making it easy to create outputs that look good and feel real and are connected to how your team builds. Stop spending so much time telling people about your product vision and instead show it to them. Make code-back prototypes and apps fast with Figma Make. Check it out at figma.com/lenny.\n\n(00:04:40):\nDid you know that I have a whole team that helps me with my podcast and with my newsletter? I want everyone on that team to be super happy and thrive in the roles. Justworks knows that your employees are more than just your employees; they're your people. My team is spread out across Colorado, Australia, Nepal, West Africa, and San Francisco. My life would be so incredibly complicated to hire people internationally, to pay people on time and in their local currencies, and to answer their HR questions 24/7. But with Justworks, it's super easy. Whether you're setting up your own automated payroll, offering premium benefits, or hiring internationally, Justworks offer simple software and 24/7 human support from small business experts for you and your people. They do your human resources right so that you can do right by your people. Justworks, for your people.\n\n(00:05:31):\nFei-Fei, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:05:34):\nI'm excited to be here, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:36):\nI'm even more excited to have you here. It is such a treat to get to chat with you. There's so much that I want to talk about. You've been at the center of this AI explosion that we're seeing right now for so long. We're going to talk about a bunch of the history that I think a lot of people don't even know about how this whole thing started, but let me first read a quote from Wired about you just so people get a sense, and in the intro I'll share all of the other epic things you've done. But I think this is a good way to just set context. \"Fei-Fei is one of a tiny group of scientists, a group perhaps small enough to fit around a kitchen table, who are responsible for AI's recent remarkable advances.\"\n\n(00:06:10):\nA lot of people call you the godmother of AI, and unlike a lot of AI leaders, you're an AI optimist. You don't think AI is going to replace us. You don't think it's going to take all our jobs. You don't think it's going to kill us. So I thought it'd be fun to start there, just what's your perspective on how AI is going to impact humanity over time?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:06:30):\nYeah, okay, so Lenny, let me be very clear. I'm not a utopian, so it's not like I think AI will have no impact on jobs or people. In fact, I'm a humanist. I believe that whatever AI does, currently or in the future, is up to us. It's up to the people. So I do believe technology is a net positive for humanity. If you look at the long course of civilization, I think we are, and fundamentally, we're an innovative species that we... If you look at from written record thousands of years ago to now, humans just kept innovating ourselves and innovating our tools, and with that, we make lives better, we make work better, we build civilization, and I do believe AI is part of that. So that's where the optimism comes from. But I think every technology is a double-edged sword, and if we're not doing the right thing as a species, as a society, as communities, as individuals, we can screw this up as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:47):\nThere's this line, I think, this was when you were presenting to Congress, \"There's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people. It's created by people, and most importantly, it impacts people.\" I don't have a question there, but what a great line.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:07:59):\nYeah, I feel pretty deeply. I started working AI two and a half decades ago, and I've been having students for the past two decades and almost every student who graduates, I remind them when they graduate from my lab that your field is called artificial intelligence, but there's nothing artificial about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:23):\nComing back to the point you just made about how it's kind of up to us about where this all goes, what is it you think we need to get right? How do we set things on a path? I know this is a very difficult question to answer, but just what's your advice? What do you think we should be keeping in mind?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:08:36):\nYeah, how many hours do we have?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):\nHow do we align AI? There we go. Let's solve it.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:08:41):\nSo I think people should be responsible individuals no matter what we do. This is what we teach our children, and this is what we need to do as grownups as well. No matter which part of the AI development or AI deployment or AI application you are participating in, and most likely many of us, especially as technologists, we're in multiple points. We should act like responsible individuals and care about this. Actually, care a lot about this. I think everybody today should care about AI because it is going to impact your individual life. It is going to impact your community, it's going to impact the society and the future generation. And caring about it as a responsible person is the first, but also the most important step.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:37):\nOkay, so let me actually take a step back and kind of go to the beginning of AI. Most people started hearing and caring about AI, as what it's called today, just like, I don't know, a few years ago when ChatGPT came out. Maybe it was like three years ago.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:09:51):\nThree years ago, almost one more month, three years ago.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:55):\nWow, okay. And that was ChatGPT coming out. Is that the milestone you have in mind?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:09:56):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:57):\nOkay, cool. That's exactly how I saw it. But very few people know there was a long, long history of people working on, it was called machine learning back then and there's other terms, and now it's just everything's AI and there was kind of a long period of just a lot of people working on it. And then there's this what people refer to as the AI winter where people just gave up almost, most people did, and just, okay, this idea isn't going anywhere. And then the work you did actually was essentially the spark that brought us out of AI winter and is directly responsible for the world where now of just AI is all we talk about. As you just said, it's going to impact everything we do. So I thought it'd be really interesting to hear from you just the brief history of what the world was like before ImageNet and just the work you did to create ImageNet, why that was so important, and then just what happened after.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:10:44):\nIt is, for me, hard to keep in mind that AI is so new for everybody when I lived my entire professional life in AI. There's a part of me that is just, it's so satisfying to see a personal curiosity that I started barely out of teenagehood and now has become a transformative force of our civilization. It generally is a civilizational level technology. So that journey is about 30 years or 20 something, 20 plus years, and it's just very satisfying. So where did it all start? Well, I'm not even the first generation AI researcher. The first generation really date back to the '50s and '60s, and Alan Turing was ahead of his time in the '40s by asking, daring humanity with the question, \"Is there thinking machines?\" And of course he has a specific way of testing this concept of thinking machine, which is a conversational chatbot, which to his standard we now have a thinking machine.\n\n(00:12:02):\nBut that was just a more anecdotal inspiration. The field really began in the '50s when computer scientists came together and look at how we can use computer programs and algorithms to build these programs that can do things that have been only capable by human cognition. And that was the beginning. And the founding fathers the Dartmouth workshop in the 1956, we have Professor John McCarthy who later came to Stanford who coined the term artificial intelligence. And between the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s, it was the early days of AI exploration and we had logic systems, we had expert systems, we also had early exploration of neural network. And then it came to around the late '80s, the '90s, and the very beginning of the 21st century. That stretch about 20 years is actually the beginning of machine learning, is the marriage between computer programming and statistical learning.\n\n(00:13:23):\nAnd that marriage brought a very, very critical concept into AI, which is that purely rule-based program is not going to account for the vast amount of cognitive capabilities that we imagine computers can do. So we have to use machines to learn the patterns. Once the machines can learn the patterns, it has a hope to do more things. For example, if you give it three cats, the hope is not just for the machines to recognize these three cats. The hope is the machines can recognize the fourth cat, the fifth cat, the sixth cat, and all the other cats. And that's a learning ability that is fundamental to humans and remaining animals. And we, as a field, realized, \"We need machine learning.\" So that was up till the beginning of the 21st century. I entered the field of AI literally in the year of 2000. That's when my PhD began at Caltech.\n\n(00:14:33):\nAnd so I was one of the first generation machine learning researchers and we were already studying this concept of machine learning, especially neural network. I remember that was one of my first courses at Caltech is called neural network, but it was very painful. It was still smack in the middle of the so-called AI winter, meaning the public didn't look at this too much. There wasn't that much funding, but there was also a lot of ideas flowing around. And I think two things happened to myself that brought my own career so close to the birth of modern AI is that I chose to look at artificial intelligence through the lens of visual intelligence because humans are deeply visual animals. We can talk a little more later, but so much of our intelligence is built upon visual, perceptual, spatial understanding, not just language per se. I think they're complementary.\n\n(00:15:37):\nSo I choose to look at visual intelligence and my PhD and my early professor years, my students and I are very committed to a north star problem, which is solving the problem of object recognition because it's a building block for the perceptual world, right? We go around the world interpreting reasoning and interacting with it more or less at the object level. We don't interact with the world at the molecular level. We don't interact with the world as... We sometimes do, but we rarely, for example, if you want to lift a teapot, you don't say, \"Okay, the teapot is made of a hundred pieces of porcelain and let me work on this a hundred pieces.\" You look at this as one object and interact with it. So object is really important. So I was among the first researchers to identify this as a north star problem, but I think what happened is that as a student of AI and a researcher of AI, I was working on all kinds of mathematical models including neural network, including Bayesian network, including many, many models.\n\n(00:16:53):\nAnd there was one singular pain point is that these models don't have data to be trained on. And as a field, we were so focusing on these models, but it dawned on me that human learning as well as evolution is actually a big data learning process. Humans learn with so much experience constantly. In the evolution, if you look at time, animals evolve with just experiencing the world. So I think my students and I conjectured that a very critically-overlooked ingredient of bringing AI to life is big data. And then we began this ImageNet project in 2006, 2007. We were very ambitious. We want to get the entire internet's image data on objects. Now granted internet was a lot smaller than today, so I felt like that ambition was at least not too crazy. Now, it's totally delusional to think a couple of graduate student and a professor can do this.\n\n(00:18:05):\nAnd that's what we did. We curated very carefully, 15 million images on the internet, created a taxonomy of 22,000 concepts, borrowing other researchers' work like linguists work on WordNet, and it's a particular way of dictionarying words. And we combine that into ImageNet and we open-sourced that to the research community. We held an annual ImageNet challenge to encourage everybody to participate in this. We continue to do our own research, but 2012 was the moment that many people think was the beginning of the deep learning or birth of modern AI because a group of Toronto researchers led by Professor Geoff Hinton, participated in ImageNet Challenge, used ImageNet big data and two GPUs from NVIDIA and created successfully the first neural network algorithm that can...\n\n(00:19:12):\nIt didn't totally solve, but made a huge progress towards solving the problem of object recognition. And that combination of the trio technology, big data, neural network, and GPU was kind of the golden recipe for modern AI. And then fast-forward, the public moment of AI, which is the ChatGPT moment, if you look at the ingredients of what brought ChatGPT to the world technically still use these three ingredients. Now, it's internet-scale data mostly texts is a much more complex neural network architecture than 2012, but it's still neural network and a lot more GPUs, but it's still GPUs. So these three ingredients are still at the core of modern AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):\nIncredible. I have never heard that full story before. I love that it was two GPUs was the first. I love that. And now it's, I don't know, hundreds of thousands, right, that are orders of magnitude more powerful.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:20:30):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:31):\nAnd those two GPUs where they just bought, they were like gaming GPUs, they just went to the-\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:20:34):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:35):\n... GameStar that people use for playing games. As you said, this continues to be in a large way, the way models get smarter. Some of the fastest growing companies in the world right now, I've had them all mostly on the podcast, Mercor and Surge and Scale. They continue to do this for labs, just give them more and more label data of the things they're most excited and interested in.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:20:53):\nYeah, I remember Alex Wang from Scale very early days. I probably still has his emails when he was starting Scale. He was very kind. He keeps sending me emails about how image that inspired Scale. I was very pleased to see that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:08):\nOne of my other favorite takeaways from what you just shared is just such an example of high agency and just doing things that's kind of a meme on Twitter. Just you can just do things. You're just like, okay, this is probably necessary to move AI. And it's called machine learning back then, right? Was that the term most people used?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:21:25):\nI think it was interchangeably. It's true. I do remember the companies, the tech companies, I am not going to name names, but I was in a conversation in one of the early days, I think is in the middle of 2015, middle of 2016, some tech companies avoid using the word AI because they were not sure if AI was a dirty word. And I remember I was actually encouraging everybody to use the word AI because to me that is one of the most audacious question humanity has ever asked in our quest for science and technology, and I feel very proud of this term. But yes, at the beginning some people were not sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:12):\nWhat year was that roughly when AI was a dirty word?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:14):\n2016, I think because that was-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:15):\n2016, less than 10 years ago.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:18):\nThat was the changing. Some people start calling it AI, but I think if you look at the Silicon Valley tech companies, if you trace their marketing term, I think 2017-ish was the beginning of companies calling themselves AI companies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:40):\nThat's incredible. Just how the world has changed.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:43):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:43):\nNow, you can't not call yourself an AI company.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:46):\nI know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):\nJust nine-ish years later.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:22:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:49):\nOh, man. Okay. Is there anything else around the history, that early history that you think people don't know that you think is important before we chat about where you think things are going and the work that you're doing?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:23:01):\nI think as all histories, I'm keenly aware that I am recognized for being part of the history, but there are so many heroes and so many researchers. We're talking about generations of researchers. In my own world, there are so many people who have inspired me, which I talked about in my book, but I do feel our culture, especially Silicon Valley, tends to assign achievements to a single person. While I think it has value, but it's just to be remembered. AI is a field of, at this point, 70 years old and we have gone through many generations. Nobody, no one could have gotten here by themselves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:54):\nOkay, so let me ask you this question. It feels like we're always on this precipice of AGI, this kind of vague term people throw around, AGI is coming, it's going to take over everything. What's your take on how far you think we might be from AGI? Do you think we're going to get there on the current trajectory we're on? Do you think we need more breakthroughs? Do you think the current approach will get us there?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:24:13):\nYeah, this is a very interesting term, Lenny. I don't know if anyone has ever defined AGI. There are many different definitions, including some kind of superpower for machines all the way to machines can become economically viable agent in the society. In other words, making salaries to live. Is that the definition of AGI? As a scientist, I take science very seriously and I enter the field because I was inspired by this audacious question of, can machines think and do things in the way that humans can do? For me, that's always the north star of AI. And from that point of view, I don't know what's the difference between AI and AGI.\n\n(00:25:10):\nI think we've done very well in achieving parts of the goal, including conversational AI, but I don't think we have completely conquered all the goals of AI. And I think our founding fathers, Alan Turing, I wonder if Alan Turing is around today and you ask him to contrast AI versus AGI, he might just shrugged and said, \"Well, I asked the same question back in 1940s,\" so I don't want to get onto a rabbit hole of defining AI versus AGI. I feel AGI is more a marketing term than a scientific term as a scientist than technologist. AI is my north star, is my field's north star, and I'm happy people call it whatever name they want to call it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:05):\nSo let me ask you maybe this way, like you described, there's kind of these components that from ImageNet and AlexNet took us to where we're today, GPUs essentially, data, label data, just like the algorithm of the model. There's also just the transformer feels like an important step in that trajectory. Do you feel like those are the same components that'll get us to, I don't know, 10 times smarter model, something that's like life-changing for the entire world? Or do you think we need more breakthroughs? I know we're going to talk about world models, which I think is a component of this, but is there anything else that you think is like, oh, this will plateau, or okay, this will take us just need more data, more compute, more GPUs?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:26:44):\nOh no, I definitely think we need more innovations. I think scaling loss of more data, more GPUs, and bigger current model architecture is there's still a lot to be done there, but I absolutely think we need to innovate more. There's not a single deeply scientific discipline in human history that has arrived at a place that says we're done, we're done innovating and AI is one of the, if not the youngest discipline in human civilization in terms of science and technology, we're still scratching the surface. For example, like I said, we're going to segue into world models. Today, you take a model and run it through a video of a couple of office rooms and ask the model to count the number of chairs. And this is something a toddler could do or maybe an elementary school kid could do, and AI could not do that, right?\n\n(00:27:50):\nSo there's just so much AI today could not do, then let alone thinking about how did someone like Isaac Newton look at the movements of the celestial bodies and derive an equation or a set of equations that governs the movement of all bodies, that level of creativity, extrapolation, abstraction. We have no way of enabling AI to do that today. And then let's look at emotional intelligence. If you look at a student coming to a teacher's office and have a conversation about motivation, passion, what to learn, what's the problem that's really bothering you. That conversation, as powerful as today's conversational bots are, you don't get that level of emotional cognitive intelligence from today's AI. So there's a lot we can do better, and I do not believe we're done innovating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:00):\nDemis had this really interesting interview recently from DeepMind slash Google where someone asked him just like, \"What do you think, how far are we from AGI? What does it look like going through there?\" He had a really interesting way of approaching it is if we were to give the most cutting-edge model all the information until the end of the 20th century, see if it could come up with all the breakthroughs Einstein had and so far we're nowhere near that, but they could just-\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:29:22):\nNo, we're not. In fact, it's even worse. Let's give AI all the data including modern instruments data of celestial bodies, which Newton did not have, and give it to that and just ask AI to create the 17th century set of equations on the laws of bodily movements. Today's AI cannot do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:49):\nAll right. We're ways away is what I'm hearing.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:29:50):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:51):\nOkay, so let's talk about world models. To me, this is just another really amazing example of you being ahead of where people end up. So you were way ahead on, okay, we just need a lot of clean data for AI and neural networks to learn. You've been talking about this idea of world models for a long time. You started a company to build, essentially there's language models. This is a different thing. This is a world model. We'll talk about what that is. And now, as I was preparing for this Elon's talking about world models, Jensen's talking about world models, I know Google's working on this stuff. You've been at this for a long time and you actually just launched something that's going, we're going to talk about right before this podcast airs. Talk about what is a world model? Why is it so important?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:30:33):\nI'm very excited to see that more and more people are talking about world models like Elon, like Jensen. I have been thinking about really how to push AI forward all my life and the large language models that came out of the research world and then OpenAI and all this, for the past few years, were extremely inspiring even for a researcher like me. I remembered when GPT2 came out, and that was in, I think, late 2020. I was co-director, I still am, but I was at that time full-time co-director of Stanford's Human-Centered AI institute, and I remember it was... The public was not aware of the power of the large language model yet, but as researchers, we were seeing it, we're seeing the future, and I had pretty long conversations with my natural language processing colleagues like Percy Liang and Chris Manning. We were talking about how critical this technology is going to be and the Stanford AI Institute, Human-Centered AI Institute, HAI, was the first one to establish a full research center foundation model.\n\n(00:31:59):\nWe were, Percy Liang, and many researchers led the first academic paper foundation model. So it was just very inspiring for me. Of course, I come from the world of visual intelligence and I was just thinking there's so much we can push forward beyond language because humans, humans use our sense of spatial intelligence, a world understanding to do so many things and they are beyond language. Think about a very chaotic first responder scene, whether it's fire or some traffic accident or some natural disaster. And if you immerse yourself in those scene and think about how people organize themselves to rescue people, to stop further disasters, to put down fires, a lot of that is movements is spontaneous understanding of objects, worlds, human situational awareness. Language is part of that, but a lot of those situations, language cannot get you to put down the fire.\n\n(00:33:21):\nSo that is, what is that? I was thinking a lot. And in the meantime, I was doing a lot of robotics research and it dawned on me that the linchpin of connecting the additional intelligence, in addition to language embodied AI, which are robotics, connecting visual intelligence, is the sense of spatial intelligence about understanding the world. And that's when I think it was 2024, I gave a TED talk about spatial intelligence at world models. And I start formulating this idea back in 2022 based on my robotics and computer vision research. And then one thing that was really clear to me is that I really want to work with the brightest technologists and move as fast as possible to bring this technology to life. And that's when we founded this company called World Labs. And you can see the word world is in the title of our company because we believe so much in world modeling and spatial intelligence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:41):\nPeople are so used to just chatbots and that's a large language model. A simple way to understand a world model is you basically describe a scene and it generates an infinitely explorable world. We'll link to the thing you launched, which we'll talk about, but just is that a simple way to understand it?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:34:56):\nThat's part of it, Lenny. I think a simple way to understand a world model is that this model can allow anyone to create any worlds in their mind's eye by prompting whether it's an image or a sentence. And also be able to interact in this world whether you are browsing and walking or picking objects up or changing things as well as to reason within this world, for example, if the person consuming, if the agent consuming this output of the world model is a robot, it should be able to plan its path and help to tidy the kitchen, for example. So world model is a foundation that you can use to reason, to interact, and to create worlds.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:00):\nGreat. Yeah. So robots feels like that's potentially the next big focus for AI researchers and just the impact on the world. And what you're saying here is this is a key missing piece of making robots actually work in the real world, understanding how the world works.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:36:17):\nYeah. Well, first of all, I do think there's more than robots. That's exciting. But I agree with everything you just said. I think world modeling and spatial intelligence is a key missing piece of embodied AI. I also think let's not underestimate that humans are embodied agents and humans can be augmented by AI's intelligence. Just like today, humans are language animals, but we're very much augmented by AI helping us to do language tasks including software engineering. I think that we shouldn't underestimate or maybe we tend not to talk about how humans, as an embodied agents, can actually benefit so much from world models and spatial intelligence models as well as robots can.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:15):\nSo the big unlocks here, robots, which a huge deal if this works out, imagine each of us has robots doing a bunch of stuff for us, they help us with disasters, things like that. Games obviously is a really cool example, just like infinitely playable games that you just invent out of your head. And then creativity feels like just like being fun, having fun, being creative, thinking of magic, wild new worlds, and environments.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:37:39):\nAnd also design, humans design from machines to buildings to homes and also scientific discovery. There is so much. I like to use the example of the discovery of the structure of DNA. If you look at one of the most important piece in DNA's discovery history is the x-ray diffraction photo that was captured by Rosalind Franklin, and it was a flat 2D photo of a structure that it looks like a cross with diffractions. You can google those photos. But with that 2D flat photo, the humans, especially two important humans, James Watson and Francis Crick, in addition to their other information, was able to reason in 3D space and deduce a highly three-dimensional double helix structure of the DNA. And that structure cannot possibly be 2D. You cannot think in 2D and deduce that structure. You have to think in 3D spatial, use the human spatial intelligence. So I think even in scientific discovery, spatial intelligence or AI-assisted spatial intelligence is critical.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:08):\nThis is such an example of, I think it was Chris Dixon that had this line that the next big thing is going to start off feeling like a toy. When ChatGPT just came out, I remember Sam Altman just tweeted it as like, \"Here's a cool thing we're playing with, check it out.\" Now, it's the fastest growing product to all of history, changed the world. And it's oftentimes the things that just look like, okay, this is cool, that it's a fun to play with that end up changing the world most.\n\n(00:39:33):\nThis episode is brought to you by Sinch, the customer communications cloud. Here's the thing about digital customer communications. Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes, or account alerts, you need them to reach users reliably. That's where Sinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses, including 8 of the top 10 largest tech companies globally use Sinch's API to build messaging, email, and calling into their products. And there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about, Rich Communication Services or RCS. Think of RCS as SMS2.0. Instead of getting texts from a random number, your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new.\n\n(00:40:16):\nIt's a more secure and branded experience. Plus you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies. And here's why this matters, US carriers are starting to adopt RCS. Sinch is already helping major brands send RCS messages around the world and they're helping Lenny's podcast listeners get registered first before the rush hits the US market. Learn more and get started at sinch.com/lenny. That's S-I-N-C-H.com/lenny.\n\n(00:40:45):\nI reached out to Ben Horowitz, who loves what you're doing, a big fan of yours. They're investors I believe in...\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:40:51):\nYeah, we've known each other for many years, but yes, right now they're investors of World Labs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:57):\nAmazing. Okay, so I asked him what I should ask you about and he suggested ask you why is the bitter lesson alone not likely to work for robots? So first of all, just explain what the bitter lesson was in the history of AI and then just why that won't get us to where we want to be with robots.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:41:17):\nWell, first of all, there are many bitter lessons, but the bitter lessons everybody refers to is a paper written by Richard Sutton who won the Turing Award recently, and he does a lot of reinforcement learning. And Richard has said, if you look at the history, especially the algorithmic development of AI, it turns out simpler model with a ton of data always win at the end of the day instead of the more complex model with less data. I mean, that was actually... This paper came years after ImageNet. That to me was not bitter; it was a sweet lesson. That's why I built ImageNet because I believe that big data plays that role. So why can't bitter lesson work in robotics alone? Well, first of all, I think we need to give credit to where we are today. Robotics is very much in the early days of experimentation.\n\n(00:42:25):\nThe research is not nearly as mature as say language models. So many people are still experimenting with different algorithms and some of those algorithms are driven by big data. So I do think big data will continue to play a role in robotics, but what is hard for robotics, there are a couple of things. One is that it's harder to get data. It's a lot harder to get data. You can say, well, there's web data. This is where the latest robotics research is using web videos. And I think web videos do play a role. But if you think about what made language model worth a very... As someone who does computer vision and spatial intelligence and robotics, I'm very jealous of my colleagues in language because they had this perfect setup where their training data are in words, eventually tokens, and then they produce a model that outputs words.\n\n(00:43:36):\nSo you have this perfect alignment between what you hope to get, which we call objective function and what your training data looks like. But robotics is different. Even spatial intelligence is different. You hope to get actions out of robots, but your training data lacks actions in 3D worlds, and that's what robots have to do, right? Actions in 3D worlds. So you have to find different ways to fit a, what do they call, a square in a round hole, that what we have is tons of web videos. So then we have to start talking about adding supplementing data such as teleoperation data or synthetic data so that the robots are trained with this hypothesis of bitter lesson, which is large amount of data. I think there's still hope because even what we are doing in world modeling will really unlock a lot of this information for robots.\n\n(00:44:53):\nBut I think we have to be careful because we're at the early days of this and bitter lesson is still to be tested because we haven't fully figured out the data for. Another part of the bitter lesson of robotics I think we should be so realistic about is again, compared to language models or even spatial models, robots are physical systems. So robots are closer to self-driving cars than a large language model. And that's very important to recognize. That means that in order for robots to work, we not only need brains, we also need the physical body. We also need application scenarios. If you look at the history of self-driving car, my colleague Sebastian Thrun took Stanford's car to win the first DARPA challenge in 2006 or 2005. It's 20 years since that prototype of a self-driving car being able to drive 130 miles in the Nevada desert to today's Waymo and on the street of San Francisco.\n\n(00:46:17):\nAnd we're not even done yet. There's still a lot. So that's a 20-year journey. And self-driving cars are much simpler robots, they're just metal boxes running on 2D surfaces, and the goal is not to touch anything. Robot is 3D things running in 3D world, and the goal is to touch things. So the journey is going to be, there's many aspects, elements, and of course one could say, well, the self-driving car, early algorithm were pre deep learning era. So deep learning is accelerating the brains. And I think that's true. That's why I'm in robotics, that's why I'm in spatial intelligence and I'm excited by it. But in the meantime, the car industry is very mature and productizing also involves the mature use cases, supply chains, the hardware. So I think it's a very interesting time to work in these problems. But it's true, Ben is right. We might still be subject to a number of bitter lessons.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:28):\nDoing this work, do you ever just feel awe for the way the brain works and is able to do all of this for us? Just the complexity just to get a machine to just walk around and not hit things and fall, does just give you more respect for what we've already got?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:47:44):\nTotally. We operate on about 20 watts. That's dimmer than any light bulb in the room I'm in right now. And yet we can do so much. So I think actually the more I work in AI, the more I respect humans.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:03):\nLet's talk about this product you just launched. It's called Marble, a very cute name. Talk about what this is, why this is important. I've been playing with it, it's incredible. We'll link to it for folks to check it out. What is Marble?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:48:14):\nYeah, I'm very excited. So first of all, Marble is one of the first product that World Labs has rolled out. World Labs is a foundation frontier model company. We are founded by four co-founders who have deep technical history. My co-founders, Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall. We all come from the research field of AI, computer graphics, computer vision, and we believe that spatial intelligence and world modeling is as important, if not more, to language models and complementary to language models. So we wanted to seize this opportunity to create deep tech research lab that can connect the dots between frontier models with products. So Marble is an app that's built upon our frontier models. We've spent a year and plus building the world's first generative model that can output genuinely 3D worlds. That's a very, very hard problem.\n\n(00:49:30):\nAnd it was a very hard process and we have a team of incredible, founding team of incredible technologists from incredible teams. And then around just a month or two ago, we saw the first time that we can just prompt with a sentence and the image and multiple images and create worlds that we can just navigate in. If you put it on Google, which we have an option to let you do that, you can even walk around. Even though we've been building this for quite a while, it was still just awe-inspiring and we wanted to get into the hands of people who need it. And then we know that so many creators, designers, people who are thinking about robotic simulation, people who are thinking about different use cases of navigable interactable, immersive worlds game developers will find this useful. So we developed Marble as a first step. It's again, still very early, but it's the world's first model doing this, and it's the world's first product that allows people to just prompt, we call it prompt to worlds.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:00):\nWell, I've been playing around with it. It is insane. You could just have a little Shire world where you just infinitely walk around middle earth basically, and there's no one there yet, but it's insane. You just go anywhere. There's dystopian world. I'm just looking at all these examples and my favorite part, actually, I don't know if there's a feature or bug, you can see the dots of the world before it actually renders with all the textures. And I just love like, you get a glimpse into what is going on with this model, basically-\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:51:27):\nThat is so cool to hear because this is where, as a researcher, I am learning because the dots that lead you into the world was an intentional feature visualization, is not part of the model. The model actually just generates the world. But we were trying to find a way to guide people into the world, and a number of engineers worked on different versions, but we converged on the dot, and so many people, you're not the only one, told us how delightful that experience is, and it was really satisfying for us to hear that this intentional visualization feature that's not just the big hardcore model actually has delighted our users.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:19):\nWow. So you add that to make it more, like to have humans understand what's going on-\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:52:24):\nTo have fun, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:24):\n... get more delightful. Wow, that is hilarious. It makes me think about LLMs and the way they, it's not the same thing, but they talk about what they're thinking and what they're doing.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:52:32):\nYes, it is. It is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:34):\nIt also makes me think about just the Matrix. It's exactly the Matrix experience. I don't know if that was your inspiration.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:52:42):\nWell, like I said, a number of engineers worked on that. It could be their inspiration.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:48):\nIt's in their subconscious. Okay, so just for folks that may want to play around with this, maybe like, what are some applications today that folks can start using today? What's your goal with this launch?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:52:59):\nYeah, so we do believe that world modeling is very horizontal, but we're already seeing some really exciting use cases, virtual production for movies, because what they need are 3D worlds that they can align with the camera. So when the actors are acting on it, they can position the camera and shoot the segments really well. And we're already seeing incredible use. In fact, I don't know if you have seen our launch video showing Marble. It was produced by a virtual production company. We collaborated with Sony and they use Marble scenes to shoot those videos. So we were collaborating with those technical artists and directors, and they were saying, this has cut our production time by 40X. In fact, it has to-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:00):\n40X?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:53:59):\nYes, in fact it has to, because we only had one month to work on this project and there were so many things they were trying to shoot. So using Marble really, really significantly accelerated the virtual production for VFX and movies. That's one use cases. We are already seeing our users taking our Marble scene and taking the mesh export and putting games, whether it's games on VR or just fun games that they have developed. We are showing an example of robotic simulation because when I was, I mean I still am a researcher doing robotic training. One of the biggest pain point is to create synthetic data for training robots. And this synthetic data needs to be very diverse. They need to come from different environments with different objects to manipulate. And one path to it is to ask computers to simulate.\n\n(00:55:10):\nOtherwise, humans have to build every single asset for robots. That's just going to take a lot longer. So we already have researchers reaching out and wanting to use Marble to create those synthetic environments. We also have unexpected user outreach in terms of how they want to use Marble. For example, a psychologist team called us to use Marble to do psychology research. It turned out some of the psychiatric patients they study, they need to understand how their brain respond to different immersive things of different features. For example, messy scenes or clean scenes or whatever you name it. And it's very hard for researchers to get their hands on these kind of immersive scenes and it will take them too long and too much budget to create. And Marble is a really almost instantaneous way of getting so many of these experimental environments into their hands. So we're seeing multiple use cases at this point. But the VFX, the game developers, the simulation developers as well as designers are very excited.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:39):\nThis is very much the way things work in AI. I've had other AI leaders on the podcast and it's always put things out there early as soon as you can to discover where the big use cases are. The head of ChatGPT told me how, when they first put out ChatGPT, he was just scanning TikTok to see how people were using it and all the things they were talking about, and that's what convinced them where to lean in and help them see how people actually want to use it. I love this last use case for therapy. I'm just imagining heights, people dealing with heights or snakes or spiders, which-\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:57:11):\nIt's amazing. A friend of mine last night literally called me and talked about his height scare and asked me if Marble should be used. It's amazing you went straight there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:24):\nBecause imagining all the exposure therapy stuff, this could be so good for that. That is so cool. Okay, so I should have asked you this before, but I think there's going to be a question of just, how does this differ from things like VO3 and other video generation models? It's pretty clear to me, but I think it might be helpful just to explain how this is different from all the video AI tools people have seen.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (00:57:46):\nWorld Labs' thesis is that spatial intelligence is fundamentally very important, and spatial intelligence is not just about videos. In fact, the world is not passively watching videos passing by. I love, Plato has the allegory of the cave analogy to describe vision. He said that imagine a prisoner tied on his chair, not very humane, but in a cave watching a full life theater in front of him, but the actual life theater that actors are acting is behind his back. It was just lit so that the projection of the action is on a wall of the cave. And then the goal, the task of this prisoner is to figure out what's going on. It's a pretty extreme example, but it really shows, it describes what vision is about, is that to make sense of the 3D world or 4D world out of 2D. So spatial intelligence to me is deeper than only creating that flat 2D world.\n\n(00:59:14):\nSpatial intelligence to me is the ability to create, reason, interact, make sense of deeply spatial world, whether it's 2D or 3D or 4D, including dynamics and all that. So World Lab is focusing on that, and of course the ability to create videos per se could be part of this. And in fact, just a couple of weeks ago, we rolled out the world's first real time demoable, real-time video generation on a single H100 GPU. So part of our technology includes that, but I think Marble is very different because we really want creators, designers, developers to have in their hands a model that can give them worlds with 3D structures so they can use it for their work. And that's why Marble is so different.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:21):\nThe way I see it is it's a platform for a ton of opportunity to do stuff. As you described, videos are just like, here's a one-off video that's very fun and cool and you could... And that's it. That's it. And you move on.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:00:33):\nBy the way, we could in Marble, we could allow people to export in video forms. So you could actually, like you said, you go into a world, so let's say it's a hobbit cave. You can actually, especially as a creator, you have such a specific way of moving the camera in a trajectory in the director's mind, and then you can export that from Marble into a video.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:02):\nWhat does it take to create something like this? Just how big is the team, how many GPUs you work in? Anything you can share there. I don't know how much of this is private information, but just what does it take to create something like this that you've launched here?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:01:12):\nIt takes a lot of brain power. So we just talk about 20 watts per brain. So from that point of view, it's a small number, but it's actually incredible. It's half billion years of evolution to give us those power. We have a team of 30-ish people now, and we are predominantly researchers and research engineers, but we also have designers and product. We actually really believe that we want to create a company that's anchored in the deep tech of spatial intelligence, but we are actually building serious products. So we have this integration of R&D and productization, and of course, we use a ton of GPUs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:15):\nThat's the technical thing.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:02:17):\nHappy to hear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:20):\nWell, congrats on the launch. I know this is a huge milestone. I know this took a ton of work.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:02:20):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:23):\nSo I just want to say congrats to you and your team. Let me talk about your founder journey for a moment. So you're a founder of this company. You started how many years ago? A couple of years ago, two, three years ago?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:02:23):\nA year ago.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:33):\nA year ago?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:02:34):\nA year plus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:37):\nA year? Okay. Wow.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:02:37):\nProbably, 18 month, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:38):\nOkay. What's something you wish you knew before you started this that you wish you could whisper into the ear of Fei-Fei of 18 months ago?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:02:46):\nWell, I continue to wish I know the future of technology. I think actually that's one of our founding advantage is that we see the future earlier in general than most people. But still, man, this is so exciting and so amazing that what's unknown and what's coming, but I know the reason you're asking me this question is not about the future of technology. Furthermore, look, I did not start a company of this scale at 20-year-old. So I started a dry cleaner when I was 19, but that's a little smaller scale.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:30):\nWe got to talk about that.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:03:32):\nAnd then I founded Google Cloud AI and then I founded an institute at Stanford but those are different beasts. I did feel I was a little more prepared as a founder of the grinding journey compared to maybe the 20-year-old founders. But I still, I'm surprised, and it puts me into paranoia sometimes that how intensely competitive AI landscape is from the model, the technology itself, as well as talents. And when I founded the company, we did not have these incredible stories of how much certain talents would cost. So these are things that continue to surprise me and I have to be very alert about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:40):\nSo the competition you're talking about is the competition for talent, the speed at which just how things are moving.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:04:46):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:47):\nYeah. You mentioned this point that I want to come back to that if you just look over the course of your career, you were at all of the major collections of humans that led to so many of the breakthroughs that are happening today. Obviously, we talk about ImageNet also just SAIL at Stanford is where a lot of the work happened, Google Cloud, which a lot of the breakthroughs happened. What brought you to those places? Like for people looking for how to advance in their career, be at the center of the future, just is there a through line there of just what pulled you from place to place and pulled you into those groups that might be helpful for people to hear?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:05:25):\nYeah, this is actually a great question, Lenny, because I do think about it, and obviously we talked about it's curiosity and passion that brought me to AI, that is more a scientific north star, right? I did not care if AI was a thing or not, so that was one part. But how did I end up choosing in the particular places I work in, including starting World Labs, is I think I'm very grateful to myself or maybe to my parents' genes. I'm an intellectually very fearless person, and I have to say when I hire young people, I look for that because I think that's a very important quality if one wants to make a difference, is that when you want to make a difference, you have to accept that you're creating something new or you're diving into something new. People haven't done that. And if you have that self-awareness, you almost have to allow yourself to be fearless and to be courageous.\n\n(01:06:42):\nSo when I, for example, came to Stanford, in the world of academia, I was very close to this thing called tenure, which is have the job forever at Princeton. But I chose to come to Stanford because... I love Princeton. It's by alma mater. It's just at that moment there are people who are so amazing at Stanford and the Silicon Valley ecosystem was so amazing that I was okay to take a risk of restarting my tenure clock. Becoming the first female director of SAIL, I was actually relatively speaking a very young faculty at that time, and I wanted to do that because I care about that community. I didn't spend too much time thinking about all the failure cases.\n\n(01:07:46):\nObviously, I was very lucky that the more senior faculty supported me, but I just wanted to make a difference. And then going to Google was similar. I wanted to work with people like Jeff Dean, Jeff Hinton, and all these incredible demists, the incredible people. The same with World Labs. I have this passion. And I also believe that people with the same mission can do incredible things. So that's how it guided my through line. I don't overthink of all possible things that can go wrong because that's too many.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:33):\nI feel like an important element of this is not focusing on the downside, focusing more on the people, the mission. What gets you excited, what do you think, the curiosity.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:08:43):\nYeah. I do want to say one thing to all the young talents in AI, the engineers, the researchers out there, because some of you apply to World Labs, I feel very privileged you considered World Labs. I do find many of the young people today think about every single aspect of an equation when they decide on jobs. At some point, maybe that's the way they want to do it, but sometimes I do want to encourage young people to focus on what's important because I find myself constantly in mentoring mode when I talk to job candidates. Not necessarily recruiting or not recruiting, but just in mentoring mode when I see an incredible young talent who is over-focusing on every minute dimension and aspect of considering a job, when maybe the most important thing is where's your passion? Do you align with the mission? Do you believe and have faith in this team? And just focus on the impact and you can make and the kind of work and team you can work with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:05):\nYeah, it's tough. It's tough for people in the AI space. Now there's so much, so much at them, so much new, so much happening, so much FOMO.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:10:11):\nThat's true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:12):\nI could see the stress. And so I think that advice is really important. Just like what will actually make you feel fulfilled in what you're doing, not just where's the fastest growing company, where's the... Who's going to win? I don't know. I want to make sure I ask you about the work you're doing today at Stanford, at the HCI. I think it's the-\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:10:12):\nHAI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:30):\nHAI, Human-Centered AI Institute. What are you doing there? I know this is a thing you do on the side still.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:10:36):\nSo yes, HAI, Human-Centered AI Institute was co-founded by me and a group of faculty like Professor John Etchemendy, Professor James Landay, Professor Chris Manning back in 2018. I was actually finishing my last sabbatical at Google and it was a very, very important decision for me because I could have stayed in industry, but my time at Google taught me one thing is AI is going to be a civilization of technology. And it dawned on me how important this is to humanity to the point that I actually wrote a piece in New York Times, that year 2018, to talk about the need for a guiding framework to develop and to apply AI. And that framework has to be anchored in human benevolence, in human centeredness. And I felt that Stanford, one of the world's top university in the heart of Silicon Valley that gave birth to important companies from NVIDIA to Google, should be a thought leader to create this human-centered AI framework and to actually embody that in our research education and policy and ecosystem work.\n\n(01:12:10):\nSo I founded HAI. Fast-forward, after six, seven years, it has become the world's largest AI institute that does human-centered research, education, ecosystem, outreach, and policy impact. It involves hundreds of faculty across all eight schools at Stanford, from medicine to education, to sustainability to business, to engineering, to humanities to law. And we support researchers, especially at the interdisciplinary area from digital economy, to legal studies, to political science, to discovery of new drugs, to new algorithms to that's beyond transformers. We also actually put a very strong focus on policy because when we started HAI, I realized that Silicon Valley did not talk to Washington DC and or Brussels or other parts of the world.\n\n(01:13:27):\nAnd given how important this technology is, we need to bring everybody on board. So we created multiple programs from congressional bootcamp to AI index report to policy briefing, and we especially participated in policymaking including advocating for a national AI research cloud bill that was passed in the first Trump administration and participating in state level regulatory AI discussions. So there's a lot we did, and I continue to be one of the leaders even though I'm much less involved operationally because I care not only we create this technology, but we use it in the right way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:24):\nWow. I was not aware of all that other work you were doing. As you're talking, I was reminded Charlie Munger had this quote, \"Take a simple idea and take it very seriously.\" I feel like you've done that in so many different ways and stayed with it and it's unbelievable the impact that you've had in so many ways over the years. I'm going to skip the lightning round and I'm just looking to ask you one last question. Is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:14:52):\nI am very excited by AI, Lenny. I want to answer one question that when I travel around the world, everybody asks me is that, if I'm a musician, if I'm a teacher, middle school teacher, if I'm a nurse, if I'm an accountant, if I'm a farmer, do I have a role in AI or is AI just going to take over my life or my work? And I think this is the most important question of AI and I find that in Silicon Valley, we tend not to speak heart-to-heart with people, with people like us and not like us in Silicon Valley, but all of us, we tend to just toss around words like infinite productivity or infinite leisure time or infinite power or whatever. But at the end of the day, AI is about people. And when people ask me that question, it's a resounding yes, everybody has a role in AI.\n\n(01:16:03):\nIt depends on what you do and what you want. But no technology should take away human dignity and the human dignity and agency should be at the heart of the development, the deployment, as well as the governance of every technology. So if you are a young artist and your passion is storytelling, embrace AI as a tool. In fact, embrace Marble. I hope it becomes a tool for you because the way you tell your story is unique and the world still needs it. But how you tell your story, how do you use the most incredible tool to tell your story in the most unique way is important. And that voice needs to be heard. If you are a farmer near retirement, AI still matters because you are a citizen. You can participate in your community, you should have a voice in how AI is used, how AI is applied.\n\n(01:17:14):\nYou work with people that you can encourage all of you to use AI to make life easier for you. If you are a nurse, I hope you know that at least in my career, I have worked so much in healthcare research because I feel our healthcare workers should be greatly augmented and helped by AI technology, whether it's smart cameras to feed more information or robotic assistance because our nurses are overworked, overfatigued, and as our society ages, we need more help for people to be taken care of. So AI can play that role. So I just want to say that it's so important that even a technologist like me are sincere about that everybody has a role in AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:17):\nWhat a beautiful way to end it. Such a tie back to where we started about how it's up to us and take individual responsibility for what AI will do in our lives. Final question, where can folks find Marble? Where can they go, maybe try to join World Labs if they want to? What's the website? Where do people go?\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:18:34):\nWell, World Labs website is www.worldlabs.ai and you can find our research progress there. We have technical blogs. You can find Marble, the product there. You can sign in there. You can find our job posts link there. We're in San Francisco. We love to work with the world's best talents.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:02):\nAmazing. Fei-Fei, thank you so much for being here.\n\nDr. Fei Fei Li (01:19:04):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:06):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:19:09):\nThank you so much for listening.
