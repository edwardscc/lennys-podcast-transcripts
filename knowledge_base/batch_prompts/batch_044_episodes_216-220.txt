What happens when we're building a product? Same thing, right? We want this product to be for everyone, but we've learned with product market fit that doesn't work. We need a narrow, clear focus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nHow did you realize this is a really powerful method versus the way people normally look for jobs?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:00:16):\nWhile it's hard to figure out your candidate market fit, it's also a relief to know it's not about you. So what I ask people to do is I ask them to think about what they want and what they don't want. Now, you might not think that that's a radical step, Lenny, but most people don't do that. When they get laid off, they spray and pray.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):\nThis is very much like a product person thinks about new product.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:00:34):\nThere's no I in team. Well, there is an I in village, and the I in village is that when you start to interview and negotiate, you've got to be in charge. I want you to play to win, not not to lose.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):\nIs there anything else that you think might be helpful to people looking for jobs?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:00:49):\nIf someone did this, it would blow my mind. I would hire them on the spot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):\nToday my guest is Phyl Terry. Phyl is the author of Never Search Alone, which I've seen so many people reference as the most impactful thing they read for helping them find a job. Once you listen to this episode, you'll see why.\n\n(00:01:09):\nPrior to this book, Phyl was on the founding team of the first company that Amazon acquired back in the '90s, and then was CEO of the pioneering product and customer experience consulting firm Creative Good for over 15 years, where Phyl and the team had companies like Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and hundreds of other companies as customers. Phyl also co-authored Customers Included, has written articles for the Harvard Business Review, and has delivered more than 500 keynotes to companies like Apple and Microsoft. This episode is for anyone struggling to find a job or unhappy in the job that they're in. I promise you, the time you put into listening to this episode will help you find a job that you love.\n\n(00:01:47):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Phyl, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:02:05):\nOh, what a pleasure. I'm such a fan of yours, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:08):\nI'm thrilled to be here.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:02:09):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:10):\nI'm a huge fan of yours, and I think by the end of this I'll be an even bigger fan of yours. What I'm hoping that we can do in our chat today is to help people who are struggling to find a job and especially struggling to find a job they love, actually find that job with actual tips that they can use today in this week. How does that feel to you?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:02:29):\nThat's great. We have some practical time-tested stuff that I've developed over the last 25 years with leaders in Silicon Valley, especially in the product community. We've really brought a product lens to reinventing the job search, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:41):\nThis is a perfect Venn diagram of topics then.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:02:43):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:45):\nThere's a lot of ways I can approach this. I want to start with a question about something that you run, something that you created, something that has had a lot of impact on a lot of people: Job Search Councils. What is a Job Search Council?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:02:56):\nIt's a support group of six to eight job seekers, so product people, but it is not just for product people, but the product community really owns this, it comes out of the product community. And what they do is they commit to being with each other, to supporting each other, go through the process of looking for a job and I lay out a methodology, how to figure out your candidate market fit, one of the big concepts in the book. As well as how to play to win, not not to lose. You know what I mean? People are scared in the job search. Here's the thing, Lenny, that people really have a hard time believing, everyone, I mean everyone, and I work with some of the most senior people in Silicon Valley, I'm talking about CEOs of public companies, I'm talking about chief product officers, VPs of product at great brands, everyone, no matter who they are, Lenny, feels insecure and anxious in the job search. And if you do it alone, it magnifies that.\n\n(00:03:57):\nSo with Job Search Councils, there's this great hack, I didn't invent this, it's baked into human psychology, if you put anxious people together and ask them to be open and vulnerable and to ask for help, and we'll come back to asking for help, it actually flips the anxiety and the fear into hope, into motivation, into accountability and confidence. It's like, \"What [inaudible 00:04:20]?\" It's fantastic. My mother taught me this, we can talk about her at some point, but it's really powerful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:28):\nThat's amazing. Your whole book is called Never Search Alone, so the whole premise of how you recommend people look for jobs is to look for jobs with other people. You mentioned maybe it's your mom, maybe it's something else, how did you realize this is a really powerful method versus the way people normally look for jobs?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:04:44):\nYeah. I set up my first council more than four years ago. I set up the first CEO council for internet CEOs in the mid '90s, and then I've run product and CEO council since. But it goes all the way back to my mom. 1960, Lenny, 1960, what is that? 64 years ago? In the San Fernando Valley, my mom was a newly-minted elementary school teacher, and she put together a council of teachers. That group met for 50 years, 5-0, until the year she died. They worked together to ask for help and support each other in their careers. And Lenny, people say to me, \"Does this Never Search Alone method work in a tough job market?\" And I'll tell you, it comes out of tough job markets. Absolutely, yes. Starting with my mom.\n\n(00:05:39):\nSo in 1974, my dad... in 1976 he left and it was just me and my mom and my sister. He had insisted that she stop teaching, so she lost her tenure and everything. Her candidate market fit was terrible, but she had her council. It was the mid '70s, and Lenny, you probably can't imagine how hard it was for a single middle-aged woman with kids looking for a job in Los Angeles in the mid '70s. It was terrible. But she had her support group and they held her hand. The job she could get, guess what? She had to be an entry level teacher again after having been a senior teacher coaching and advising. It was really tough. So that had a big impact on me.\n\n(00:06:22):\nAnd then when the dotcom bubble burst, I was running Creative Good, and suddenly there was a depression. And suddenly I'm helping hundreds of people try to figure out their job search. So it's been going for a number of years, but it goes back to my mom. I dedicate the book to her and the community we've built.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:40):\nThat's beautiful.\n\n(00:06:42):\nLet me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The most successful people that I know surround themselves with incredible peers. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut-check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This gives you more than a leg up, it gives you a leap forward. Having a group of trusted and amazing peers was key to my career growth, and this is the Sidebar ethos.\n\n(00:07:08):\nBut it's hard to build this trusted group of peers on your own. Sidebar is a platform for senior tech professionals, director to C-level, to advance in their career. Members are matched into peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation all running on Sidebar's technology, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your career journey. If you're listening to this podcast, you're already committed to growth. Sidebar is the missing piece to catalyze your career. 93% of members say Sidebar helped them achieve a significant positive change in their career.

You touched a little bit this idea of settling, figuring out what to settle for. Your mom took a job that's below what she was doing before, so I want to chat about all these things. A little bit more on these councils. What's the scale of these? So I think it's going to blow people's mind just how many of these are happening and [inaudible 00:09:16]-\n\nPhyl Terry (00:09:15):\nWe have launched more than 2,000 of these Lenny, 2,000, and they're completely free, completely 100% free. It's volunteer-driven. We have hundreds of pages of tools. We've done a Slack community. We have a free matching program. You can sign up and we'll match you and put you in a council. Then we'll give you training, live training. There's so many volunteers. We have 20,000 hours of volunteer work that's already been put into this, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:42):\nYou said that it's free. I know these things aren't free to run.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:09:46):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:47):\nI saw somewhere that you mentioned that basically all your book sales and also just your own money you spend on running these councils. Talk about that for a little bit.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:09:55):\nYeah, actually two times the book sales are going into running this. So we have 20,000 hours of volunteer time, but you also have to pay for technology and you have to pay for certain kinds of support. Later we will talk about this, and we're always looking for more volunteers. I have a process for people to apply if they're interested in being a part of the team. But yeah, I have dedicated this to my mom, and I'm giving everything to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:25):\nWhat's the general structure? If someone's trying to think about how these things work, if they want to join these as we go through it, how do they work?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:10:31):\nOkay, so you apply at phyl.org, P-H-Y-L, Phyl with a Y. Again, it's free. We match you behind the scenes. Now, when you apply, we ask, \"First of all, are you in a job and looking or are you out of work?\" Because we separate those two because they have different cadences. If you're in a job and looking, we call you a slow seeker because you have a full-time job and you can't work as quickly. If you're out of work and looking, we call you a fast seeker and we put you in different groups. Fast seeker or slow seeker. We also ask though, are you willing to be a moderator? Every council needs a moderator, and every moderator is a job seeker who volunteers to do that. If you volunteer to moderate, first of all, you get matched faster, and secondly, you get more training and support.\n\n(00:11:18):\nIt's a little bit more work for a lot more benefit. We've gotten 2,000 moderators, Lenny, it's amazing. And we feel like we're just beginning. So you apply, you get matched, and then you go through an orientation program that we run live where we tell you how this works and what to expect in your first meeting. And then there's a whole set of agendas and materials and everything in the book as well as everyone gets a free workbook, a 100-page workbook after they join the community with all of the templates and guides and questions. And then the moderator pulls you together, you work on Zoom or whatever technology, it's remote typically. And you do a first meeting, we call it meeting zero, where you're open and vulnerable. People share stories about their lives and who they are, builds trust and get a sense of who people are. And then you move into the process. You meet twice a week typically if you're in a fast seeker council and every two weeks if you're in a slow seeker. So that's the start of the answer. Does that help you think?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):\nYeah, really helpful. And then you basically are on this council until you find a job, I imagine.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:12:26):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:27):\nAwesome.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:12:28):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:28):\nIs there anything you can share around the impact you've seen? The reason I reached out to you to come on this podcast is I just started seeing people mentioning that they found a job and maybe the thing that helped them most was your book and being on one of these councils. I imagine there's a lot of stories you hear and a lot of numbers you could see of just people succeeding going through, so what can you share about just the impact you've seen?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:12:51):\nWell, I posted on LinkedIn today that I was going to be on your podcast and I asked people if they wanted to share stories with me, and over email and LinkedIn, I've been flooded with stories from people who are in the process or people who did it. If you like, I can pull up and share a few of those if that would be helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:09):\nYeah, if there's a few you have there, that'd be really sweet.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:13:12):\nOkay, so Justin Meats is a chief product officer who's gone through the process and he posted on LinkedIn today. He said, \"As a product leader, I love how it has you apply the product process to your career.\" This comes out of the product world, it's a product lens on the job search, and it's for everyone, but it really makes sense for product people. And he says, \"Not only does your JSC help bounce ideas and help your job search, they also help you keep going and accountable when you're low on emotional energy.\"\n\n(00:13:46):\nI talk about this in the book, Lenny, I say, \"Look, most people think, 'What's the most important thing to manage during your job search?'\" They think, well, maybe it's their resume or LinkedIn profile or their ability to network or candidate market fit, a concept I introduced I think is really important. All those things are really important, but the most important thing to manage is your emotional balance. I talk about your emotional balance sheet. And for many job seekers, they have more liabilities than assets on their old balance sheets. They have more fear and anxiety, they feel demoralized, they have a hard time going. That's why these things are so important.\n\n(00:14:24):\nHe also says, \"Hey, it's a journey, and the more you embrace it, the more you learn about yourself.\" And he says... and this is important Lenny. I don't have a magic wand that especially in a down market today that magically gets a job. It's hard. The job search, it can be hard and humiliating at times. I know. This is why I want to create this community, why we're doing this. We want to give you a place where you can really get the support when it's hard and humiliating. But the process will ultimately set you up for success if you follow it.\n\n(00:14:58):\nThis one woman who just started, she's a senior product leader in a major financial institution, and she said she couldn't believe the level of support and openness and vulnerability. We really emphasize people being open and vulnerable, and I've learned a lot about how to create that environment. It ties back to asking for help, which I know we'll talk about more at some point. But when you create that, it's amazing what people can do together, Lenny. Amazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:31):\nJust to reinforce this point, people listening may be like, \"I'm just going to keep looking for a job. I'll use all this advice. I don't need a group.\" What's your best pitch, again, to help people see the value of doing this in a group and joining a council or starting a council?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:15:45):\nI acknowledge that that's a reaction that some people have. That's totally valid. This is unusual, what we're doing here. This is not how people look for a job. We're trying to disrupt the job search process. Lenny, this is my quick story. We had a great interview with a couple. Two of them were product leaders. They had met at Amazon and then had gone to have great careers. They both got laid off. The woman joined a Job Search Council right away. She loved it, she raved about it. Her husband, who was also an engineer, was a little more introverted. He's like, \"Ah, this isn't for me.\" She said, \"No, listen, you won't... \" And finally he read the book. Because the book, it works for the product mind and for the engineering mind, it makes sense. He said, \"I'll join a council, but I'm not going to be field connected to people. But I'll do this because you asked me to.\"\n\n(00:16:43):\nHe sat in the interview, we have it up on the side, he was like, \"Oh my God, I couldn't believe it. The level of trust we created right off the bat I've never experienced in my life. It's really truly accountability, the motivation, the ability to hang in there.\" And so I say to people, \" Look, try it.\" We have all these videos on our website with all these people talking. Go look at it. If you want to read the book first and see if you think this makes sense. But try it. You will be shocked in a positive way. You'll discover how delightful it is.\n\n(00:17:25):\nWe live in a world where there's increasing loneliness, Lenny. There's so much research about this, the Surgeon General's book, everybody talking about... And it's more detrimental to our health than smoking cigarettes. Bowling Alone famously came out 25 years ago. We live in a world where people have not experienced community in a powerful way. I don't mean message boards, I mean real community. And I think you have a sense of this because you do real community. And that's what we're talking about here. It's real community but with some practical tools and techniques, which we'll talk about. What do you think? Is that a good response to the-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:08):\nI'm sold. I don't need a job, but I want to join one. You also just had a really beautiful way of describing these programs as a safety net for people.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:18:16):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:16):\nDoes that ring a bell?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:18:18):\nIf we go up to the 30,000-foot level, what are we doing here? What's our mission? We're building a private safety net for all those who've been laid off or let go. Look, we're not going to do what the government does with unemployment insurance, we're never going to be able to do something like that. But the government's never going to be able to innovate around how to actually look for a job. That's where we come in. We are trying to build this. We talked about this earlier, Lenny, creative destruction is this economic concept that sits at the heart of capitalism. Creative destruction basically says, \"Under capitalism, it's dynamic. New products and services displace or disrupt old products and services, companies and methods.\" It's why our economy has grown sixfold over the last a hundred years. It's remarkable. It's why we have this amazing multi-trillion dollar economy. But it comes with some negative unintended consequences, which is that people both in jobs and out of jobs, they're anxious and fearful. There's no program that addresses that.\n\n(00:19:20):\nThat's what we're going after here. We're trying to be the solve for the unintended consequences of the thing that is so positive in many ways and that we as product people love because we get to build new products and displace old products. I'll just say one more thing. The reason you know this creative destruction works so well is if you compare our economy to the late Soviet Union's economy. They were a planned economy with no creative destruction. So there was no innovation, and eventually it just failed. It just collapsed. It's remarkable, this is a huge country with a massive military and nuclear weapons, but they couldn't make their economy work. Why? Because they didn't have this element. So it's something to celebrate, but as we celebrate it, we need to have something that addresses the negative unintended consequences. All of us who benefited from this, I think it's our duty to do something about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):\nThat is beautiful. You're very good at this. Let's shift to talking about tactics. Let's talk about some of the things that you've shared. So you've mentioned things like candidate market fit, playing to win. Go wherever you want to go. Let's pick a few and then dive in.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:20:29):\nCandidate market fit is probably the most important job search tactic in the book, aside from the Job Search Council, and it may be the thing I'm known for. When I die, they coin candidate market fit. So here's the thing, and this is why this is so important in a down market, when you're looking for a job, you're in a marketplace with supply and demand characteristics. So if there's a lot of supply, which there is right now in the tech world because there's been a lot of layoffs, the overall economy, there's been net job additions, Lenny, but those have been primarily in healthcare and government. There've been net job losses in tech. We could talk about why that is, but that's the world that we're in.\n\n(00:21:17):\nSo let's say you're a director of product. Two years ago when the economy was great in tech and the job market was great in tech, you could probably get a VP of product role. What about today? Well, today your candidate market fit's been pushed down because there's a bunch of VPs of products who are going to take a director role. Guess what? That means you might not be able to get the director role you might need to get a senior manager role or whatever. Now, the important thing about this is it's not a personal segment about you. It's the marketplace. And that's what so many people today in their notes to me said, that it was such a relief for them. While it's hard to figure out your candidate market fit, it's also a relief to know it's not about you.\n\n(00:21:59):\nSo what I ask people to do is the first radical step I ask them to take is to think about what they want and what they don't want. Now, you might not think that that's a radical step, Lenny, but most people don't do that. When they get laid off, they spray and pray. That's the typical, \"Let me just... \" Wait a minute, just take a moment. They're like, \"Oh, don't slow me down.\" I'm like, \"I'm going to slow you down to go fast.\" In fact, what our data shows is that the average job search in the Job Search Council from beginning to end is three months. If you look at the national data for job search, it's three to six months. So we are at the very low end of the national average. So this is not a slow down, take two years, whatever. No, no. Most people need to put food on the plate, so it's a slow down at first. And we as product people should understand this. You want to think about your strategy. You want to understand the marketplace, your customer, the product market fit. You're not going to just go...\n\n(00:22:59):\nYou're going to iterate. First step, what do you want and what don't you want? That's the Mnookin two-pager named after Allison Mnookin, who was a member of one of our product councils. So we run product councils and general management CEO councils for people in jobs. That's a paid program that companies pay for. It's out of that program helping those people that I developed this methodology that we're now as a community giving to the world. So Allison, she was the GM at Intuit, and then she spun out a division and ran it as CEO, and she's now a professor at the Harvard Business School. And about 15 years ago, she was in transition and we talked and she created and we created this thing we called now the Mnookin two-pager. I told her, \"Allison, I'm going to make your name famous.\" That's my job. I love her.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:46):\nGreat name.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:23:46):\nShe's wonderful. And it's just a simple thing, what do you, what don't you like and you create it and then you share it in your council. And here's something cool, Lenny. Let's say you and I are in a Job Search Council. You share yours, I share your mine. Now you see a few things about what you don't like. I'm like, \"Hot damn, I also don't like those. I forgot, I got to add that.\" Or you say a thing about what you like, you're like, \"Oh, wow, no, that's really important to me, and I left that out.\" So that's part of the shared learning environment. I'm asking you to do these, but with others who you're walking it through.\n\n(00:24:16):\nNow, once you have done that Mnookin two-pager, and it's a draft, you don't have to get it fine, and not everyone knows exactly what they want, by the way, this is important, especially younger people. But sometimes mid-career people too, they're like, \"Oh, I'm not... \" So I'm not asking you to make a final decision, no, no. We're going to iterate. Okay, we're product people, we're going to iterate.\n\n(00:24:38):\nSo we're going to take this Mnookin two-pager, this draft that shared with our council, and we're going to go out and do a listening tour. Because guess what? In the job search, we're the product. We're our skills and experience. That's the product that we're bringing to market. So we have to go see what the market wants. Now we have a sense of what we want, but what does the market want and what does some of our trusted friends, what do they think about what I want and what I'm a fit for? And what do they think I'm a fit for now given the market conditions that we have?\n\n(00:25:09):\nI will tell you, people are terrified to do the listening tour. They're like, \"I don't know, what am I going to hear from people?\" Because I asked them to ask a golden question, if you were in my shoes, how would you approach this? I call that the golden question. It's such a creative question. It really opens the conversation. But they think, \"Oh no, people are going to tell me all this stuff.\" No, mostly people tell you this. Once in a while you get a helpful piece of critique, \"Oh, you make everything a priority, in which case nothing is, and you could work on that.\" Super helpful to know. We all have stuff to work on.\n\n(00:25:43):\nBut I will tell you, once people do the listening tour, they're blown away. I mean, the people who are in jobs, they love, they love helping others if it's done well. Because guess what? They're also anxious themselves, and they want to give back. They want to feel like they're supporting people. You actually end up, and we're going to talk about this, but when you ask someone for help while you've done your homework, you're thoughtful, they want to help you even more. They become invested in you. So the secret about the listening tour is that not only are you getting market research customer feedback on your fit, you're also creating a whole group of listening posts, people who are invested in your success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:33):\nJust to clarify on that specific point of this listening tour, you write this Mnookin two pager, which basically describes what you want, what you don't want, goals you have, what you hate. And the listening tour is find colleagues, friends, people that are other, say, product managers and get their feedback on what you want, what you don't want, what you hate, what your goals are.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:26:54):\nAnd what they're seeing in the market, what they think you're a fit for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:56):\nI see. Got it. So it's like, \"Oh, this is unrealistic. You're not going to get this.\"\n\nPhyl Terry (00:27:00):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:00):\nLooking for that [inaudible 00:27:02]-\n\nPhyl Terry (00:27:01):\nAnd we see both things, Lenny. So some people underestimate their fit, others overestimate it or don't recognize that changed market condition. The other thing I'll say is that in the book I have three different kinds of structured listening tour conversations. One I call reverse exit interviews. This is people you used to work with before, go ask them, \"Hey, what did I do well, what do you think my strengths are? What do you think I'm a fit for? Here's what I'm thinking. Do you think I accurately am projecting myself?\" The second is your broader network, and that's where I ask you to do the golden question, \"If you were in my shoes... \" And then third is recruiters.\n\n(00:27:43):\nNow, this is an important hack. Recruiters don't like being barraged with, \"Get me a job.\" They do like someone saying, \"Hey, what do you think I'm a fit for?\" asking their advice. And this is especially true if you pre-\n\nPhyl Terry (00:28:03):\nAnd this is especially true if you've pre-built a relationship with a recruiter. So anyone listening to your podcast right now, if you're in a job, I have a really important message for you. When that recruiter calls, pick up the phone even if you don't want the job, help them, network with them, introduce them to other people, and build that relationship, because whether you lose a job or whether you decide to start looking when you're in work, you want that relationship.\n\n(00:28:29):\nNow, Lenny, there's a problem many people haven't done that. Okay? So part of what we're doing with the Never Search Alone community is we're building a recruiter network. We're finding recruiters who are willing to, in a protected way, do a couple of conversations a month, helping people think about their candidate market fit. And if anyone listening to the show is a recruiter, please come join us and volunteer. We need more recruiters. I know many of you want to give back and you don't know how. You tell me this. Here's a way to give it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:01):\nMm-hmm. Love that. Okay, and so the intent of this is that you're trying to figure out, one, what does the market want, and how do I be honest about what it wants because what you want may not exist right now, and then, two, help you refine your pitch and how you're approaching and who you're talking to. Is there anything else that comes out of doing this exercise? Because I think people might be hearing this, like, \"Ah, so much work. I have enough work to do, all these interviews. Got to reach out to people. I got kids and a family. I have to write this two-pager now and listening tour.\" What other benefits do you get out of this, doing this exercise?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:29:37):\nYou build those relationships. You turn people on as listening posts, so you light up your network in a way that you... If you just send an email saying, \"I want a job,\" or if you just go, \"Hey, do you have a job for me,\" people don't know what to say. But if you say, \"Hey, if you're in my shoes, how would you approach this, and what do you think if you were me I should be looking for, and what are you seeing in the market,\" they love that, and now they're really thinking about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):\nAnd if they see a job that might be a fit, they tell you about it.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:30:07):\nThey tell you about it. Yeah, and that gets to candidate... Because at the end of this, we're going to create a very simple, narrow, focus candidate market fit statement at the end of listening tour.\n\n(00:30:17):\nSo once you've now done this listening tour, now you need to create a focus candidate market fit, and this is tough. Look, again, this is why you need a job search council. You need them to be there with you during the listening tour. Not every listening tour conversation will be a home-run. Once in a while it'll be a dud. I talk about this in the book, like, \"Warning there are some curves ahead.\" You could have a conversation... A number of women that I have worked with over the years who've gone and done conversations and they've gotten frankly sexist feedback... It was not helpful. \"You're too poised,\" or \"You're not poised enough.\" It's just this strange set of stuff. So you need your council to help you parse out and interpret what people are telling you.\n\n(00:31:02):\nAnd at the end of this listening tour, and it never really ends, but once you've done 10 or 15 and you're ready to say, \"Okay, I'm going to take a stab at my candidate market fit,\" now you need your job search council because you're going to want... Every bone in your body is going to want that to be expansive, to want it to be broad. Remember, we're product people, at least those of us in Lenny's podcast community; what happens when we're building a product? Same thing, right? We want this product to be for everyone, but we've learned with product market fit, that doesn't work. We need a narrow, clear focus. Same thing with candidate market fit. So I say to people, and we have this whole grid that we give them, \"I'm looking for a director of product role in a healthcare, series B startup in San Francisco,\" like \"Bing, bing, bing,\" and people say, \"Oh, if it's so narrow, I'm going to lose...\" And here's the thing, when you're looking for a job, you need a spear and not a net. With a net, everything slips through.\n\n(00:32:08):\nNow, part two to this, people are expansive, but not reductive. What are you talking about, Phyl? Here's what I mean. If you give them a specific... If I say to you, \"Lenny, I'm looking for a director of product role at a healthcare startup that's a series B in San Francisco,\" well, if you see another FinTech startup that's in a heavily regulated industry looking for a director of product that's a series B, you're going to be like, \"You know what? Phyl is looking for that, but I bet Phyl could do that.\" You can be expansive. But if I told you, \"Hey, Lenny, I'll take any product job I can,\" you are never going to think of me. You're never going to remember me. You're not going to be reductive from a broad statement, but you will be expansive from a narrow.\n\n(00:32:52):\nAnd I'll tell you, Lenny, this is so hard for people, and this is why, again, you need that council and you need that broader community. And every two weeks we do a LinkedIn Live where we address... We go over these questions again and again because it goes... If I were in the job search, I'd feel the same way, even with all the darn research I've done. It's really hard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:13):\nIf you've been using this metaphor, approaching this like a product person, and this is very much like a product person thinks about new products is there should be a very narrow audience to start with kind of a wedge or an ICP. When someone's building this, what is a sign they've narrowed it enough? Are there a certain number of attributes? What tells you that, \"Cool, this is small now\"?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:33:31):\nSo it's typically three to four attributes, and we give people a whole grid in a set of examples. So we had a woman who was a designer. She was a product designer. And what her product market fit was, she was looking for companies that either did not have a design team or needed to reboot one. So she wasn't talking about stage of business, or even industry, but that really plants an image in your mind. If you hear about a company that doesn't have design or looking to reboot design, you're going to think of her immediately because after you've done your listening tour and you've created your candidate market fit and your council signs off on it, Lenny, this is important, then you go back out to your listening tour and you tell all those people, \"Thank you for your help. Here's the candidate market fit I've come up with.\" And you also post it on LinkedIn. You tell the whole world, right?\n\n(00:34:29):\nNow, will that candidate market fit change over time? Yeah, we're iterative, right? So if you go and go... And the market is changing. What was true three months ago may not be true now. Two weeks ago the stock market was convinced we're going into a recession, and everything crashed. Two weeks later we're like, \"Oh, no, we're not going into a recession,\" and that affects the psychology of hiring managers and companies. Not just psychology, their willingness to open up, recs and everything else. So things are changing, so you need to be flexible and adaptive to that, which is also why you need the council and why you need to have a good network around you that you've asked for help from and they're invested in you and can be there for you as you try to keep navigating this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:11):\nJust to follow us through it a little bit more, when someone is... Someone's thinking right now, \"Okay, what are my attributes,\" what's on that grid, roughly? There's stage of company, I imagine there's-\n\nPhyl Terry (00:35:21):\nStage of company, industry, level of role and function, of course, and culture.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:27):\nIs there a set of options you have of type of culture?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:35:30):\nBasically everyone wants a good culture, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:32):\nYeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So culture.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:35:38):\nSometimes it can be very specific, like, I need a company that has a particular kind of policy for kids, or whatever, remote or hybrid or whatever, that kind of element. But I tell people, make it simple. This should not be paragraphs and paragraphs. It should be a one-sentence statement. You can do a longer thing that you can then share with people when you're getting into the conversation, but you want something simple that people go, \"Oh, Lenny looking for a chief product officer role. Oh.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:11):\nYeah. It's exactly like you want your product to feel too.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:36:13):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:14):\nI need a SOC 2 compliance, so I'm going to think of-\n\nPhyl Terry (00:36:17):\nThat's [inaudible 00:36:17].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:18):\nYeah, exactly. Okay, so I'm thinking through this list here. So level and role I imagine people get a pretty good sense of where they want to be. Stage, any advice for someone to decide what stage is right for them?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:36:35):\nIf I were coaching someone which, as you know, I do, we would talk a lot about this. But when I'm in the book and in the community, I say, \"To figure out stage again, I want you to rely on your job search council and your network and your own experience,\" and it becomes pretty... People usually have a pretty good sense, like, \"Who was I talking to recently? I need a big...\" Whereas many people are like, \"I don't want that. I want a startup.\" Okay.\n\n(00:37:01):\nAnd what I will tell you is that one thing to keep in mind right now is that there are more jobs in the startup world than there are in the established companies in the tech world for product people. That's where new job creation has been happening. It's slower than it was before, but the big companies, they've just been shedding people. They've just been throwing them off. Whereas the smaller companies, there's more opportunity there. Now that doesn't mean that... If you can't stand working at a startup, I'm not telling you you should go there necessarily.\n\n(00:37:35):\nBut I will say this, and again, if you need to put food on the table... We were talking to someone recently; they had moved to a new city and then were laid off the next day. They moved for the company, and then they were laid off the next day, and they're like, \"Okay, I need to get a job.\" I said, \"Okay, yeah, sure. Just know that if you're going to get any job just to have while you still look for the job you really want, just know that that's hard. That's a hard pen. I understand it and I support it, it makes sense, and it's hard.\" It's harder than you realize, and you absolutely have to keep your job search council, because otherwise you're going to get lost.\n\n(00:38:16):\nCan I share one story about candidate market fit-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:19):\nPlease.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:38:19):\n... that might be helpful to people? I was coaching... He was an EVP at a traditional media company, but on the digital side, running their streaming business, but it was very much an old economy, old media company. This was not a player in the streaming space. And they smartly recognized that if they stayed there, they were going to end up in a pretty bad cul-de-sac. And by the way, that company's had layoffs, and they would've... So they decided they wanted to go work for a company like Netflix or Apple TV. And they're someone who ran hundreds of people, corner office, limo, first-class, you know what I mean, in the airplane? What was their candidate market fit? They went out and did this, their candidate market fit, if they were going to join a top streamer was as an individual contributor, Lenny. Because those guys, they didn't respect much of what they brought from traditional media. And if he had done this search alone, he would not have done that. But to his credit, he decided to take that, and it transformed his career. He's not someone who had a lot of management experience, but also tied now with one of the top streamers. He's just done incredibly well. But that is really hard to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:35):\nSo in this example, when you talk about candidate market fit, a big part of it is what the market wants from you. It's not like he's like, \"I'm going to go IC.\" He just realized as he was going through the process, \"This is where I'm actually going to succeed.\"\n\nPhyl Terry (00:39:48):\nHe talked to people, and I helped him network with people in Silicon Valley. They were just honest with him. And that's what Justin was talking about, this can be hard and humiliating at times to figure out... We had another person who was a chief product officer in a startup, and she was great. She helped me with the book, she was an early reader, she's a member of your community, Lenny. And she realized that she wasn't getting the right product trend. She was the only product person, and she didn't really know what she was doing. Well, what was her candidate market fit? It was an IC. It was an IC role, an individual contributor role in a larger tech company. And to her credit, she realized that was the right path for her learning, and she did this before the shoot really hit the fan. I'm in the tech world, fortunately. Just not swear.\n\n(00:40:38):\nI talk about this in the book. Sometimes you need a two-step strategy. Let's say you want to be a VP of product at a top streaming company or whatever it is, but you not a fit for that today. So the question is how do you step there? I tell a story in the book about a guy who'd been a VP of product. He wanted a COO role. He was not a fit. He was not a fit, Lenny. And it was very clear. The market was telling him, he did the listening tour, but he came back to me and said, \"I don't care. I want a COO role.\" So he interviewed with 50 companies. 50. Can you imagine? It took them a year and a half. The 50th company hired him.\n\n(00:41:15):\n10 days later, they were a public company, massive fraud, and they went bankrupt. I said, \"Okay. The market is clear. The only COO role you're a fit for is a company that's about to go bankrupt.\" And he's like, \"Okay,\" and he went back to the VP of product role. I said, \"If you want to become a COO from that role, where you are today, one of the great paths is to do it from that job inside a company.\" Okay? And that's what he ended up doing. It was a two-step strategy. He couldn't go straight there.\n\n(00:41:46):\nI'm not talking about people's innate worth, Lenny. I believe every human is worthwhile person, and I deeply believe in belonging and giving people support and spreading love and creating community. But I also believe in being practical and realistic. I didn't create this situation. I'm just trying to report to you what the situation is and how you can manage it so that you don't get stuck. How many people have you seen, Lenny, who get stuck? They get stuck in a bad job, they're not learning, and then they can't go from there? They get into their 40s and 50s, and it is tough. A number of people in the job search community who are in their 50s, 60s, whatever, they're dealing with ageism, they're dealing with... They're not close enough to the technology frontier. You got to get closer to the technology frontier, even if that means you're going to go from the EVP to an IC role. That's how creative destruction works. The closer you are to the technology frontier, the more new jobs and opportunities there are. The further you are from the technology frontier, the worse you're going to be over the long run. You might be able to get a better-sounding job in the short term, but you're going to find yourself stuck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:55):\nI love your Venn diagram of just warmth and support and belonging, and also just straight real-talk. Here's the reality.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:43:04):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:05):\nWhat a combo.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:43:06):\nOh, thank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:06):\nThis is such powerful advice, and I think people might be feeling like, \"Yeah, I get it, but man, I don't want to be a IC again. I've been a director, I've been a VP. That sounds really not great.\" Is there anything else you can share to help people get past that, of like, \"Okay, maybe I really should be looking for an IC role again?\"\n\nPhyl Terry (00:43:24):\nAgain, if you're in a job search council, and also you're in our Slack community, what you're going to find is that you're not alone. That's a big thing. It's not you. There's not something wrong with you. This is the market that we're in. And by the way, the more relationships you build, the better you do your listening tour... One of the tactics, Lenny, I tell people is you've got to send out an update note every month to all of your network that you've talked to. And it might be, \"I don't have a job yet,\" or \"I don't even have any news, but I just want to let you know I'm still going and I appreciate everything you've done for me and I'm still looking for X.\" That could be it. And Justin, in his note, I referenced him earlier as chief product officer, his note on LinkedIn today said, \"Phyl told me to keep people updated, and I didn't do it enough.\" Don't make that mistake. You got to do that.\n\n(00:44:12):\nLenny, I met with a group of about 50 job seekers recently who've been in the Never Search Alone community for more than a year. Okay? They're struggling. Again, I don't have a magic wand. But as I talked to them, what was happening? They stopped network. They left their job search council. They weren't updating their candidate market fit to the changing market condition. I'm like, \"You have to do everything. You can't get passive.\" One of the concepts, Lenny, I talk about is you've got to be the I in village. There's no I in team. Well, there is an I in village, okay? And the I in village is that when I'm saying you've got to ask for help, you got to be a part of job search council community, you have to be independent and accountable and responsible. I'm not saying you're not going to become passive independent. This is how you become more independent. This is how you stand up and be even more accountable and responsible. This is how you can do the best search possible in the market conditions that we have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):\nSo the advice here is if you're struggling finding a job, this is a solution. Join a council, bring people on board with you, update people on your progress. These are the things that break you out of that funk that you're probably in.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:45:26):\nAnd it will still be hard. It will still be hard. I wish that weren't true, Lenny. Now, I will tell you that, look, what's the difference between now and the dot-com depression of 2000, 2001 and 2? The difference is that we were a much smaller industry then. And people had been in web jobs only for a couple years, where now we've got people who are in jobs for 10, 15 or more years in tech who have never seen a downturn, have never seen a market like this. We've never seen a tech market like this. It will improve at some point, but right now it's tough. And I can't change that, but I can provide tools, I can provide community, I can provide heart and smarts, so that you can get the best job you can get right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:10):\nSpeaking of advice, is there anything else along the lines of candidate market fit before we move on to more tactics?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:46:17):\nJust that, again, that you're going to resist the narrowness of it, every bone in your body. Just know that that's what everyone is feeling. But go watch... I have this great video online of... He was a VP of product. He was initially masked, but VP of product at Nike. I met him through Marty and Chris at Silicon Valley Product Group. He joined one of our product councils, and then he decided to leave. And he was like, \"Phyl, I love you, but this candidate market fit stuff, no. You're wrong. It needs to be [inaudible 00:46:57].\" And so he went out and he actually spoke to a bunch of VCs and like, \" We don't have any idea what to do with you. You have to tell us something really specific.\" He was like, \"Oh, man.\" So he went, he's like, \"Phyl...\" So he redid it, bam, bam, bam.\n\n(00:47:12):\nI tell another story in the book about Dee. She was a chief data officer of a large company in tech, wanted to become a CTO. She had a technology and engineering background, as well as data. She spent a year spinning her wheels alone. I said, \"Join a job search council.\" She figured out her candidate market fit. It turns out she was a great fit for a mid-size regional bank CTO. And within three weeks she had three offers. A year, nothing. Within three weeks, three offers.\n\n(00:47:43):\nSo I can't guarantee that you're going to get three offers within three weeks, right? I'm not saying that. Some of you, it might take you six months or a year. And the more senior you are, Lenny, the longer it is. If you're a CEO, it's going to take you a long time, unless you happen to be the CEO of Chipotle, who just became the CEO of Starbucks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:02):\nYeah. Yeah, I know you're creating a page that we're going to link people to, which is, I think... Is it phyl.org/lenny?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:48:08):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):\nOkay, cool. And is it going to have this template to help you work out your market fit?\n\nPhyl Terry (00:48:13):\nThere'll be a link to where you can download not only that template, but all the templates. You don't even have to join a job search council to get all this stuff. I hope you do. Again, it's free. I will say, early on people were like, \"What's the trick here? This is free, and you're going to charge me.\" No. No, this is free. Why am I making it free? Because, one, I can, which is cool; second, this is in honor of my mom; and third, I want to create a private safety net for the ravages of creative destruction. It's great. A lot of positive consequences, but there's negative ones. And I just don't love the idea of charging people for this. I charge people for other things, but not for this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:58):\nAnd we'll link people to the things you charge for so they can support you and benefit you in other ways, or benefit themselves in other ways.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:49:04):\nBenefit them and me. That'd be awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:07):\nLet's talk about some other tactics. You mentioned this idea of playing to win, and I think within that, there's this kind of OKR in mission tactic. Let's talk about that.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:49:15):\n50%, Lenny, of the people who read my book, join a job search council, and follow everything I've described, the people don't do what I'm about to tell you, it is the biggest mistake and miss, and I'm really sorry about this. I'm on a campaign, right? So here's the thing. When you start to interview and negotiate, you've got to be in charge. This is collaborative coaching. I want you to play to win, not to lose.\n\n(00:49:49):\nNow, when people hear me say that, they translate it in their brains into, \"Oh, Phyl is saying that I've got to be a ruthless negotiator.\" If anyone who knows me know that ruthless is just not how I am, at least in this sense. No, no, I'm like, \"What I want you to do,\" and it's a great tactic that we stumbled upon, and it's one of the best tactics in the book, and I really hope we can get the other half of the people who are in the community to do this, and your listeners who aren't involved who decide to join also do this, when you start interviewing, I want you to create your own version of the job description. I want you to do it privately, Lenny, and I want you to create what I call a job mission with OKRs.\n\n(00:50:38):\nNow, most job descriptions, they suck, Lenny. The company doesn't know what the eff they're doing. They don't know exactly what they're looking for. But I'm not telling you to say that to them, just to be clear. I'm telling you, \"I want you to create your own job mission with OKRs.\" This is key. It needs to be with OKRs. Now, your audience knows what an OKR is, objectives and key results, and I assume I don't need to explain that. It needs to be something where you are saying, \"Here's what I think I'm going to be accountable for. Here's what I'm going to actually... the outcomes I'm going to deliver,\" right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:13):\nAt the company that you join.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:51:14):\nAt the company you join. Now, you'll keep it private at first because drafting it... This thing has multiple benefits. The first is drafting it will help you understand and develop great interview questions to ask them to clarify, what is this job? And they'll be impressed by that. Okay? The second thing is, once you've had a couple of interviews, and it's a draft... Now, it's not a full, final thing. This is so important. I want you to pull the hiring manager aside and say, \"Hey, Lenny, you're the hiring manager. I've thought about what the role is. I want to make sure I'm understanding it correctly. Can I share something with you?\" I don't want you to email it. I want you to do phone call, Zoom, or coffee or whatever.\n\n(00:51:54):\nLenny, can you imagine how hiring managers feel when they get this job mission with OKRs? I was talking to a senior guy at Amazon who's hired more than 2000 product leaders and others. He said, \"Phyl, no one in...\" He's part of our product account. He said, \"No one in my life has ever done this. If someone did this, it would blow my mind. I would hire them on the spot.\" And that's the message I want these folks to understand.\n\n(00:52:22):\nWe talk about silver medals, Lenny. In the job search, the silver medal sucks. At the Olympics, hey, it's pretty good. You get to be on the podium. But guess what? Silver medal is... It's almost worse than... Because you were almost there. And we have a number of videos and other things where we talk about the difference, in many cases, between getting the silver and gold has been doing the job mission with OKRs. Companies say, \"This is what distinguished you. This is what...\" We were like, \"Who is this person?\" They're already thinking about what they're accountable and the outcomes, and naturally they're thinking about it better than I am, which is fantastic, right? So it raises the odds, but it also does something if you present it...\n\n(00:53:02):\nAgain, Lenny, you're the hiring manager. I show you my job mission OKRs, and you're like, \"Oh, this is fantastic,\" but you also say, \"Oh, this thing you have here, this OKR, this isn't part of the role. Well, that's helpful to understand, but this thing that you don't have listed is.\" \"Oh, really?\" Lenny, how many times... I'm going to ask people in the audience to raise their hands. How many times have you taken the job A that turned out to be job B? Everybody just raised their hands, Lenny. So this helps to address that, right?\n\n(00:53:35):\nAnd then if you get the offer, and again, this raises the odds of getting the offer, it then sets you up to negotiate what I call the four legs of the negotiations tool. This is not hard negotiation. This is something the company loves. I actually say, you get an offer and it's like whatever, $250,000 base with a 30% bonus. This may be a director or whatever, or senior manager. Maybe it's an 800 base if you're more senior, whatever it might be. I want you to go and talk to the hiring manager, if possible. Hopefully not the recruiter. We'll talk about that. And I want you to say, \"This is great. I want to talk about money, but before we do, I want to think about some of the things that will set me up to see succeed in this role. I think there's like $10 million of tech debt here. Does that sound right to you? And are we on board that that'll be priority one to eliminate the first day I start the job?\"\n\n(00:54:39):\nWe had two CPOs, both interviewing at private equity firms, private equity-owned companies, about the same size, SaaS companies. One had tech debt of 20 million, one had tech debt of 10. I told them both, \"You got to talk about that in the...\" So one talked about it in the negotiation, and the company was like, \"Oh, that's great.\" They wrote a check on day one. Six months later, the tech debt was relieved. They updated the systems. They were able to get into innovation. A year later, they got promoted to a GM role in addition to their CPO role, and then a year after that, they were being interviewed for the CEO role. The other person, where there was 10 million of tech debt, was kind shy about asking, sort of mentioned it, they were like, \"Oh, we'll talk about it when you get here,\" but they didn't really commit, and they never addressed it. One month, six months, 12 months, 18 months later, he's looking for a job. This is the opportunity cost of not being set up for success.\n\n(00:55:34):\nNow, again, don't hear this as antagonistic. We're not antagonistic here. We're trying to say, \"What's going to help me succeed?\" So one CPO recently was negotiating... I'm not just talking about budget for tech debt or whatever. If you're a senior person, do you think that team needs more training? Do you need to send them over to Marty's workshops, over to my product councils, right? Get them into Lenny's community. The company was like, \"You're negotiating the training budget of the team that you don't even run yet-\"\n\nPhyl Terry (00:56:04):\nYou're negotiating the training budget of the team that you don't even run yet while we're talking about your salary? Who are you? We love you, we're going to pay you even more. Lenny, companies love this. And even if you're a junior person, you're not going to negotiate budget, but you can talk about mentorship, professional development, will you be able to attend conferences or training? Again, and this is, we're not hard negotiating this, we're saying, \"Here's what I think I'm going to need to accomplish the OKRs that we've already agreed upon.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:33):\nThis is really cool advice, I want to make sure people super understand it. So an example of tech debt. This person asked, \"I need $10 million budget in order to address this tech debt.\"\n\nPhyl Terry (00:56:42):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:43):\nI see. So it's not like, \"I believe we will save $10 million if we spend on time.\" It's like, \"Here's how much this team will need and I will need to be successful.\"\n\nPhyl Terry (00:56:51):\nI'm going to need a check for $10 million on day one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:54):\nI guess you're right, someone would be shy asking for that. Or that was $20 million actually, that was the one that asked for it.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:57:00):\nThat was the 20 million, that was right. And again, it was not... Yes, people feel really shy about this, but the companies love that they understood what it was going to take. I will tell you what, if the company doesn't like this, it's a huge red flag. Huge red flag, it means they're not serious. But if you're talking to them, \"Hey, I think we're going to need train the team. I'm going to need to hire three more ICs,\" or the design function is weak, or whatever it might be. And then you're like, \"Do you agree? Do you see it this way?\"\n\n(00:57:37):\nAnd they're like, \"Yeah, that's right. Good. Wow.\" You're already like bang, bang, bang. We haven't even finished negotiating your salary. And this is so counterintuitive, Lenny. I'm the queen of counterintuitive stuff. Kelly Marcus said it's counterintuitive, right? But this is as well. People think they're going to lose the opportunity when it actually wins them. Now, of course, if they marched in and said, \"Damn it, you have to do X and Y,\" right? That's not what I'm talking about.\n\n(00:58:10):\n\"Hey, here's how I see it. This is the OKRs. I think we're going to need this. Does that make sense to you?\" And you're having a collaborative conversation about how you need to be set up for success.\n\n(00:58:21):\nAnd by the way, if they say, \"No, I hear you. I believe you, but no,\" then you make a judgment decision. I'm not always saying you turn that away. Well, especially if you need a job, but you're now going in eyes wide open. You are not going to be able to believe that tech debt initially. You're going to have to work within that constraint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:41):\nSo I love that we're getting into negotiation advice by the way, because I was hoping we'd get there. So the advice here is identify something that you'll need to be successful, and your finding is that when you ask for, and it seems like a financial investment as a part of you joining, ends up leading to a better comp for you.\n\nPhyl Terry (00:59:00):\nYes, and I will say that there's less negotiating room today than there was two years ago because of the market that we're in. And the data all bears that out, and we see that. But here's the other piece of data. So I want you to ask for things that tie back to the OKRs that you've already agreed on with the hiring manager. This is how this thing connects together, right? It's like Legos, and then we come to the money and you've had this lovely conversation. You've shown them how much you're invested in succeeding. See, Lenny, the problem that every hiring manager has is distinguishing be someone between someone who is a good talker, and someone who can actually make things happen. You know this, right? And this is true every from individual contributor to CEO.\n\n(00:59:50):\nBy doing the job mission of the OKRs, and by showing them that draft, you are showing them. Not telling them, showing them that you take initiative, that you're accountable, that you can make things happen. And then in the salary negotiation, by talking to them about what you need to succeed, you're showing them that you really want to succeed. And guess who that benefits? That benefits the company, obviously. I want you to do that first and then, okay, so then let's talk money. Now, 87% of the time, Lenny, when you ask for more money, you get it. Now, that's a longitudinal statistic, meaning over many years. It's going to be lower in a moment like this, but you can still ask, and people are afraid to ask. Again, don't ask in some shark way like some of my friends in business might do. Some M&A negotiators, whatever. No, ask, are you open?\n\n(01:00:48):\nUnless it's a deal breaker. If it's a deal breaker, just be open about that. But if it's not, let's say they offered you whatever it is. 400 base with up to 100% whatever in some RSUs or options, blah, blah, and you really wanted 450. Lenny, you can say, \"Hey, are you open to 450? That was really what I was hoping for. What I think I'm worth, are you open to that? Is that something we can talk about?\"\n\n(01:01:16):\nAnd most of the time they say yes. They may not get you to 450. They may be like, \"You know what? Yes, thank you. Let me get back to you.\" Or, \"No, we could go to 420. Does that work? Great.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:28):\nYou make it sound very easy.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:01:30):\nHere's the thing-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:30):\nI hate negotiating. Yeah, go.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:01:32):\nI do too. And I talk about this in the book and Jason Fried, who you know. Jason Fried's got this great thing where they have all very clear bans, 37signals, well, at Basecamp. He's like, \"Because no one's trained in negotiation, how can we expect people to negotiate?\" And there's another thing Marty says about my book. He says what he loves is that companies have all of these resources. They've got lawyers and HR people, and you're there alone.\n\n(01:01:57):\nThat's why you need your job search council. This is when you really need to ask for help because every bone in your body is going to say, \"I'm not going to negotiate. That's going to make it worse,\" and it almost never does. And again, you could be a jerk about it, that won't be good, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about collaborative conversation. I'm talking about what you need to succeed, showing them that you're thinking about resources, support, budget that will help you deliver on the things that you signed up for. And then asking, are you open if they didn't quite hit your range.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:30):\nYeah. The way you phrase it, make it very low risk to ask.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:02:35):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:37):\nDo you have any specific advice on doing this over email, over phone call, or in person? Is there something you're like, \"Definitely do it in this way.\"\n\nPhyl Terry (01:02:43):\nStrongly, strongly want you to do it either in person or over the phone live with the hiring manager. Now, some companies won't let you do that. You have to talk to the HR person or whatever. But as much as you can work with the hiring manager, even if it's to say, \"Hey, I just want to run by you some of the things I think I need to succeed in the role before we talk money with the hiring manager,\" or whatever. With the recruiter I mean, and they'll go to bat for you behind the scenes if you do that. Not guaranteed, but more like.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:20):\nYeah, that's totally true because oftentimes you don't really have a specific budget as a hiring manager.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:03:24):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:24):\nSo to you it's like, \"Sure, 450, let's make it happen.\"\n\nPhyl Terry (01:03:27):\nThat's right. Now some companies like know this and they're like, \"You have to talk to the person we designate the internal recruiter,\" but you can also get back to that hiring manager, and even informally. Again, if you've built a good relationship and everything is about building good relationships, Lenny. I want you to be a good interviewer. I want you to ask good questions. I want you to listen. I want you to present that job mission OKRs. It shows how innovative and how much you take initiative and how much you're thinking about this and how much you want this, right? Every step of the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:00):\nThis episode is brought to you by Dovetail, the customer insights hub for product teams.

I mean, you could talk about your third grade teacher, you know what I mean? I'm just talking on, I just want you to do that, and I want you to do that because everyone has this idea that they're alone. We have all received enormous help to do what we're doing, whoever we are. Even the [inaudible 01:05:51] was born to a mother, and they did not make it themselves for their first several years of their lives. We all are born of mothers. We all are born as families and communities. Some better or worse. I had a pretty tough childhood, but there was love.\n\n(01:06:09):\nI want you to do that gratitude house exercise, and then it can sometimes surface people that you'll go talk to in the listening tour. Might not talk to your third grade teacher, but you'll go talk to some. Now when you're going into interview, I ask people to take a moment and re-reflect the gratitude house exercise, remind themselves of everyone they're carrying with them, to imagine that they're on your shoulders. All of those people, including your job search council of course, and everyone you've talked to and you're listening to, you're walking in with 50 people, Lenny, okay? Even people who tell me, \"I don't know anyone.\" Now, that is not true. You might not know as many people as I do, okay? That's understandable. My job is to know people, but everyone knows some people and you bring them with you even metaphorically, so that you feel not alone when you're going into that interview.\n\n(01:07:10):\nThe other thing I say with the interview and the negotiations is you've got to go do the debrief right afterwards, Lenny. Because we all have these cockamamie ideas about what happened. We think we did terribly when we did well, we think... We need to talk it through with someone else who can help us parse exactly what happened and really where we're at. I had a woman who was a director of product, she was interviewing for a VP of product roles. She texted me after the interview, \"Oh, I screwed it up,\" this and that, this and that, \"but they really liked me and we're going to go to the next round.\"\n\n(01:07:41):\nI'm like, \"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Something is not true here.\"\n\n(01:07:48):\nThis is just your own imposter syndrome and inner critic. That's another exercise we ask people to do, by the way, is what we call the inner critic exercise name the critic. Mine is Tub Tour. I was overweight when I was a kid and my dad called me Tub Tour.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:04):\nI learned that tactic from Julie Cameron from The Artist's Way, she recommends that.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:08:08):\nYes, she's great. Love that book. By the way, it's on my bookshelf back there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:12):\nI love that. I think I called mine Jim. Yeah, we had a really good episode. I don't know if you saw with Joe Hudson, he has a whole series of advice on your inner critic, and his point, and I'll point to it is your inner critic is always lying to you.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:08:30):\nI did see that episode. I love it. We all have it. People think, \"Oh.\" Everyone. And that's what I love about this moment we're in too, Lenny. I started in therapy in the 1980s. In the 1980s, you did not share that you were in therapy, okay? Today, we have tennis stars talking about their emotional well-being and their therapy and how they're doing. It's beginning to normalize in some really important ways that emotions, they're not bad. They're actually really important to the decision-making system, but they can go off in certain ways that can really hurt us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:13):\nAnd it feels like these councils are like a lite therapy for people.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:09:16):\nYes. I would never want to say the word therapy because of course that implies certification and training, but there's a therapeutic aspect to it. I feel comfortable saying that, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):\nOkay. So on this gratitude house, just come back to it real quick. The reason that is powerful is that gives you confidence to ask for stuff to believe in yourself. You're worth something-\n\nPhyl Terry (01:09:37):\nGives you confidence to walk in there as who you are, Lenny. Not as your inner critic, but as the whole good person that you are. And when you show up, this is one of the reasons job search councils are so important because if your anxiety and fear starts to run away and erode at your confidence, it will hurt your interview. You will not show up well. So you're not going to even, even in a down market you're going to get even, you won't even get the jobs that your candidate market fit suggests you're good for in that down market. You're going to slide down a few more notches, or you just won't get offers, and then you're going to get paralyzed and feel like you're really worthless.\n\n(01:10:17):\nAnd if anyone watching this has been out of work for a while and feels that, let me just tell you, you are not worthless. You are not worthless. I want you to invest in yourself, to prove that to yourself that you're not worthless. You are worth the investment of this time and energy. I'm not asking you to do this for me, I'm asking you to do this for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):\nYou got tingles when you said that. That was a really powerful message. I'm glad you said that.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:10:46):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:48):\nSo yeah, so we're on this topic of playing to win. And what you just said is along the same lines is just remember, you're playing to win. You're not trying to lose, you're not trying to find-\n\nPhyl Terry (01:10:56):\nNot lose, just be really, I just can't say anything. I just can't rock the boat. I'm not asking you to rock the boat. I'm asking you to take charge and demonstrate the power of who you are. These companies will love it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:10):\nWhen I asked a lot of people to ask you what you're amazing at, one of those common themes is really good at just asking for help and teaching people how to ask for help, which was actually an topic for a recent newsletter post by one of my newsletter fellows, Natalie. So let's talk about it. Talk about why this is so important, why you spend so much thought and time on this topic.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:11:32):\nFirst, I want to shout out my mom again. So my mom's name, her nickname was Chic, C-H-I-C. Her friends and family and I dedicate the book to Chic, and she started that first council in 1960, and she asked for help. Of course, she taught me to ask for help, and to start councils. And of course, when I was very young, I didn't want to do what my mother said, right? You're not. But I ended up in a bad situation and she's like, \"You've got to ask for help,\" and I asked my high school teachers for help. I was an alcoholic at the age of 12, Lenny, and things were really spiraling downwards. I was no longer living with my mom, there's a whole long story about that. I was in a pretty unsupportive position, and she's like, \"You've got to ask for help.\" And so I did.\n\n(01:12:23):\nAnd OMG, Lenny. I mean, I was carried by these teachers. And I also have to give a shout-out, and I'm going to cry now to my girlfriend in high school, Karen Kavanagh, whose family had very few resources. They were struggling, but they made a home for me, and I couldn't have done it without them and some of my other friends and my teachers. I worked a full-time job by the age of 16 and I was going to high school, and I was in a tough situation. It was transformative, Lenny. It was transformative. Did I feel like asking for help was a weakness? I did. Did I think people were going to think less of me? Absolutely. I thought all the things that people think, and it is not what happens.\n\n(01:13:24):\nNow, there is a warning here. If you ask for help poorly, and I'm going to define that, it does end up leading to bad consequences. What do I mean by asking you poorly? I mean, if you don't do your homework, if you're asking for someone to do it for you rather than advise and support and give you perspective, we all know that. I get these emails, Lenny. So when I started the product councils, Marissa Mayer was a founding member, right? Marissa Mayer at Google and Miriam Moheed at Amazon. And as Marissa's reputation grew, suddenly everybody wanted to talk to Marissa.\n\n(01:13:57):\nSo I got all these random emails from people I've never met. \"Oh, I've got software, would you please introduce me to Marissa? I think she'd want to license it or buy at Google.\"\n\n(01:14:08):\nI'm like, \"Who are you? What? That is the dumbest.\" Of course, I'm never going to answer that, right?\n\n(01:14:13):\nIf they had reached out to me and said, \"I know you don't know me. I have this small software company. I'm not well-connected, but I would love your advice on how to grow this business and what you would do if you were in my shoes,\" which I have never received, Lenny, even though I've written about it and said about, I would've done that phone call.\n\n(01:14:34):\nAnd then if they have said, \"Well, can I talk to Marissa?\"\n\n(01:14:36):\nI'm like, \"You have not earned that yet. That's not a statement about your worth. It's just you're not ready for that conversation.\"\n\n(01:14:48):\nSo you can do it poorly. But if you do it well, if you've done your homework and you're open, oh my gosh. There's four counterintuitive rules here. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of confidence. It both requires confidence and strengthens it, Lenny. That's number one. Two, it's not a taking activity, it's a giving activity. If you do it well, you're actually being giving to the people you ask. This is really counterintuitive, Lenny. This is what I teach in my product councils. I'm like, \"You have to ask for the money.\" If you ask for help and you're open and vulnerable, you're a smart person.\n\n(01:15:27):\nSo at one point, Marissa came in and said, \" Listen, I'm developing a new product. I want to present it to the board, but I'd like your feedback on it first, and what do you guys think?\" Am I approaching this in the right way?\n\n(01:15:37):\nPeople were like, \"What?\" Google was already a public company at this point. Wow, that, they were just blown away. They were so happy to help.\n\n(01:15:48):\nSo if you've done your homework and you ask someone who has some expertise in the area that you have, and you do it in this way, \"I'd love your perspective and thoughts and how would you approach it?\" People feel given to, they feel given to. Here's the thought experiment that'll prove it. Imagine that somebody that you respect comes to you for help on an area that you have expertise. And they ask you in this way, how are you going to feel, Lenny? How do you feel?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:17):\nLike they value. Like they value my opinion-\n\nPhyl Terry (01:16:20):\nYou feel honored, and you feel excited, and you love giving. Everyone loves giving, it's a part of human activity. And you learn more when you give, of course, because it helps you see something new. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It's not a taking activity, it means you're becoming more independent, not independent, and it doesn't hurt your reputation, it improves it. Something I did not understand when my mom was trying to tell me to do this, Lenny. And it took the experience to drill into my head.\n\n(01:16:49):\nAnd then I will tell you, I won't name names, but one person that you asked, who's a prominent product person who's worked at great companies, right? He said ask him about asking for help. I think he would agree with this. He'd been a member of the product councils for a long time. I think it took years before he really embraced it. I've seen many people, they're like, \"Bill, I know you keep talking about this asking for help thing.\" And I know there's something to it, but it is transformative, Lenny. It is transformative if you learn to ask for help well.\n\n(01:17:25):\nI can tell you about Brad Smith at Intuit who toppled the stock price there. But he was a GM. He became a CEO. He was a GM. He ran a project and he didn't do it well. He lost $300 million for company. He thought, okay, that's over. But they came to him and said, \"What's your lesson here?\"\n\n(01:17:46):\nHe said, \"I didn't ask for help. I was pigheaded. I didn't listen to my team.\" That's a great lesson, and if you really internalize that, then it's worth it because you're great in other ways. And he ended up getting to the CEO role. And what did he do? He joined a council, right? And he asked for help. Boom, boom, boom. Stock price goes up 7X in his tenure, okay?\n\n(01:18:08):\nKenneth Chenault at American Express. Joins in the 1980s, one of the few African Americans in professional roles there. Ends up as a CEO and chairman of the board. First African American chairman of a Fortune 50 company. You ask Kenneth Chenault as I did, how'd you get there? He asked for help. And by the way, what did he do once he became CEO? He got on a CEO council.\n\n(01:18:33):\nAnd by the way, who asked for help? Well, this is going to blow your mind if you. Warren Buffett. People think Warren Buffett only listens to himself and Charlie Munger who passed away last year. That guy asked for help. Well, it doesn't ask anybody for help. He asked people he respects and so on, but that guy asked for help. Every single leader I've ever worked with that has done well asked for help. And I have data in the book. 85% of the people get to a senior role credit asking for help to help get them there. 85% of the people in a junior role say they're afraid to ask for help because they think it's a sign of weakness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:06):\nPerfect.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:19:07):\nIt's literally the same number if you can believe that. I couldn't believe it when I did the data. I was like, \"What?\" But it's really, and guess what? If you don't learn to ask for help and you're a junior person, you're going to remain a junior person most likely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:19):\nWhen you say ask for help, what are some examples and common times and uses of asking for help? Because it could be like, \"Hey, can you just look at this email for me?\" Or is it like, \"I'm struggling with this project?\" What are some things that you've seen when people think ask for help do this.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:19:35):\nOne of the things that Kinshaw talks about is what he calls defining reality. So it's a CEO at American Express, he was constantly just going around and asking different people in the company and outside the company, \"How do you see things? What are you seeing? What are you thinking? Help me understand your perspective,\" right? So that's a form of asking for help, for sure. Okay.\n\n(01:19:52):\nReviewing my email absolutely is a great form of asking for help. If you're sending a good email, an important email let's say, and let's say you have a history of maybe sending emails that don't get well received, you go ask for help. And by the way, I have a whole workshop where I teach people how to use ChatGPT with some communication models to help you with that email. So there's ways to do that with ChatGPT. But I still, if it's a really important email, want you to have eyes on, right?\n\n(01:20:22):\nThere's a woman who became the president of a digital retailer in the United States about five years ago, and then she realized that she had significant technical debt. The project, they were trying to build a new platform, and it was stuck. So we convened what we call a peer coaching call, and I also talked about this in the book. We got three other presidents of retailers, online retailers who had re-platformed and spent an hour, just one hour with her asking them for help. \"What would you do if you were in my position?\" I mean, bing, bang, boom.\n\n(01:20:55):\nSo when people get a new job, by the way, I tell them, do a first 90 days peer coaching call. I want you to talk to people who are in that role today. Not at that company necessarily, but they're a director of product, they're a VP of product, whatever it might be. And I want you to say, \"Hey, I'm starting this job. Here's my job mission with OKRs. What would you do if you were in my shoes? What mistakes have you seen others or yourself make that I need to avoid? What should I focus on? Here's what I'm thinking for my 30, 60, 90.\"\n\n(01:21:24):\nWhatever it might be, I want you to do a first 90 days call. Now, let's say you're a director of product in a job is going well, and you want to get to a VP of product role. Well then, I want you to do a career evolution call where you're talking to VPs of product. \"Okay, I'm a director. I want to become a VP. How do I get from A to B? Will you tell me?\" And that's another peer coach you call. So these are the things we do in the paid community, in the product councils and stuff. But you can do these on your own, right? And I tell people how to do them on their own in the job search councils.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:54):\nPerfect.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:21:54):\nAre these helpful answers?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):\nAbsolutely. I think all these examples you're sharing is exactly I think what people are wondering. Just like, okay, I see.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:22:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:01):\nFeels like it's not-\n\nPhyl Terry (01:22:02):\nCan I share one more?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:03):\nPlease.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:22:03):\nThat's so great. So Bradley Horowitz joined Google in 2008 as director of product. He had come from Yahoo, but he was initially intimidated. He had a weekly meeting with Jonathan Rosenberg, who was the SVP of product, with Susan Wojcicki. Susan just passed away tragically. Absolutely fabulous person by the way, if people don't don't know her, go learn about her. Marissa Mayer, and also another director of product named Sundar Pichai, right? Who is now the CEO of Google. And Bradley, he was nervous, he didn't know how to be in that meeting.\n\n(01:22:42):\nOne of the things I tell people, when you ask for help, use your emotional intelligence, use your product council if you're in a job or your job search council, if you're looking to get feedback on, am I thinking about this well? Because I don't want you to ask the wrong people for help. Someone who's going to take advantage of that. You have to be thoughtful about this.\n\n(01:23:02):\nHe was picking up vibes from Sundar that he was very approachable, that he lacked guile. Bradley told me Sundar just made it easy for him to say, \"Hey, after one of these meetings, could I ask you a couple of questions?\" And he says, first question he has is, \"Is this meeting, is it just me or is this meeting intense?\"\n\n(01:23:21):\nSundar was like, \"Oh, no, no, this is intense. I feel the same way you do and I've been here for a couple of years.\"\n\n(01:23:29):\nSo they start to build a bond, and that's a form of asking for help. It's like you're checking, is your experience the same as mine or am I missing something? And then Horowitz who felt relieved at this point, felt more trust with Sundar, decided to ask him another question and this question. And by the way, now Bradley, he's kind of embarrassed that he asked this question, although I'm really happy that he did, I told him this.\n\n(01:23:56):\nHe asked this question, he basically said, \" I haven't been here very long, but you, Sundar, you strike me.\"\n\nPhyl Terry (01:24:03):\n\"I haven't been here very long, but you, Sundar, you strike me as a really thoughtful person and great leader. Why is your remit just working on a toolbar for Marissa?\" Whoa. Heard the wrong way, that could sound like an insult or something, rather than an honest attempt to understand the culture of Google and how it operates. But again, he had trust with Sundar at this point. And it was an open and vulnerable question, and it was great. Pitch I basically said, \"Listen, I don't worry about title or scope or any of that. I've really been focused on just doing good work and letting the right things happen. That's the culture of Google.\" I will tell you that that was more true of the culture of Google in a way that's not so...\n\n(01:24:48):\nYou have to be a little more politically aware at Google today. But the point is not so much the exact question he asked, but that he was open and vulnerable. He was thoughtful about who he asked, and it really made a difference in terms of his entry into Google and eventually led him to the VP of Product role. Of course, Sundar came into the CEO role down the road, but that's what I'm talking about, right? He was part of the product councils, Bradley. You need to have that sounding board so you can be thoughtful about... I teach people how to map and figure out who their allies are and their blockers and play what I call positive politics. That's all in my next book, Never Lead Alone, just to give a little. Don't worry, at least a year away.\n\n(01:25:32):\nWhen I write a book, I do... I did 400 drafts of Never Search Alone. I had a couple of thousand people help me with it and 200 people read it and use it. I had 2,500 comments and 400 drafts. I like to really dock through this stuff. I'm doing the same with Never Lead Alone. That's how I know it works, by the way. I'm a prouded person, Lenny. I mean, that's what we do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:57):\n[inaudible 01:25:56]. That's amazing. Let me ask one last question around the art of asking for help. So we've talked about when to ask for help a little bit. What are just a couple tips for how to do it well? You know, people come to me and like, \"Hey, can you look at this email?\" And be like, \"No. I'm pretty busy. I don't know if I have time to look at an email.\"\n\nPhyl Terry (01:26:15):\nHave to think about the relationship, right? Again, showing that this random, small software company wanted to talk to Marissa Meyer. I didn't know them, they didn't know me, and they didn't know Marissa. That's not going to happen, right? Lenny, if your mom or your close friend or your colleague who you work closely with says, \"I want you to look at this email,\" you're going to respond in one way. If some person, let's say in your podcast community, which is great, wants you to do it, I mean, you have thousands of people there. You can't do that. People come to me for job search advice in the job search community. I said, \"I can't do that. I can't scale that. That's what the Job Search Council and the Slack community is there for. I appreciate you asking, but that's what the deal is there.\"\n\n(01:27:03):\nYou got to think about the relationship. Listen to your emotions. This is where, again, emotions are really important for decision making. If your emotions are telling you, \"I don't know if I trust this person,\" don't get all open and vulnerable with them. I want you to learn to ask for help in a counsel format where it's really safe. You can flail around. You can ask in fakakta ways. There's ways to ask for help where it's like... Have you experienced this, Lenny? Where I want you to do me a favor, but I'm actually acting like I'm doing you a favor. Lenny, I have this person to talk to I know is really going to be great for you to talk to, when really I'm trying to get you to give me... Whereas I should said, \"Lenny, I have a favor to ask. Would you be willing to do this?\" You just say yes or no. That's the other thing, I really want you to be honest with people about what you're asking. I never want you to hide the ask.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:00):\nThat is really good advice. A lot of times it's just, yeah, okay, if this is just a favor for you, absolutely.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:28:05):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:05):\n[inaudible 01:28:06]\n\nPhyl Terry (01:28:06):\nI mean, if people would say to me, \"I have a favor to ask. Would you be willing?\" \"Yeah.\" Most of the time I'm going to say yes to that, you know?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:14):\nYeah.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:28:15):\nDo you get cold introductions, Lenny?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:18):\nWhere people introduce me to someone else without asking. Yeah. It's not a super common, but it does happen, for sure.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:28:23):\nIt almost never is someone you want to talk to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:26):\nYeah, that's right.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:28:27):\nIt's not like, \"Hey, let me introduce you to Sergey Brin,\" you know?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:31):\nYeah.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:28:34):\nIt's [inaudible 01:28:32]. No. It's like they're trying to help somebody and you're doing them a favor, but they're not being honest.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:39):\nYeah. Okay. That's amazing advice. Phyl, we could talk for hours about so many things. You're involved in so many other things I want to hear about, but maybe one last question before we start to close out our chat. Just a broad question, is there anything else that you think would be valuable for people to know or leave with as kind of a final note around either job hunting, asking for help, anything else? And then I'm going to ask you to share all the things that you do for people that maybe could benefit from one of these other programs.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:29:08):\nWhen my book came out, we did a book party in New York and the host of it, very senior product person, got up and said, \"The most important thing about this book that I learned,\" and they run a Job Search Council, \"was, and I said this earlier, but I want to come back to it, everyone feels anxious and insecure in the job search.\" Lenny, everyone. It's built into the fabric of how capitalism operates. It's not something problematic in your head. It's the instability of the system, which gives it its dynamism, but which also creates trends in security and fear. Everyone feels that, Lenny. You are not alone. But my saying that is not enough. What I say in the book is that this book is like a cookbook. You don't get the calories from reading it. You got to actually make the dishes. To experience what I'm saying, you need a Job Search Council and you need to go like, \"Oh my gosh, it's really true, I'm not alone. Even Lenny. Lenny feels this. Holy, I respect Lenny. Wow, look at everything Lenny has done and created, and he feels this way. Maybe I'm not crazy.\" There's so much else to this, but that is such a core point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:37):\nThat's such an important point to leave with. And just to build on exactly what you just said about me, this strange life that I've created for myself, I originally called the project Avoid Getting a Real Job because I was worried about that. I forced myself to try something else instead.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:30:53):\nThat's amazing. That's amazing. That's great. Well, thank you, because you have created something that's really meaningful to a lot of people, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:00):\nThanks, Phyl. So have you. I'm so thankful that you made time to share so much advice. I think this is going to be one of the popular episodes I've done. I think it's going to help a ton of people, but we're not done yet. Tell us about some of the other stuff that you've got going on. You've mentioned product councils, you do coaching, just so people know what else might benefit them.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:31:17):\n21 years ago I started these product councils. And by the way, I like to show this Marty Cagan, and I go back to the late nineties, early... He was actually a client of mine when he was at eBay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:31):\nWow.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:31:32):\nAnd I'll tell you what happened. We were about to sign a project and he decided, he called me up. Literally, we were signing that day. He called me up, \"Phyl, I got bad news.\" \"I mean, what are you telling me?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:40):\nNow?\n\nPhyl Terry (01:31:41):\n\"I'm leaving.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:42):\nCome on.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:31:42):\n\"I'm leaving and I'm starting something.\" And he started the Silicon Valley Product Group.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:47):\nOh, wow.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:31:47):\nBut why am I saying that? Because that was around the time that I started the councils and I started with Marissa. Basically, I went out and did a listening to her Lenny and I said, \"Listen, I think for those of us left in the digital world after this depression, I think we need a place to come together that's not a conference with sponsors and people that are all trying to sell each other. We need a private, safe, secure environment to really talk. Does that resonate with you? Do you want that?\" And they were like, \"Yes,\" so I started this thing and Marty has been involved from day one. He has sent me something like 30% involved with members we've had over the years. We've had a couple thousand members and he just sends people over, which has been amazing.\n\n(01:32:33):\nAnd so we have product councils for VPs and CPOs. We also have an associate council program for ICs and new managers. We started that a couple of years ago. It focuses on women and people of color and LGBTQ, but not exclusively. So you can be a white guy who's straight, whatever, and you're a product manager. What we care most about is if you're willing to ask for help, and you're really committed to being there for each other and being a part of this community and activity. And so that's what I've been doing for years. And I have a great team and amazing... Teresa Torres was one of the moderators of our private councils, by the way, and great friend, and been on the podcast here. Gino, obviously great friend of yours. She asked me to really emphasize asking for help and share some of the stories that I did. She's just been such an important part of my life. I can't say enough about her.\n\n(01:33:28):\nWe've got those and we have CEO groups and we have [inaudible 01:33:31]. That's my day job. That's sort of what pays the bills and I've been doing for 20 plus years now. But then I also have a series of other learning communities. I'm one of these, I read. If you asked me, \"If you had one job title, what would it be?\" Reader. I read, Lenny. Books are machines to think with. Books are machines to think with. And I'm on a campaign to get more people reading more because... And product leaders need to read more. I have a whole bunch of book recommendations on my Lenny page, by the way, that are for product leaders, and we can talk about a few of those. But I also run something called the Reading Odyssey, which is a partnership between scholars and readers at Harvard, Cambridge, for lifelong learning and curiosity.\n\n(01:34:22):\nI run the World Business Reading Group for high school students. It's a high school business literacy. Not financial literacy, business literacy program based on the philosophy of Warren Buffett and Charlie Mugger. And taught by really senior executives, like partners at venture capital firms, hedge funds. And I'm an investor. We have this amazing faculty. It's pro bono. We're all volunteer. We have a small charge for middle class families and it's free for anyone who can't afford it. And it's a summer program and it's going gangbusters. What else?\n\n(01:34:54):\nOh, Slow Art Day. So one of the things I teach people is that you need to develop mentors. Most people do not have mentors, Lenny. 95% of the people in my community of senior product leaders do not have mentors. And mentorship programs, it's like the typewriter. Our parents or grandparents have them, but we don't have them. The companies don't offer. One of the ways that everyone listening to this podcast today can get a mentor, you can get what I call a dead or distant mentor. Warren Buffett is my mentor, he just doesn't know it, which is great. I don't have to listen to everything he says and he doesn't have to take my calls. Steve Jobs is my mentor. And when I talk about mentor, I don't mean just, hey, I'm a fan, or I like the products, or I read the biography. I mean really study.\n\n(01:35:46):\nIf you really study Jobs, you have to come to 1997. He's interim CEO. So he was fired from Apple in '84, '85. Actually, after the Mac came out. He wandered the wilderness for 10 years. He created a company called Next, which wasn't next. And then in '95, '96, Apple buys the operating system from Next, and the company is in really bad shape and makes Steve the interim CEO. Interim. They wouldn't give him the full title. They're like, \"Ah, the business is so terrible. You're going to destroy it anyway. Whatever. You'll be interim.\" And he does a bunch of stuff, but he gives a talk in 1997. He's got tattered hole jeans. There's 300 people at the developers conference. They all are pissed off. And he gets up there and he says, \"You have to start with the customer, not with the technology.\" And that's what we're doing it at. People talk about that customer. If you really study Jobs, that's what he did.\n\n(01:36:49):\nAnd what does that mean? I can tell you there's a lot of product people, Lenny, who talk about customer and don't really focus. And if you really study that moment and study what Jobs did, it can inform your decisions and actions. So one of the things that Jobs also talked about was the power of art and that everyone needs to go to art museums and that you need to be inspired and it will help you think about design if you create great products. So I started a company, something called Slow Art Day, which has now been in 1,500 museums around the world. It teaches people how to slow down and look. And especially for Lenny's podcast, I am making free both the teacher materials, the leader materials, and the participant materials so that all of your podcast listeners who are running product teams can go to a local museum and do an offsite and develop more visual literacy, empathy, connection with each other, and an understanding of art that will help them be better [inaudible 01:37:46].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:46):\nThat is amazing. I'm going to try to do that myself.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:37:49):\nIt will blow your mind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:51):\nSo you mentioned Marty Cagan and Christian a couple times, and Marty Cagan described Chris as the most interesting person in the world. I feel like you deserve that title. You're doing so much and so much good and so much variety of things. It's really impressive. And the amount of impact you're having is wild.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:38:10):\nThank you. It really means a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:14):\nI'm just saying it how it is. I'm really thankful you've shared so much wisdom on this podcast with everyone. I think that's going to help so many people. We're also not done yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. Phyl, are you ready?\n\nPhyl Terry (01:38:28):\nI am ready for lightning round.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:31):\nHere we go. And you've talked about books. I imagine you're going to have an answer for this.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:38:35):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:35):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nPhyl Terry (01:38:38):\nOf course, I've recommended hundreds, but right now what I recommend is Creative Destruction, and I'm going to give your listeners the link to the right book, it's by a group of French economists. It's a little bit academic, but it's so important. It's so important for product people to understand. It is so important. More jobs get created because of creative destruction. There's not net job loss. There's more jobs created. AI is going to create more jobs, not destroy. Everybody got that wrong. Almost everybody, except the people who understood creative destruction. But you have to be close to the frontier. That's where the job creation happens. And product people, you got to be close to the frontier. You got to do whatever you can. If you're at a company that's not close to the frontier, do stuff at... I was working at Moody's Investor Service and I built one of the first 2,000 websites back in the early nineties, Lenny. I was doing all this stuff outside of work. That was bringing me closer to the technical frontier and was changing my candidate market fit. So I recommend that book.\n\n(01:39:36):\nI also, of course, I recommend Marty's books. Now, I want to just say again, I don't want you to just read Marty's books, listen to his podcast, the great interview you guys did here at Lenny's. I want you to read and reread those books as if he's your mentor. And rereading is important, Lenny. And people say, \"Oh, I listened two or three times speed on the audiobook.\" You are not going to have that deeply inform your decision making. Now what I'll do is I'll read a book and then I'll listen to it as a reinforcement, or I'll read it and listen to it at the same time. For the important books, Lenny, you got to read them more. And Marty's books are important.\n\n(01:40:20):\nThe last book I'll recommend is The Manual. It's a short introduction to Stoicism. People misunderstand Stoicism. They think Stoicism means repressing your feelings. That is not what Stoicism means. It means understanding and accepting your feelings, but not necessarily always being driven by them. Incorporating them. Your feelings are an important part of your decision-making system, but they shouldn't rule you. And it's a really important book. I have driven a lot of sales with that book because I really hammer it home in my book. So if you go on to Amazon, you'll see the book that's most bought along with my book is that book, right? I have other books I recommend that are on my website, but those are two or three.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:58):\nAmazing. On the listening to things at fast speed, I sometimes meet folks that listen to the podcast and they're like, \"Oh, this is what you sound like at regular speed, because I just listen to every podcast fast.\" Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nPhyl Terry (01:41:16):\nSo there's a great new TV show on Apple TV that is not getting the audience that it deserves. It's called Las Azules. Las Azules, the Blues. It's about the first women recruited onto the police force of Mexico City in 1971 or 2. Of course it speaks to me because 1970s, these are women and my mom and how close I was to her and what I... I saw the world through my mother's eyes, Lenny, and it really shaped me. It's a great TV show. I love that. Of course, I love the show that I've always recommended and everyone's now seen it, I hope. If they haven't, it's been out for a while, but it's... Oh, the name just escaped me. The American football coach who goes to England and becomes a soccer coach.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:10):\nOh yeah.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:42:11):\nHow can I forget this? I've recommended it so many times.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:13):\nThat's the guy's name, right? The character, Ted Lasso.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:42:15):\nTed Lasso, Ted Lasso. Thank you. So the kindness in there. And by the way, a great message around asking for help in that. The last thing I'll say, of course, is the Inside Out movies. The second one came out this summer. Just the way it's normalizing emotions, again, and helping us start to talk about emotions. Really love that. Okay, what else in the lightning round?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:36):\nSo there's this next question that I cut. I moved to other questions, but I wanted to bring it back with you. It's about your favorite interview question. You help a lot of people interview and interview better. I'm curious if there's a question that you've heard that you really like.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:42:50):\nIf you are interviewee for a job and it's a senior level job, I want you to ask, \"Tell me about a time that you, the company, brought in a senior level person and it failed, and why?\" Because they often fail bringing senior level people into companies. So ask them what happened and why, and figure out how can we avoid that outcome. And hopefully they're going to have a good answer. I have a whole bunch of questions in my book, but I love that one.\n\n(01:43:19):\nI also love, if you are on the other side, if you're hiring and you want to check references, I have the most amazing question. The most amazing question. By the way, this is the best thing I learned in my two years at the Harvard Business School. I learned this in my running and growing a small business class. It's like the best thing I've learned. It is, if you want to get references, what you do is you want to leave a voicemail or you could send an email, whatever. And you want to say, \"I'm about to hire Lenny. Okay, if it would be a huge mistake if I didn't bring him on, if you think he's amazing, then call me back. Otherwise, don't bother.\" And that gets around all the legal blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it's just it cuts through. I love that question. I don't know if that resonates with you as much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:10):\nYeah. So is the idea if you don't hear back from them, they're not necessarily amazing?\n\nPhyl Terry (01:44:14):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:15):\nWow.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:44:16):\nYeah. You're leaving that space there. And by the way, I love doing that for back channel. When you start a job or when you are accepting an offer or interviewing, I want you to back channel that boss a little. Talk to people who've worked with them, if you can. Use your network and ask them, \"Would you work with this person?\" And even say, \"Hey, if I called you and told me I was interviewing with this guy and you should only call me back if you thought I should take the job, would you have called me back?\" You'd know, and so you can do a form of it that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:47):\nDo you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love, whether it's like a digital app?\n\nPhyl Terry (01:44:50):\nI'm going to give you a very different kind of answer than I would normally give, but I'm hoping you and your community will appreciate this. So I did recently discover it, but I'm going to talk about a book, Lenny. So 25 years ago, a guy named Robert Strassler, who was a business guy, he started teaching at a special high school for kids who were dropping out. And he was teaching them some of the classics like Herodotus and Thucydides, expert, and they couldn't get it. And the books were terrible because there was no context, so he spent 10 years and he reinvented the format of a history book. There are 120 maps. Each of them he drew specifically, and they're only relevant to the previous one or two pages. Okay? There's a margin summary in plain English for each paragraph describing what that paragraph just said. He got the top scholars in the world to write two-page appendices on their expert topic, things they've written hundreds of books about, hundreds of pages about, you have to do it in two pages.\n\n(01:45:58):\nAnd by the way, the publishing world wouldn't back it. He funded it himself. He hand drew the maps. He spent two years creating a concept index, not just a keyword index. And it's just blown apart the whole industry. Completely disrupted. He sold hundreds of thousands of copies of these books. They are a masterpiece, Lenny. They have Landmark Series. Landmark. They have new ones coming out. Every product person, in my opinion, should go look at this and look at the product design of this book. It is masterful and it teaches you a lot about usability and the reader experience. I want product people, Lenny, to get out, who are doing digital work to get out of the digital world and look at products outside the digital world for inspiration and thinking, because I don't want you all looking at the same stuff. You're going to just create the same stuff. I love tools like Calendly, which I just didn't... I've been using for years, but no one could get it right until they got it right. Those are great. How's that for an answer?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:06):\nThat's incredible. So what is it called again and where do you find it?\n\nPhyl Terry (01:47:09):\nAnd it's going to be on the Lenny page. If you get on [inaudible 01:47:12], if you do Landmark Herodotus or Landmark Thucydides, either one, you'll get there. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:19):\nOh my God. Sounds incredible. Great choice. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often like to think back to and share with friends or family?\n\nPhyl Terry (01:47:27):\nOf course, we talked about asking for help, and I say that a lot. But I also love, and I said this earlier, books are machines to think with. And as product people, Marty and I talk about this all the time, we have to be thinking. And I coach people all the time, how can I think more? You've got to read more because books are machines to think with. Good books. There's a lot of bad books in the business world, but good books. Good books, thoughtful books. Books that'll help and shift your perspective, whether it's history or science. I read widely, and I want you to do the same. Books are machines to think with. That's probably one of my greatest lines.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:09):\nFinal question. Usually I try to make this fun, but I want it to come back to something practical for people. So to leave people with something they could do this week to help them find a job or help them improve the chances of finding their job, what's something you'd recommend?\n\nPhyl Terry (01:48:22):\nI have one very simple thing. Go to Phyl.org and sign up for a Job Search Council.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:28):\nThere we go.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:48:29):\nIt's free and it will transform your search. Is it a good [inaudible 01:48:34] answer, or were you looking for something different, Lenny?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:36):\nBeautiful answer. It also is exactly what I would've asked you next, which is just where do people go find the stuff you're up to and learn more about things that we've been talking about?\n\nPhyl Terry (01:48:44):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:44):\nThere's phyl.org and then there's phyl.org/lenny, which has a lot of the templates and things that you referenced.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:48:49):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:50):\nAmazing. Final actual question, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nPhyl Terry (01:48:54):\nThat's such a lovely question. So on the Lenny page at Phyl.org, I outline some ways. We're raising $100,000 right now to build a platform for job seekers. It will remain free for job seekers. Part of what I'm doing is I'm doing a speaking tour on AI, and I'm taking all my speaking fees and putting it to this, but people can also make a donation just to that. They can also volunteer. And we're looking for, if anyone's a Salesforce admin, I'd love to have you volunteer with us. If any of you have really good PHP experience, let me know. If any of you are really good at Typeform or Formsite, which is a tool I don't like much. By the way, if anyone from Formsite is listening, your tool sucks. You need to really improve the product there. There's a lot of different ways that you can help, but those are some of the things.\n\n(01:49:48):\nBut most importantly, tell someone who you know in your life who's looking for a job, that there's a community here for you that's free, that has all these smart tools and resources and people who are genuinely here to help you and who will help transform your search in this very hard moment. People ask me, \"Is this good in the hard moment?\" This is born out of hard moments.\n\n(01:50:12):\nIn a great job market, it's easier to say, \"Oh, I can just grab a job.\" You need to be more thoughtful in the down market. Now, I think you should be in the up market too. This is our moment to be there for people. This is what. And I would love, so many people still don't know this, Lenny, we want millions of people. We want to help millions of people. We have 20,000 hours of volunteer time already. We want to have millions of hours of volunteer time. We are changing something about the way capitalism works with this community. We are changing this negative consequence of creative destruction that people have just been left to fend with on their own.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:50:54):\nWell, I'm excited to be helping spread the word. Phyl, you're wonderful. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:51:00):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:51:02):\nBye, everyone.\n\nPhyl Terry (01:51:02):\nBye. Thank you, everybody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:51:06):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Building Wiz: the fastest-growing startup in history | Raaz Herzberg (CMO and VP Product Strategy)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nYou're one of the first 10 employees, you're the first product manager. It was when you joined, the founders didn't really have an idea figured out yet. When they landed on an idea, and then ended up being wrong, ended up not working. Six weeks after you joined, there was a pivot.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:07:01):\nAt the time, we didn't really have a solid product yet. We would have 10 to 15 meetings every day with potential customers. I was hired as the first product manager. I sat in on those calls.\n\n(00:07:01):\nI still did not exactly understand what we were going to build, which was confusing, because I was a product manager, so I was supposed to start building it, and so, at some point, it was like, \"I have to ask, what exactly are we doing here?\" And that ended up pivoting us around to cloud security.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):\nSo things started to click a little bit more, you started seeing enthusiasm. Can you talk about just what that phase was like?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:07:01):\nWe really felt the type of questions change, right? Silly. The call sounded like, again, \"How are you pricing this, or when can we start doing a POV?\" I think naturally, as human beings, you have a bias to look for affirmation, versus a bias for what you don't want to hear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):\nYou started as an engineer, you moved into product, and now you're marketing, which is not a traditional path.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:07:01):\nI had a ton to learn about marketing, with what I knew really well, with ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):\nToday, my guest is Raaz Herzberg. Raaz is chief marketing officer and VP of product strategy at Wiz. Before moving into marketing, Raaz was an engineer, and then, for most of her career, was a product manager. Prior to Wiz, Raaz led security products in Microsoft, including Azure Sentinel, and with Wiz, moved from VP of product to CMO.\n\n(00:07:01):\nIf you haven't heard of Wiz, it's not only the world's fastest growing security company, it's also the fastest growing software company in history, hitting 100 million ARR, just 18 months after founding, and then, just under five years after founding, was rumored to be exploring an acquisition by Google for over $23 billion.\n\n(00:07:01):\nEven more wild, as you'll hear in our conversation, the team initially went in circles on what they wanted to build. And it took them awhile to actually land on the idea that is basically the most intense product market fit of any B2B company ever.\n\n(00:07:01):\nIn our conversation, Raaz shares what signals told her and the team that the original idea wasn't going to work, and that what changed in their conversations, when they finally found product market fit, why she moved into marketing, and what she wished she knew as a product leader from her new marketing lens, also, her perspective on marketing, and what marketing people often get wrong, and why CMOs often fail. Also something she calls the dummy explanation. Why you need to pay attention to where the heat is within the organization.\n\n(00:07:01):\nShe shares her most contrarian take on leadership, and so much more. This was such a fun episode, and there's so much to learn here for product leaders, for marketing leaders, and for founders.\n\n(00:07:01):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes, and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Raaz Herzberg.\n\n(00:07:01):\nRaaz, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:07:01):\nThank you for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):\nSo I want to start by giving a little context on Wiz, for folks that aren't super familiar with the company. You launched just under five years ago, at this point. Within 18 months, you all hit a hundred million ARR, which is the fastest growth rate in history of any software company. It's faster than the two other companies I've had on the podcast, that also claim to be the fastest growing software companies, Deal and Ramp. You guys grew even faster.\n\n(00:07:01):\nI read that you are at over 500 million ARR now. I know it's also not confirmed, but a certain company that rhymes with Loogle, offered to buy you guys for $23 billion, and y'all turned that down, decided to stay private. And also, something like 50% of Fortune 100 companies are customers of Wiz.\n\n(00:07:01):\nIs there anything I missed? Anything I got wrong?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:07:01):\nNever heard of that Loogle company, but other than that, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):\nOkay. Okay, great. We're going to come back to that. What's even crazier is in spite of that, when you joined the company, you were employee, something like, number seven?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:07:01):\nYeah, we kind of started, I feel like, the founders, and the first six, seven employees, we just started at once.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication, and SCIM provisioning.\n\n(00:07:01):\nThat's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand, so that you can ship quickly, and get back to building other features.\n\n(00:07:01):\nToday, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine grain authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google, to power Google Docs and YouTube.\n\n(00:07:01):\nThis enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale, while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted, to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control, or other enterprise features, like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS.\n\n(00:07:01):\nIt's a drop-in replacement for Auth-Zero, and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workok.com to learn more. That's workos.com.\n\n(00:07:01):\nThis episode is brought to you by Rippling, a single platform to build and scale your startup on. Rippling handles all the \"can't get it wrong\" admin work of payroll and benefits, giving you back hours every week, but it does a lot more than that. Rippling is a game-changer for the entire company, with tools for HR, IT and spend, all built from the ground up, and designed to work together seamlessly.\n\n(00:07:01):\nJust hired someone? Rippling makes onboarding easy, whether your new hire's sitting next to you, or halfway across the world. In just a few clicks, Rippling automatically generates an offer letter, ships a laptop with the necessary apps and permissions, and even delivers a corporate card.\n\n(00:07:01):\nAn employee needs to update their benefits contribution? When they do it in Rippling, that change automatically syncs to payroll. CTO forgot her laptop in an Uber? Lock it remotely, with Rippling.\n\n(00:07:01):\nMany startups I've invested in, like Sprig, Elemy and ClassDojo, use Rippling, because it's a force multiplier for lean teams, helping them eliminate major headaches, and operate their business more efficiently. For a limited time, Rippling is giving Lenny's listeners three months off.\n\n(00:07:01):\nTo redeem, visit rippling.com/lenny. That's rippling.com/lenny. Okay, so for one of the first 10 employees, you're the first product manager at Wiz.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:07:01):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:02):\nAnd what I read is that when you joined, the founders didn't really have an idea figured out yet, when they landed on an idea, and it ended up being wrong, ended up not working. Six weeks after you joined, there was a pivot.\n\n(00:07:02):\nSo the fact that that was true, and you went from this, \"This isn't working,\" to boom, $100 million dollars AR, I want to spend some time here, because I think there's a lot people can learn here.\n\n(00:07:13):\nSo let me just ask, looking back at that point when the idea wasn't working to realizing, \"Hey, maybe this is a better idea,\" what do you remember are some signals that told you this isn't working, and okay, maybe this is, because a lot of founders are in that stage with their products?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:07:31):\nWhen we started, it wasn't even Wiz. The company was literally officially founded as Beyond Networks, because there was this idea of, \"Hey, we want to do something in the network security space.\"\n\n(00:07:43):\nActually, myself and the founding team, and also, the other five engineers that started with us, we actually all came from a background of building cloud security products before, but this time it was like, \"Okay, we actually don't want to do cloud security, we want to do network security.\"\n\n(00:08:00):\nWhat happened was in those initial few weeks, it also, we started was literally, exactly, Wiz was founded together with COVID. It was that March when the whole world shut down. Suddenly, everything went terribly, terribly strange on all of us. That's when Wiz started.\n\n(00:08:19):\nSo it was like, our days looked like talking to 10, 15 customers. Wiz is a B2B product, the buyer is the CISO, the people, the person that owns basically security for the entire company. So we would have 10 to 15 meetings every day, with potential customers.\n\n(00:08:39):\nAt the time, we didn't really have a solid product yet, but we had an idea, and the deck explaining our idea, and what we're going to build, and why. We were all a very technical group of people, and especially, our founding team, a staff, our CEO at Wiz. Before Wiz, he led the entire division of all of the Microsoft cloud security products. So they're very, very impressive, very technical, very well known and respected in the industry.\n\n(00:09:09):\nAnd so, we would join a call, and kind of present and walk through our idea, and the person on the other end would be like, \"Oh, it sounds interesting. Oh yes, sounds interesting, we'd love to hear more. Yes, perfect. Sounds interesting, we'd love to hear more.\" And you finished calls with a good feeling, like the person said, \"Oh yes, interesting, interesting.\"\n\n(00:09:32):\nBut like you said, I was hired as a first product manager. I sat in on those calls, sometimes officially participating, sometimes, even, not officially participating, but listening on all of the calls, and I finished a couple of weeks of that, which is a lot of calls, I think, two weeks or something. I still did not exactly understand what we were going to build, which was confusing, because I was a product manager, so I was supposed to start building it, in some ways, go to the dev team and start building it. And that was a point where I felt like, \"I don't know what we are talking about exactly.\"\n\n(00:10:10):\nNow, I really thought, \"I don't know what we're talking about. I thought they all understood what we're building, and I thought every customer we had in the call, understood that we were building.\" It's just that I did not understand what we were building.\n\n(00:10:24):\nAt some point, it was like, \"Okay, I have to ask. What exactly are we,\" like, In the details, right? Not in describing a big problem, in a high level, big potential approach to solving it, but what exactly are we doing here?\n\n(00:10:44):\nAnd I think that that ended up opening a really deep discussion of, \"Okay, wait, maybe we are telling a bit of a broad story, and maybe the person on the other end is not going to tell you.\" They're not incentivized to tell you, \"You know what? I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n(00:11:02):\nIt's really, I guess they felt a bit like me in some ways, and they were like, \"Oh, it's a really smart group of people. I'm sure they're building something interesting.\" So yeah, interesting. They're not incentivized to really dig, deep dive into the problems, right?\n\n(00:11:14):\nSo I think that opened up a discussion for us, and we kind of understood that we were listening in the wrong way, maybe, that we were looking for positive reinforcements, but not really listening intently to signs of deep enthusiasm, and that ended up pivoting us around to cloud security.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:31):\nThere's so much to learn, just from the short story, and I want to get into what you started hearing that made it sound like, \"Okay, wait, maybe this is a better idea.\" But first of all, just the fact that you're doing 10 to 15 calls a day, you said?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:11:41):\nThat was a bit of, in some weird way ... Again, Wiz was founded in that terrible March, where the world closed down. It seemed, at the time, a really bad time to start a company. Markets were frozen, and everything.\n\n(00:11:55):\nEven my mom, which knows nothing about what exactly I do or why, I mean, I left Microsoft to join Wiz, even my mom was calling me and telling me, \"This is not a good time to join a startup.\" But it ended up being in some ways, like an advantage, because everybody were home. Suddenly, everybody were home, no meetings, no travel.\n\n(00:12:15):\nSo suddenly, C-Sales, which are busy people, and we started, originally based in Tel Aviv, so we couldn't even fly, but suddenly, it didn't matter. Because, I mean, everybody's home. So yeah, we took 10-15 calls a day, back to back to back.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:30):\nI think that alone is a really important lesson of just, that's how you discover something that isn't working/find the thing that is working is, do many, many calls.\n\n(00:12:38):\nThat is a lot of calls. I don't even know how someone has time to do 10 to 15 calls a day. But again, I think that's how you do this. So I think that alone is a really important lesson for folks to take away.\n\n(00:12:46):\nI love this point, that people are going to try to be nice to you, especially if they think you're really smart, and especially if you're describing things that might be helpful to them, but what you're sharing is, you need to not trust, that often is deceiving.\n\n(00:13:03):\nTalk about what it felt when it moved from just, \"Oh, this is cool, this is nice, and maybe let's talk more,\" to, \"Oh, maybe this is actually something they'll buy.\"\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:13:12):\nWe really felt the type of questions change. Suddenly, the call didn't end, was like, \"Oh, this sounds super interesting. Sure, please update me. I'd love to hear more.\" Certainly, the call sounded like, \"Wait, again, how are you pricing this? How much will this cost?\" Or, \"Wait? When can we start doing a POV? How long is a POV?\" Or somebody would finish the call, and be like, \"Okay, I know exactly who I need to connect you to in my team.\"\n\n(00:13:35):\nThose are really strong indications that are the type of indications we learned to look for. Although there's something I think, at the beginning of a company, it's very scary. I think naturally, as human beings, you want to get affirmation from the other side.\n\n(00:13:53):\nSo you're actually, you have a bias to look for affirmation, versus a bias to look for what you don't want to hear. That's just natural, being a person.\n\n(00:14:04):\nSo I felt like, that is what we ended up really being in tune with. \"No, I have to understand. They're intently interested. They want to connect me to somebody. They want to know how much this costs.\"\n\n(00:14:15):\nIf somebody just tells you, like you said, \"Oh, super cool, yeah, I want to take this as a good sign, but I shouldn't.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:23):\nIt's almost like you need to see them pushing for the next step is what I'm hearing is, \"Let's do a POV, what's the next step to do this? I want to connect you to this person, to talk further about this,\" versus just, \"Oh yeah, this is awesome. Thank you.\" And then, okay, bye.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:14:34):\nYeah, exactly. And also, in B2B, that is really the process you have to take, after you have to get connected to the actual team that will test the tools, will deploy it. There needs to be real passion about doing something, and I guess that is the difference. It's real passion about, \"Hey, I want this right now.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:54):\nThe other point you made is that you were the person, nobody was saying this thing that was this elephant in the room, almost of, \"What are we even building? I don't understand what's happening here.\"\n\n(00:15:05):\nI read somewhere that you were like, you told, \"I need to quit. I don't understand what this is, and I'm not the right person for this role,\" and it turned out, nobody understood exactly what was going on. Can you share that story?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:15:17):\nIt's funny, because it's a story that some of the founders tell, and they tell differently. They tell, \"She came to us, and she was like, we have to rethink,\" but that was not my perspective at all, right? My perspective was genuinely, \"Okay, I have to confess, that was my perspective.\"\n\n(00:15:38):\nI was sure that I was the only one not understanding. It's hard to get the courage, I guess. Sometimes, it's hard to get the courage to say, \"Actually, I don't understand.\" But I think by now, in my career, it's my favorite question.\n\n(00:15:56):\nI feel like I say, \"I don't understand,\" a lot of times a day. I think, if you build a company with the right type of culture, in a sense, then it's not a shame to say, \"I don't understand, or please explain again.\"\n\n(00:16:14):\nIt's having that culture in place that enables it. And I also have to say, when I think of the founding team, and the founding team in Wiz, Wiz is a very flat organization, in some ways. It's not about seniority, it's really about driving impact, and everybody can have a seat on the table, and voices are heard.\n\n(00:16:32):\nAnd I think it also reflects really highly about them, just giving me the seat at the table, in a sense, to be even able to say, \"I don't understand.\"\n\n(00:16:41):\nThen, when I'm saying I don't understand, not actually being open to, \"Oh, maybe we have to also think again.\" I think that tells a lot about the culture, even, to this day.\n\n(00:16:52):\nBut it's definitely, for me, it's a very learned quality over my progression of my career, actually allowing myself to be more vulnerable, more easier in saying, \"I don't understand, or I don't know.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:05):\nI love this lesson so much. One, partly because you said it's really scary to be the person that's like, \"I don't understand,\" right?\n\n(00:17:12):\nThat puts you, that's a very vulnerable thing to say, because you're like, \"What? She doesn't get it. Maybe she is not as smart as we thought.\" That can't be easy, to be the person doing that.\n\n(00:17:22):\nThe other thing is this reminds me of Tomer Cohen, LinkedIn CPO, has this really great phrase, \"We may be wrong, but we're not confused.\" I feel like that's exactly what you're saying here.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:17:31):\nExactly, which is why I love this question to this day. I love it. I do think that if something is not easy to understand, then maybe it needs a bit more chewing on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:46):\nI love that. Okay, so things started to click a little bit more. You started seeing enthusiasm. Can you talk about just what that phase was like, and any lessons from just that turn to, things are actually working?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:17:59):\nI have to say, I think the feeling, after we made that switch, what ended up happening is that after that big conversation that we know, I don't understand, we ended up having, and this never happens, I don't think it's ever happened since. It was almost a long, five-hour discussion, with all of the founders, where we decided to move away from that pivot to cloud security, which is what we really, in some ways, know best.\n\n(00:18:25):\nThat's our background, that's what we did before, and we felt the problems there was so big and so strong, and once we started having the conversations with the new pivot to cloud security, the room felt so different. I mean, it was all over Zoom, but our room, it felt very different.\n\n(00:18:49):\nOnce we found the right path, it was so easy to distinguish it from the wrong path, in some ways, because we did start getting those strong signals. And in some ways, they pushed us forward.\n\n(00:19:02):\nA customer was like, \"Okay, I want to start a POV,\" and we're like, \"Oh, okay. Of course. Let's schedule for Thursday next week, or something. We tried to even postpone it a bit, because we had to run fast.\"\n\n(00:19:15):\nAnother learning I have from that phase was, I explicitly remember that first conversation, where it was like, \"Okay, let's do a POV.\" It was a Fortune 10 company, a really big company, and we had a beginning of a product. We wanted to buy some time, until we actually started the POV.\n\n(00:19:33):\nJust because of that, we said, \"Okay, also we want to really understand exactly what they will connect to us as part of the POV,\" because everything was so initial. So we put this long list of technical questions, \"What are you using for this? What are you doing here? What are you [inaudible 00:19:47]?\" On the one hand, because we needed to know, to actually build a thing, on the other end, just because we wanted to buy time, and I was super scared.\n\n(00:19:55):\nI remember studying that e-mail, and being like, \"Ugh, they want a POV. And now, I'm going to scare them away, with this list of things they have to do, and list of questions, like it's counterintuitive.\"\n\n(00:20:06):\nBut actually, it came back filled a day later, and I remember my lesson being, \"You know what? This is actually good. I want to make sure they're committed, right? I don't want to push somebody into a POV, if he is not committed to me at this stage.\" I mean, it's not a well-built product. It's going to be a journey we take together, so they need to really want it. I need that commitment from the other side.\n\n(00:20:32):\nI'm not trying to push something on someone, especially not at this point, and my opinion, not ever, not even today, not even when you sell at large scales. I'm not trying to push anybody to anything, I really want to make sure they want it. I have to feel that want back. So that was another learning for me.\n\n(00:20:49):\nIt's like, first of all, when it works, it works, and you do know when it works. And the second is, \"Don't be too afraid to get the pull from the customer.\" It's okay. You need that pull from the other end, as well. Don't push too hard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:03):\nI know people always talk about, \"Look for pull,\" and I love that you're describing what pull looks like. Somebody's next day, filling out a really complicated annoying questionnaire, because they just want this product they've never heard of before you chatted with them.\n\n(00:21:14):\nNow, they're like, \"Just give it to me now. I'm going to do anything you need.\" Is there anything else along these lines, before we move into your current role and learnings there?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:21:23):\nI also think that one of the things we did very, almost uniquely, it was, was that, because things started rolling so fast for us, once we found the right path, we ended up selling before we had a seller's team.\n\n(00:21:37):\nWe ended up, almost in some ways, always being behind, right? Okay, I'm closing contracts with people, I haven't hired my first salespersons, I don't know what we're doing here, I don't know how to have the conversations.\n\n(00:21:49):\nBut we ended up learning so much from that, from us, ourselves, us being the founders, myself, closing the deals, actually going all the way to contracts and everything, by ourselves. We learned a lot, we learned a lot.\n\n(00:22:04):\nAnd then, when we hired our first sales hire, it was also like, \"Look, we sold a couple million of this, so you, for sure, as a salesperson, you kind of give that confidence.\"\n\n(00:22:14):\nSo I felt like there was multiple places where that ended up happening, just by accident, because of how fast things ended up happening for us. Actually, it was a really good learning experience to do it for the first time yourselves. I think, sometimes, when you start building a company, you have this wish that if you can't do something, you're going to hire the right person, and he will be able to do it.\n\n(00:22:36):\nOkay, I feel like my message is not clear enough, and we just started this company, it's okay, I'm going to hire my first product marketer, and that's going to be it. Or I feel, we can't close a deal, because I need to hire my first salesperson, and that will be it.\n\n(00:22:49):\nI hardly find that, I don't think we've ever had that work for us, honestly. It's like, if you can't do it one time end to end, and you're the core, core group, the chances of just bringing somebody from the outside to solve that problem, it's wishful, in some ways, but it never ends up that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:08):\nI love this advice so much. There's kind of two parallels here. If the founder can't do it, who has the most context and passion and motivation? It's unlikely an employee's going to be able to do it. And it's similar to the selling point, that if your early customers aren't pulling from you, later customers are not going to have a good time, right?\n\n(00:23:27):\nIt's like, the most passion comes early. How long did you all stay, doing sales as a founding team? How many millions ARR, roughly, do you remember?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:23:39):\nOh, a couple million. I don't remember the exact-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:41):\nA couple million?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:23:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):\nAwesome. That's incredible. Often, the heuristic I hear is, one or two million ARR, and then you start to hire salespeople. Okay, that was an awesome lesson. I love that.\n\n(00:23:53):\nI want to talk about your current role. So currently, you're CMO, and also, VP of product strategy at Wiz. You started as an engineer, you moved into product, and now you're in marketing, which is not a traditional path, especially for product people. First of all, why did you decide to move into marketing, from product?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:24:11):\nYeah, it's not a traditional path for anyone, I think, also not one I would have necessarily expected myself to be on. First of all, it's not like I had this plan, right?\n\n(00:24:22):\nIn general, I myself, people sometimes ask me about career progression, and I never had a plan for anything. That is just, the only thing I did was follow good people around. That's it. I never had a plan for anything I do.\n\n(00:24:36):\nSo myself, coming to Wiz was following Assaf and Ynon in the founding team. And two and a half years into Wiz, at that time, Wiz was already, it was a very clear product market fit.\n\n(00:24:50):\nOur revenues were already there. We had a sales team that was fully functioning, but at that point at Wiz, we felt marketing was still something we didn't fully figure out. It wasn't working super well for us. We were at this stage where, yes, if there was a POV, a proof of value happening, we would win it, versus competition.\n\n(00:25:13):\nBut many times, we would come to a customer, and they would be like, \"Oh, I wish we heard of Wiz, we just signed with a competitor,\" which it breaks your heart, because I know they would have chosen me, had they heard about me in time. So you started feeling that challenge around awareness and marketing. So two and a half years into the company, basically Assaf, our CEO, asked me if I was willing to take on marketing.\n\n(00:25:42):\nOriginally, I thought it was, I remember, he knocked on my, bothered me while I was working on my computer, and we went into this super cold room. It was like, when you were a fast-growing startup, all of the rooms are always full, you know what I mean?\n\n(00:25:58):\nWe went into this server room, which is freezing cold, and I was in the middle of something, and he told me, \"I think you should lead the marketing org now.\" I told him, \"Okay.\" I was like, \"Assaf, I'm cold, I'm going back to work. I have a lot to do.\" It sounded that bizarre to me.\n\n(00:26:12):\nIt's not only, do they not know marketing, I spent my life in engineering, and in any product, it's not the go to market side, even. I was never part of the go to market, or I have never heard of a lead in my life. I did not know the word \"pipeline.\"\n\n(00:26:26):\nAll of those things were very remote to me, very. It sounded like such a bizarre motion. But that was on a Thursday, and then, I spent the weekend, because he asked me to, and again, I just follow good people, and do what they tell me to do.\n\n(00:26:42):\nSo I spent the weekend listening to a ton of podcasts, talking to CMOs, just to even understand what do CMOs do, what do marketing orgs do in B2B companies?\n\n(00:26:51):\nThen I ended up deciding to just give it a try, and we did not know if it was going to work. I also don't know if it's going to work forever, but we ended up deciding to give it a try.\n\n(00:27:04):\nI think the thing that's convinced me to do it was that, in some ways, I really felt like if, in the early days of the company, finding product market fit is a major block for the company. And then, building a sales organization becomes a major block for the company.\n\n(00:27:19):\nI felt like we were at the point, where you have to figure it out to scale. At some point, of every product, people start looking really heavily at brand, whether we think that way, or we don't. When I buy my iPhone, I have no idea how it really is compared to an Android phone. I did not look at the specs. I truly have no idea.\n\n(00:27:39):\nSo why do I buy an iPhone? I just know it's the thing to buy. B2B products, even the most complex products, people are still people. They still buy it, because brand matters a lot.\n\n(00:27:53):\nThat was part of what convinced me that this is super important. So if I'm asked to attempt, at least try, because I do think it's really important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:05):\nI love this. I love the detail of the cold room, by the way. Speaking of cold, when we were chatting earlier, you had this really beautiful metaphor of heat. And where heat is within an organization and how it shifts, as the company grows. Can you share that?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:28:19):\nYeah, it's exactly that. It's like that in the early, early days when we just started with, I remember, I felt like the heat was in the product kitchen. Because it's like, everybody's waiting to have something, people want to start doing something, right?\n\n(00:28:34):\nThen they felt like, \"Okay, you start understanding it,\" and now, the heat moves a bit to the engineering side like, \"Okay, build it. Somebody wants it, build it, make it work.\"\n\n(00:28:44):\nThen I felt, \"Okay, so we close a couple of deals now,\" right? We had our first couple of clients. Now you bring in sales, and the heat moves to sales, because they're like, \"Okay, we have this thing, now go sell it.\" And then, the heat starts moving to marketing, in my opinion, where it's like, \"Okay, we have a product market fit. Salespeople can sell it, but they're saying, 'Give me more pipeline like, 'Hey, nobody heard of Wiz. Give me more.'\"\n\n(00:29:09):\nSo the heat moves to marketing, at that point. That's kind of, I've always felt like, yeah, in some ways, I also naturally, I guess, follow the heat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:18):\nAnd I think it's actually more so, that they put the best people in the places that need the most help. Clearly, that was you, when they did that.\n\n(00:29:27):\nThis episode is brought to you by Cloudinary, the foundational technology for all images and video on the internet, trusted by over two million developers, and many of the world's leading brands.\n\n(00:29:39):\nCloudinary is the API-first image and video management platform built for product leaders, who rely on visual storytelling to express their unique product value, who are building engaging web and app experiences, and who understand that harnessing the power of AI to automate is the only way forward.\n\n(00:29:56):\nGil Grossman, engineering team lead at Fiverr, says that \"our users share billions of images, video and audio files.

He's a partner at Index Ventures, and here's what he told me, speaking of this move to marketing.\n\n(00:30:32):\nHe said that when you were in your first board meeting, the Wiz board meeting, presenting marketing, and sharing your plan, and you asked him, \"Hey, can you introduce me to all these marketing leaders, so I can learn from them,\" he basically did the opposite.\n\n(00:30:44):\nHe's like, \"No, I'm going to introduce all my marketing leaders to you, because I think they need to learn from you.\" Why do you think that's the case?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:30:51):\nI think Shardul is very kind. I deeply remember that meeting, because funny enough, it was my first board meeting ever. That is a funny thing by itself, because Wiz's board, we have Shardul on our board, we have Doug Leon, and we have Jeff from Insights.\n\n(00:31:09):\nIt's almost like, it's very humbling to sit down in front of those people, period. And since I decided to take marketing, and I took to the CMO role, this was also my first board meeting ever.\n\n(00:31:23):\nAnd also, it was the meeting where it's, in some ways, I was not that. I was like, \"Okay, we took our product manager person, she was never a CMO at any company, and now she has a CMO here.\" So it was just very, the whole setting was very stressful for me.\n\n(00:31:43):\nI just ended up, it was like, I think we just had the meeting two months after I took over marketing. So it was more of an update of, \"Hey, those are the changes I've made, and this is how I'm thinking of approaching this, and this is all the things I've done in the past two months.\"\n\n(00:31:59):\nIt's funny, because I'm a very non-traditional marketer, just because I really don't know marketing. At this point, I kind of know already, because I've been doing it for two years, and I read a lot, but at that point, I generally did not know. I could not even explain to you how untraditional my approach was, in some ways.\n\n(00:32:16):\nI just really did what I thought. I mean, I had a ton to learn about marketing, but what I knew really well was the problem we solved, and I really knew our audience.\n\n(00:32:28):\nI myself, I come from security, I come from cloud security, I read all of the right Twitters, and I follow all of the right people on Twitter, and I read all of the right blogs.\n\n(00:32:36):\nI know it's funny, I know what matters, I know it's interesting right now, generally because, this is my space. I mean, I live in that space, truly, as a customer. So I was just thinking, \"Okay, what are things I could do, to start fixing the problem that mattered most?\" And that was, nobody heard of Wiz at that time.\n\n(00:32:59):\nThose were just, I was saying, \"Okay, I think, in order to do that, I'm willing to take chances, I'll just focus on making a lot of noise.\" And I think, even in that short time of two months, we saw changes happening already, in some ways.\n\n(00:33:16):\nSo I think, that what's Shardul meant by that, of course, although I do think he's being very, very kind, and I have learned a lot from many, many marketing people, including my own team, by the way, which is another interesting thing., right?\n\n(00:33:28):\nI took over a large team, of people who are marketers, and I'm this person knows nothing about marketing, but will now manage this. So I learned a lot from many marketers, including my own exceptional team.\n\n(00:33:41):\nBut I think he meant, really looking at it differently, just thinking, \"Okay, what is the end to the goal of having the right people hear the right thing about my company, ASAP,\" versus a ton of traditional aspects, of building pipelines and different things they really did not know how to do, at that time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:01):\nSo following that thread, I'm curious, what is it that you think CMOs mistake, or often do wrong? Why do you think CMOs often don't work out, and they brought in someone like you, with this very fresh perspective? Where do you think folks often go wrong?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:34:16):\nFirst of all, I think CMO is a very, very hard role. And also, I think it's a role that is very hard to do without a lot of trust, and without a deep connection to the founding team. Everything you do in marketing is very visible, and you're kind of touching something that matters so deeply to the founding team, and you are the one representing it to the world.\n\n(00:34:43):\nSo it's very hard to build that trust, and it's very easy to break it, because one bad ad, or something that one of the founding team will say, \"Oh, this is not us, this is not what I mean, this is not the right thing,\" it breaks the trust really easily.\n\n(00:35:00):\nAnd I think it's especially challenging. I mean, I really don't know how somebody that does not come from from a security background could be successful deeply, in this type of a role, for a company like Wiz, because it is really about understanding your customers, and it is really about understanding your product. I think that's very, very hard to gain.\n\n(00:35:21):\nSo I guess I would say, I think it's the deep trust you need with the founding team, and the really deep connection you need to the product, and to the market. I think both of that, when you come from the outside, in a way, because you are not part of the founding team, and also, you maybe come from outside the market, sometimes, because it's a very technical market or it's a very different domain, then I think it's two really big challenges.\n\n(00:35:47):\nI'm not saying you can't come over them, but I think, it's just a very, very hard job. On top of that, it's a very diverse job. When I was a product manager, I managed product managers. I know exactly what they like, what they don't like. That's my audience, I know who to hire. I have the best network, I know every single PM and security around me. It's so different.\n\n(00:36:05):\nWhen you are a marketing leader, you manage performance marketing, which is a numbers game. You manage designers and brand, and then you manage events and field. There's nothing in between those things that is deeply correlated. Sp it's just a very, very challenging and very interesting role.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:23):\nThis trust point is so interesting, especially based on what you said earlier, where what you want it to do is create noise, take some risks. That's extra hard, if you're not someone that the founding team trusts.\n\n(00:36:35):\nCan you share some of the things you did that helped create noise, and get the Wiz name out there, that might inspire folks of like, \"Oh, that was really cool, we should do something like that?\"\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:36:43):\nYeah. Another insight I had about marketing in the early days was how different it is from product. As a product manager, I was always, and still believe, it's so important to think really hard about everything you add. Less is more.\n\n(00:36:59):\nIf you decide to build a feature in a product, then A, you're taking engineering time, which is the most valuable resource in every company, in my opinion, and B, in some ways, you can never take it back. It's complicated your product. Even if one customer likes it and uses it, at least at B2B, you're never going to be able to suddenly take it away.\n\n(00:37:19):\nEvery new feature you add to your product, you'll have to think about, \"Okay, how does it work with that feature?\" So it's like making a mistake, adding something to the product that is not the right thing, or that is not truly, truly what your customer needed, even if it's what they asked for. But if it's not what they truly needed, it has a huge cost associated with it.\n\n(00:37:40):\nMarketing is quite the opposite, in my opinion. There's no cost to anything, no maintenance to anything, no technical depth, no anything. If tomorrow I post a video on Wiz's LinkedIn page, and I think that video is super funny, and nobody likes that video, nothing happened.\n\n(00:37:54):\nTomorrow, I'll post a different video, no maintenance, bye-bye, forgot it ever happened. In some ways, it dawned on me how opposite those things were, and I was like, \"Okay, we have to just use it to our advantage. Let's try everything, let's try everything. I'm trying to make noise.\"\n\n(00:38:11):\nIt was right before, when I took over, it was before RSA. RSA is the Super Bowl of security companies. So it's where every vendor's come to showcase, and all of our buyers are there, and you know how those conferences go. You pay for having a space assigned to you, and it's a very expensive space to assign to yourself.\n\n(00:38:33):\nAnd we had the exact same spot we had the year before. I said, \"Okay, it's a booth at a conference. I'll just make it the weirdest booth ever, because my goal is just having people look and be like, 'Oh, what is Wiz, right? Because they've never heard of me.\"\n\n(00:38:48):\nInstead of doing a classical cyber booth, I decided to say, \"Okay, let's scrap our booth, and do a Wiz of Oz booth,\" which literally looked like a Wiz of Oz booth, and we had actors, like Dorothy, and all those things hanging around there.\n\n(00:39:03):\nIt looked nothing like any booths in the show, which is a cybersecurity show, things are red and black, and people with hoodies. And we decided to take a completely opposite approach.\n\n(00:39:14):\nIn general, I also decided that we're going to take a completely opposite approach was brand. I wanted Wiz's brand to, again, my first motive, stand out.\n\n(00:39:23):\nI wanted Wiz to have a very positive, optimistic type of brand. So I went all in on, \"Scrap whatever we were doing before, which was dark, and go pink, go bright blue, always go optimistic, and focused on magic, not scaring people from the facts, but magic.\" And that ended up, and it was scary, don't get me wrong.\n\n(00:39:45):\nHalf of me was like, I remember feeling so scared walking to the show, to the floor trade. Because I was like, \"Is this going to be the most terrible, bizarre? Are people going to be like, 'What is she thinking?'\" So I knew it could either be a failure, or a hit.\n\n(00:40:04):\nAnd it ended up, the amount of people that stopped by our booth was five times the amount of people that stopped by the year before. It's the exact same space, the exact same investment, because you invest in the space.\n\n(00:40:16):\nBut also, ever since we do themed booths, every time, we change themes to keep it fun. At this point, you won't see other cyber companies even doing themes. We were just, \"Okay, we'll do whatever it takes to make noise,\" and this is just one example.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:29):\nThat is an amazing story. You said that other companies now try to do something similar, right? Oh, man. So along these lines, when we were chatting earlier, you shared that you kind of have this mindset of being very okay with failing, that's a core part of you.\n\n(00:40:46):\nAnd it feels like, that comes up again and again in the stories you share, where you just try stuff, and you're okay if it doesn't work out. Can you just talk about that part, and why that's so important?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:40:54):\nAlmost every single thing I've done in my career, in some ways, even before, I never thought I was going to be successful in it. I guess there's a lot of times, it's a lot of talk about being more confident than yourself. I don't know, at least for me, I don't really know if that's a real option, okay?\n\n(00:41:17):\nI just know that I'm kind of okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something, and still attempting it. That is the thing that has grown in me where, when I took the job, it was, I was sure, I was sure they got confused, that they offered to take me with him.\n\n(00:41:36):\nI was certain that it's going to be like, \"Okay, they're going to figure out that I'm not the right fit for that super smart and talented group of people,\" who have all worked together before, by the way, I was sure they're going to find me out.\n\n(00:41:48):\nAnd I was pretty sure I was going to fail, but I will still take it. I thought I was going to fill the product manager role, too, although I did have the experience.\n\n(00:41:58):\nSo that also makes it easier to move, in some ways. If I think I'm going to fail with anything, I'm like, \"Okay, whatever, I'll try,\" and I think over time, yeah, it releases you a bit. Sure, I might fail.\n\n(00:42:09):\nBy the way, I might still fail. It's also fine. Even in my current role, probably not for every scale, it'll make sense for me to do it, but that's also fine. It's still just giving yourself the opportunity to fail.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:23):\nThat is really empowering. Is there anything that helps you build that skill, that's not natural to a lot of people, being okay with failure, and leaning into things that they think they'll probably fail at? Where did that come from, for you?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:42:34):\nYeah, depending on what you believe in, everything comes from childhood. In some ways, I do think it has to do with, I think the way my mom raised me, my mom really believed that if you're good at something, so that's not where you should invest your energy. She really believed in pushing us to the places where we were less confident in, I guess.\n\n(00:43:00):\nI mean, I was a very shy kid. My natural inclination, as a young kid, was to close the door in my room, read a book. I had no interest in meeting other kids or doing sports or nothing, nothing, really super, super shy. And I think, also slightly unsocial by nature, really.\n\n(00:43:18):\nBut for my mom, she could have been like, \"Oh, so she's really good was books and math, so let's focus. Perfect. Let her build up the skill, and be really good with that.\" But no, she would make me go swimming, and make me go meet other kids.\n\n(00:43:32):\nIn some ways, I feel, she always used to say that friction is good. If you brush your teeth, and there's a bit of blood somewhere, then you need to brush harder there. It's that idea, that friction is kind of good.\n\n(00:43:46):\nIf you're good at something already, then you're good at something already. So it's a bit more about learning how to learn, how to push yourself in other areas.\n\n(00:43:54):\nI think she put hard work and courage, in some ways, or friction, mostly, above talent. Talent only gets you so far, but that hard work in the friction gets you more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:09):\nThat is an awesome story. It's interesting that friction is good circles back to the story you shared about creating hurdles for potential prospects early on, and creating, looking for enthusiasm, where they're filling out these long surveys. How about that?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:44:24):\nNo, it's true. You're right. It shows something. It shows if you do, it's always easier to be in inertia, right?\n\n(00:44:32):\nThat's why I also say, sometimes, it's like breakup advice I give my girlfriends over the years, where it's like, \"Well, if you decide to break up with somebody, it's for sure the right decision, right?\"\n\n(00:44:43):\nBecause not breaking up with somebody is much easier. It's so hard to break up. So that makes it, by default, the right decision. So it's like, yes, where there's friction, it means that you put something extra in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:53):\nI want to circle back to marketing/product advice, going back full circle a little bit. So folks that are in product, now that you're in the marketing world, thinking about marketing, what do you think you wish you knew as a product leader, that you think a product leader should be thinking more of, or maybe you miss, that you now see as a marketing leader?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:45:12):\nHaving done products for many years, I really did not understand the criticality of marketing, and even of product marketing. I really did not understand deeply enough that sometimes even gap, between when you're in the product, and you really live inside the product.\n\n(00:45:30):\nIn the technical domain, you can sometimes not understand how far you are from a common person in your market, or a seller in your market. And marketing, in a lot of ways, bridges that gap.\n\n(00:45:44):\nIt's like a multiplier, but the further you get away from the core engineer, than product, then in order for the messages to move correctly, they have to be crystal clear. That is something I understood only when looking at it from the other side. If you're on the product side, you can often work with things that are fluffy or blurry or gray, okay?\n\n(00:46:10):\nSomebody will ask you, \"Can the product do this?\" You'll be like, \"Yeah, not exactly, but it can do, blah, blah, blah,\" kind of work around something, right? It doesn't have to be crystal clear, because you can kind of go around things, in a way, that when you try to scale your message, you can't. It gets lost in translation. You have to be crystal clear, black and white.\n\n(00:46:29):\nYou have to communicate very clearly, especially as an organization scales, you have to communicate very clearly. Suddenly, you're looking at the product org from the outside, in the company that scales fast. And you said, \"Whoa, product marketing, in marketing, plays a really important role, in being able to take that message and amplify it.\"\n\n(00:46:51):\nAnd if you are giving signals that are even a bit gray, fuzzy, then it's not going to work, and you can't expect them to do a good job with it, in some ways. I really, by understanding the go to market perspective, and the user perspective, and the seller perspective, I suddenly understood how things that can look simple on the inside of that side, are very complex, when you cross over to the go to market side. And I think learning the difference is so, so important for product people to understand, that they have to deliver those crystal clear messages about the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:25):\nIs there an example of that, where you're like, \"Oh, wow, I thought this was good, but no, nobody understands what we're talking about?\"\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:47:30):\nThere's so much. I think, for example, in our domain, it's very, almost custom, to talk in a lot of initials, and a lot of things in security are, \"Use initials for them.\" You say CSPM, for Cloud Security Poster Management, and you use a lot of those types of initials, and you keep assuming that the world knows what you mean.\n\n(00:47:51):\nBut then, when actually looked at things over, from the marketing side, if you ask our product people, engineers, \"Where does our product fall in terms of category,\" it would be CNAP, Cloud Native Application Protection. But if you go over and you look at Google, people are not Googling that word. They're Googling, \"Cloud security solution,\" right?\n\n(00:48:13):\nSo that's just a simple and silly example, but it's that example, that when you live inside something very technically inside your market, inside domain, you're very remote, sometimes, by accident from the buyer. So a lot of those learnings clicked for me, only once they saw everything from the marketing side.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:32):\nYou have this concept that you described as a dummy explanation, when someone, you just need it to feel really, really simple. Can you add some color to that?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:48:40):\nYes. It's when I, now in marketing, and in everything we write, and everything our team produces in terms of anything, anything written by Wiz, I keep going back to, I don't want us to forget that we are inside our own bubble.\n\n(00:48:56):\nWe go to work at Wiz every day. Wiz is a cloud security company. We live inside our own bubble, but reminding ourselves that customers don't live in that bubble, they're people in the world. Their life is not Wiz.\n\n(00:49:11):\nSo every time you write something, I wanted to not assume knowledge about Wiz, or knowledge about the product, or deep knowledge about the market. I'll give just a simple example.\n\n(00:49:23):\nWiz itself is based on, part of the deep innovation that Wiz brought to the market that enabled the scale, was a very high correlated signal that's based on a graph database. So inside Wiz, we have the Wiz graph database, for security.\n\n(00:49:37):\nIf you write something that says, the Wiz Graph Database, I don't like it. Because why would a common person know it is the Wiz Graph Database, right? So it's making sure that every single thing you say is understandable by anybody. There's no reason to use complex terminology, when you can keep things straight and simple.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:59):\nEasier said than done, but such a good reminder to always be, is there a framework here? Are you just trying to remember, people outside don't understand anything we are talking about, and simplify it further?\n\n(00:50:10):\nHow do you actually practice that? Because I imagine everyone's, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I know all this stuff,\" but they don't actually do it. Is there any tips there, for how to actually practice this?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:50:18):\nI constantly remind myself about the bubble. Every time somebody says, \"Oh, we haven't changed our color for so long, or a website's headline,\" a lot of those things, for me, it's like, you are the only one that is sick of it.\n\n(00:50:33):\nYour customers are just learning what you put there 10 months ago. You are the only one looking at this thing, day after day after day after day after day. You're actually going to change it, only they're just starting to grasp it, and you're changing it under their feet.\n\n(00:50:46):\nIt's living in that bubble, and constantly reminding myself, it is a bubble. I'm in that Wiz bubble, right, but my audience is not. So yeah, it's a daily reminder. It's a hard daily reminder.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:00):\nThat is so funny. Okay, just a few more questions. One is, so there's four co-founders of Wiz. That right?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:51:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:09):\nWhat your relationship with them, how has that changed over the years, and over time? I imagine it's very difficult being, not a founder, trying to have a lot of influence on strategy and vision, and all these things.\n\n(00:51:23):\nJust, I guess, how has that relationship changed over the years? Anything there that might be helpful to folks, and any advice for people in a similar boat, to work well with founders who are also very product-oriented, and very opinionated about everything?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:51:38):\nYeah, I think the Wiz founding team is a truly incredible team. They also have a very unique story. Wiz is actually their second company together. So before Whiz, they founded Adallom, which sold to Microsoft.\n\n(00:51:51):\nThat's how they all ended up in Microsoft in the first place. Even before that, they all worked together in the Israeli army, so they've known each other for, they've been working together for 30 years, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:02):\nWow.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:52:02):\nIt's a long, long time. Well, not 30, I made them older, like 20, 22, 22 years. It's a very, very, very unique team, where there is complete trust between the team members. Each has his own clear domain, and that's why decisions are made super fast, super fast, because, the complete trust, and everybody has their clearly own domain.\n\n(00:52:31):\nI think the unique thing about Wiz, and I truly think it defines their company's culture to this day, is exactly that they did not have to work hard, to be able to impact strategy, and get a seat at the table.\n\n(00:52:45):\nI think that it's open, it's a very open culture, and an open company, that goes back to the beginning of being able to say, \"I don't understand.\"\n\n(00:52:53):\nThey really believe in employees, and they really believe in giving everybody a chance to have impact. Regardless of title or experience or anything, if you want to drive more impact, you will get the chance. I think it's something I really learned to adore in that team.\n\n(00:53:10):\nIt's like, they will give their trust to someone, and they will allow you to try. And I think it also causes employees to have a lot of loyalty, because you are given those opportunities, and you are given that chance.\n\n(00:53:24):\nIt builds a very, very healthy culture, and I think, also, a culture that's very loyal. Everybody feels part of what's being built here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:32):\nIncredible. And how many employees are there? How large is Wiz at this point? Just for folks to get a sense, if they want to potentially join Wiz, some day?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:53:39):\nAround 1,000 through 500, probably.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:46):\nOkay, awesome. Amazing.\n\n(00:53:47):\nOkay, well, potentially final question. I want to take us to Contrarian Corner. I'm curious if there's something you have a very contrarian opinion about, something that you believe, that a lot of other people don't believe?\n\n(00:53:59):\nWe've already covered a number of things, I think, like that, but is there anything else that comes to mind?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:54:03):\nIt's so funny, because I don't think we've covered anything contrarian.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:05):\nOkay.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:54:09):\nI think one thing is, maybe goes back to what I was talking about before, but it was failing in confidence. I think at least, being a woman in tech, you get talked to a lot about imposter syndrome, and building up her confidence. I actually do think that my approach to it, at least for me, has been just more effective. I won't be able to build that confidence.\n\n(00:54:30):\nI do feel like an imposter, and I know there's always those statistics about many people feeling that way. So I think, maybe just, \"Let's embrace it. I feel like an imposter, you feel like an imposter, everybody feels like an imposter,\" It's kind of, maybe embrace it, but don't let that stop you from making a decision.\n\n(00:54:49):\nMaybe they will find out you're an imposter, maybe let them find out. It's fine. If you think about trying to go to an interview for a company, and you start thinking, \"Oh no, I won't get accepted, they won't take me,\" perfect.\n\n(00:55:03):\nLet them not accept you. You think you're not good enough? Perfect. That's on them, to not accept you, right? Give yourself that opportunity.\n\n(00:55:10):\nAnd I think, for me, maybe less talking about the imposter syndrome, more talking about just, \"Okay, but ignore it. You will never know your limit if you don't try.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:20):\nThe best advice I've heard along these lines, which is basically what you're saying, is that when you take on a new role, you actually are an imposter. You've never done this before, and that's okay, and that's very normal.\n\n(00:55:32):\nMost people in a new role, when they're promoted, given a big opportunity, yeah, you are an imposter in many ways, but that's okay. And that's exactly what you're saying.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:55:39):\nI never heard it, but I love it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:42):\nRaaz, is there anything else you wanted to share, anything else that we haven't touched on, that you think might be helpful to folks, before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:55:49):\nI deeply, deeply believe that we're doing something super special in Wiz, and I think the company is in such an interesting place of hyperscaling, but still keeping that authentic, and I think, flat and enabling culture.\n\n(00:56:02):\nI think there's literally interesting opportunities across every domain. So yeah, just to say that we are always hiring for great people, trying to make an impact.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:13):\nAre there any roles or areas you're specifically most focused on hiring now, in case folks are listening, you're like, \"Oh, shit, I'm going to apply?\"\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:56:19):\nTruly, the beauty of hypersaling is, we are hiring across everything, but also, if you feel super strongly about joining, and you don't find the right role, we'd still love to talk to you. There's many, many things for passionate people to do here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:34):\nAwesome. We'll link to the Career page in the show notes. And with that, Raaz, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:56:41):\nI'm ready, I hope.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:43):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:56:48):\nSo I focus like it was on the product side of things. We mentioned the heat in the kitchen. Actually, one of my most favorite business books, and I've read a lot of them, is probably Setting the Table, by Danny Meyer, which is, he owns Shake Shack, and a chain of really great restaurants in New York.\n\n(00:57:07):\nAnd it's such an interesting business perspective, from a different domain, than obviously tech or SaaS. But there's so many applicable lessons there, from the deep connection to hosting, focusing and obsessing over your customer. Shake Shack, unlike other chains, where they optimize for you not to sit down, they optimize for you to sit down there. It's a very, very unique culture and unique vision, and I've learned a lot. Some of the most memorable lessons come from his management thoughts.\n\n(00:57:39):\nImagine huge chains, but also very high-end restaurants. I think it's a very, very inspiring, inspiring book, and different, just different from my domain, but very applicable in my domain, as well.\n\n(00:57:50):\nAnd then, a second book I really like, I read it early on in Wiz, and so did the entire founding team, I think, the book by Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, No Rules Rules, which also, I think, talks very clearly. Netflix has a super unique culture and story, right?\n\n(00:58:11):\nTalk about pivots, they sold cassettes over mail, and somehow pivoted to what it is today. That's an insane story. Think about pivoting from a tech company, to a company that has production to do, and produces reality TV. Talk about the type of culture you would need to truly pivot, I think it's a super interesting read for anybody thinking about putting strong culture in place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:34):\nI'm going to call an audible, and ask about marketing, specifically. You said that early on, you read some marketing books, and listened to marketing podcasts. Is there anything else that you recall was very helpful, in helping you ramp up in this world, and do marketing?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:58:48):\nHonestly, I think, at the end, for me, I just ended up saying, \"What are the companies I feel do things really well? What are the brands I love, and what do I love about them?\"\n\n(00:59:04):\nAnd then, really obsessing about, what did they do, what are their team doings? And then, also, obsessing about the people behind them. For example, I think Gong does an amazing job in marketing, for a B2B product.\n\n(00:59:22):\nSo it was like, \"Okay, so what are all the things Gong did?\" Then I would look up every single talk their CMO gave. So it's like, I always backed up into it. I did not care if it's a security company or not a security company.\n\n(00:59:35):\nI actually don't like the way most security companies market things. It's mostly by frightening and fear, and I don't like it. For me, it was just looking at brands I love, and then backtracking from there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:49):\nI love that. We have the CPO of Gong and co-founder coming on the podcast very soon, so I'll ask him about this.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:59:53):\nOh, cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:55):\nAll right, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (00:59:59):\nHonestly, I hardly, hardly watch anything. I think The Wire is the best show ever created.\n\n(01:00:05):\nI will take that fight with anybody. But yeah, I haven't really watched anything super recent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:11):\nThe only problem with the Wire is it's so long to watch. I've watched, I've seen it, I love it, but it's a large commitment. It's an hour times 22 episodes times, I think, five seasons, but worth it.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (01:00:22):\nWorth it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:24):\nNext question, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered, that you really love?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (01:00:28):\nIt's a funny question, in the world we live in, where there's just so many similar things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:32):\nThat's why. Which one should we pay attention to? That's the question.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (01:00:36):\nI'll answer a pretty random answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:38):\nYeah, okay.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (01:00:38):\nRecently, I always go around with a notebook and a pen, still that type of person. I mean, I constantly walk around with them, across office rooms, blah, blah blah, and I always care deeply about the notebook and the pen.\n\n(01:00:50):\nI'm a very picky person. I pick pens, I pick notebooks, and I often lose my pens, which is sad. I recently bought this cute something, it's very geeky, like, a pen holder for a notebook. I did not know they existed.\n\n(01:01:04):\nIt's a very nice feature. It's small, magnetic, and it claps into your notebook, and then you can put the pen in it. Really nice feature.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:10):\nHow does one find this? Is there a brand, or a name, or something?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (01:01:14):\nI'll send you a link, but if you look, \"notebook pen holder,\" you'll find a ton.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:18):\nOkay, cool. We'll link to in the show notes, whatever one you recommend.\n\n(01:01:22):\nJust a couple more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find helpful, in work or in life?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (01:01:29):\nI think, keeping it simple. If you start feeling like something is too complex, or an answer is too complex, or something you're building in the product is too complex probably, or something in your life feels too complex, probably, it does mean something. But sometimes, you just have to maybe take two steps back, leave it there, until you come back to it again, and you find a simple way out.\n\n(01:01:50):\nWhether it's a private feature or anything, I feel like, if something starts getting too complex, and you don't know how to design it, or how to find end from start, it does mean it's not the right solution. It's too complex, it's not the right solution, but sometimes, I take two steps back, and you find it applicable to anything in life, almost.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:08):\nReminds me of the story when you were trying to sell the initial version of Wiz/beyond whatever it was called, early on, and it was just too complicated. No one understood what the hell's going on, and so I love how that circles back.\n\n(01:02:20):\nFinal question. I know you can't talk too much about this, but I'm also just curious what you're able to share. As I said, allegedly, a company whose name rhymes with Loogle, wanted to buy you guys for many billions, and you all decided to decline that, and stay private. Anything you could share there, about maybe why you decided to do that, if that was true at all?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (01:02:40):\nYeah, I mean, I can't address any specific offers. Obviously, Wiz over the years has gotten many acquisition offers. I can share, that I think for us, us being the founding team, the employees, the customers, the board, staying on an independent path, we all really believe that Wiz can become one of the biggest security companies in the world.\n\n(01:03:06):\nWhen you look at Wiz today, and I mean, we spoke about the unconventional growth, when you think about it, in some ways, Wiz addresses the biggest growing market of security. Cloud security, cloud is the fastest growing, cloud is such a fast-growing market. Cloud grows 20, 30%, year over year.\n\n(01:03:25):\nWe feel like everything is in the cloud, but in reality, by estimation, only 20%, 15 to 20% of the infra today, is in cloud. It's a really, really fast-growing state, in a fast-growing market. And security by nature is a bit of a market of leaders.\n\n(01:03:42):\nI mean, it's a bit like buying insurance for something. You want to buy it from the best, from the leader in this domain. And today, Wiz really is that leader, because it's a new space. Wiz is considered, I think, in many ways, and that is also what makes marketing and brand, not just marketing, but truly, brand so important.\n\n(01:04:01):\nWiz is considered, I think, the cloud security company, in a lot of ways. Still, of course, it's our to lose. There's a ton of work ahead of us, but that is a huge opportunity in front of us, becoming the cloud security company. And I think nobody thinks we are anywhere near ready to give it up, in a way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:21):\nI totally understand that, and again, Wiz is hiring, in case you are inspired by what you're hearing.\n\n(01:04:27):\nRaaz, this was incredible. I'm so happy that you did this. Thank you so much for being here.\n\n(01:04:32):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online, if they want to reach out, and maybe follow up on stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nRaaz Herzberg (01:04:37):\nFind me on LinkedIn, and yeah, no apply. We'd love great people who are learners, which I think is what this podcast is all about. So definitely, the right place to find the right people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:48):\nAwesome. Raaz, thank you so much.\n\nRaaz Herzberg (01:04:49):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:52):\nBye, everyone.

People have climbed the ladder because they've been dependable, reliable, the smartest person in the room. But great leaders know that when you try to advise and have the answer all the time, you're not actually equipping your team to go solve the hard problems. You're training your team to come to you with all of the hard problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):\nDifficult conversations are difficult. How do we help people make them less difficult?\n\nRachel Lockett (00:00:32):\nWe operate in tech. We're supposed to give all of ourselves, all of our time, all of our energy to this endeavor, and it's purely logical. That's not at all true. It's completely emotional. Professionals have feelings. People, when they want to have a conflict, they come in ready to prove their point. There's a misguided view that the goal is to convince the other person that what they're doing is wrong. Actually, the goal of any conflict is to create mutual understanding.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):\nTalk about what you've learned about helping leaders in tech avoid burnout.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:01:01):\nWhen people are in their gifts and their strengths, they have more energy. We all have more energy when we're operating from the things we naturally are good at. It's no one else's job to help you live in your gifts. What I notice in big companies is people are often annoyed or frustrated with their management for not making their job more interesting. No, your manager's job is to help you perform in the job you are hired to do. It's your job to navigate your career.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:26):\nThe power of this is this makes your life so much better.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:01:28):\nLenny, let's try it. So, I want you to tell me a challenge, something that you're struggling with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:34):\nThe main thing I struggle with these days is just... Today, my guest is Rachel Lockett, an executive coach and former longtime HR leader at Pinterest and at Stripe. She works with CEOs, and founders, and leaders at tech companies on both ways that they are, emotional and positive intelligence, resilience and courage, and what they do, setting vision and strategy, prioritizing, and building trusted and accountable teams. She's someone I've heard a lot about over the years from other podcast guests, and this conversation is powerful. It's jam-packed with advice, and tips, and frameworks that'll make you a better leader and also a better person. We even do a couple live coaching sessions to demonstrate some of Rachel's approaches. And as you'll see, I had a number of epiphanies during this conversation. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It helps tremendously.\n\n(00:02:26):\nAnd if you become an annual subscriber of my newsletter, you get a year free of a ton of incredible products, including Devon Lovable, Replit Bolt, NNN, Linear, Superhuman, Descript, Wispr Flow, Gamma, Perplexity, Warp, Granola, Magic Patterns, Raycast, JPRD, Mobin, and Stripe Atlas. Head on over to lennysnewsletter.com and click Product Pass. With that, I bring you Rachel Lockett after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:49):\n1.3%, it's a small number, but in the right context, it's a powerful one. Stripe processed just over $1.4 trillion last year. That figure works out to be about 1.3% of global GDP. It's a lot, but it's also just 1.3%. Stripe handles the massive scale and complexity of many of the world's fastest-growing enterprises, including 78% of the Forbes AI 50 and more than half of the Fortune 100. There's a reason I've had more leaders from Stripe on this podcast than any other company.

I am honored to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):\nI'm honored to have you here. I was going to start with a different question, but we were chatting ahead of this conversation and I always like to ask guests, what do you want people to get out of this conversation? And I loved your answer, so I just want you to share this. So, let me just ask you, what are you hoping people get out of the conversation we're about to have?\n\nRachel Lockett (00:05:23):\nGenuinely, I hope that your listeners take away that the human side of business building is incredibly fun and impactful and that it's easy to do. They can do it with simple tools. So, I'm hopeful that through this conversation, heads of product, heads of engineering, founders walk away feeling more empowered and more motivated to attune to the people around them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:47):\nSo, what I'm hearing is just if you're struggling with the human side of building a product, building a team, building a company, there are answers. You can do it.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:05:56):\nYes, exactly. It is achievable, and it's actually most natural. Leaders want to care about the people they work with. They want to empower those around them. But sometimes the busyness of our world gets in the way and the urgency of the litany of things to do distracts you from the people in front of you. And actually, if you really understand the talent around you and you create an environment where they can be successful, your business will thrive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:22):\nI think the hardest part of this for people is just there's the knowing this can be helped with. The other is just being vulnerable enough to seek help and to take this on because it's so hard. Just like, \"Oh, maybe I'm not a great manager.\" That doesn't feel good.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:06:37):\nYeah, that's true. I mean, it's vulnerable to seek help, but I think your audience, I know to be incredibly committed to growth. I hear of people who come on your podcast and they've spent decades focused on self-improvement. And I actually want to tell you a story about one of my clients who loves your podcast, and I was talking to him last week. He's a client I've seen for 10 years, and he's a person who exemplifies a commitment to personal growth.\n\n(00:07:08):\nI started working with him when he was a frontline engineering manager at Coinbase, and we talked about who he is, what his strengths are, and his bigger picture why. And he talked about this dream of creating a global movement one day. He was really focused on building community, and he thought the path for creating possibility in the world around him was creating a strong community around him. And he continually worked on his leadership capacity. And over the 10 years, at some point, he created a tattoo on his arm that's a sun with a redwood grove around it that reminded him of his core strengths and his purpose. And today, guess what he's doing, Lenny?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:59):\nKilling it.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:08:00):\nHe's not only killing it-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:02):\n[inaudible 00:08:02] vision.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:08:02):\n... but he's running a community, a global community for Coinbase called Base and the Base app.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):\nOh, wow.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:08:08):\nIt's the largest Ethereum L2 in the world, and it's a community of creators and developers, and he's having a great time. He's having more fun than ever. And so, I think for the people who are committed to excellence and impact, recognizing that if they lean into their gifts and they get back into their purpose, they can have more fun while having an impact on the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:33):\nThis story reminds me of just why I love these sorts of conversations because the sort of stuff we're going to be talking about, and we'll get into it right after this final preamble, is stuff that's usually locked away in these very small rooms, are only accessible to folks with a bunch of money. This is stuff people pay tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars for over the course of their career. And I just love the idea of sharing all this with everyone to help all learn from the stuff that you've learned from all these people you've worked with. So, I'm really excited to be digging into stuff. The first thing I want to dive into, I actually asked you, when clients come to you, what is the biggest gap they have that is keeping them from being successful as leaders? And you told me it's essentially knowing when to coach versus knowing when to just tell people what to do and learning to coach. Talk about what you see there, why this is so important, and how you help people develop the skill.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:09:24):\nI think that most leaders, especially technical leaders, assume they have to have all the answers. People have climbed the ladder in whatever realm they're in because they've been dependable, reliable, the smartest person in the room. But when you're leading a quickly-scaling company, you quickly have less context than the people you're around. And the way you were operating before doesn't work because you don't have the ability to wrap your arms around every problem in a deep way. So, I've seen leaders at every phase from frontline managers up to running an 8,000-person company struggle with knowing when do I have to have the answer, and when I don't have the answer, what options do I have?\n\n(00:10:12):\nBut great leaders know that when you try to advise and have the answer all the time, you're not actually equipping your team to go solve the hard problems. You're training your team to come to you with all of the hard problems. And coaching is a different way. It's an alternative path that unlocks brilliance in your team and is way more motivating for the people around you. So, coaching is actually a learnable skill, obviously, because there's tons of coaches around Silicon Valley, but you don't have to coach in the same way that an executive coaches. You can shift your energy into curiosity when someone brings you a hard problem to solve, and create space to get curious, and help them solve their own problem.\n\n(00:10:59):\nSo, obviously, sometimes advising is the right path. If there's an urgent issue, the person coming to you doesn't have the skill they need, that's a time to advise and help. But leaders over-rotate, assuming the people that they've hired who are experts in their domain need them to solve the problem. So, I think it's useful for your listeners to actually know that coaching's an alternative, and I can help them learn some basic skills around this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:31):\nOkay. I'd love to learn those skills. What this makes me think about is there's this famous Harvard Business Review piece. I don't know. It's like 30 years ago maybe about the monkey on the back. You know this piece, where it's-\n\nRachel Lockett (00:11:42):\nSay more. I think I do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:44):\nOkay, we'll link to it. It's this idea that as a leader, people always just coming to you trying to give you their monkey that's sitting on their back. And they're like, \"Hey, this monkey is causing me all this problem. I don't know what to do. But this monkey, here you go. You take it, and feed it, and help it, figure out what it needs.\" And the role of a leader is to keep the monkey on the back of the person and help them figure out how to solve the problem, exactly what you're describing.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:12:04):\nYeah, that's a great analogy. I love that. I think leaders make things up when they don't have answers sometimes. A person comes to you with a problem and you just want to help. But the best way to help is actually doing something that most leaders don't do well. It's attuning to what is the context? What does this person need? What are they blocked on? And ask them with those questions so that they can solve their own problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:32):\nLet's talk about how to get better at this. But first of all, when you said, \"When is it actually smart to just tell them what to do?\" You said it's when they don't have the skills to do it. Is there any other kind of heuristics of like, okay, just tell them what to do in these cases?\n\nRachel Lockett (00:12:43):\nYeah, it's an urgent issue and you actually have an answer that you want to drive. So, don't coach and make it a game. You want your person on your team to guess what's in your mind. That's not a good time to coach. You have something you absolutely want them to do. You know the right answer. You want them to be motivated to go do it. Advise them. Help them see the path. But most leaders over-index on that solution. So, I want to share. Maybe Lenny, I can teach you two skills that I think are the basics of leader coaching-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:43):\nLet's do it. I'd love that.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:13:21):\n... that you can use in your own life tonight with your wife-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:24):\nShe's going to love this.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:13:25):\n... or anyone you operate with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:25):\nLet's do it.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:13:27):\nAnd hopefully, your listeners can use them too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:30):\nLet's do it.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:13:31):\nOkay. So, the first skill is active listening. And Lenny, you're probably a good listener because this is what you do for a living is you listen to the people who come on your podcast. But I don't know if you've seen Fight Club. There's a quote, \"Most people aren't listening. They're just waiting for their turn to talk.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:49):\nAbsolute-\n\nRachel Lockett (00:13:49):\nThis is rampant in tech. And great leaders flip that script and tune in. They're the kinds of leaders who walk into a room, and they can see the elephants. They can name them. They can ask the hard questions to get people collaborating. So, there's actually three levels to listening. So, the first level listening, level one is internal. Let's say you're talking to me about a problem. I'm thinking about the implications of that problem on me. I'm completely distracted with my own inner dialogue. That's level one. Most people go through their world rushed and in level one. Level two listening is focused. So, you're talking to me, and I can repeat back what you're saying. So, I am listening to the words you're describing, and that's typically what happens in a good one-on-one. We're problem solving together and focused on your words.\n\n(00:14:46):\nLevel three listening is global listening. So, that's what I'm hearing beneath the words. I'm hearing what you're communicating, not just what you're saying. I see your body language. I notice your tone of voice. I know the context around what you're talking about, and I can reflect back more insight about what's happening than you're aware of because I'm understanding everything you're communicating. So, dropping into level three listening is what great leaders do when they're influencing, when they're selling, when they're pitching a vision, and definitely when they're coaching. So, do you want to try it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:22):\nLet's do it.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:15:25):\nOkay. How about this? I'll demonstrate some level three listening. I'm going to ask you a question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:30):\nOkay. Uh-oh.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:15:32):\nYou told me earlier, you're a father.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:34):\nYeah.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:15:35):\nWhat is it like to be a dad?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:38):\nWow. What is it like to be a dad? It's amazing. It's like the most amazing thing I've ever done in many ways. I love it so much. It's also quite challenging at times dealing with setting boundaries and knowing when to just let him do the thing he's really excited about or just saying, \"no,\" and just letting him cry for a while. That's something I've been dealing with recently, but it's like everything people tell you it is basically in every way except the joy is so much higher, so much higher than you hear from other people because people always talk about all the downsides, all the pain and challenges.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:16:15):\nYeah, and I see you when you talk about being a father, initially, I saw you really squirm in your chair. Well, this is a big question. And you looked up and down and kind of avoided my eye contact at first because my sense is you love being a dad, and it's so challenging. It's so tiring. And I'm hearing both of that in your answer. The high joy and the discomfort in having to sleep train, and having to disappoint, and navigating challenging behavior.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:51):\nNailed it. That was very nice to hear. Clearly, you listened to everything I said and that was a really good example of active listening.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:16:59):\nWhat does it feel like to be seen that way?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:02):\nIt feels really nice. It feels really nice to be heard. And it's not just like you're repeating back my words. It's here's what I got out of the level below what you're saying, and the gist, and the bigger picture.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:17:14):\nYeah, there's some emotional connection when you listen actively, and that took less than a minute. So, what I want to invite listeners to understand is that active listening doesn't mean you're setting up an hour coaching session with every person on your team. No one has time for that. But even in the time you're already spending, just focusing on the other person in a way that is novel and really gives them your full attention so you can see their feelings under what they're saying goes a long way to motivating your team and helping them understand what's actually happening under the surface in this situation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:50):\nI think there's just so much power in different words, repeating back what they said. That's almost implied in what you're describing. It sounds like... So, I don't know, like a trick they'll see through. But knowing that you're listening to me and you're going to show me active listening, it still feels really nice to just hear back what I said. There's a lot of power in that and it's subtle.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:18:10):\nYeah. Great. Yeah, there's an element of synthesizing what I'm hearing verbally. That's the focused listening part, and then, mirroring back the emotions that I'm noticing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:18):\nThe emotions.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:18:19):\nAnd even things that I'm guessing, and I can say, \"Is that right?\" And you can say, \"No, actually, I'm not conflicted about the challenges of being a dad. I just am so joyful.\" And then, now, I understand where you're coming from and so do you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:33):\nAwesome. Okay, so this is a core skill of coaching is active listening.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:18:37):\nYes. So, that's listening. Second skill, powerful questions. So, asking powerful questions means I'm curious about what's really going on, and there's not one right answer. So, a powerful question helps you gain insight and it takes you to a new solution set you didn't have before. But it's not me leading the witness. I'm not trying to guide you to a specific answer. That wouldn't be a powerful question. So, something that I like to equip leaders with is four kinds of questions that you can ask to unlock insight.\n\n(00:19:17):\nSo, the first kind is I use a GROW model. So, the GROW model just is four different categories of kinds of powerful questions. So, the G in grow is goal. So, what does success look like? What's the outcome that you want to have? Any question that's around defining the best case scenario. The R in the GROW model is about your current reality. Where are you stuck? What are your current challenges? What have you tried? The O is about your options. So, let's expand the opportunities that you can understand of the choices you have in front of you. What are the various paths you could take? And the W in the GROW model is the way forward. What are you going to do next? So, this sounds simple, and it is simple if you take the time and space to listen carefully and ask any of these questions. The people on your team will appreciate the space and time to unlock an option that they didn't think of before and walk away with a concrete next step.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):\nSo, just to reflect back what you're saying, so someone comes to you with a monkey on their back. Here's a problem I'm trying to solve. This percent of my team is just not doing something right or this feature isn't working, something like that. So, first of all, it's listen, be very active in your listening. Reflect back what you're hearing, their emotions. And then, ask them questions around what does success look like for this? What is the goal? What is the goal? What does success look like for the thing you're trying to do here? What does success look like? Two is just what's today's reality? What's happening today? Then, options. Here's options that you think exist. So, this is you asking them what are the options?\n\nRachel Lockett (00:21:01):\nYeah, what are your paths forward? What could you do next?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:03):\nWhat could you do next? And then, this is organic. So, it's not just like one, two, three, four, I imagine.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:21:10):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:10):\nBut the final step is just, okay, what's the way forward? What do you want to do?\n\nRachel Lockett (00:21:14):\nThat's exactly right. And you don't have to do it in this order. These are just four kinds of questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:14):\nI see.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:21:19):\nSo, you might come and someone's super clear about their outcome. You know that. You don't need to spend any time asking them questions about that. Maybe you just want to really dig in on where are they stuck? And once they start talking about their reality and where they're stuck, then they realize, oh, I'm stuck because my cross-functional partner is blocking me, and I don't have any relationship with them. I need to go meet with them actually and just have a breakthrough conversation, tell them where I'm stuck. So, sometimes talking this out loud, just creating that space for them is going to help them tremendously.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:48):\nAnd there's kind of an implication here that the person often knows the answer or can come to the answer, and they just need a little bit of nudge to get there.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:21:56):\nYeah, this is definitely you want to coach when you think the person you're talking to has the right context and can solve their own problem. That's a premise of coaching. You wouldn't coach if someone needs your guidance and comes to you and says, \"Hey, I'm trying to take my company public. You took your company public. Can you tell me exactly the steps you took to get there?\" Not a good time to coach.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:20):\nThis begs the question, what if they just come to a terrible conclusion and you're just like... Advice on when to actually just like, \"What about this instead?\"\n\nRachel Lockett (00:22:30):\nYeah, okay. I think that's great. So, if you have a really strong negative reaction to what they're sharing, of course it doesn't behoove anyone to hide that. I think you get curious. \"Hey, help me understand how you came to that conclusion because here's my reaction to that.\" So, you're honest, but you're also curious. So, coaching in a manager or a leader context is not the same as in an executive coaching conversation. You're managing this person. You're responsible for their outcomes. You're not setting up an hour-long coaching session, you're just using coaching as an additional tool in your toolkit from advising. And you're creating more space, maybe 15% more space in your one-on-ones, in your meetings for open-ended questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:14):\nI love this phrase, help me understand. One of my managers used to be really good at this, just like... You could tell, he's like, \"Help me understand this part of your thinking.\"\n\nRachel Lockett (00:23:22):\nYeah. And the other thing that does when you're curious and you don't just shut down someone's idea, is you're helping them think. You're not helping them realize they're going to screw it up unless they come to you for advice. You're helping equip them with the right questions to ask and the right skepticism to have. And so, it's always useful to be in conversation when someone who reports to you has a different worldview than you do. There's some reason they came up with this great idea that you think is a terrible idea. And actually, that's where the learning happens.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:56):\nAnd you may actually be wrong and you may realize, okay, they actually have the better solution. I get it now.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:24:01):\nYeah. This actually happens to me all the time in talent conversations. Because I have a background in being an HR business partner, and I'm working with CEOs and they're thinking about building their leadership team. And I want everyone to have a very rigorous stance on their talent because if you have an A plus squad, you're going to do great things in the world. And sometimes, they come up with an idea to performance manage someone who's clearly not working in the role, but think, oh, maybe I'll wait six months, and then, we'll have a conversation. I have a strong point of view. I'm not going to let that slide, but I'm going to say, \"Help me understand why that is a good idea,\" and I'm going to press on that. And if they don't come to an idea that I'm aligned with, I'm going to share openly my perspective while still empowering them to solve their own problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:49):\nTo close the loop on this piece of advice, is there an example you could share to make this super concrete for folks?\n\nRachel Lockett (00:24:55):\nWell, I'm going to give you an example of a client, I'm going to call him Jeff, who runs an AI company. And he was essentially playing the role of the head of product also. And he had a growing number of engineers and designers, and his customer base was growing rapidly. And he started to feel completely overwhelmed. So, he came to me and we started coaching together. And soon, he realized that he was the blocker on every decision, every business decision, every product decision. And he was resenting it. He wanted his team to take more ownership. But with some coaching, he realized he was training his team to come to him with every decision because he had always operated that way. So, he decided to create squads and have small pods of engineers, product leaders, and designers focus on subsets of the team. Very normal as you have a small startup scaling. But he didn't have an engineering manager and a product leader for every one of them.\n\n(00:26:00):\nSo, this was a little bit earlier than he was equipped for because he did it out of necessity. And he also realized he needed to create some behavior change for the way he was interacting with that tech lead on each project so that they would take more ownership. So, we really invested in this idea of I'm going to start to set the system up so we have a product review every two weeks, they each have clear KPIs they're driving to that we co-design, and for this next quarter, I'm shifting from the role of deciding on everything to coaching. I'm going to really ask good questions in our check-ins. I'm going to align to the KPIs, ask how things are going, ask where they're stuck. And I just had a session with him last week. It's amazing to see him because he's so much more energized. He said, \"The squads are moving so much faster. The teams feel more empowered and motivated.\" And he has time to pick his head up and plan for 2026...\n\nRachel Lockett (00:27:01):\nAnd he has time to pick his head up and plan for 2026, and spend his time and his gifts. Which are product, vision and strategy. So that's more of a global example of what results from leaders shifting from the mode of solving every problem to coaching.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:19):\nThat's such a great example of just the power of this, this makes your life so much better. Because other people can start picking up the slack and not come to you for everything. And it's like, listen better, ask a few powerful questions and so much improves, so much changes.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:27:35):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:36):\nEveryone around you gets better.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:27:37):\nLenny, let's try it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:38):\nOkay, let's try it.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:27:38):\nSo I want you to tell me a challenge. It could be a personal challenge, a professional challenge. Just bottom line, something that you're struggling with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:51):\nWhoa. The main thing I struggle with these days is just endless work. I feel like this newsletter, I started this newsletter six, seven years ago at this point, and originally it was like, I'm just going to build this chill newsletter, do this on the side. Just kind of chill out for a while. And now it's just like, it just grows. I couldn't help but make it more awesome and bigger and have this podcast now and other stuff I got going on. So it's always this.\n\n(00:28:18):\nSo I'm in a world now where it's just this ... the way I think about it is the Indiana Jones boulder is constantly in my back rearview mirror just coming at me. Because I need to get a newsletter post out, get podcast episodes out, do all the things associated with that. I'm also just in the middle of ... I have this large Slack community at Twitter and LinkedIn, so I'm just constantly being barraged with small little asks and things and all these little things that never ... it's hard to just ignore and say no to. So what I struggle with just endless work. I joke that be careful working for yourself if your boss is a workaholic.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:28:53):\nI totally relate to that. Okay, so I'm hearing noise, barrage of needs and just constant requests of you online, in your work life. There's always something that you need to be doing. And you designed it that way yourself. So you're kind of aware of, I had this one intention of a path to freedom, insight. I imagine the newsletter was a fun passion project. And you couldn't help but make it this all-consuming full-time job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):\nThat's right. Let me just add, it's like in so many ways the most awesome thing I could ever imagine doing also and extremely fulfilling. And I couldn't think of anything better I'd rather be doing.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:29:27):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:36):\nSo I think that's an important element.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:29:38):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:38):\nIt's this Indiana Jones boulder constantly chasing me.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:29:41):\nYeah, I can feel the gratitude and the resonance with what you get to do every day. And yet I hear you questioning, why does it have to feel like I'm fighting for my life while I'm doing this thing I love?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:56):\nThat's one way to put it, yeah. This boulder is squishing me.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:30:00):\nI mean, the Indiana Jones boulder is coming for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:01):\nOh man.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:30:02):\nThat's a fight or flight instinct we all have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):\nThat's true. That's true.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:30:05):\nOkay, so thank you for being vulnerable enough to share that with your listeners and with me. I want to ask you, what would dream state look like? So let's say in six months you're still running this beautiful business that you've created. And you feel differently. What is happening?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:33):\nWhat I imagine is the same thing mostly, just much more free time. So more time to experiment and play with other things. And at the same time, the newsletter continues to be awesome and high quality, the podcast continues to be awesome and high quality. So it's continuing to put out the same high quality stuff, just more free time, less ... the boulders may be smaller.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:30:56):\nYeah, okay. So what does free time enable for you? When you think about ... I hear your deep commitment to quality products and quality output. But this longing to feel a little bit more playful or flexible with those parts that are essential to you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:17):\nVery practically, it's time to play around with AI tools. Just explore and just kind of tinker. Versus, okay, all the time I have, I need to focus on the newsletter, make it better for next week. Oh, it's coming out, here's things I got to do. Oh, this podcast, got to prep for that, got to edit this thing. So it's just time to tinker and explore and just like that kind of stuff.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:31:37):\nThat makes sense. And what's important about exploring and tinkering to you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:42):\nBecause in the work I do, I need to stay ahead on where things are going. I can't just sit around and pontificate from a cloud. I need to really understand how things work, what's working, what's not, what's real, what's not. So being on the ground as much as I can with what's actually going on versus just putting out content.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:31:59):\nThat makes sense. Your voice is moving really fast. I kind of hear you feeling behind, even in the way you're describing what you're doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:06):\nA good [inaudible 00:32:09] listening.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:32:10):\nWhat's interesting to me is when you're talking about exploring and tinkering, when you first said it, you said it in kind of a spacious way. It's fun to explore and tinker. You're deeply naturally curious. You find new insights. But then I also heard you say, \"And it's a way to stay ahead, I have to do it in order to feel like I'm informed.\" So what do you make of that difference?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:37):\nYeah. Yeah. Those are two sides of the coin. There's another element of ... I guess let me answer that question. I think those are both true, I don't know. The reason I got into this is because it was so fun and so interesting. Just like, here's what's happening, here's what the future-\n\nRachel Lockett (00:32:53):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:54):\nHere's advice, here's ways to improve in the work that you do. So I still love it. It's just I have less time to do that part and more it's just the machine of the treadmill of content, content, content. There's also just spending more ... I didn't even mention this. But just spending more time with my son and my wife, that would be really great just to have more freedom to go do stuff. Which we have a lot of that, but more is great.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:33:16):\nThat makes sense. Okay, so the goal that I hear is not so dramatically different from today. It's that you hold on to this high quality output, but you have space for exploring and tinkering. And for spending quality time with the people you love most.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:33):\nYes. One way I'm thinking about as you reflect that back is 25% more free time while everything else continues to be awesome. And the challenge I run into is I sometimes get that extra time and then I fill it with more projects and opportunities. That's the problem right there.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:33:50):\nYeah, there's that inertia of moving fast, taking advantage of the moment that's coming.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:54):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:33:54):\nSo that's a perfect shift into, what are your current ways of operating that get in the way of having that 25% of free time?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:03):\nIt's just agreeing to more things. Just like, oh look, I'm kind of free right now. Oh, okay, let's do this talk here. Let's agree to this thing here. So it's just once I feel freedom, I'm like, \"Okay, I could do that other thing.\" And so I commit to more stuff.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:34:18):\nYeah. And how is that commitment to saying yes to things that come at you serving you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:24):\nNot great.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:34:27):\nWell, it's serving you in some ways. You're doing it for a reason.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:31):\nYeah.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:34:31):\nWhat benefit does it have to you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:33):\nWell, it depends on the thing. I actually have a rule of never doing a talk or going on another podcast or going to events really, because I find I never really get much out of it, and it distracts me from the stuff I could be doing. So I've set up a lot of policies of just turning down things that don't serve me. But I still crumble and say yes to stuff.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:34:33):\nYeah, that's smart.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:57):\nSo to your point, there's value here and there when I take on more work. And then I end up overworked again.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:35:04):\nYeah, I'm hearing there's just a pattern, it's like a reflexive pattern of even though you set a rule for yourself to say no to certain things and you seem proud of that boundary. You naturally break it or you fall into filling it with other things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:16):\nThat's right. Exactly.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:35:18):\nOkay. So you're stuck in this kind of addiction to doing more and signing up for more, which is so normal in our world, and probably most listeners can relate to that. That's kind of the soup we swim in. So we have to be conscious of what inputs we have around us.\n\n(00:35:34):\nSo let's explore your various options that you have in front of you. One that you mentioned already you tried was to make a list of the things you don't want to be doing anymore, like things you want to say no to. And really committing to that and sticking to that. What are the other kinds of things you could do to help you prioritize and create that sacred 25% of extra time for yourself?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:01):\nSomething I've already done, which hasn't kicked in fully yet, but that I'm really excited about is I reduce the cadence of my newsletter and podcast. Which in theory, should be a massive change. But the cadence of the podcast hasn't shifted down yet, it'll happen next year. The newsletter cadences, I basically changed my promise to readers instead of, you'll receive a newsletter every week. Now it's, two to four times a month depending on what's going on.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:36:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):\nWhich felt huge. The problem is I still like every week I'm like, \"Oh, I want to write about this thing. Oh, every week there's nothing's happening, I got to put this out.\" So I'm almost not taking advantage of that opportunity. So something I could do is actually not publish every week.\n\n(00:36:45):\nAnother is just bring on some more help. Which is difficult because I've got a lot of good help and there's only so many things other people can do for me that isn't writing an awesome newsletter and recording conversations like this. But I'm always thinking about, and I should think deeper about where can people take more load off my plate?\n\nRachel Lockett (00:37:04):\nYeah, I love that insight. What I'm hearing is do less in certain areas and think about your team and really expanding the capacity of your team. And be rigorous about the things you can hand off, that you may have limiting beliefs around the things you need to do versus the people on your team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:21):\nI might, I might. And then your point I loved, which is just improve my policies of what I say no to that don't serve me.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:37:29):\nYeah. What are the things you could be saying yes to if you said no to more things?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:34):\nJust playing around with stuff. Just space to explore and tinker, and just sit around and think. Versus just go, go, go, go, go.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:37:43):\nYeah. I just see you feel so light and excited in that. Like you almost are giddy when you think about that spaciousness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:50):\nThat'd be so nice.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:37:52):\nAnd I just want to name reflect back to you how special that is and how much more creative you could be in your work when you have that space and time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:52):\nI love that.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:38:01):\nAnd your bucket's full with care.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:04):\nI feel that, I feel that.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:38:05):\nYeah. So what's one thing you could do in the next two weeks that would help you get closer to the kind of spaciousness you want to create?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:14):\nI love that ... as we go through this, I'm thinking about this growth framework and I love how you're executing it. Like I see it in action, it's so good.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:38:21):\nYeah, I'm trying to do very simple coaching right now, just [inaudible 00:38:25]-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:24):\nYeah, yeah. No, this is great\n\nRachel Lockett (00:38:26):\n... that it's really easy to follow for your listener.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:28):\nYeah, yeah. This is great. Okay, so what's the one thing I could do in the next couple of weeks to help you move forward on this? I think one is at least skip a week or two of the newsletter and just actually stick to that plan. But it's tough because the next two weeks I got already planned. I got to write a gift guide, that's my ... okay, so the week after, I'll take a break. Okay, cool. So two weeks from the recording this I won't publish a newsletter. And then I'm going to revisit my policies on what I say yes and no to.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:38:59):\nI love that. Think about everything you're saying yes to and what are things you want to say yes to that you could treat it with. So really consider that it's a trade off every time you say yes to something. The more resonant you are with the end state and what's possible for you, the easier it is to be disciplined in the near term.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:20):\nI love just that element of here's what you'll get out of this. It's not just no, no, no, no. It's like yes to this other thing you really, really want to do.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:39:25):\nYeah. Exactly. Yes, say it like a resonant full body yes to the things that are in [inaudible 00:39:32].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:25):\nHell yes.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:39:32):\nYeah, hell yes. With an exclamation, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:36):\nAwesome.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:39:36):\nWell thank you, Lenny, for letting me just demonstrate what powerful questions are. And the reason I wanted to do that with you is you brought an example that's actually pretty big. It's an emotional thing, it's a cultural norm, it's a way of being that we've all learned to be through growing up and operating in tech, especially. So even with that kind of topic, using a simple grow model can be useful. But people are coming at your listeners with topics that are very complicated, technical, urgent. But the same kinds of questions unlock new opportunity when it's about how to build technical infrastructure or how to influence the executive team or how to ship the go-to-market strategy. So I just want a name that's very transferable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:28):\nI love that I got great advice in this conversation already.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:40:34):\nGood.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:35):\nWhat a great ROI for me at least.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:40:37):\nWhat did it feel like to be coached on your own podcast?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:41):\nIt was unusual. I'm just like, wait, I got to get back to asking you questions. That's where our minds are right now.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:40:44):\nOkay, all right, all right. We can flip it, we can flip it. I do want to name that typically when you're coached versus told what to do, you're more bought in. So if I told you, Lenny, I've heard all kinds of leaders come to me talking about being too busy. Here's what you should do. Write a list of all the things you're doing, write the things you're going to delegate, cut out 25% of the things on your calendar. I could have given you a laundry list of things that I thought you should do without much context. But you're the expert on your own context and actually what resonates. And you're much more likely to do it if you came up with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:22):\nI was going to mention that earlier. That is so incredibly true. No one wants to ... unless you ask for advice, very few people are like, \"Please tell me what to do.\"\n\nRachel Lockett (00:41:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:31):\nI really love just unsolicited advice. That doesn't go well.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:41:35):\nYeah. And great leaders often say, \"Do you want advice or do you want some space to think about it? Can I help you think it through? Or would you like me to tell you what I would do?\" And both are fine in certain situations. So asking is useful too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:48):\nYeah. Okay. That's such an important element of this that we should have mentioned and I'm glad you did.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:41:55):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):\nOkay. So I'm going to go back to asking you questions.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:41:58):\nGreat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:59):\nThis is a good segway to something I wanted to spend a little time on, which is burnout.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:42:03):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:05):\nWhat I'm talking about is stuff that often leads to burnout. I'm definitely not burnt out, but this is a common problem in tech. Where people feel depleted and just go too hard. So many people I've worked with just left tech. I had a colleague at Airbnb, he's like a park ranger now near woods. That's how far tech-\n\nRachel Lockett (00:42:05):\nSo peaceful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:26):\nSo peaceful and so wonderful. But I think that's just people go so hard sometimes and then just get burnt out and never want to do anything like this again. I know that you've spent a lot of time on this with founders and you have a really helpful approach. So just talk about what you've learned about helping leaders in tech avoid burnout and feel energized and excited about their work for a long time.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:42:47):\nYeah. Well first of all, I'm glad you brought it up. It's a huge problem. I remember when I was coaching top talent at Stripe, Patrick Collison is really committed to retaining top talent. And I created a program with my team for the top 50 executives in the tech side of the house. And we looked at their engagement scores, we did coaching circles. And it was so sad to see how exhausted that group of incredibly creative and committed leaders was in that moment.\n\n(00:43:19):\nAnd it's so common that people who start with incredible inspiration and incredible capacity start to feel like they've been pushing and pushing and pushing for years. They're parenting, they're leading, crazy things are happening to the business. And they just can't muster the same kind of motivation they once had. And I see this with my clients all the time.\n\n(00:43:44):\nSo I've also witnessed people who are still inspired and continually energetic and seem to have some secret well of some diesel battery, or I guess I should say a Tesla battery that helps them through really hard challenges, and they're still having a good time. And so what I make of that is that when people are in their gifts and their strengths firmly, most of the time, they have more energy. We all have more energy when we're operating from the things we naturally are good at and the things we innately love doing.\n\n(00:44:25):\nSo I try to help my leaders see that they can design their lives so they're spending 80% of their time in their gifts. That seems really ambitious because you're stuck within a context that requires a lot of you. Especially when you're executive at a huge company. But I also interact with founders who started a company with great inspiration, an entrepreneurial vision, and their job has obviously changed every six months. Once you fundraise, once you grow a team. And sometimes, especially technical founders will start solving a technical problem they're absolutely obsessed with. They spend three years doing it, the product ships, and then they're stuck managing a board and a team. And they don't even realize they're doing a completely different job than the one that played to their strengths.\n\n(00:45:17):\nSo one tool I like to give is for people to actually take two weeks and every night reflect on, what are the five things today that gave me the most energy? And what are the five things that depleted my energy the most? If you do that for two weeks and you look at patterns, you can tell, what are the natural gifts that I'm living in? And what are the things that I'm stuck doing that are exhausting? And they're just slowly ... it's like a slow leak in your gas tank that over time shows up in your daily amount of energy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:52):\nI so believe this advice is so effective. This is the way I actually approach when I left my job. I very actively did this. I paid attention every day, what gave me energy? And what sapped my energy? And let me just do more of the thing that gave me energy and less of the thing that saps me. I want to talk about just like, there's only so much you can change, but I want to talk about that. And so initially I was like, maybe I'll become an advisor and consultant kind of person. I actually found that was super depleting for me.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:46:22):\nInteresting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:23):\nDoing these calls and talking to people because it's like surface level, here are some things I would do. And it was just so unexciting and energizing. But writing was really energizing, which I'd never expected.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:46:23):\nI love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:36):\nAnd that's what I did, and I just followed that pole.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:46:38):\nAnd it sounds like maybe you need a refresh, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:42):\nOh, interesting.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:46:43):\nThere's always more tuning you can do to your gifts. You're in this amazing ... you've clearly been successful for a reason, you're in your strengths and you're paying attention to what brings you energy. We can always do that more throughout our life. I think it's a process of continually tuning in to where your spark is. And protecting that spark, feeding it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:05):\nI love that insight, that just blew my mind.\n\n(00:47:08):\nSo very tactically, the way you would do this is for two weeks every night is the idea, reflect back on that day and write down five things that gave you energy, five things that sap you of energy.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:47:19):\nYeah, there's so many different activities you could use. So that's one. I like an activity of actually asking five to ten people in your life with a very simple email. When I walk in the room, what shows up? What are my strengths? What are the gifts? If you really don't know them and you haven't spent a lot of time in this realm, that's also an opportunity of actually asking the people who know you best, what your core gifts are? And when do you have the most inspiration?\n\n(00:47:46):\nYou can also look through your calendar and note themes. Okay, over the last month, what are all the things I look at on my calendar that I'm excited to do? What are the things I dread? Okay, why do I dread those things? What do those things have in common? So there's various ways you can get to what is your zone of genius? But what my invitation is to take that really seriously. It actually takes risk taking, it takes intention to design your life around your gifts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:15):\nIs there any advice for actually doing this? Say someone's just like, \"Yeah, I got to do this.\" But most people don't actually do this. Is there a buddy you can nominate, just help you do this? Is it like if you have an EA, they can maybe help you with this? Is there anything you've seen?\n\nRachel Lockett (00:48:28):\nThat's a good question. Yeah, I love your ideas. I think that the people around you need to be on board and know what are your gifts. So for example, when I was an HR business partner, my boss bought into this and I explained to her, \"Hey, I started at Stripe because I actually know I'm going to be a coach. I'm not going to be Head of HR. But I love working with leaders. So I'm going to do all the compensation strategy and all the org design, and I'm going to help product and engineering leaders. But what I have in the back of my mind is I'm honing my coaching skills.\"\n\n(00:48:56):\nAnd so when this opportunity to work on top talent retention came about, it was very aligned in the realm of coaching and L&D, background that I had. So she put me on that. So it's useful to name it to the people around you. What are your gifts? What are your interests? What skills are you really excited to hone? So that they are in a contract with you to help you and really apply your gifts to the business's needs. So that's one thing.\n\n(00:49:23):\nWhen you're a founder, a CEO, when you have the autonomy to consider, what are the role scopes around me? Then you can really hire around it. So I have some CEOs that I work with who are incredible visionaries, great strategists, really good at managing the board, hiring, et cetera. Terrible at managing their team. They hate it. So they hire a COO. And they work in partnership, they have one person who's really internally focused, they get to be externally focused. That works well, it's a symbiotic relationship. If you're honest about your strengths and you're weaknesses, then you can start to manage around them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:59):\nThis episode is brought to you by Persona, the verified identity platform, helping organizations onboard users, fight fraud and build trust.

Thanks again to Persona for sponsoring this episode.\n\n(00:51:04):\nIt's really nice to know what you want to do and understand what your dream life looks like. You also have a job, you have manager, you got things to do, you got responsibilities. So I guess first of all, as you have seen people that are not founders actually make a change to do the things ... to spend more time on their gifts, to actually not just be like ... like there is ... you have agency to move in a direction that'll make you happier.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:51:28):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:28):\nIs kind of an implied piece of this.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:51:30):\nYeah, I think sometimes people hire a Chief of Staff to help them and compliment them. Sometimes people design their team with strengths and gifts that they don't have. So it's really ... you can get creative once you really understand, oh, these things give me a ton of energy and these things are exhausting. But I still need to fill this need for the business. What are all the ways I can do it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:52):\nAnd telling your manager, I think, is such a simple and important part of this. Telling them-\n\nRachel Lockett (00:51:52):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:58):\n... here's where I want to go, here's the things I want to get better at, here's the things that give me energy. Can we just try to make as much of my role that?\n\nRachel Lockett (00:52:04):\nYeah. Especially if you're executing well, people want to retain you. They want to know, what's going to keep you here for the next five years? And typically they think that means moving up the ladder. But maybe it doesn't for you. I think it does take the courage to move horizontally sometimes to get into your strengths. I mean, I've moved horizontally a number of times and I love what I do, I feel like I'm in my natural gifts. But it took me a few risks and some uncomfortable jobs that didn't feel like they were worthy of my experience in order to get there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:38):\nWhat's a good percentage of your work life that should be in gifts and things that energize you versus, okay, I actually got [inaudible 00:52:48] stuff.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:52:48):\nMy litmus test is 80%, that's the goal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:48):\n80%.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:52:48):\nThat's the aspiration. You're always going to have 20% of things you don't love doing. There's just the logistics of getting into the zone that you need to be in. But I really try to push people to think aspirationally, that if you're 80% of the time in your gifts, how much energy you have to give to the world. It's so much more inspiring.\n\n(00:53:09):\nSo I want to tell you why I'm passionate about this topic because it actually is how I ended up as an Executive Coach. So 10 years ago, I was working at a small company called Remind, and I was running the UX Research team. And the CEO asked me to move into the Product Manager role for the Core Product team. And I was excited for the opportunity. I had non-technical background, but I thought, \"Hey, all these strategists are up there creating the roadmap. I can do that. I know exactly what our users need.\" So I was excited for this.\n\n(00:53:44):\nI came into the team, there was I think 12 senior engineers, very opinionated, very skeptical, this non-technical PM, but we worked together. And what I did was I listened. I learned what do our users need? What does this team need? What's working and not working? And with-\n\nRachel Lockett (00:54:00):\nWhat does this team need? What's working and not working? And within a month, this team was working well together. They were reviewing each other's code base. They were really disagreeing in a healthy way in our team meetings. They felt more connected to users. And I felt like, \"Okay, this rhythm is working.\" But what I was also doing as I was at home stressing in the middle of the night about the new user experience, I couldn't decide which of the designs to go with. I was always over leveraging our data scientists, and I found myself swirling on decisions that didn't need to have so much stress involved. And one day I went for a walk with my colleague Zach Abrams, and he was a great product manager and he was listening to me ask all these questions about how to sell the vision of what this product would look like in the future.\n\n(00:54:55):\nAnd he said, \"Rachel, you're a zone of genius or your gift is not being a product strategist, but I've watched you over the last few months, and you have gotten the team more motivated than I ever could, and you've influenced the entire executive team behind your ideas, and that's impressive. You're a people person.\" And at first I was offended. What? You think I don't have the ability to be a great product leader? And yet I sat with what he said, and I knew he was right. Both my parents are therapists. I never wanted to be a therapist. Here I am. I'm basically a work therapist. I love entrepreneurial energy, I love big vision, but I'm a people person. \n\n(00:55:40):\nAnd I left that, and I realized I love what my coach does. I got trained as a coach. I went into HR leadership. And Zach, who was a gifted product strategist, went on to lead product at Coinbase and BREX and most recently Bridge, which was acquired by Stripe, and he's still my client. And we've watched our journeys over the last decade, and we've both been honing our gifts. Life is more fun when you're in your gifts, and you have more inspiration and capacity to offer the world. So I just want to share that story because it's helpful to be honest with the people you care about when they seem energized and when they seem depleted because sometimes it's a wakeup call for people to really think about what is their spark and to protect it and to feed it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:36):\nI love that story because I think most people when they hear this advice and this topic of, \"Okay, I am feeling depleted, I'm feeling burnt out,\" I feel like most people jump to, \"Okay, but I can't actually do anything about it. I have a job. I got responsibilities.\" What I'm getting from this is the most important step is jump to figure out what you actually should be doing. What gives you energy? What your gifts are. It feels like that's the biggest gap for people because once you know that, there are ways to do that. Talk to your manager. \"It may not be possible today, but here's where I want to be going. Here's what I want to be spending time on.\" I love your point you made though about you actually have to be doing well for your manager to listen to you. You can't just be sucking and then like, \"Oh, but I want to work on strategy.\"\n\nRachel Lockett (00:57:19):\nYeah. Well, it's no one else's job to help you live in your gifts. And what I notice in big companies is people are often annoyed or frustrated with their management for not making their job more interesting. It's like, \"No, your manager's job is to help you perform in the job you were hired to do. It's your job to navigate your career.\" So over the arc of your career, how do you match your gifts with the world's needs? And if the world right now is your company, how do you understand the needs enough so that you can apply your strengths to those needs?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:54):\nThis reminds me, there's a couple of guests I've had on the podcast who did this. They're both founders, so this is specific to founders, but Rahul Vohra at Superhuman, he realized he's not the best executor operations person, so he hired a president that took all that office plate. And then Darmesh, co-founder of HubSpot, he knew from the beginning he didn't want to manage people, so he made a rule with his co-founder, \"I will never have reports.\" And he's the CTO, I believe, and has zero reports, has no one-on-ones.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:58:23):\nYeah. And I think that it's a beautiful thing to recognize that, but then to actually address the needs of those reports also. I think often people know, \"Ugh, I don't want to have one-on-ones,\" but just not having anyone to manage those people is not going to be healthy for your company. So you have to both take your strength seriously and actively manage around your weaknesses.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):\nIs there any maybe last piece of advice on this topic of helping people get to a place where they're feeling much less depleted and just more energized at work?\n\nRachel Lockett (00:58:53):\nI would start small. You don't have to leave your job and redesign your life. You can stop going to the optional things that are exhausting. You can leave space between the things that are depleting that you have to go to outside and go on a 30-minute walk and refuel your tank. Start with tomorrow. What are the three things you're going to do to plug up that gas leak and re-energize your spark? It might even be you love to read and you're going to start reading 30 minutes before you go to sleep every night. It doesn't have to be a dramatic life change, but recognize that only you know what is resonant and what is depleting, and it's your job to take that seriously if you want to show up purposeful and impactful in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:41):\nI love that advice. I've actually started reading before bed for 30 minutes, and that's been so joyful, like a physical book with a little nightlight.\n\nRachel Lockett (00:59:48):\nI agree. I love a physical book. I have a Kindle, I got all the things, but a physical book on the couch is the best.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:55):\nYeah, it's just that nightlight is key because sometimes at nighttime you need a night book. So we've been talking mostly so far about individual improvement, how to figure out what you should be working on, just helping learning to coach, things like that. I want to take us up a little level above and talk about team skills, how people get better at working with other people. Something that you are in many ways known for is helping co-founders build better relationships. And in my experience one of the most challenging parts of starting a company is the co-founder relationship. A lot of people don't realize what they're getting into. You're basically getting married to this person in a very high stress situation, and you sometimes don't know much about them.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:00:38):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:39):\nAnd then you not working well together is just a huge issue because that all trickles down, and everyone sees it. And when co-founders leave, it's really bad for everyone. So let me just ask you this, what have you found most helpful in helping co-founders build great relationships, stay happy and productive?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:00:56):\nYeah, thanks for asking this. I love working with co-founders because I think your core values as a person come out when they interact with someone else's core values. Conflict, healthy conflict or otherwise, is actually where your core values come out. So it's fascinating to watch people try to do something incredibly hard in the context of someone else's vision, someone else's strengths and weaknesses and navigate that together. So there's so much energy in the co-founder dynamic for me and for co-founders themselves. It's actually something that people don't feel comfortable going to their board about or talking to that many people about because it's a private matter. It's almost like in a marriage you go see a couples' therapist, but you don't tell all your friends that you can't stand your partner, but it keeps you up at night. So it's a really tender, important relationship, and there aren't enough supports for co-founders to navigate it. It's very normal. \n\n(01:01:50):\nIn fact, I know you probably know this stat, 65% of startups fail because of co-founder conflict, and co-founders are in a moment where they're trying to build the future for their business, but also trying to build their own livelihood. So there's so much at stake to get along with your co-founder. I think the core at its core, what you need in a healthy relationship is, one, self-awareness. What do I bring into this dynamic, and how am I being experienced by the other person? What does this other person bring into the dynamic, and how am I reacting to that? So the first is just collective awareness about what is our dynamic. I like to use the Enneagram for this, but there's all kinds of tools, self-awareness tools that you can use to give a common language to what is my thing and what is your thing.\n\n(01:02:46):\nA very classic one has to do with roles. CTOs tend to be skeptics. They love facts, they seek knowledge. They want depth of awareness and understanding, and they also like to be self-sufficient. This is a total generalization, but I've seen this pattern over and over again. The CEO is the person who had to sell the vision. They're a person who loves big picture vision strategy. They often are great at influencing others. They love to sell ahead of the reality of what the company's actually built. This creates an inherent tension between blind optimism and skepticism, and it's a dance that these two roles play together. So the first part is knowing the dance you're in, so you're not just stepping on each other's toes blindly. \n\n(01:03:34):\nThe second step is actually being conscious about the commitment you're making to your relationship. In a marriage, for example, I talk about co-founder vows and recommitments and renewals because in a marriage you get married, and a lot of times people build a family and then they think, \"Oh, the relationship will just continue around each other all the time. We're doing this thing together.\" But just like couples need a date night, co-founders need time and space to connect with each other to come together and say, \"How's this working for you? Are we still aligned on our vision and our strategy? How are we working together? What am I doing that's pissing you off? What are the things that have gone unsaid and that we need to talk about?\" \n\n(01:04:20):\nBut if you're just in the hustle and bustle of running and scaling your startup, you don't make time for that conversation. So I think it's incredibly important for co- founders to make space for their relationship, whether that's a dinner every other week, whether that's going out to lunch regularly, whether that's just touching base business-wise, but having an in-person quarterly check-in. That space is critical for the health of a co-founder relationship.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:50):\nOn that second piece, the vows idea is such a good idea. Is that something you actually recommend, here's what I vow to do?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:04:56):\nYeah, here's what I commit to do. So recently I actually wrote an article with First Round, and we created a document to help co-founders think about what to integrate into their check-in. So we put out weekly check-in, monthly check-in and annual and just questions to sit down and ask each other. Active listening skills will come in handy in those conversations, but it's about taking space out of hustling and running the business to think about the business from a like to say, instead of being on the dance floor, you need time on the balcony to look down at what's happening. How are we doing? Is this still working for both of us? And the vows are really about, how are we going to be together? How are we going to show up? What's our culture that we're creating? \n\n(01:05:43):\nEven if you don't want to go through a whole culture exercise early on in building your company, you should have some sense of how you want to show up for each other. How are we going to make decisions? How are we going to deal with conflict? These are things you can go into intentionally and design with your co-founder.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:03):\nAwesome. We're going to link to that post The first step, Enneagram sounds like that's what you recommend, and this is basically a personality profile that a lot of people love.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:06:12):\nI really like the Enneagram. I think you can also simply tell each other, \"Here are my strengths. Here's what I see as my weaknesses, and what do you think? Give me some feedback. Do you agree?\" And you can do that with each other without any personality assessment. If you want to just be scrappy and have an open connected conversation about, you could even say, what are the gifts I bring and the weaknesses I have, and how will I cover those? How will I lean into my gifts? How will I cover my weaknesses, and how will you? And then I think it's worthwhile having a conversation about, what are the gaps neither of us cover that we're likely going to need as we build this business?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:50):\nWhat do you recommend people do when they are just like, \"Our relationship isn't working great. There's a lot of tension\"? All this advice we've been talking about, at the beginning, here's things you can do to set things up for success. Understand what you're good at, what you're bringing to the table. Consciously commit to, here's what I'm going to do, here's what you're going to do. Have these dinners or lunches. I love this metaphor of going out on the balcony and just reflecting on how it's going. So that's all really great. What if you're just already in it and it's really annoying, I don't like this person that much or so much tension constantly. What are a couple things they can do this week, next week?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:07:27):\nCo-founders typically come to me either in this early phase where they want to intentionally build something great and they want to set it up for success. More often co-founders come when they're really frustrated with one another. They feel the tension is palpable. They can't stand it anymore, but they're still really deeply committed to the business so they don't see an out. And they knew that at some point they really loved this cofounder, so they see a possibility of recovering, and that's why they want to go get a coach. I'm going to give you an example of this PR duo running a fierce business scaling really fast. And at one point when they started, you had the visionary who was great at selling business. They were both incredible with PR, and the partner was incredible operationally. \n\n(01:08:17):\nSo as the business scaled, one took on a lot more business development and the other took on all the internal things, but was exhausted by all this people management and all of the elements of running a scaled team that she didn't expect to have to do. And when they came, I think both of them weren't sure, can we figure this out? Do we want to just sell this thing? Do we want to keep going? And I think someone said, \"End it or send,\" was what one co-founder said to me. They're coming at this decision point. And what I saw them do is, one, they named current state really well. They were both able to share. We did use a 360. So they got feedback from their teams and then shared it with one another, but they were able to be open and vulnerable in what was working and what wasn't working. Not immediately, but over time. \n\n(01:09:16):\nAnd they realized they used to love being partners in this work, but as they began to lead different teams, they grew very distant from one another. They were living on opposite sides of the country and actually just coming together and realizing what each other was missing and how lonely it is to lead this scaling company without each other's support and how they actually needed the counterbalance to their strengths and didn't have it was a important start to their healing.\n\n(01:09:48):\nAnd over our coaching, they turned back towards each other and they created more of a rhythm of how they would get together without me involved. And they ended coaching after our arc feeling renewed and really recommitted. They made some changes on their leadership team to fill their gaps. They also started, I think, meeting once a week virtually, and they started a cadence of getting together in person quarterly. And I don't mean to say that just that time means you're going to heal, sometimes coming together and really grappling. I had one last week where we all came together, we had a great full day in-person discussion about how they were making this co-founder duo, how they were making decisions. \n\n(01:10:36):\nAnd after that conversation, it was really clear that one of the co-founders was unhappy and didn't appreciate the other one and was not going to change and realized he was a big part of the problem and I think is going to leave the business. But that's still success because it's clarity. You're not muddling in the dark, frustrated, unconscious about the interpersonal dynamics you're in, you're making a choice based on your strengths and what the business needs and this relationship dynamic that you're in to either be in it or to lovingly step out of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:16):\nI love how similar this is to just the marriage, all this stuff. This is the same sort of thing you would do.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:11:21):\nTotally. I mean a marriage, you're building a life with a partner. So the only difference is a marriage is rooted in sexual attraction and love, and that's not the case always in the co-founder dynamic. But I have worked with couples who are also co-founders, but there should be some element of love for your co-founder. In fact, I think that when you work closely with colleagues and you really are able to see their gifts and enable them, you can't help but love them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:52):\nThat's a big statement. The other takeaway here is that just get coaching. It feels like that's the solution if things are just not working great. There's only so far you can get just talking.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:12:01):\nIt takes an evolved facilitator, one of the co-founders, being able to hold space for both their frustration and their empathy in a dynamic that is challenging. So outside support is useful. Sometimes it's actually a team member, it's an HR leader. It's the GC who happens to have great people skills. You don't always need a coach, but you need space to be vulnerable, open, and curious. So if you can create that on your own, that's great. I think it's definitely possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:35):\nOutside of the co-founder relationship, do you have any just tactical tips for people to improve their interpersonal skills with just team members, anyone they work with, just people that may struggle like, \"Man, I have a hard time with this person. I just have a hard time with a lot of people\"?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:12:50):\nFirst of all, people when they want to have a conflict or they want to engage in something that's not working, they come in armored and ready to prove their point. It's natural. You've been thinking about this, perseverating over whether you should mention it. You finally get to the point of engaging, and often there's a misguided view that the goal is to convince the other person that what they're doing is wrong. Actually, the goal of any conflict is to create mutual understanding. So when I go in to have a conversation with, let's say my husband who's not doing his share of the parenting, my goal is to help him understand what I'm struggling with so that he can empathize, see clearly what's happening, and perhaps meet my needs in some way. But it's not for me to prove to him how little he's doing in the house because he might have a totally different story about what's happening. \n\n(01:13:54):\nSo I'm going to give you a framework that I like that many of my clients use. It's from Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication. It is a book and a framework. So it's four steps. The first step is observations. So my job is to note what is happening factually. For example, I noticed that in the last three sprint planning meetings, you didn't invite me to those conversations or share with me the roadmap. That's an observation. It's a fact. I could take a picture of it, and no one would argue with it. The next step is feelings. So I'm going to express my feelings without blame. So I felt anxious not knowing what was on the roadmap for the week. I felt confused about whether that meeting happened or not because I wasn't included. So this is me sharing my feelings so the other party can empathize and understand what I'm going through without being defensive.\n\n(01:14:59):\nThe third step is needs. What are my universal human needs related to this topic? We all have needs. This is not requiring anything of the other person, just helping them understand my needs that are not met. So I have a need for clarity, I have a need for collaboration, I have a need for connection, whatever that is. And lastly, the step is to make a request. Now, in this model, the request is an olive branch to help the other person meet you and see you. It shouldn't be something that's impossible to do. It should be actually something quite small and easy to achieve for the other person to feel successful in connecting to you and understanding you. So in this case, I might make a request. I'd like to ask you next time you have a sprint planning meeting to include me as optional or to send me the roadmap afterwards that you align on. \n\n(01:15:54):\nNow, the other person doesn't have to meet my request. They might make a counter proposal, but the most important thing of this model in this conversation is that the other person understands what I'm going through and they don't feel reactive so that we can have a mutual conversation about what's going on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:12):\nWow. This point about how when you're trying to convince someone of something, when something is going wrong, this point that your goal is not to convince them, that your goal is to have mutual understanding, that just blew my mind, and I think it's going to change my life. Wow.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:16:32):\nLenny, try this with your wife tonight. NVC is a powerful tool, and actually it's very akin to most models that are about connection. The Stanford Business School course that has a T, it's called Touchy Feely that everybody loves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:48):\nYeah, we've had Carol on the podcast.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:16:49):\nGreat. Yeah, so Carol Robbins created this movement. There's lit. A lot of founders go to her model that's for founders.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):\nAnd tech.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:16:56):\nAnd this is all about, they talk about a net that you can talk about your feelings and your reaction, but as soon as you cross the net to blaming someone else or making an assumption, they're going to have a defensive response. But you can be incredibly bold and brave if you stay on your side of the net. So this model helps you do that because it's really about sharing your emotions and your needs and making a request without blame.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:21):\nYeah. So what I was going to say as you were going through this framework is here's me, here's what I saw, here's what I'm feeling, here's what I need. And then now that you have that in context, here's something I'm asking for versus you did this and you're feeling this and you thought this.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:17:37):\nExactly. It also acknowledges that professionals have feelings. I think that we operate in tech. We're supposed to give all of ourselves, all of our time, all of our energy to this endeavor. And it's purely logical. It's not at all true. It's completely emotional. And if we ignore our feelings, they will bubble up, and we will be unconsciously acting from them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:00):\nAnd there's this implicit power here that if the person cares about you and loves you or values your relationship, knowing that this makes them feel bad will make them want to change. It's not like you need to tell them, \"Change this thing. Oh, I didn't realize this made you upset or that you have this need. And now that I know that, okay, now I see why this is important to you.\"\n\nRachel Lockett (01:18:22):\nThat's exactly right. And sometimes the other person will hear that and have a different story or a different perspective. So they might say, \" Okay, I can honor that request,\" or, \"I hear that request, and I hear your feelings, but let me explain what happened for me.\" And one way you could do that is, are you open to hearing that? So they're able to share their side too. You don't have to just agree with the person's request. As long as you're setting this tone, the other person's more likely to contribute in a way that achieves mutual understanding because once you're vulnerable, they're going to share their vulnerability.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):\nLet me remind folks of the framework. I'm going to try using this. I wish it was a handy acronym off. So the framework is share what you've observed, just the facts of what is happening. Just simply, I saw you didn't close the fridge fully. Your feelings of how that made you feel, the needs that your core human need that drives that feeling, I imagine. And then the request you have of the person.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:19:28):\nYes. And I want to make one note I forgot to say, which is feelings are emotions. So sometimes people say things like, \"I feel like you're being a jerk.\" That's not a feeling, obviously. A feeling is a sensation in your body that results in an emotion. So naming a feeling is actually not easy for technical leaders sometimes. I want to make that point because emotions are what get you to the underlying humanity of connection. Emotions are the key to soliciting empathy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:05):\nAre there phrases that are just examples of non-feelings, like using the word \"you\" in the way you describe a feeling probably is not a good sign?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:20:14):\nExactly. If you can say, \"I feel like... \" even if you add like or, \"I feel that... \" you're probably going to add a fact. It should be an emotion word after I feel.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:24):\nSo don't say like, don't say you, don't say that?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:20:27):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:29):\nAwesome. Along this topic, I chatted with a number of clients that have worked with you over the years, and one of the most common themes that they said you help them with is having difficult conversations. And I think we covered actually much of this in what we just talked about, but I'm curious if there's any other advice you have for helping people have difficult conversations. Let me read a quote from one of your clients.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:20:52):\nOh, wow. I love this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:54):\nSo she said, \"Rachel is exceptional at making difficult decisions clear and making it feel possible to get these decisions actualized.\" Is there anything more-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:00):\n... these decisions actualized. Is there anything more there for, because difficult conversations are difficult. How do we help people make them less difficult? Any tips?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:21:11):\nYeah. Well, first of all, difficult conversations makes you want to run away. The marketing on conflict is poor, so I want to reframe that. My belief is when we feel internally ambivalent, we have two inner parts at war. And there's something really beautiful and important to pay attention to, there's something to learn, when we have ambivalence. When we are in conflict, something important is at stake. We care deeply about what we're building, about the person that's letting us down. So the reason it's hard, is because there's such an emotional component to it. And there's something to learn from it.\n\n(01:21:57):\nSo first, I want leaders who are listening to think, \"This is hard, because I have something to learn here, and because it matters. So instead of avoiding it and running away, I'm going to lean into this moment. And I'm going to come out of it not just having solved this dynamic, and not just having said my piece, but having built a skill.\" The reason I focus on interpersonal dynamics is because the quality of our relationships determines the quality of our life. I really believe that. And if you cannot have conflict, you can't have healthy relationships. We are going to disagree with the people we love, or care about, or are building a business with. So first, I just want listeners to reframe ambivalence and interpersonal challenge, think of them as a growth opportunity.\n\n(01:22:56):\nSecond, there is always something that we're doing to contribute to the conflict, even if it feels like the other person is insane, and is driving us crazy, and we're the innocent party. So entering any conflict conversation with humility, and curiosity about the other person's experience, is critical to setting the table for a commitment to come out better and stronger. So no model, NVC or otherwise, can fix a person who's coming in rigid and full of blame. I really love the 15 Commitments to Conscious Leaders, I don't know if you know that book, but one of the concepts is about taking a hundred percent responsibility. Not being in the world of blame, being a victim, or being a hero. And I see many leaders, when they're in a challenging interpersonal conflict, being in victimhood, being in blame, or being in hero. \"I'm just going to do it for them, and forget it. They're having such a hard time getting this done, I'm just going to do it.\"\n\n(01:24:10):\nInstead, take responsibility for your part. \"What is my piece in making this dynamic happen and how can I address it?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:18):\nThat makes me think about, Jerry Colonna was on the podcast, and he has this famous line that I've always remembered. How are you complicit in creating the conditions that you claim you don't want?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:24:29):\nYes, I love that. Love that question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:32):\nAnd there's so many, there's three parts to that whole question, I won't get into it. But what you're sharing here is, think about that, figure out how, because your point is, you're always somehow complicit in creating the issue you're complaining about. And use that to help kind of put down the defense of the person like, \"Here's what I've contributed to this problem.\" Do you use the nonviolent communication framework? And I don't know, is that just a general way of trying to have difficult conversations, or is there not a framework?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:24:58):\nYeah, no, I think that's a great framework for when you want to go interact with someone around something that's not working for you. I think typically a difficult conversation arises because some feelings are coming up for you, and you have a need that's not being met. And so, that's the instigator to know, \"Okay, I need to talk to this person. We need to clear this up.\"\n\n(01:25:17):\nFor example, I was working with a CEO whose co-founder was constantly undercutting his decisions, and criticizing him. And there was something happening, where they'd gone from being this great dynamic duo, fundraised, hired a few leaders, and then all of a sudden he was getting daggers thrown at him all the time. And it was exhausting, and frustrating, and confusing. That was a time where he used NVC to address, \"What is happening, here?\" And it turned out that the co-founder was really frustrated with how he was spending his time. He didn't want him to be off selling, he wanted him to be helping him with product vision. And they had a totally different conception of how the CEO should be spending his time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:02):\nAwesome. Just remind folks of the NVC framework, because this is the thing that's hard in the moment. Like, \"Oh, what should I be saying?\" Observe, feelings, needs, request.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:26:11):\nYeah, exactly. And there's a nonviolent communication book, if folks are into the framework, and want to check it out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:17):\nPeople need a little... Who was it, you said one of your client's tattooed the vision he had, on-\n\nRachel Lockett (01:26:22):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:22):\nOkay, there's, let's just get something.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:26:24):\nMaybe don't tattoo NVC.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:25):\nBecause that may be [inaudible 01:26:25]\n\nRachel Lockett (01:26:27):\nIt doesn't have a good acronym. You could just print it out, and put it right next to your screen, or something-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:27):\nAll right, okay.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:26:30):\n... if you want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:31):\nNo tattoos. I just want to highlight the first point you made in this answer, of having difficult conversations. And then I have one more question for you. Just this point about, if there's something you're afraid of, that is a sign you should do that. There's a quote I often think of. \"The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek.\" And the advice there is just, the thing you're afraid of is a compass too, the thing you should do. Because there's something important there.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:26:58):\nI love that. Yeah. It's like, \"What's important here? What do I have to learn here?\" Is a question you can ask yourself when you're avoiding something. I often see this in talent management situations. A CEO has an underperforming COO. They're avoiding a conversation, because they keep getting let down, and actually they kind of know deep down, this is not working out. They don't want to face it. It's too much work. They need to just keep plowing forward.\n\n(01:27:27):\nAnd when we really take space to think about their feelings and needs, they realize, I ask them, \"Would you enthusiastically rehire this person for the same role?\" Which is the question we always asked at Stripe. And when the answer is no to that, no matter how many difficult conversations you have, this is not going to work. So then you have to take action. And even engaging in the hard conversation, and seeing what happens, can lead you to the clarity that you need to take action on talent that's not working.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:01):\nThat is a really cool tip. I did not know Stripe operated that way. We had the CTO of Netflix on the podcast, Elizabeth Stone, and this is very much how they operate. They're always asking a question like that. The way you phrased it was, \"Would I enthusiastically rehire this person for the same role?\"\n\nRachel Lockett (01:28:18):\nExactly. It's very clarifying, because it's binary. People have a physical sense, just like we talked about a full body yes, before? You have a immediate reaction that is honest, to that question, that provides clarity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:33):\nAnd the answer isn't, if it's no, it's not, \"Fire them.\" It's, \"You need to do something about it.\" It could be talk to them about it, put them on a performance plan, put them in a different role. It doesn't mean you have to fire them immediately, so it's not necessarily as scary as it sounds, if you say no.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:28:47):\nYeah, I think that also it depends on the stage of business you're in. So I see a lot of companies build a leadership team, and then a year later, the size and stage of their business is dramatically different. And they start to realize, \"Oh, the CFO that was really fine back then, is now completely wrong. He should be the controller.\" Okay, great. So reckon with that. Recognize that in how you're interacting with your current CFO, put out a search. There's many things you can do that aren't firing someone. But in quickly scaling businesses, it's natural that the leadership team's job will change, and that you'll have to make some evolution over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:28):\nAnd I guess it's very important to highlight the importance of operating this way, if you're trying to build a really successful company, is that should be the bar. Is, if you would not enthusiastically rehire this person for this role. If you're trying to build something that's never been built before, and build a company that actually works out really well, you need to really only have people around that are hitting that bar.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:29:50):\nYeah. My perspective, I talked at the beginning about how I'm obsessed with the human side of business building, and my belief is that talent and the environment that you put your talent in is everything. Yes. Building a product and a business is about building something that users need. It's about product market fit, and then the wave you're on. Timing is important. You're going to build a different size business, if you're in a sector that's not growing, than right now, if you're in the middle of AI. True. You're riding a timing wave, and you're solving a core need. But everything besides that is so human. It's about talent, and it's about the environment that you put that talent in. So you need to create the conditions such that your talent can thrive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:37):\nSuch a simple concept, that I think people overlook, is just everything you do is going to be the people that you have around you, and the environment you create for them to operate. I think your point about when you're doing something difficult, just to close out this element, I love this idea that if it feels hard, think of it as a learning opportunity. I think anyone listening to this is like, \"Oh, cool, I'm going to learn something. I'm going to get better.\" It's such a easier, more motivating way of approaching something that's difficult.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:31:05):\nAnd I want to make a distinction between that and what we talked about earlier, which was, lean into your strengths. Because I don't believe people should suffer through the day grinding, doing work that's depleting. That's not a learning opportunity. Interpersonally, when you're avoiding something, it's because you care about something. Avoiding your emotions is what I want to encourage people against. We have to feel our feelings all the way through, be present to our feelings, and interact with others in a way that acknowledges our feelings. That's what I want to encourage, because actually that's not deadening, that's enlivening. And there's learning there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:48):\nA final area I want to spend a little time on is, something that I've heard from everybody that you work with, which is the way that you help them operate. So you just talked about the importance of the people you hire and the environment you create for them. And something that you help leaders do is create a very specific way of operating around a one-page plan, and how that kind of trickles down and just makes everything at a company more effective. Talk about this one-page plan, how you recommend companies operate with this.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:32:17):\nYeah, thanks for asking that question. I think, typically, companies have complicated the process of aligning their vision, their strategy, their goals, and the way people behave with each other, their values. So that all of these things live in different places, are talked about to a different degree, resonate to employees differently. And if you asked anyone at the company, \"What are your top three priorities, and how do they relate to the vision?\" It's not an easy answer.\n\n(01:32:50):\nSo the reason I like the one-page plan concept is, it's simplifying. It's a way for the leadership team to come together and align around, \" What are we doing here? What is our role in it? And how do we communicate it, so that the whole company has clarity, and knows how the work they're doing ladders up to our big picture vision that we're all committed to?\"\n\n(01:33:14):\nSo I actually got this idea of the one-page plan from Alpine Investors. They have something called the People First Operating Rhythm, and they've successfully implemented that at their portfolio companies. And I work in concert with Alpine, so I work with some of their portfolio CEOs. To execute this rhythm. So it's not just about a one-page plan. It puts your vision and your values on the first column, your strategic intentions and your KPIs on the second column, your annual goals on the third, and your quarterly goals on the fourth. So that no matter what you're talking about, in terms of, \"What are we doing for the next year, or the next quarter? How do we prioritize?\" It's always in tandem with your core KPIs, your strategy, and your vision.\n\n(01:34:04):\nAnd I love how they instituted that with their portfolio, and I saw the power of it. They've collected some data that their portfolio companies that actually institute the People First Operating Rhythm result in higher returns. So they're very committed to this strategy, and after operating with CEOs in their rhythm, I took some of those ideas and started to help other founders and other leaders with some of the same concepts, in my own way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:30):\nWe're going to hopefully link to a template of this one-page plan?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:34:33):\nYeah, sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:33):\nOkay, cool.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:34:33):\nHappy to share.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:34):\nOkay, so let's do that. And then, what kind of impact do you see from companies starting to operate this way to motivate people to do this?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:34:41):\nYeah. What I see is clarity and alignment. And I also see more connection. So I want to name that it's not just about having a plan, it's about how you create it, how you reflect on it, and how you come together around it to celebrate wins.\n\n(01:34:57):\nSo in my opinion, a very under- attended to part of building a business is an operating rhythm. When do you come together to kick off the year, and share your strategy and vision again, and talk about the goals? When do you come together to reflect on what's working and not working, and how do you do that? And in what groups? And are you honest, or are you just kind of doing it as a quick exercise to move on to what's pressing?\n\n(01:35:25):\nSo just like I said in co-founder dynamics, a key is to step out of the dance floor and to get onto the balcony. Executive teams leading a complex business need time away from being in the business to work on the business. So around this one-page plan, the reason I like a rhythm, is you can kick off the year with the plan. That's really simple, easy to understand. Everyone can have it accessible and every quarter, you can get together to reflect, \"What worked, what didn't work?\"\n\n(01:35:56):\nI really like the question, \"What's an inconvenient truth?\" Air the things that need to be talked about, that no one's talking about because you're too busy. That's the power of combining a simple plan, whether it's one page or not, that aligns you from the top to the bottom, your vision all the way down to your quarterly goals. And a time where you stop, pause, discuss, reflect, have a little spacious energy.\n\n(01:36:26):\nIt's not unlike what you said about your own time. You are the executive team. You want a little bit of spacious time to tinker, reflect, create, and come back to the meaningful work you're doing more energized. And leadership teams need that too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:45):\nWait, Alpine Investors, Graham Weaver. He was on the podcast.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:36:45):\nI saw that. I saw that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:49):\nI love that. Okay, final, final question. I want to take us to AI corner before we get to the very exciting lighting round. I'm going to do kind of a tweaked version. Usually I ask people just, how has AI impacted their work and life? I guess that is the question here, just how has AI changed, I guess coaching, as a coach? But also just, from a client's perspective, how are people using AI to help them in their, I guess life, from a coaching perspective?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:37:13):\nYeah, it's a great question. So as a coach, I use AI in a couple of key ways, that I'm grateful for. One, I use Granola, which I saw you give away to your listeners.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:23):\nOne free year of Granola, for becoming an annual subscriber of Lenny's Newsletter, lennysnewsletter.com.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:37:29):\nThere you go.\n\n(01:37:29):\nSo I use Granola to take notes in our session so I can be fully present with my clients, and I can give them a synthesis of what happened and the next steps they committed to after our session. I also use it, I put them in a folder for every client, and so I can look at insights across our work together. What are the deeper things that are happening? What are the patterns that are taking place? I have these in my head, but actually it's a great tool, to see over time. \"Oh yeah, we talked about that in our first session. Let's bring that back, because that's what you're struggling with now.\" So it helps me create the kind of transformation that I want for all my clients.\n\n(01:38:08):\nSecondly, I just use ChatGPT to help me plan my retreats. I run a women's organization, and we have eight retreats a year, and it's a great tool to think expansively about new activities. Once I've gotten the core objectives down, and I have a bunch of ideas about what I want to do, it gives me new creative ideas. So I can put in like, \"Here's my objective, here's my goal, here's my audience, here's my last retreat that I ran. I kind of want three new ideas for this session.\" So it'll give me creative energy that I otherwise would need to get together with other coaches to discuss. And I do that, too.\n\n(01:38:50):\nFinally, I'm experimenting with AI in a way to support my clients between sessions. So I've gotten some feedback from my clients that they would like more interaction between our sessions, and they're always allowed to email me, or text me. I'm available to them. But I think they want to be really respectful of my time, and so some people do reach out and ask me questions, and other people wait for our session.\n\n(01:39:17):\nSo I'm curious about the future of coaching, how in between sessions, clients can get access to more of an AI support, where the bot has all of their context, their development plan that we create at the beginning. So that's their goals, for our work together, how they want to grow. Some of my core frameworks, and my beliefs, and my training. And the Granola notes from all of our sessions, so that they can access between, just some extra spot support. They're going into this conversation, how should they approach it? They're anxious about this team meeting. How can they make the most of it? More tactical support. I see personal coaching as still critical for, \"What is your vision of your life? How do you want to shift your core behavior to align with that vision?\" But then, AI can play a real helpful role in between, on the tactics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:15):\nThat is super cool. So that's something you already do, where they have access to this kind of GPT-\n\nRachel Lockett (01:40:19):\nIt's something I'm building right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:20):\nYou're building, that is-\n\nRachel Lockett (01:40:21):\nMy clients don't have that yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:22):\nOkay. That is great. That is a really good idea. It's not replacing coaching and therapists, let's say, but it's adding a lot more in-between time where you could just talk to us, based on everything you've talked about, all the frameworks that you use. That is extremely cool. All right. There's a billion-dollar company coming.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:40:39):\nI don't want to build that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:43):\nIt's not your zone of genius.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:40:44):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:47):\nRachel, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with, before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:40:55):\nWhat I want to share is that the world is getting more lonely. There's a lot of research on this, but it's also obvious in my coaching sessions, that people feel more alienated from one another. And actually, building businesses is an inherently human endeavor. So I am a fan of this AI boom, I appreciate that we have more technology at our fingertips than ever before. But I want to encourage listeners to think of themselves as leaders who bring humans together to self-actualize, and that they have to actively overcome the default state, which is blind, grind, and loneliness. So I think this is a call to action for your listeners, to connect with the people around them, lead healthier teams, create environments where connection is inevitable. And that they will have more fun, and build better businesses, because of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:03):\nWhat a beautiful way to end it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:42:10):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:11):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:42:16):\nOne of them I said before, The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leaders. And I love Designing Your Life, by Bill Burnett.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:25):\nI love that book, too. People don't talk about that book enough. Next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:42:31):\nOh, God. I just went to KPop Demon Hunters with my daughter. It's so embarrassing, but that's what we dressed as for Halloween, like everyone else in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:38):\nI have not seen that. I hear everyone talking about it. I am going to try to avoid it, I think. Next question. Favorite product you have recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be a gadget, could be clothes.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:42:48):\nI really love Loom.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:50):\nAmazing.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:42:51):\nI've been recording trainings on Loom for some of my clients that are, it's a scaled holding company, so I'm able to scale training in a really human, connected way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:02):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, in work or in life?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:43:06):\nI have a quote that is on my desk. And I love it. Ready? \"If you can see your path laid out in front of you, step by step, it's not your path. Your own path, you make with every step you take. That's why it's your path.\" That's a Joseph Campbell quote.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:27):\nBeautiful. Final question. You've got two kids, you said. Do you have any favorite children's books that you most love reading to them, that they've loved most?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:43:36):\nOh my gosh. So my daughter is really into Roald Dahl. I love Roald Dahl, because he's completely irreverent, and he has a crazy imagination. So we've been reading Witches, Matilda, all of his books. And both my kids love it. So, they're five and seven.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:54):\nHave you seen the Wes Anderson stories of his stories, where he takes [inaudible 01:43:58]-\n\nRachel Lockett (01:43:58):\nSome of them, yeah. They're great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:00):\nYeah, they're so amazing. Oh my God. And it's like Roald Dahl is like, I think it's personifying him. He's like a character in the story.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:44:06):\nYeah, he's a character, from what I hear about his life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:09):\nRachel, this was incredible. I feel like we've very much accomplished what I set out to do, which is just give people all this advice that they never have access to that, costs tens of thousands of dollars. I think we're going to help a lot of people improve their lives and their careers. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:44:26):\nAbsolutely. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:28):\nI almost forgot to ask you two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, maybe consider working with you? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nRachel Lockett (01:44:36):\nYeah, find me at lockettcoaching.com, and how can listeners be useful? Listeners should turn towards each other, build great relationships, and send CEOs and co-founders my way if they need coaching.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:48):\nThank you so much for being here.\n\nRachel Lockett (01:44:50):\nThanks for having me. Take care, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:52):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:44:55):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Superhuman's secret to success | Rahul Vohra (CEO and founder)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nLet's talk about product market fit.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:00:01):\nYou have to deliberately not act on the feedback of many of your early users, and this is at the same time as listening to people intensely and building what people want. That's what we're here to do, is to make something that people want, but it can't be all people. And the question becomes, how do you listen to them? And then even of what they say, what do you pay attention to and what don't you? The trick here is-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):\nYou're not doing what a lot of CEOs think they need to be doing with their time. A lot of CEOs think they need to spend time on hiring or org building and you intentionally, \"I will spend time on product and marketing design.\"\n\nRahul Vohra (00:00:36):\nThis is a technique that I call the switch lock. It's born out of the observation that your calendar says what you thought you were going to do, but it's really only your trail of work that describes what you actually did. How can we capture that? So I came up with the following idea. What if I just did whatever the heck I wanted?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):\nWhat's the most pivotal moment in your career, in your life?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:00:58):\nI learned the real secret behind virality. There is no such thing as a truly viral product. What then is the true secret? It is-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):\nToday my guest is Rahul Vohra. Rahul is the founder and CEO of Superhuman and one of the most thoughtful and insightful and articulate founders that I've met. As you'll see in our conversation, it's hard not to be captivated by Rahul's storytelling skills and also his really insightful takes on how to build great products and teams.\n\n(00:01:32):\nThis episode is for anyone who's looking to build their product taste, help their teams move faster, learn how to think better from first principles. And also learn about Superhuman's very unique approach to building their company, including why they manually onboarded every single new user for years and why they decided to stop. Why they ignored most of their customer feedback on their way to finding product market fit, and also how you can use his approach to finding product market fit for your own company. Also, the power of game design in building great products, a very contrarian take on pricing strategy, what Rahul has learned about building scaled products on top of AI and LLMs and so much more.\n\n(00:02:07):\nA huge thank you to Ed Sims, Conrad Irwin, Bell Trenchard and Gaurav Vohra for suggesting questions and topics for this conversation.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:05:07):\nHello, hello and thank you for having me Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:10):\nI have so many questions for you. We're going to have so much to talk about. I actually want to start with your time before Superhuman. When I was preparing for this chat, I actually asked you, what's the most pivotal moment in your career in your life? And you told me that other than starting Superhuman, it was selling your previous company Rapportive to LinkedIn. So let me just start there. What was that experience like? What do people not know about this phase in your life and just why was it so pivotal?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:05:37):\nSo for folks that don't know, Rapportive was my last company. It was the first Gmail extension to scale to millions of users. Basically on the right-hand side of Gmail, we would show you what people look like, where they work, links to their recent tweets, their LinkedIn profile and everything else that they were doing online. So if you were hiring, marketing, selling in BD, super useful. It turns out we somehow attracted most of LinkedIn's daily active users onto this one free app, and I then ultimately ended up selling that to LinkedIn. That by far, as you said, was the most pivotal thing I'd done in my career, prior to starting Superhuman.\n\n(00:06:22):\nNow, had I known that we'd amassed most of LinkedIn's active users onto one app, I would have sold it for far more. But the actual pivotal moment was really who I got to work with. Because I reported to LinkedIn's head of Growth, Elliot Shmukler. He was responsible for scaling LinkedIn from 25 million members to when I joined, north of 250 million members. And during my first one-on-one, I learned the real secret behind virality and big hint, it's not about viral mechanics. Overall that acquisition experience gave me the time to figure out what was next and the resources to truly swing for the fences.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:02):\nOkay. Well, I have to follow this thread that you put out there, what the secret is to virality. What did you learn there?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:07:08):\nWell, in my first one-on-one, I sat down with Elliot and I said, \"Hey, I'm here to learn. Please teach me everything that you know about virality.\" And he said, \"Okay. Well, hate to burst your bubble, but there is no such thing as a truly viral product.\" I said, \"What do you mean? How do you explain Facebook for that matter? How do you explain LinkedIn?\" And he said, \"What I mean is, no app has sustained a viral factor of greater than one for any real period of time.\" Even Facebook in its heyday had a viral factor of about 0.7. And he told me that lasted for perhaps a year, so one person was creating about 0.7 new users.\n\n(00:07:57):\nI double-clicked again and I said, \"Well Elliot, what about the address book import?\" This is one of the things that LinkedIn got famous or infamous for. You could import your address book and then it would spam slash invite everyone who happens to be members of LinkedIn in your address book, and then eventually it would just invite everyone to LinkedIn. And he said, \"That's an amazing feature, but you have to remember not everyone is going to use it all the time.\" So even that feature had a lifetime viral factor of about 0.4, and that's considered good.\n\n(00:08:28):\n 0.4 is good for a viral feature, 0.6 is great, something like 0.7 is absolutely incredible. You're in the stratosphere up with Facebook at that time. So I said, \"Well, okay, all of these things by definition are going to Peter out. There's going to be an asymptote. None of these viral mechanics keep on compounding. Which actually makes sense, it would be a little absurd if things just kept on growing. What then is the true secret behind virality?\" And he said, \"It is word of mouth. It is the virality you can't measure that isn't a mechanic that isn't in a feature. It is when one user spontaneously tells another user about your product.\" That really colored how I think about growth and virality. Since then, it has shaped so much of what we do at Superhuman and so much of how I think about growing brands.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:23):\nWow, you're such a great storyteller. I'm just listening here, just captivated, \"What is he going to say next?\" That was fascinating. I actually have a post that I'm going to link to that, that very much aligns with what you're talking about, which is titled, Virality is a Myth mostly. It's based, I forget, on this book where they do all this research on actual viruses. It turns out they're not actually spreading in this exponential way, there's one person that spreads it to a lot of people and it keeps happening.\n\n(00:09:52):\nThat's actually apparently what the data shows. I'm curious if you found this same thing, which is, when people think of an app as going viral, it's one person with a massive platform sharing it and their audience adopts it and that's just one to many and then it just happens a couple of times and it looks like it's going viral, but it's a person to many people, not many people to many people. Thoughts on that?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:10:14):\nYeah, we've definitely found that there are whales, to use the gaming terminology, that one person is going to be responsible for inviting 25, 50, 100 people, and they may have various motivations for doing that. In Superhuman, as an individual subscriber, if you refer somebody else and they sign up, you both get a free month, which is a great incentive if you're paying out of pocket.\n\n(00:10:39):\nWe have people who send many, many hundreds of invites and there are some people who essentially have free Superhuman for life now due to how many people they've invited. But of course that incentive doesn't necessarily work inside of a company or inside of a team where ultimately it's the company paying for the product, so you have to then come up with new motivations for those people. That's where there really isn't any substitute to having a genuinely multiplayer or a genuinely collaborative product. That's one of the huge evolutions we've taken Superhuman through over the last, probably about two years.\n\n(00:11:15):\nEarly last year we launched what we call Superhuman 2.0. The basic idea is, we saw almost every single other app of note become collaborative by default, Figma, Notion, Loom. These are all multiplayer or collaborative by default. Yet email, the one tool that we all use more than anything else, even more than things like Slack, was still firmly stuck in its single-player origins.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:43):\nI want to come back to something that you mentioned that I didn't come back to you that I think is really core to what you just shared, which is word of mouth being so important. People talk about all these viral features and sharing contact books and all these things. And your point is, that takes you to a place, but really what helps a consumer-ish product spread is word of mouth, people sharing with each other. Which, then the question is, how do you do that? We're going to talk about a lot of things that you did to make Superhuman something people want to share, but in the end it's just making something people want to share. That's the definition almost. Then it's like, what makes people want to share stuff? It's amazing, it's helping them, something that is remarkable.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:12:22):\nWell, it turns out, because you mentioned remarkableness, that is one of our core company values. If you think about what a company has to do, it has to grow. How do things grow? Well, let's take Elliot's advice at face value, and I believe it's true, it's creating something that people share. You mentioned one way of doing it, which is something that people want to share. There's actually another way, which is simply creating something remarkable, and you used that word, and that is one of the core values of Superhuman.\n\n(00:12:53):\nWe have, create delight, create something that is so joyful that really truly brings people delight. We have deliver remarkable quality, something that is so striking, so compelling and worthy of attention that people can't but help tell others about it. Then we have build the extraordinary, which is a measure of the efficacy or the innovativeness of what we want to build. That's another trick, which is literally baking these raw ingredients for growth into your company values.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):\nI didn't know that was one of your values. That makes so much sense. Okay, we're going to come back to that, because I think that is... There's so much to learn about how you think about product and how you think about building the company that builds the product. But I want to actually start here with how this conversation came to be.\n\n(00:13:41):\nThe CEO of Product Hunt, Rajiv, tweeted months ago, he tweeted this and we're going to show this if you're on YouTube, \"Superhuman's product velocity feels like it's kicked into another gear as of late. Does anyone else notice this?\" I saw that, I'm like, \"I completely have noticed this. It feels like there's just feature shipping left and right, AI this, AI that. It feels like it's just a new company.\" And I tagged you on the tweet. I'm like, \"Hey Rahul, what's changed?\" And you answered with a few things and it just made it clear there's a lot to learn about what you did.\n\n(00:14:12):\nBecause a lot of companies are in this phase of just, \"Things aren't moving as fast as we want. We used to be so much faster, we used to ship all these features and now we don't.\" So I think this is a really cool real case study illustrative example that we can analyze. So let me ask you this, what did you notice that told you something needed to change at Superhuman? And then what did you change that actually had the most impact on your ability to ship and move faster?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:14:37):\nI think what we noticed was this sentiment, and we felt it first ourselves, but we also started hearing it from the market, from our users, from our customers, that we'd slowed down. And as a founder, as a CEO, that's the absolute last thing you want to hear. It's our job after all to speed things up. When I ask people what do they mean by slowing down, they didn't mean the product, of course, the product wasn't working any slower, but that the pace of delivery seemed to have slowed down.\n\n(00:15:09):\nI think to break this down, it's important to start by defining what we mean by a slowdown. There's the kind of slowdown that is unavoidable in certain spaces, and then there is the kind of slowdown that is quite avoidable. We actually had both. So starting with unavoidable slowdown, you can classify anything that you build in a company into one of two categories, solution deepening and market widening. Now, solution deepening means making your product better for its existing users, but not making it available to more users. Whereas market widening means making your product available to more users, but not making the product itself any better.\n\n(00:15:50):\nThere are some spaces, there are some markets, there are some platforms where market widening is really fast and really easy, and there are some spaces, email is one of them where market widening is really hard and really slow. But when we started we had a great deal of focus. We only supported Gmail, we were only on the web. In those early years, we could pour every ounce of R&D energy, every engineering dollar, into solution deepening, making the product better for existing users. And of course users loved it. It's how we got to product market fit. It's how most startups do.\n\n(00:16:24):\nBut at a certain point, almost every company then has to start investing in widening the market. For example, the market of people who will use a new Gmail front end but without a mobile app, does exist, but it is relatively small. This is something that every new email startup is going to learn sooner or later. In order to keep on growing, you are going to have to need to add an iOS app and then a MacOS app, and then a Windows app, and then an Android app. Then you'll soon want to support Office 365. But that's not one thing, that's actually three things, because you have to support Office 365 on desktop and then on iOS and then on Android. That's all much easier said than done.\n\n(00:17:04):\nI think we at Superhuman now know things about these APIs that literally no other company knows, and I would not wish it upon my worst enemy. So fast-forward to today, and Superhuman now works wherever you do on every combination of Gmail, Outlook, Mac, Windows, Web, iOS, Android, and this actually turns out to be a really great technology moat. Almost no other email app can claim this. It's taken many years of intense investment. I think we'll touch on this later, but it's one of the main reasons why we can sell into the enterprise, because we now know everyone can use it.\n\n(00:17:37):\nBut this is the hard part, when you're doing that market widening, you're not solution deepening, so your perceived product velocity may decrease. You can avoid some of these things with some smart technology decisions, but mostly you just have to grind through it, and it is worth it to get to the other side. Then there's the kind of slowdown that is avoidable. If I remember my answer to Rajiv's tweet, that was the kind I was talking about. In that case it was our management structure, or who does what.\n\n(00:18:07):\nWhen we hired our initial executive teams, I followed very conventional wisdom. I ended up with a set of VPs and eight, I think direct reports, maybe even nine. I thought that's what you were meant to do. That's how startups are meant to scale. But as anyone who's been there knows, eight direct reports is a lot. It's a lot of hiring, it's a lot of goal setting, it's a lot of OKRs, it's a lot of accountability conversations, and fortunately also it's a lot of firing. No CEO ever gets their executive team right on the first try. That time I had for the things that I think I can genuinely be world-class at things like product and design and technology and marketing, that all began to rapidly disappear, and as a result the organization began to slow down.\n\n(00:18:54):\nUnfortunately, I was also tracking my time very closely, I had this crazy way of tracking it. At one point I noticed I was spending six to 7% of my week on these areas, these areas where I can truly be world-class at. So I had two realizations. Number one, as CEO, once you get to a certain scale, and we were definitely at that scale, you can actually define what you want the role of a CEO to be at your company. And number two, the Superhuman opportunity deserves everyone who works at the company to spend as much time as possible in their zone of genius, so that includes me as well as everybody else. What I did is, I hired a really great president, I went from eight direct reports to two, and the amount of time that I spend on product design, technology and marketing went up from six to 7% to about 60% to 70% of my week.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:49):\nJust to mirror back a few things. One is, people may feel like you are not shipping as much as you used to because you're actually building things they don't care about, which is support for office and all these things that they don't need, but the business needs to expand, integrations with Microsoft and Android and all these things. I think that's such a good point, that it looks like nothing's happening when there's a lot of good stuff happening for other users that aren't you.\n\n(00:20:15):\nThen there's this point about people delegate. Then a leader of delegates, hires all these execs and they're like, \"This is not what I wanted. Why have I done this?\" And you think it's going to speed up, but it slows down. A couple threads here that are really interesting. One is this time tracking thing, I need to know how do you do this? The fact that you knew seven to 8% or whatever the number is, to that granularity of your time you're spending on things you wanted was that low, how do you do time tracking? Let's not go super far, but just what's your approach?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:20:48):\nThis is a technique that I call the Switch log. It's born out of the observation that your calendar says what you thought you were going to do, but it's really only your trail of work that describes what you actually did. So how can we capture that? And actually, how can we create a system of work that isn't tethered to a calendar, where you aren't at the behest of what some timetable says you do or you don't have to do? So I came up with the following idea, what if I just did whatever the heck I wanted? What if every single time I change task I just Slack DM'd my EA, but this also works in Slackbot, it just has to go somewhere. I Slack DM'd my EA and I said, \"TS:,\" and then a few words for the task I was doing.\n\n(00:21:45):\nWell, that would create certain changes. Instead of having to constantly look at the calendar and think, \"Oh, should I stop this task, start that task, I can just do what I want.\" If what I feel right now is, \"Oh boy, I really need to prepare for Lenny's podcast, I'll go ahead and do that.\" And if I get bored or distracted eight minutes in, which sometimes happens because something else just bubbles up to the top of my mind, well, there's a reason that my body is bubbling it up to the top of my mind. I also practice transcendental meditation, so I'm very keen on the idea of being aware and listening to what's bubbling up.\n\n(00:22:20):\nSo it's okay for me to then go and attend to that thought as opposed to start to expend my focus points or my discipline or willpower on the thing that I thought I was meant to be doing. All I'd have to do is I'd go back to Slack, \"TS: Dealing with this other thing.\" And by the way, you should obviously turn up for your meetings. I'm not saying just blow through your meetings and not turn up for your one-on-ones. Definitely do those things. What I'm saying is, do what feels right for as long as it feels right to do. Then at the end of the week you can see where your time is going.\n\n(00:22:55):\nI realized at one point that I was spending only in those days 5% of my time on recruiting, whereas perhaps I should be spending 20 or 30% or more of my time on recruiting. But the biggest thing was, I saw I was only spending six to 7% of my time on product, on design, on technology and marketing. These are things where I know I'm really good at them. I should either be teaching people how to do them or doing them or some combination of both. That's probably the best thing for me. It keeps me really happy, very joyful, it keeps me sharp, but it's also scaling the organization. So that's how we had that kind of an insight. Once you have this Slack Log, you can then graph it and chart it and see where your time is actually going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:37):\nHow cool. Clearly this is an app opportunity or an agent opportunity where you're just telling this thing every time. It's essentially tracking context, which we're always hearing, try not to avoid context which switches.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:23:50):\nI think context switches are fine. There's definitely this idea that, for every interruption you have, the brain does take roughly 21 minutes on average to recover, to get back to the efficacy before that you were disturbed. It's a big deal, of course, I'm building productivity software, we designed Superhuman to minimize the amount of distraction and disruption that's possible within the app. But if you are working on something and at the back of your mind something bubbles up, you have to attend to it in one way or the other. Sometimes I just write it down, actually, I don't have my notebook with me, but it's really big. I have a gigantic, whatever twice the size of A4 is, I guess A3 sketchbook and I always have a 4H pencil, so whenever one of those thoughts comes up, I just scribble it down. Or I actually stop what I'm doing and I attend to that task, because there's a reason it's bubbling up right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:44):\nI love that you know exactly the type of paper and pencil, 4H pencil, A3 paper, [inaudible 00:24:51]. Okay, this is going to be a theme. You mentioned meditation, you said you do TM, so you do 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes... Do you do it that style or you do a longer session?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:25:01):\nI do about half an hour in the morning, including rest time. The physical rest component of it is very important to me. So it's 20 minutes of the actual meditation, then 10 minutes of rest. I do that in the morning as well as in the afternoon at around 3:00 PM\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):\nAnd you just carve that out in your calendar. Everyone knows Rahul at three o'clock, he's going to be out.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:25:17):\nAbsolutely. My EA knows, they're the one who's organizing the calendar and making sure things happen when they need to happen. They also know that nothing can override this TM block. Without it I genuinely start to fall apart. But with it, I'm able to access some very deep competencies that I didn't have before. I've been doing this now for about four or five years, and initially I simply felt happier, occasionally even more euphoric coming out of a really great meditation session. But over time I found that my ability to focus was increasing. I could hold attention on something for much longer, but I also was able to become much more creative and much more expressive.\n\n(00:26:02):\nThese are well-known side effects, as it were, or intended effects for some people of TM. And interestingly about TM, if you compare it to other forms of meditation, they don't have quite the same impact across quite as many executive functions. So there's something particularly interesting that's going on with transcendental meditation as opposed to other forms that folks are still trying to unravel and figure out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:26):\nIf folks want to, if they're inspired and they want to check out this form of meditation, any advice on where they could go learn?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:26:32):\nAbsolutely, a lot. But in summary, have a coach teach you. I had many false starts myself with meditation, trying the various apps, learning from books. None of it really worked for me. What worked was having one-on-one teaching from someone themselves who had been taught one-on-one the Yogic or the Raja tradition of teaching. This person in particular had also been a venture-backed founder multiple times over, so they're very well aware of the kinds of stresses that I tend to be under. And all of his clients are mostly in technology as well. If you're in the Bay Area, this person's name is Laurent Valasek. They run an institution called the Peak Leadership Institute. And this is all about how we can live a more integrated and whole life. Integrating wellness practices like meditation, but for the purpose of unlocking peak performance in life and in business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:31):\nThank you for sharing that. That is very actionable. We're going to link to that in the show notes.\n\n(00:27:35):\nOkay. I'm going to try to bring us back on course. The other thing you mentioned that I think is really interesting is hiring a president. A lot of founders and leaders might be hearing this and be like, \"Going from eight reports and doing all these things I don't want to, spending most of my time on the product and design and marketing, amazing.\" What did this president take off your plate and what is their responsibility and that allowed you to do the stuff you wanted to do?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:27:58):\nThe biggest thing was taking off the operations and the management of the executive team and the rest of the company. Think of the president role in Superhuman as an operationally extremely challenging and a very growthful role. It is perfect for someone who wants to go on to be a CEO in their next role. Instead of hiring and firing that team, instead of managing and setting their goals, instead of the accountability conversations, someone else who's now doing that.\n\n(00:28:35):\nIn addition, because that's not the only job, in addition, they're also a very strong thought partner when it comes to corporate strategy. When it comes to, where do we take act one, our email product? How far do we go down the multiplayer path? How aggressively should we lean into AI? What's a reasonable gross margin in a world with AI? Are we from a financial perspective okay dipping now and then coming back later? When should we start building our second product? How do we think about our R&D strategy? Should we keep on hiring in the Bay Area, or as we've done for many of our recent hires, should we continue hiring in Latin America? Should we consider other time zones as well? And so on and so on and so on. I'm just randomly coming up with questions, but the list is truly endless.\n\n(00:29:27):\nAnother way to think about it is, it's almost like a grown-up co-founder. The two people I co-founded the company with, Comrade and Vivek, they've long since gone from Superhuman. We're now a 10-year-old organization and I'm one those rare founders that is persisting and thriving actually 10 years in. That said, the journey never gets easier, it gets different and you still need that co-founding energy around you. I have a handful of people in the organization who are in their roles providing that kind of energy, that kind of input, and who thrive off doing so. Then the president role is definitely one of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:07):\nIncredibly interesting. There's so much there. One, just a couple of things I'll share and then I want to move on to a different topic. One is just, it's cool the solution to helping you move faster and do the work you want to do is org design. That feels like a really doable thing. If you're finding you're not spending time on things you want to spend time on and things aren't moving as fast as you want, it's essentially you can find people to take on things that you don't want and shift the way that the org is structured and that could solve a lot of problems. That's what it did for you. Then I think it's also really interesting, there's this lesson here of as a founder, if you're just feeling depleted or just don't have the partner you want, you could bring someone on that could be that person.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:30:50):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:52):\nOkay. There's so much there. That was much more of a rich area than I even expected. I want to zoom out a little bit, and there's a couple themes that came up again and again when I talked to folks that you've worked with, investors in Superhuman. The two themes are contrarian thinking, in terms of building the company, and strong attention to detail. Let's spend a little time on attention to detail. Like I said, this is one of the things that came up again and again when I was asking people about you. So I have this quote from Ed Sims, and maybe your first investor. Were they your first investor?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:31:27):\nYeah, that there's a bunch of people on Twitter who are going to fight for that. But to set the record straight, Ed Sim did actually write the first three checks into Superhuman.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:35):\nFirst three checks? At subsequent rounds.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:31:38):\nWell, yeah. Quick sidebar on that, he runs Boldstart Ventures alongside his partner Elliot Durbin. They have a particular interest in backing second-time founders, but they'll also back first-time founders, and they love application and infrastructure areas like Superhuman, so we were like the perfect investment. He also wrote a check from his previous fund into a Rapportive, and I think I'd made him five X that money. Nothing to write home about, but definitely, \"I'm going to back this guy again.\" So I went to him and I said, \"Hey listen, this is going to sound crazy. I want to take on Gmail.\" He said, \"Do you have a deck?\" I was like, \"Yeah, here it is one slide, here it is.\" And there was a screenshot of Gmail with most of it scribbled out, \"I want to build that and it's going to be amazing.\"\n\n(00:32:25):\nSo he said, \"Cool, we're in. Can I wire you the money?\" And I said, \"No, I don't even have a bank account yet.\" I come back two days later with a bank account and he's like, \"Cool, I want to wire you 750 K.\" And I said, \"I don't even know what I'm going to do with that money. I'm not paying myself, I won't for a while. We don't have any employees. I can't think of anything I want to spend it on. Tell you what, I'll just take 250 K.\" And he was like, \"What?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I'll just take 250 K.\" We start having the conversation around venture economics. I'm like, \"Yeah, it's fine, we'll figure it out.\" Then a few months back I took another 250 K and a few months back I took another 250 K as I began inventing ways and finding channels to deploy capital properly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:11):\nI love this story. I love all these stories you're sharing I've never heard before. And by the way, it is awesome. We're talking about him coming on the podcast, maybe breaking our VC rule. So specifically the story he shared with me that is maybe an example of you and your attention to detail is, he said that you created your own font because existing fonts weren't good enough. Is that true?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:33:31):\nKind of. Okay. The font that we use today is a modified version of Adelle Sans. The story there is, I looked at all of the major font families, and honestly none of them was what I would call truly excellent. That may sound like an odd thing to say. So let's, if you will permit me to talk about typography and email-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):\nPlease.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:33:56):\nThe first thing we did was, we took our UI and we laid it out in about 15 different styles using examples of the major font families. We actually printed these out and we left them on a desk in the middle of our office. Sometimes with design, you want to tune in to your immediate most visceral response, but sometimes you want to truly let a design marinate. And this was the latter. So we let these designs marinate, we let these font choices percolate. Like I said, none of them was truly excellent.\n\n(00:34:31):\nNumber one, I was looking for a font that was in and of itself gorgeous. Number two, I was looking for a font that could also convey a message of any kind, without overpowering the sentiment of that message. For example, does the font work when this is inviting you to a party? Many fonts, including almost all serif fonts, are actually too somber or too sober for that. Or to pick another extreme, does the font work if it is informing you of somebody's passing, many fonts are just too jaunty for that. You wouldn't want that kind of message in Comic Sans, for example. And number three, I was optimizing for a font that made reading speed and comprehension really fast. And number four, I was looking for a font that made email addresses themselves look great. So I discarded all the 15 because they weren't good enough, and after searching high and low, I came across a font called Adelle Sans, which is designed by a foundry called Type Together, type-together.com. They have a whole bunch of lovely fonts, go check them out.\n\n(00:35:36):\nAnd if you go through my list, number one, Adelle Sans is gorgeous. I think each character is a work of art. It's beautifully formed. Number two, Adelle Sans is, I would say upbeat, it's optimistic, yet it's serious enough to convey any kind of message. It has just the right amount of personality, yet not too much personality. Number three, Adelle Sans is also unusually narrow, and that actually fits email particularly well. One of my pet peeves with Gmail, which by default uses Ariel, is that the lines are as wide as your window. So if you're in a wide screen, then the lines get really arbitrarily long. The problem with really wide and really long lines, is that they decrease reading speed. Because by the time you've reached the end of one line, your eyes have lost track of the start of the next line. And Ariel itself has fairly wide characters, which further exacerbates that.\n\n(00:36:30):\nSo at Superhuman we, if you've used the product, you know this, we fix the line length or the typographical measure to the optimal length for reading speed, which depending on the font is around 90 to 120 characters. And Adelle Sans is quite narrow, so it actually lets us do this on quite small windows with fairly dense line. So we get a lot of information on fairly small windows without getting a very long typographical measure, optimizing for reading speed and for comprehension. Then number four, finally Adelle Sans has very unusual treatment of the at symbol in an email address. It actually puts the base of the A in the at on the same baseline as the rest of the text.\n\n(00:37:15):\nSo for example, if your name has an A, my name does Rahul at Vohra, three A's and or two A's and an at, they're all actually on the same baseline. It's a small thing, but it makes the email addresses look incredibly natural. If you look at that and then you actually look at email addresses laid out in other fonts, those other the fonts look really clunky and awkward because the A is kind of shifted around and it just looks a bit silly in my opinion. Now Adelle Sans isn't perfect. So we then worked with a type designer on some of the specific details that there are some of the glyphs, which get a little pinchy as it were, and what we use today is very close to retail Adelle Sans.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:55):\nAnd this was pre-launch or this was after you'd already launched?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:37:58):\nWe'd probably had about 10, 15 users at the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:03):\nSo I think that's pretty contrarian unique to be this focused on the font and the typeface before you even launched. This was like, \"Is this even going to be a thing? Will anyone even care?\" And I think this says a lot about the way you think about product.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:38:17):\nOh yeah, that thought never crossed my mind. I think we'll probably come to it later, but the idea that, is this never going to be a thing? I think that's a dangerous thought. We can't start thinking that way, because at what point do you stop second-guessing yourself?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:35):\nInteresting. So you were confident this was going to work, so because I am so confident it'll work, I need them to get this right. There's also this trap founders fall into of just spending too much time perfecting a thing that never works and there's always advice launch early, launch often. Thoughts there? How do you find that balance? What's your advice there?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:38:57):\nHow much to spend time ahead of launch really does depend on the markets and the structure, the nature of your business model. For example, let's say you are building a marketplace in a greenfield opportunity, so imagine the Lyft or Uber in their heyday. There's a strong network effect, because the more cars you have on your platform, the shorter waiting times are, therefore people are going to preferentially use your app versus the other person's app. That's when there's no time to spare, that's when you probably shouldn't even be sleeping. You're going to hire the most aggressive maniacal people possible. You're going to work 120-hour weeks, because every marginal minute actually does matter. Every marginal minute in the market, growing compounding is going to make your next year even better.\n\n(00:39:51):\nThat's actually not true of all startups and it certainly isn't true of something like Superhuman. Yes, working harder is always better and we work tremendously hard at Superhuman, but not to the point where it made sense to release something that didn't work. I'm reminded of a story of a founder that was in Y Combinator, told me about their demo day experience. They used Mailbox, which some folks may remember was also a startup, and Dropbox famously acquired them for about a hundred million dollars. The reason that they were well known, apart from the acquisition, is they were the first to popularize, swipe to archive or swipe to mark down, which of course is now standard in Superhuman and every other app.\n\n(00:40:43):\nThis founder was using Mailbox and was having an amazing demo day. They're working the room, they're meeting investors, they're pitching their photography app in this case. He went home that night and went to his laptop, fired up mailbox and sent off a bunch of follow-up emails. He waited the day, didn't hear back, he waited two days, didn't hear back. On the third morning he figured something was up, so he fired up Gmail, went to his sent mail, and you guessed it, there were no sent mails there. So something had broken with mailbox. So he's cursing to himself trying to remind himself everything's going to be okay. Sent all the same emails from Gmail manually and they all came through.\n\n(00:41:37):\nBut then one of the investors said, \"Hey, by the way, you might want to check your email clients, because I've been getting some of your emails twice.\" Now he goes back into his Gmail, he sees that yes, actually the original emails that were queued up in mailbox have now indeed been sent, and some of the investors, and unfortunately most of the investors he actually pitched twice. Now, is this the end of the world? No, an investor can overlook that. Probably a good thing that you're trying new apps. But was it horrifying and was it really scary? Absolutely.\n\n(00:42:08):\nImagine this wasn't investors, imagine this was a customer, someone who you were trying to convince to buy your thing and that you knew what you were doing and you had attention to detail and you had everything just buttoned up and under control. Well, now you've lost face, now you look foolish. That's why when you have mission-critical products like email where you are interfacing with customers, with candidates, with investors, it turns out to really matter. Email is mission-critical. It's not something where you can simply launch with a half-baked product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):\nThis is such an important nuance take on, there's always this debate, how much to focus on craft and user experience, how much to focus on time to launch and get it out and speed. What I'm hearing here, which I completely agree with is, it depends on the market you're in and the criticality essentially of your product. So if it's email, it just needs to work and you need to get that right, you need to spend all the time, you need to get that right.\n\n(00:43:03):\nThis reminds me of something else that when your early investors shared with me, Bill Trenchard from First-Round Capital. He talked about how speed was the thing that you just dialed up as a lever to 11. That's where you just, \"We will make this the focus. Speed, speed, speed.\" I think maybe the lesson there is, you pick the thing that you think will most differentiate you, make you significantly better than what's out there. So just thoughts on how you decided speed was the thing you were going to obsess with, and advice for folks that are trying to decide where to dial up things to 11?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:43:37):\nBill is right and I agree with him, you have to pick something. Knowing what to pick is the trick. In the early days of Superhuman, I read a book on positioning that really influenced my thinking. It is, I believe called Positioning the Battle for Your Mind. It struck me how the most well-known brands have stood for one clear thing, they have a clear position. So in order for Superhuman to be memorable, I believed that we needed to occupy a clear position that was unique and which was available and which reinforced our product strategy.\n\n(00:44:12):\nIn the first year of Superhuman, therefore, I interviewed hundreds of potential customers about their experience with Gmail and with Outlook. And predictably, almost everybody says that email takes way too much time. But interestingly, many people also said that Gmail and Outlook were way too slow. That was how I first thought that speed could be an interesting position for us. I then asked myself, \"Is the position of speed unique and is it available?\" And the answer was overwhelmingly yes, because almost no software was being sold or has ever been sold on the value proposition of speed. The last time I could remember anyone trying to do this, was when Google launched Chrome, and obviously that went incredibly well for them. You may remember they had slow-motion videos where they were comparing Chrome render webpages and showing that was faster than an actual strike of lightning. No one had done it since then.\n\n(00:45:15):\nI then asked, \"Well, does speed reinforce our product strategy?\" And again, the answer was overwhelmingly yes. I knew that our competition was not going to be startups, it was incumbents. And I also knew that incumbents generally struggle with speed, because by definition they have massive scale and usually entrenched architecture. Then finally I did what I call the cocktail party test, which is to look at the cocktail parties and to watch how people pitch your product to other people. In our case the pitches were simple. People would say, \"Dude, you have to use it, it's really fucking fast.\" And that's it. That was the pitch. That's how I knew that speed would be a really great position for us to start with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:01):\nI'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:46:08):\nYes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:10):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:46:24):\nYes, so we just launched OneSchema of FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes, as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:47):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema. Not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:46:59):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:19):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us and if you want to learn more, head on over to OneSchema.co. That's one OneSchema.co.\n\n(00:47:33):\nThe next area I want to spend time on and I imagine we'll have much insight is, some of the contrarian ways you approach building Superhuman that a lot of companies never thought about doing that you did that worked out for you. So the first is manually onboarding every single new user. Sure, startups have done this, founders bring on some folks and then cool, show it to them and then they stop doing that and then it's self-service or sales teams. How far did you scale this manual onboarding phase of your company? How many people did you have onboarding people, how many people did you manually onboard?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:48:12):\nSo for folks that don't know, in those early days we insisted on one-to-one concierge onboarding, and it was absolutely the right thing to do. You couldn't use Superhuman unless you went through the onboarding experience. Now it's almost the reverse. Almost every new Superhuman customer goes through self-service. The onboarding experience is still there, but again it is absolutely the right thing to do. To answer your question, at peak we had about 20 people doing manual onboarding.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:40):\nOkay, so it's not that many people. That's really interesting. Because I always imagined it was like a massive team, but 20 people can handle a lot, is the takeaway there. What was the scale where you stopped manual onboarding, just for folks that are thinking about doing this and then when to stop?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:48:55):\nI think the reason to stop is that there will always be certain personality types who do not want to go through a one-on-one onboarding. At a certain point those people will become very important, and you'll need to be ready with a world-class self-service option. When we started building self-service, it seemed nearly impossible. In fact, it was terrifying, because it's difficult to overstate how much the entire DNA of the company was built around this idea that we would onboard users manually. After all, we did so much in our one-to-one onboardings and there's only so much that software can do. Now, we did after a lot of grind and persistence eventually figure it out and we have a world-class self-service experience today, but we did not at the time.\n\n(00:49:49):\nSo the flip side is, why would you even do this to begin with? What we found is two things. Number one, the user metrics are excellent for things like engagement, retention, product market fit score, MPS, virality, for all of those metrics. I think you you'll significantly beat your industry benchmarks if you go to the effort of one-on-one onboarding your early customers. It becomes so powerful to have that early cohort of super fans when it comes to things like building a brand. If folks remember that conversation from way up at the top, what is it that creates true virality? It's not viral mechanics, it's word of mouth. It is brand. This is how you can kickstart a brand.\n\n(00:50:32):\nAnd number two, in a world where you can easily and quickly raise funding, like for example the zero interest rate phenomenon era, you can actually use dollars to avoid building a first-time user experience and all of the normal growth loops that you would then have to build. You would then instead focus all of your engineers on finding product market fit or in solution deepening or in market widening, but not for example on a first-time user experience, not for example on activation, because you have humans doing activation for you. By contrast I saw other companies often competing spend almost half their engineering dollars on those things, on self-service flows for products that ultimately did not find products market fit. So makes sense to do if you really want to create that brand, which I think all consumer-ish companies need to do. And if there is money falling off trees, for whatever reason, which we did have for a period of time, arguably AI companies have that again today. So if you can weave this into your strategy, I think you should, but you should also know when to stop.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:40):\nSuper interesting. I guess some factors to think about, because I wanted to ask you when should people consider doing this? If they're hearing this and they're like, \"This is awesome, so many problems solved if I just have somebody onboarding every new user, everyone's activated. Amazing.\" So some of the variables you're sharing is, do you have like cheap cash to invest in say, it doesn't have to be 20 people, it could be a few people to start. Then if there's an LTV, ACV element of just are you going to make enough from a new customer? Imagine that's a variable. Is there anything else you think founders should think about?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:52:14):\nAbsolutely. You don't want to lose money doing this. We always made money doing onboarding to be clear, it's just that at a certain point the mass market, whether it for us it's enterprise or all of the prosumers in the world, you hit a top of funnel width, it needs to be wide enough where manually onboarding no longer makes sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:37):\nAwesome. Okay, let's talk about product market fit. I know that everyone, when they think of Rahul, they think product market fit. You wrote this epic First Round post that described the way you guys approach product market fit. We're not going to spend a lot of time on describing it, because people can look it up. So let me just ask you this, what are a couple of things that you think people still don't understand about finding product market fit, getting to product market fit? Considering it's the most important thing you got to figure out as a founder. If you don't find something people want, nothing else matters. Anything there you want to share.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:53:12):\nThe core ideas are still weird enough that I'll start there. Which is number one, you can measure product market fit. Number two, you can optimize product market fit. Number three, you can systematically, even numerically increase product market fit. And number four, you can even have an algorithm write your roadmap for you, and that is a roadmap that is guaranteed to increase product market fit. Now, if that sounds crazy, I would be the first to admit it doesn't seem like that should be true, but go check out that post. I think it is still the most widely shared post on First Round Review, it's called How Superhuman Built an Engine to Find Product Market Fit, or just Google the Superhuman Product Market Fit Engine. And you'll see the algorithm laid out there fully explained and why it works.\n\n(00:54:07):\nI'd say the second thing is to get to product market fit, you have to deliberately not act on the feedback of many of your early users. This is at the same time as listening to people intensely and building what people want. That's what we're here to do, is to make something that people want. But it can't be all people. It can't be everybody. The question becomes, how do you listen to them? And then even of what they say, what do you pay attention to and what don't you? All of that's covered in the Product Market Fit Engine.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:45):\nOkay, I got to follow this thought on algorithmically building your roadmap to increase product market fit. Talk about how one would do that.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:54:55):\nWell, that's really the meat of the engine. Let's see if I can condense it here in a very easy to grok fashion. Let's assume for the sake of argument, that you can put a number on product market fit, and it turns out you can. Very simply, you're going to ask people, \"How would you feel if you can no longer use this product?\" You give them three responses. One of them is very disappointed, the other is somewhat disappointed, and the other is not disappointed. Very disappointed means, \"I'd be devastated. I love this product. I need this product.\"\n\n(00:55:30):\nWhat Sean Ellis found, Sean Ellis, if you don't know him, is the guy who coined the term growth hacker, and he instrumented, benchmarked this initial question. What he found, is that the companies that struggled to grow almost always had less than 40%, very disappointed. Whereas the companies that grew the fastest almost always had more than 40%, very disappointed. And this question, this metric is way more predictive of success than something, for example, like net promoter score.\n\n(00:56:03):\nOkay, so far so easy. How do we make this number go up? Well, you want more people to be very disappointed without your product. The trick here is not to act too much on the feedback that the very disappointed people are giving you, because they already love your product. Also, not to act at all really on the feedback that the not disappointed people are giving, you because they're so far from loving your product that they're essentially a lost cause. But to focus on the segment of the somewhat disappointed people, they kind of love your product, but something, and I would wager something small, is holding them back.\n\n(00:56:43):\nYou then divide them into two camps, the camp for whom the main benefit of your product resonates and the camp for whom it doesn't. What do I mean by that? Well, you go back to the people who really love your product and you basically ask them why? What is it about my products that you really love? In the early days of Superhuman, it would have been speed and keyboard shortcuts and the overall design aesthetic as well as the time that we were saving you. You then go back to the somewhat disappointed users, and in the Superhuman example, I would simply ask, \"Wait, do you like Superhuman because of its speed or for something else?\" And if it's something else, well, and this is hard to do, but politely disregard those people and their feedback. Because even if you built everything that they asked for, they're still pulling you in a different direction. And the thing that they like the most from your product isn't actually what the people who en mass love it the most for, is.\n\n(00:57:38):\nYou have then articulated the subsegment of the subsegment that it makes sense to pay attention to, and there's another question in the engine to figure out what they don't like about the product. Now you have a list of things people love, you have a list of things people don't love, and you can work down that list to make the product market fit score go up. And basically at the start of every planning cycle, I advise spending half your time doubling down on what people really love and half your time systematically overcoming the objections of the somewhat disappointed users, but specifically those for whom the main benefit resonates.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:14):\nThat was an excellent summary. I know I said we wouldn't spend a ton of time here, but I'm really glad we did. That was really helpful. Let me ask you this, I know you used this initially in the early days, are you still operating in this way in some form?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:58:24):\nWe don't run the engine as is for Superhuman as a whole. There are enough subcomponents of Superhuman now that are almost individual products. For example, Superhuman for Sales, our multiplayer and collaboration features, how we think about the enterprise, AI is its whole thing, but we do sometimes run it on those individual pieces. For example, we'll ask a salesperson, the Product Market Fit Engine, as it relates to Superhuman for sales. As we think about starting new products, we would absolutely deploy the product market fit engine.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:59):\nAwesome. The way you ask this question is an in-product interstitial sort of survey pop-up thing?\n\nRahul Vohra (00:59:04):\nYou can do it however you want. The way Sean initially benchmarked the number was via email surveys. I think email surveys work just fine. The key thing is, and this applies to any survey methodology, if you're going to change the method of surveying, all of your old numbers are invalidated. So it's just a new baseline going forwards.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:25):\nGot it. We had Sean on the podcast and he describes this method in detail. So if folks want to explore the Sean Ellis test, listen to that podcast. We'll link to it.\n\n(00:59:33):\nOkay, next topic that I'm excited to get your take on, is game design versus gamification. This is one of the more unique ways you think about designing product. When people hear you talk about this, they think it's like, \"Oh, gamification making things like games. Oh, it's Zynga, Farmville, I don't want to do that.\" But you actually have a really different perspective on why you need to think about game design as you design products. Talk about your insights there.\n\nRahul Vohra (00:59:58):\nWell, I strongly believe that we should make business software like we make games, because when we make products like we make games, people find them fun. They tell their friends, they fall in love with them. It's another way actually of backing into where we open this conversation, which is you're making a brand, you are giving reason for word of mouth. It's actually an altogether different kind of product development. So how do we do this? Well, as you've said, it's not gamification, that doesn't work. Game design works, but game design is not gamification. It's not, for example, simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies or badges.\n\n(01:00:40):\nTo understand why gamification does not work, we actually have to start with human motivation. There's a very interesting study from Stanford that demonstrates the difference perfectly. In the 1970s, these Stanford researchers recruited children who were aged three to four years old, and all of these kids were generally pre-interested in drawing. Some kids were told they would get a reward, a certificate with a gold seal and a ribbon. And some kids were not told about any reward and they did not even expect one or didn't know of one. Now each child was then invited into a separate room to draw for six minutes and afterwards they would either get the reward or not.\n\n(01:01:21):\nOver the next few days, the children were observed to see how much they would continue to draw by themselves. So the children with no reward, they spent 17% of their time drawing, but the children who expected a reward, sadly they only spent 8% of their time drawing. The very presence of a reward halved their motivation. So what's happening? What's happening here, is researchers differentiate intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. With intrinsic motivation we do things because they are inherently interesting and satisfying, and with extrinsic motivation, we do things to earn rewards and to achieve external goals. That's the problem with rewards, is they just massively undermine intrinsic motivation. That's why gamification doesn't work. And when gamification does work, it's because the underlying experience was already designed like a game.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:19):\nWhat makes something like a game? I know Superhuman is really good at this, of just your inbox zero quest that you're on. Just to make that a little more real, what is game design? What does that mean to you? What makes it feel like a game?\n\nRahul Vohra (01:02:32):\nWell, maybe folks don't know this, but before I was a founder, you can probably tell, I was actually professionally a game designer. And as it turns out, there is no unifying theory of game design. To create games, what we need to do is draw upon the arts and the science of psychology, mathematics, storytelling, interaction design. And at Superhuman we've identified five key areas that we really care about, goals, emotions, toys, controls and flow. And across these we've identified many principles of game design. One example principle would be, make fun toys and then combine those into games.\n\n(01:03:12):\nA question I like to ask is, are toys the same as games? They do seem different. For example, we play with toys, but we play games. A ball is a toy, but football is a game. As it turns out, the best games are constructed out of toys. Why? Because then they are fun on both levels, the toy and the game itself. So for example, in Superhuman, one of our favorite toys is the time auto-completer. If you use Superhuman, this is the thing that appears when you hit H, when you snooze or set reminders on emails. You can type whatever you want, it can be gibberish and it does its best to understand you. For example, if you type in 2D, that becomes two days, 3H is three hours, one MO is one month. The time auto-completer is fun because it indulges your playful exploration.\n\n(01:04:06):\nIn onboardings, it wasn't long before I saw people asking, \"What can it do? Where does it break? How does it work? What happens if I keep on typing in a series of tens? Well, it turns out that's October the 10th at 10:10 PM. Well, how about a series of twos? Well, that's February the second, 2022 at 2:00 PM.\" Then you start trying more complex inputs like in a fortnight and a day, and that works, which is a pleasant surprise. And it's not long before you find more pleasant surprises like time zone math happens without you thinking about it. You can just type in 8:00 AM in Tokyo and it turns out that's 8:00 PM Eastern Time and you no longer have to do the time zone math.\n\n(01:04:45):\nThen most people were really delighted to find out that if you really want, you can snooze emails until never, i.e. you can literally type in never, and the email will never come back. It had like a little shrug emoji at the same time. Is this toy going to win awards? Nope. But is it fun actually, surprisingly yes. So what I would encourage people to do is, think about the features of their product. Do those features indulge, playful, exploration? Are they fun even without a goal? And do they elicit moments of pleasant surprise? If so, you have a toy and you can combine that with other toys and actually start to build a game.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:28):\nIf people were to listen to this segment of the podcast, they would never guess we're talking about B2B software and email, which I love. Let's talk about pricing strategy and your approach to pricing. Another very contrarian approach that you guys took where you charge $30 a month for email that was free, that people don't need to pay for anywhere. And it's worked and now a lot of companies are thinking of it this way. You've even raised your prices recently. What have you learned about pricing strategy that you think might be helpful to folks?\n\nRahul Vohra (01:05:58):\nI always say the same thing when it comes to pricing, which is before you figure out pricing, you must first figure out positioning. Superhuman is the best email tool on the market. We fortunately have the metrics to show this. One of the cool things about selling an email tool, is you can compare the 30 days prior to using Superhuman to the 30 days after, or the year before to the year after. We do that obviously. We're able to show that people get through their email twice as fast with Superhuman, that they respond one to two days faster, and that they save four hours or more every single week. Because of that, we're very confident in saying that Superhuman is the best email tool on the market and that we're building it for high performing teams and high performing individuals. In other words, we serve the high end of the market.\n\n(01:06:48):\nOnce you understand your positioning, you can then move on to pricing. And one of the best books on this is a book called Monetizing Innovation by Madhavan Ramanujam. And Madhavan covers a lot of ways to develop pricing. We used one of the easiest methods, which is the Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity [inaudible 01:07:08]. In the early years, we asked, I think it was around a hundred of our earliest users, the following four questions. Number one, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it? Number two, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be priced so low that you'd be worried about its quality and you wouldn't buy it? At number three, what price would you consider Superhuman to be starting to get expensive, so that it's not out of the question, but you'd have to give some thought to buying it? And number four, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be a bargain? A great buy for the money?,\n\n(01:07:45):\nNow most startups orient around price point number four. This is especially true for greenfield opportunities, marketplaces, you've got to set the transaction value around price 0.4. Basically when you want as many people to sign up as is humanly possible, at the top of the funnel. But the price point that supports our best in class, best in category position, is actually the third one. It starts to feel expensive, but then you sit down and you think about the time that you spend in email, the ROI, and you still buy it anyway. It turns out that the median answer for the third question was $30 per month, and that's how we picked our price.\n\n(01:08:27):\nAnd once we picked our price, we then do a quick gut check on market size. For example, we're a venture scale company, but at the time the question that we had to ask is, \"Could we grow into a billion dollar valuation?\" Well, let's assume that at that point our valuation is 10 times our ARR, so our ARR would have to be a hundred million dollars. Well, that would be 300,000 subscribers at $30 per month. That is conservatively assuming no other ways to increase ARP. You mentioned price increase, you can also go up market, you can sell new products and so on. We asked ourselves, without those tricks, do we think we can get to hundreds of thousands of subscribers? And we answered emphatically, yes, so we went ahead with that price.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:13):\nOkay, there's a couple more things I want to chat about in the time that we have and then I know you have to run. One is around AI and the work you guys are doing there. I know that's been a big unlock. And then two, the stuff you're doing in the enterprise. Then if we have time, there's a question I want to ask that I think is a really interesting way you guys operate.\n\n(01:09:29):\nLet's talk about AI first. It feels like there's this being in the right place at the right time. It feels like you guys have been building this for a while, and then AI just unlocked another stage in what you're able to do with email. Just talk about what you've done and what how you think about AI integrating into what you're doing, how it's enabled you to kind of take off again?\n\nRahul Vohra (01:09:52):\nIt's true that sometimes startups boil down to being in the right place at the right time. We actually had a massive AI launch recently about two weeks ago, but even before then we had multiple flagship AI features. Our first AI feature was write with AI, jot down a few words and we'll turn them into a fully written email. We actually match the voice and tone in the emails you've already sent. So unlike Co-pilot, unlike Gemini, unlike basically every other email app, the email sounds like you. This AI feature is way more popular than I expected it to be. On average today, users are using it 37 times per week.\n\n(01:10:33):\nNumber two, our next AI feature was auto summarize, which shows a one line summary above every conversation. And as new emails arrive, it updates instantly. Again, unlike Co-pilot and Gemini, it's pre-computed. One of the things we do is, we go above and beyond to make these features really premium and feel amazing. The next AI feature after that was instant reply. Imagine waking up to an inbox where every email already has a draft reply. You would simply edit and then send, and sometimes you wouldn't even need to edit. I can share because we just finished this analysis, that over 2024, the percentage of emails that are AI written and sent with Superhuman has grown four times just in one year.\n\n(01:11:20):\nThen if I remember correctly, the feature after that was Ask AI. Email of course, is this treasure trove of critical information, things like project statuses, customer communication, meeting updates, deal execution, and so much more. And for over 40 years we've had to rely on what we hilariously call, search. You have to remember senders, guess keywords, scan subject lines, and now you can just ask, \"Where is the queue one offsite?\" or, \"What are my flight details?\" Or, \"What is the top five most positive customer responses to the Ask AI launch?\" A task by the way, which previously used to take me 20 or 30 minutes to read through all the emails and then create that report now happening in less than five seconds.\n\n(01:12:09):\nRecently we, like I said, announced our biggest evolution yet. Superhuman AI is constantly helping you. It's organizing your inbox. It's also making sure you never drop the ball. We have things that we call Auto Labels. You can now write a short prompt like job applications or requests to review work, and you can then immediately see when emails match that prompt, when people apply for a job or they ask you to review work. With Auto Reminders, if your email needs a response, Superhuman will now automatically set a reminder. You don't have to remember to do that and you'll never drop the ball again. All you need to do is hit send. With Auto Drafts, Superhuman will now automatically draft your follow-up emails for you and will soon be drafting replies to basically every email that needs a response.\n\n(01:12:59):\nAnd finally, with what we call Workflows, you can now turn email into repeatable automated workflows. For example, I often get emails from people who are interested in working at Superhuman, and I would normally reply to that candidate and I would let them know that the team will take a look. I'll then forward to the original message, including any resume or any letter to our head of people and operations and ask her to reach out, if interested. With Workflows, I can now automate this entire process. It's, you can imagine, creating a little flowchart of what has to happen. Not only does that save a huge amount of time, with Workflows you don't even have to be in your inbox. In fact, you don't even have to be working. You could be on vacation while Superhuman AI is working for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:53):\nThis sounds like product market fit to me. This all sounds wonderful. It just makes sense. This is the stuff we've been promised, our underwater cities and flying cars and then just email that just works magically and replies for us and all these things. I love all these things you're doing.\n\n(01:14:08):\nFor folks that are building with AI. I'm curious, what's maybe been the biggest surprise, either good or bad, building so deeply on top of AI models that you think might be helpful for folks to just, \"Watch out for this,\" or, \"Hey, check this out.\"?\n\nRahul Vohra (01:14:25):\nI think for me the biggest surprise has been how unpredictable the user love has been in terms of what they love and what they don't love. For example, write with AI. This sounds like a commodity feature and on all surface level it is. Every email app, every writing surface has a write with AI feature in. I would wager ours is the best at emails and surprisingly that's what we do. But the surprising thing was just how much people love it and how often it gets used. 37 times per user per week is still mind-blowing to me. I had not expected that, so that's the most surprising thing.\n\n(01:15:11):\nAnd on the flip side, there were certain AI features where I did expect a ton of usage, but we didn't quite get the usage that we were perhaps hoping for. Hopefully I'm not AI Kramer, but basically everything I thought would work out well, people use it less than they thought they did. And everything where I was like, \"I don't know, but let's build the thing,\" people love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:33):\nInteresting.\n\nRahul Vohra (01:15:34):\nMaybe I should just create an anti-me to do AI road-mapping.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):\nThat's in a simple agent right there, whatever Rahul says, do the opposite.\n\nRahul Vohra (01:15:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:42):\nOkay. Another maybe a last topic. I know that you guys are starting to move into the enterprise. When people think of Superhuman, they think of it's consumer-y, it's for people, and you guys are doing a lot of work to make it a B2B enterprise product. For founders maybe that are starting to think about this transitioning from PLG to sales led and B2B enterprising, what have you learned about just what it takes to get to that point and what does that sales motion look like for you guys?\n\nRahul Vohra (01:16:10):\nIn some ways, it's very like selling to prosumers, except these users are not coming from Gmail where prosumers would normally come from, they're coming from Outlook. And Outlook users have very different expectations to Gmail users. For example, Outlook users expect their email app to also be a fully featured calendar app, whereas Gmail users are happy with those two things being entirely different. As a result, we've invested in calendar very heavily and we continue to do so. There's only so much I can say, but it's pretty exciting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:49):\n[inaudible 01:16:49].\n\nRahul Vohra (01:16:48):\nOutlook users are also used to certain safeguards, like if you've used Outlook in an enterprise, warnings when a recipient is external to your domain or what Outlook users might know as sensitivity labels. And as a result we've built support for external recipient indicators and sensitivity labels. But in some ways it's very different to selling to prosumers because there are other stakeholders involved. For example, we've built support for enterprise mobile management by implementing Microsoft Intune.\n\n(01:17:22):\nWe recently sold one of the big three strategy consulting firms, which is super exciting. I can't say which one, but they love Superhuman and they have thousands of people internally using Superhuman. This is after a year... They've been piloting for a year and then accelerating over the last few months. We only just got them the mobile app, believe it or not. Because, at an enterprise like that, there are significant controls on what a allowed compliant mobile app can and cannot do. For example, IT needs to be able to control which apps can save attachments or which apps you can copy and paste text into from email. And for many enterprises, those controls are super important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:14):\nWow, okay. So it sounds like essentially just building all these features that large companies need, is kind of the road you're on right now.\n\nRahul Vohra (01:18:21):\nExactly. And there's two stakeholders. There's the users, which are actually quite different because they're Outlook users and Calendar is one of the main ways that manifests. There's a whole bunch of other stakeholders, IT is one of them, but there are others as well. For example, companies this large have workplace management groups who want to see analytics of how people are working, how they can make their teams more efficient, so it truly is a multi-threaded sale with multiple stakeholders.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:49):\nThey had a product from Linear on the podcast [inaudible 01:18:51], and he actually, I don't know if you heard that episode, but he talks about how they decide what to prioritize, the thing they never build is middle managers needing to track how their reports are doing and things like that. That's an interesting opportunity for you guys maybe to cut stuff. I don't know.\n\n(01:19:07):\nAnyway, I want to end on one more nugget. Okay, I'm glad we have time for this. You shared that you have this system internally at Superhuman for making decisions. You call it Single Decisive Reason, SDR. What is that?\n\nRahul Vohra (01:19:22):\nSDR is a thinking tool that I picked up from Reid Hoffman during my time at LinkedIn. The idea here is that for important decisions, you should be able to identify one, one reason that on its own supports the decision. It's based on the observation that all too often we rely on a collection of weak reasons to justify decisions. It's very, very easy to do this. Imagine you are contemplating a decision, you write a list of the pros and the cons. There are three pros, but let's say there are 10 or 15 cons. The sheer number of cons, the effort of thinking them through, the time it took to write them down, is going to affect you, consciously or worse subconsciously. This is especially true, I've seen in group settings, which just in general are a little bit more risk averse and a little bit more consensus driven.\n\n(01:20:17):\nSo whenever anyone is making a decision and they bring that decision to me and they say, \"Well, we want to do this because of X, Y, Z, and there are multiple reasons.\" I ask them, \"What's the SDR? What's the single decisive reason?\" If they can't yet isolate it, that tells me they haven't yet figured out why they want to make the decision. It doesn't mean the decision is wrong, it just means that they haven't figured out the singular reason why we should do the thing. They can then go through their list of reasons and ask, \"Is this alone enough to support this decision?\" Meaning if this was true and all the other things were not true, would I still do it? And sometimes we still do, but actually sometimes we don't. We realize that a collection of weak reasons alone means that, for example, the outcome is less likely than we thought it was, or it was hiding a really strong reason on the other side of the decision.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:11):\nThat is very cool. This is just when someone comes to you with a decision, the way you use this idea is, you ask them what's the single decisive reason?\n\nRahul Vohra (01:21:20):\nPretty much. Yeah. And what they can't do, obviously this happens, people are human and natural, they'll usually start mentioning three or four things, and that's fine. And then I will say, \"Okay, but if only one of those was true and you're still advocating for this decision, what is it?\" I think that's just a bar for a good decision.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:40):\nWhy is that so important? Because you found that a bunch of low quality reasons just don't add up to a good reason to do something?\n\nRahul Vohra (01:21:50):\nMultiple reasons, which is ironic. But that's my SDR for why SDRs work. Which is yes, multiple low quality reasons rarely add up to a high quality reason to do something. But there are also other things as well, which is, any decision you take has an opportunity cost. Any feature you build is another feature that you didn't build. If we're going to build this for a collection of weak reasons, whereas we could build that for one strong reason, I'd much rather build that for one strong reason. Now this is all other things being equal, and these things often end up being quite complicated, but you can apply SDR all the way down. You just did that to me, what's my SDR for SDR?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:30):\nThere we go. Rahul, is there anything that we haven't covered that you wanted to cover? Is there any last piece of wisdom you want to leave listeners with before we let you go?\n\nRahul Vohra (01:22:43):\nI feel good. I think we covered a lot. Thank you for asking amazing questions. This was really fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:51):\nThis was incredible. Okay, so let me just ask you this then. Where can folks find you online? Where can they check out Superhuman? What should they know before they try it out? And then just how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nRahul Vohra (01:23:02):\nIf you want to find me online, I am generally on X. That is x.com/rahulvohra, R-A-H-U-L V-O-H-R-A. My DMs are open, so feel free to ping me. If you're going to do that, I would suggest also emailing me, that's rahul@superhuman.com, and hopefully I'll see your message soon.\n\n(01:23:22):\nIf you haven't tried Superhuman, then gosh, what are you doing? This is my call to you to do so, because your time is worth more than whatever you think it might be. So go download Superhuman and give it a shot. Invite your team. The metrics are real. I know they sound like the kind of metrics that startups make up, but getting through your email twice as fast, responding one to two days sooner, saving four hours or more every single week, they're all real.\n\n(01:23:51):\nActually, speaking of which, the consulting firm I mentioned earlier, because they're so into data and into analysis, they wanted to corroborate those numbers for themselves, and so they did. They ran their own internal case study on Superhuman, and they were like, \"Yeah, you're saving our partners 3.3 hours per person per week. And there's only one other tool that we've bought that does that, which is ChatGPT. So thank you. We love Superhuman. We're rolling it out.\" If that sounds interesting to you or your company, please do give it a shot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:25):\nThat is super cool. Reflecting back on what I imagine this conversation would look like, a lot of contrarian thinking and attention to detail, I think that's exactly what it was. Rahul, you're awesome. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nRahul Vohra (01:24:39):\nThank you. Bye everyone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:40):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:24:43):\nThank you so much for listening.

One example that I came across with one of the companies I worked with that I love is our new supply side was having a pretty bad experience.\n\n(00:00:12):\nSo what we decided to do is build some custom bespoke features that were really going to direct them to more experienced folks on the other side of the market. Good. And then, yeah, lo and behold, pretty soon those metrics start to look better. But then we're looking at it, we're like, \"Wait a second. Now the existing folks on the other side are having a worse experience,\" so you kind of whiplash around. You're like, \"Oh, wait a second. We better do something about that.\" So we take them, we try to match them up with the more experienced folks, and now suddenly a month after that, you're like, \"Wait a second,\" and your metrics just keep moving around. And that's because the whac-a-mole game here is ultimately, a lot of marketplace management is moving attention and inventory around. Many of the changes that are most consequential create winners and losers. And rolling with those changes is about recognizing whether the winners you've created are more important to your business than the losers you've created in the process.\n\nLenny (00:01:00):\nToday my guest is Ramesh Johari. Ramesh is a professor at Stanford University, where he does research on and teaches data science methods and practices with a specific focus on the design and operation of online marketplaces. He's advised and worked with some of the biggest marketplaces in the world, including Airbnb, Uber, Stripe, Bumble, Stitch Fix, Upwork, and many others. And in our conversation, we get super nerdy on how to build a thriving marketplace, including where to focus your resources to fuel the marketplace flywheel growth, why data and data science is so central to building a successful marketplace, how to design a better review system. Why as a founder, you shouldn't think of yourself as a marketplace founder, but instead simply as a founder. Also, how AI is going to impact data science and marketplaces, and experimentation, and so much more. If you're building a marketplace business, or thinking about building a marketplace, or just curious, this episode is for you. With that, I bring you Ramesh Johari after a short word from our sponsors. \n\n(00:02:04):\nThis episode is brought to you by Sanity. Your website is the heart of your growth engine. For that engine to drive big results, you need to be able to move super fast, ship new content, experiment, learn and iterate. But most content management systems just aren't built for this. Your content teams wrestle with rigid interfaces as they build new pages. You spend endless time copying and pasting across pages and recreating content for other channels and applications. And their ideas for new experiments are squashed when developers can't build them within the constraints of outdated tech. \n\n(00:02:35):\nForward-thinking companies like Figma, Amplitude, Loom, Riot Games, Linear, and more use Sanity to build content growth engines that scale drive innovation and accelerate customer acquisition. With Sanity, your team can dream bigger and move faster. As the most powerful headless CMS on the market, you can tailor editorial workflows to match your business, reuse content seamlessly across any page or channel, and bring your ideas to market without developer friction. Sanity makes life better for your whole team. It's fast for developers to build with, intuitive for content managers, and it integrates seamlessly with the rest of your tech stack. Get started with Sanity's generous free plan. And as a Lenny's Podcast listener, you can get a boosted plan with double the monthly usage. Head over to sanity.io/lenny to get started for free. That's sanity.io/lenny.\n\n(00:03:26):\nThis episode is brought to you by Hex. If you're a data person, you probably have to jump between different tools to run queries, build visualizations, write Python, and send around a lot of screenshots and CSV files. Hex brings everything together. Its powerful Notebook UI lets you analyze data in SQL, Python, or no code in any combination, and work together with live multiplayer and version control. And now Hex's, AI tools can generate queries and code, create visualizations, and even kickstart a whole analysis for you all from natural language prompts. It's like having an analytics co-pilot built right into where you're already doing your work. Then when you're ready to share, you can use Hex's drag and drop app builder to configure beautiful reports or dashboards that anyone can use. Join the hundreds of data teams like Notion, AllTrails, Loom, Mixpanel, and Algolia using Hex every day to make their work more impactful.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nRamesh Johari (00:04:35):\nThanks so much for having me, Lenny. It's great to be on. \n\nLenny (00:04:38):\nIt's great to have you on. A big thank you to Riley Newman for connecting us. Riley was the first data scientist at Airbnb and head of data science at Airbnb, and that role is actually a really good microcosm of what we're going to be focusing on in our chat today. We're going to get super nerdy about marketplaces, and experimentation, and data. I know that's your jam. Are you ready to dive in?\n\nRamesh Johari (00:05:00):\nI really am. Yeah. And I actually want to thank Riley too. I got to know Riley when I was at oDesk first as a research scientist, and then I directed their data science team. This is way back in 2012, and I was looking around for people who are experts on how we think about data and marketplaces, and Riley Newman came up and so I invited him to come talk to us at oDesk, and we've stayed in touch since then. \n\n(00:05:26):\nThose were early days of where this industry was, and I've had a kind of lengthy career now thinking about those kinds of problems. So I'm pretty excited to talk about it with you.\n\nLenny (00:05:37):\nLet's start broad and set a little foundation. You have a really interesting way to describe what a marketplace business even is. So Ramesh, what is a marketplace business, and also why is data so important and such an integral part of building a successful marketplace business?\n\nRamesh Johari (00:05:53):\nIt's interesting when people sit down and think about, say Airbnb, what does Airbnb sell? Average person is like, \"That's pretty obvious. Airbnb sells rooms. I go there to book a room I want to stay at,\" right? Other people say, \"What does Uber sell? Uber sells me rides. I'd use Uber when I need to get a ride from somewhere to somewhere else.\"\n\n(00:06:10):\nAnd in some sense, you're not wrong. I mean, you go there. That's a platform to get these things. But that's not what the platform is selling. That's a really important distinction. There are people on the platform that are selling that to you. The hosts on Airbnb are selling you listings. The drivers on Uber are selling you rides. But Uber and Airbnb are selling you the taking away of something, which is a weird thing to think about. What they're taking away is the friction of finding a place to stay. They're taking away the friction of finding a driver.\n\n(00:06:42):\nIn economics, we call those things transaction costs. When you take econ 1, you learn about markets and how supply meets demand, and we get prices out of that. But what you don't learn until econ 201 is that markets don't always work. And one of the reasons markets don't always work is because we have what are called market failures due to the presence of these kinds of friction. So what's a market failure? It's that Lenny wants to get from Palo Alto to Burlingame and he can't do it. Why can't he do it? He doesn't have anyone to drive him. Well, why doesn't he just call someone to drive him? Well, who's he supposed to call? Who are those people? Are they out there? Are they willing to drive him right now, right at 10:00 AM on a Friday? Are they willing to take him somewhere?\n\n(00:07:22):\nWhen I want to stay somewhere when I'm traveling, a friction is, who's willing to give me their room? I mean on principle, there's people who are willing to let me stay in their living room, but I don't know who they are. \n\n(00:07:31):\nSo those are frictions, and what the marketplaces are selling you is taking the friction away. That's what you're paying them for. And it's an important observation, because what that means is the marketplace's customers aren't just the people buying the rides, they're buying the listings. Actually, the hosts are Airbnb's customers, and the drivers are also Uber's customers. So both sides of the marketplace are the customers of the platform. Both sides depend on the platform to help the platform take that friction away. Because just like you want a place to stay or you want to ride, the driver is at Uber because he wants to earn money by taking people places. And the host is on Airbnb because they want to earn money by selling their listing.\n\n(00:08:10):\nI think this concept that we're making money by taking transaction costs away is such a fundamental idea that's misunderstood around marketplaces. That when you're an entrepreneur starting a marketplace or thinking about your business model, I think you can be wildly off if you forget that that's the thing that's fundamentally your value proposition. And then you asked about the role of data, and more broadly data science in marketplaces.\n\n(00:08:36):\nSo it's an interesting thing, right? The example I always love to give are the ancient Agoras in Greece or Trajan's Market in Rome. When you look at pictures of these things, what really stands out to me is the rock. I mean, these things are made of stone. It's not like you were going to move a booth from one place to another place without moving a lot of rock from one place to another place. \n\n(00:09:00):\nSo you flash forward to 2023, and here we are with technology undergirding pretty much every kind of commerce now. And it means we can architect and re-architect the marketplace kind of on the fly, and we really are doing it all the time.\n\n(00:09:14):\nAnd these frictions that are getting taken away, they're getting taken away because of data and data science. So I really want to highlight three pieces of this for people, which I want you to think of them as a cycle. But to start with, let's just lay them out one at a time. \n\n(00:09:29):\nOne of them is finding people to match with. So that's the problem of, \"I want to stay somewhere. Who is out there, who's willing to let me stay with them on a given timeframe?\" And then if I'm a host, I have a listing. Who is out there, who's willing to stay at my place when I have it available? So that's finding matches.\n\n(00:09:49):\nThen there's making the match. And so here, going back to my time at oDesk, a big problem that we dealt with there was if I've got multiple applicants to my job, who should I hire? Who should I interview? It's a common problem we face in the real world, but now it's all remote. I don't meet these people in person. All I've got is this application they submitted to me. I need help triaging that. Okay? So that's helping make a match out of possible partners you can match with.\n\n(00:10:16):\nAnd then finally, we make matches. Well, what do the matches tell us, right? I mean, if you stay somewhere in Airbnb, you learn something about the host, you learn something about the listing. The host learns about you too. And that's all information that the marketplace should feed back in. So this is where we get to rating systems and feedback systems, even passive data collection, right? Did you leave your booking before you were supposed to leave? Well, maybe that's a sign that something didn't quite work out the way you wanted to work out. So that's passive data collection. Did you leave five stars? That's active data collection.\n\n(00:10:47):\nGet all this back in, and what does that do? Well, that lets us do a better job finding potential matches and make potential matches in the future. Every single thing I just said, finding potential matches, making matches, and then learning about those matches, and then cycling back again, that is the data science in marketplaces. \n\n(00:11:05):\nAnd I feel like every marketplace that you could think of in any vertical has those three problems to deal with and relies on algorithms in data science to help them solve it. And in turn, that is I think really the underpinning of taking those frictions away.\n\nLenny (00:11:22):\nMany founders try to start a marketplace business, think about marketplace opportunities where they don't exist. And there's often these recurring failures of types of marketplaces that just don't work in an area. I was just writing a couple ideas down while you were chatting like cleaners, getting cleaners as a marketplace doesn't seem to work ever. Car wash, there's a classic failure too. Getting tasks done for you on demand as a marketplace seems to not often work.\n\n(00:11:46):\nSo this might be too big of a question, but I'm just curious if anything comes up of when someone is starting a marketplace or thinking about starting a marketplace business, what do you find are the most common flaws in, this is probably not going to work as a marketplace? \n\nRamesh Johari (00:12:01):\nThat is such a fantastic question, and I want to preface what I say with a couple of comments. So one of them is that I've worked with a lot of different marketplace companies, but anything I say is pertaining to something more sensitive. I may not name the company over the course of the podcast.\n\n(00:12:17):\nBut the other more important thing I want to say is that I'm a professor at Stanford, and there's a reason I'm not a successful scaled entrepreneur of marketplaces, and that's because I probably haven't unlocked the key to exactly the question you asked. But nevertheless, I have some thoughts on it.\n\n(00:12:33):\nThe most important one is this. What I've found talking to people who want to start what they think is a marketplace is that they think too much about a marketplace before they're a marketplace. That in my view is the biggest failure mode.\n\n(00:12:46):\nYou mentioned specific things, cleaners. I wonder about that, right? Is it something about the cleaning industry? It possibly is. I don't claim to be an expert on the microeconomics of the cleaning industry. But often it's not that, it's that I thought I was building a marketplace from the beginning, and that's not the way the world works. So I'll give you one vignette of this that I really like, and that's UrbanSitter. \n\n(00:13:09):\nSo first, UrbanSitter is a babysitting marketplace. We can talk about their whole life story, but I think what's most interesting is really the early days. And in the early days, what I found interesting, the way I found out about them actually is that we were stuck looking for some help. And I found out about this new platform where the clever thing was when you used to hire a babysitter, it's like pre Venmo days, you needed cash on hand. Because when the babysitter's done at the end of the day, they're usually high school suits or something. They want to get paid. They're not going to take your IOU, that you'll send them some check in the mail the next day.\n\n(00:13:43):\nAnd unfortunately, you often don't have cash. They don't take credit card. They're high school students. That was an incredible friction to address, which is literally just we accept credit card payments for babysitting. That's it, right?\n\n(00:13:55):\nNow from there, what happened is they took advantage of Facebook networks between parents and babysitters to build trusted introductions. So let's say my sitter wasn't available. I get to know sitters in the Facebook network of that sitter. And once they overcame that first thing to get some liquidity onto their platform, they could move towards asking, how do I solve for these frictions that I talked about earlier? How do I solve for helping people find potential matches? How do I solve for people making those matches, right? You can't do that when you don't have liquidity on your platform. It's silly to tell someone, \"Hey, I'm really going to help you find all those drivers out there, even though I only have three drivers on my platform.\" That's not a friction you're solving for. \n\n(00:14:36):\nSo in their example, as they evolved, they actually shifted their monetization model away from billing specifically for this friction of allowing you to pay with credit cards, instead to now billing for how you were interviewing and contacting sitters. They had a two-part plan for that. One with a pay as you go menu, one with a more of a subscription option. But the key thing was either way, what you were paying for now was finding potential babysitters, not paying them with a credit card. That wasn't the key thing anymore.\n\n(00:15:05):\nSo what's the moral there? The moral is a marketplace business never starts as a marketplace business, because what we think of as a marketplace business is something which at scale is removing the friction of the two sides finding each other. But when you start, you don't have that scale. \n\n(00:15:22):\nSo when you start, you had better be thinking, \"What's my value proposition in a world in which I don't have that scaled liquidity on both sides?\" And that's bespoke. It means different things. And in the case of oDesk, where I started, that initial thing was that remote work is a weird thing, because basically you've somehow got to know that this person who you're not next to is doing what you're asking them to do. And so the initial value proposition of oDesk was to provide tools for workers to verify they were working the hours and doing the things that they said they were doing, screenshots and various kinds of tracking.\n\n(00:16:01):\nAnd then in return for that, to be able to provide guarantees on both sides. So now the workers could say, \"Hey, I worked what I said so I should get paid.\" And the employers could say, \"I actually see that you worked what you said. And so I feel comfortable that I got what I paid for.\" That was the initial value proposition, is resolving a trust issue at a remote scale.\n\n(00:16:21):\nAt that point, liquidity isn't the game. It's asking, what's a problem that people in this space are facing that I can deal with when I'm not a scaled marketplace? So again, with the cleaning industry, I can comment on that from personal experience, but otherwise, I think that's the way I would think about it. It's almost never about building a marketplace when you're building a marketplace.\n\nLenny (00:16:43):\nThat's very similar to the advice I always give marketplace founders, is 90% of your problems are going to be non marketplace specific problems. They're going to be the same problems any startup is going to have. How do I grow? It's going to be the same things you need to do.\n\nRamesh Johari (00:16:58):\nSo one thing you said was, \"That's what you tell marketplace founders.\" I mean, something I've actually pressed hard on in my own way of thinking about this is that maybe we shouldn't talk about the concept of a marketplace founder. Really there's founders. And I think every entrepreneur... I mean one way to think about it, right? It's very hard to think about a human business endeavor that has not been disrupted by the potential for transactions to take place online.\n\n(00:17:24):\nAnd if that's the case, it means literally any founder is a marketplace founder. It'll be a choice they make after they grow as to whether they want to build a platform. I mean, to take a very hot recent example, no one in their right mind would've thought of OpenAI as a marketplace, but OpenAI is a marketplace now. They may not want to call themselves a marketplace, but they have plugins. The plugins are flooding that platform. People have played with it. It's not an easy thing to find the plugin you need for what you want to do. And that really is a two-sided thing now. There's the plugin creators and there's the users. And they may believe it, they may not believe it, but they are a marketplace. \n\n(00:18:04):\nSo I think a different way to think about it is every founder is a marketplace founder. It's going to be a choice they want to make for themselves of whether they want to become that platform. That's I think one. And two is because that's the case, I think one of the other challenges I find founders struggle with is you don't want to overcommit your future. And what I mean by that is that you're building up trust, and you're building up a sense of what kind of business you are in your early days. If you believe that this kind of platform future awaits you, or market platform future awaits you, there may be choices you're making early on that are tying your hands later. \n\n(00:18:41):\nA great example of this is when oDesk started, it was because the tools they were providing were for ongoing monitoring of work. It's a very natural thing to say, \"We will just take a constant fraction of the dollars that cross the platform.\" That all works well and good until after you become mature. Some of these relationships between worker and employer last a long time, and most of the value was generated now not so much because they're able to track each other, because the trust is now there, but because they found each other, because they're able to build that relationship through oDesk.\n\n(00:19:16):\nThat meant that the longer that goes on, the less value the platform is adding into that relationship, but you're still pulling 10% of all the dollars. So what does that lead to? A word that most marketplace CEOs know well is disintermediation, which is where you were intermediating between the two parties, and now disintermediation means that essentially they're like, \"Hey, we don't need you anymore.\"\n\n(00:19:39):\nMy favorite example is we had some stuff delivered from IKEA by a Thumbtack worker once, and my wife is like, \"Oh, thanks a lot. You're so reliable.\" He's like, \"Hey, great. Here's my business card. Ever need me again? Just call the number on the back.\" And that was it. Thumbtack got their one lead gen, and then we didn't need the platform anymore. \n\n(00:19:57):\nAnd I think this issue for oDesk meant that after they merged with Elance and became Upwork, they had to think a little bit about, \"Okay, what's the monetization strategy we want to use? How do we address this issue that longer term relationships may disintermediate? And does that mean you need a pricing plan that actually takes that into account?\" So early commitments in this case to a particular pricing scheme, particular monetization, can really tie your hands as you then realize later you actually are a platform.\n\nLenny (00:20:26):\nI really like this message. It makes me think about Substack actually, which started as just a platform for newsletter writers. And then they're like, \"How do we make this more valuable?\" Because they take a cut of everyone's revenue. And they've actually invested heavily on helping drive demand to writers, for example, me. And at this point, over 80% of my subscribers come from Substack's network. And so they've built this marketplace element exactly as you're describing, where they just found, \"Here's a pain point, writers need more subscribers. How do we help them drive subscribers?\" So they figured out all these ways to create demand.\n\nRamesh Johari (00:20:58):\nThat's a really positive story, where they managed to actually expand the frontier of their business by enabling that network. For every one of those, there's unfortunately a lot of negative stories. I mean, one that I think is very painful is how eBay had a lot of challenges with its seller community as it introduced more and more fine-grained sources of fees.\n\n(00:21:25):\nAnd I think a lot of that, I mean there's many, many treatises at this point written on eBay, and their history, and how they got to the point that they're at. But I think one kind of simple thing I do want people to think about there is that the sellers on eBay who had matured with the platform, who had grown with it, had come to develop certain expectations about what their lives on that platform would look like. And it's understandable, because a lot of these businesses, they had built their livelihood on that platform. That was their entire business. \n\n(00:21:56):\nSo when you now reach in and you say, \"I'm going to completely change the rules of the game in which your business model operates,\" from the perspective of those sellers, that's a breaking of a social contract that's been developed over a very long time. So I love the Substack example, because that's like, \"Hey, let me amplify our social contract.\" But I think for every one of those, there's an eBay warning sign that you can trap yourself a little bit.\n\nLenny (00:22:24):\nJust to close a loop on this really, I think important point, a lot of people listening to this are probably, \"I'm a marketplace founder. I'm building a marketplace,\" are going to hear this and be like, \"Oh shit, maybe I need to rethink how I think about what I'm doing.\" What would be your piece of advice to people like that? Is it focus on the friction point and it may be a marketplace solution, it may be a managed marketplace, it may be you own the supply? Is that the advice, or what would your advice be to someone that's like, \"I'm building a marketplace\"? How should they reframe their thinking?\n\nRamesh Johari (00:22:54):\nLet's go back to kind of thinking about this concept of a marketplace of reducing friction. So the litmus test I like to give to someone who claims to me that they're building a marketplace business or they're a marketplace founder is do you have what I would call scaled liquidity on both sides of your platform? What does scaled liquidity mean?\n\n(00:23:13):\nWhat it means in lay terms... And by the way, I am a data scientist, and I love to think about these quantitatively. But fundamentally, if it doesn't pass the smell test, then you don't have to keep going with the data science. The smell test is scaled liquidity asks, \"Do I have a lot of buyers and a lot of sellers on my platform, or do I only have one of these two, or do I have neither?\" If you don't have both, you could call yourself whatever you want to call yourself, but at this moment in time, you're not a marketplace. If you have one, congratulations. You've won the game on one side of the market. And now you if you want, you have a choice point. You can lean into growth on the side that you're doing well with. You got a ton of users, ton of buyers? Great. Lean into it, get more buyers. That's one option. There's no shame in not being a marketplace. Scaling a business is scaling a business. If that's the way to do it, do it. \n\n(00:24:05):\nIf you decide you want to be a marketplace, then at that moment when you've got a lot of buyers, but not a lot of sellers, or a lot of sellers, but not a lot of buyers, the choice you're facing is, how do I take advantage of having that one side scaled to attract the other side? We can talk more about that, but there's a lot of ways to kind of hack that, to think about how... So to take Uber as an example, they would walk into a new city, and one thing that Uber was commonly known for doing this was back in the days when really Uber Black was the only service is they just hand out coupons for free rides at events, parties, things like that, to take people home. And that was a way of saying, \"Hey, we're subsidizing the drivers in the city. That's our scaled side. Now we're going to use that subsidized driver base to attract riders.\" \n\n(00:24:49):\nSo that's like, how do you get that flywheel going? And again, many people have written about how to take liquidity, scaled liquidity on one side, and use it to attract the other side.\n\n(00:24:59):\nIf you don't have either side, don't worry about it. Don't worry about being a marketplace. Worry about scaling one side. And in that world, it opens your visibility up completely into the advice of many, many startup advisors. People who have advice not so much about scaling a marketplace, but about scaling a startup. \n\n(00:25:22):\nAnd I want to say you got to let the ego go at that point. It's fine to articulate to people that your vision of the future is to be a platform or marketplace. As I said, virtually every business is going to have that option at some point in the modern tech enabled economy anyway. So you're not saying something people don't already know when you tell an advisor or an investor that. But I do think you need to be humble enough at the starting point to recognize that there's no sense in talking about a marketplace if you don't have scaling on either side yet.\n\nLenny (00:25:52):\nAnd then it becomes a question of a business model, unit economics of, can I build say a DoorDash, not as a marketplace? Can I just hire a bunch of people delivering? Is this even possible in a different route?\n\nRamesh Johari (00:26:06):\nYeah, that's a great point. One of the things I think that's useful for people to think about here that you're raising, at some level, it's kind of tied up I think with that question of whether I should have employees, or contract or freelance work on one side of the marketplace.\n\n(00:26:23):\nAnd that's actually a pretty old question in economics. The way we talk about it often is a distinction between a market or a firm. And one of the interesting puzzles in economics, Ronald Coase is a famous economist who thought about this is, \"Well, if markets are so efficient, why do we need firms? If markets are efficient at matching labor up with things that need to get done, why would you ever need a firm?\" And that's one of the earliest recognitions that transaction costs are a real thing. And that's one of the things that firms are solving for.\n\n(00:26:52):\nAnd I love what you're saying because what it's recognizing is, \"Hey, for your frictions, the best resolution to that might not be to have a marketplace. It might actually be to have very tightly controlled labor.\" A good example of this actually, Stitch Fix, I think one of the things that's cool about Stitch Fix is the experience that people had early on with stylists at Stitch Fix.\n\nLenny (00:27:13):\nI'm a happy customer, by the way. I think [inaudible 00:27:16].\n\nRamesh Johari (00:27:15):\nYeah, I think one of the great things about that experience is it felt magical to have someone who kind of got to know you. But that depends on a relationship that doesn't feel like a freelance relationship every single time you're going back. \n\n(00:27:31):\nAnother example that I would pull out is pretty much any healthcare platform. So for example, for physical therapy, it'd be weird if every time you went to a physical therapy platform, you just got randomly matched to whoever happened to be available then. So I think there's some curation that needs to happen of that relationship. Does that mean full employee? Maybe not. But it does mean you have to think a little bit about exactly as you brought up, what's the nature of curation of your labor pool?\n\nLenny (00:28:01):\nAwesome. Okay, so let's come back to a point you made early on around the importance of data and the power of data in actually making your marketplace a lot more efficient and work more effectively. So say that you have a data scientist, or a data analyst, or someone that is helping you optimize your marketplace. Where do you often find the biggest leverage and opportunity for a data person to help you make your marketplace more effective?\n\nRamesh Johari (00:28:25):\nThis is an incredible question, right? Because I think I could answer it a number of different ways. One question I think that's kind of basic, it's just what should this person be doing? And I'm going to actually evade that question a little bit. I'm going to give some examples of what they could do, but I feel like that's one where context matters a lot. \n\n(00:28:45):\nSo as an example, at ride-sharing or grocery delivery marketplaces, pricing means actually, what do you pay for that ride? Or what do you pay for that delivery? So that's actually the price that's set at the moment you actually place the order. Just to be clear, by the way, if you order from DoorDash, I don't mean the price of the restaurant. I mean, what do you pay to DoorDash, right? What's that fee? Is there a surcharge, because it's surge or whatever? Okay, so that's a thing, right?\n\n(00:29:11):\nBut that's not really a thing in a marketplace where the platform's not setting the prices. So in Airbnb, really hosts are the ones who are in charge of setting prices for their listings. \n\n(00:29:21):\nOne answer to your question is, if I'm in a place like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, I want to have good data scientists thinking about pricing. Because that seems like something which should be heavily dependent on the instantaneous state of supply and demand in my marketplace. So that's one type of answer is, well do I need data scientists working on pricing? Do I need data scientists working on search? Why search? Because maybe in my marketplace, finding the needle in the haystack is really the biggest, highest friction problem. So maybe I need a lot more data scientists saying about search. \n\n(00:29:51):\nThat's what I'm going to evade. Okay? I'm going to focus more on something completely different, which is just a more philosophical point about what a data scientist does.\n\n(00:30:00):\nSo in a lot of companies today, especially, a main thing that you ask data scientists to do is build what's called a machine learning model. Now, machine learning model even already can mean a lot of things to a lot of different people. I'm going to focus on something very concrete. You're asking them to predict something. \n\n(00:30:16):\nWhen I started at oDesk, this is in 2012, one of the funny things about me is I started at oDesk because I'd had a academic career up to that point in about 10 years, just building mathematical models of things. I was not really very much of a data scientist up to that point. What I expected would happen is I'd go to industry and I'd be told, \"Hey, look how important data is.\" And definitely my eyes were opened.\n\n(00:30:40):\nAnd one of the first things I was asked to think about is, well, okay, someone comes to oDesk, post a job, workers apply to that job. Predict which of these workers is most likely to be hired on that job. That was the narrow question. And so why is that a good question? Because we have a whole awesome set of tools now to solve that kind of a problem exactly. How do we do it? Take a lot of past data of past jobs, past applicants, past hires that were made. Then we ask these crazy big black box algorithms, \"All right, do the best job you can predicting who's going to get hired on this job with these applicants.\" And we use that data to test how well these algorithms are doing. That's machine learning in 30 seconds basically. So we're working on this problem. Great. \n\n(00:31:25):\nAnd then I kind of poked my head up a little bit. I go, \"Why are we working? What is this going to do?\" Well, it turns out the reason these kinds of things are important is they get used to make decisions. So what kind of decision do you make with that? Well, one thing you do is you say, \"Well, if I could predict who's most likely to be hired, then I should just rank people based on that, and that would be a good matching algorithm. That'd be a good way to sort and triage applicants for employers when they're screening, trying to figure out who to interview, who to hire.\" Great. Sounds pretty natural.\n\n(00:31:58):\nAnd then you think about it a little bit, and this to me, it's such a passion project to get people to understand that this is why the humans in the loop that help us in businesses and making sense of data are so critical, is the following problem.\n\n(00:32:15):\nIf you think about it a little bit, you realize what that algorithm is doing, it's really just picking up on patterns in past data. So yeah, that's great. This person is likely to be hired. But what we really want is something different. We're trying to add value by ranking people. \n\n(00:32:32):\nSo to give another example that's similar to this, when you're a marketing manager, and you've got a cracked data science team that's built a long-term value, lifetime value model for you, you're not going to get in trouble with anyone if you send your highest value promotions to the highest LTV customers, right? Who's going to blame you for that? Because you're like, \"This person is worth a lot, and I sent them this promotion.\" Say that in your monthly report, nobody's going to give you a hard time.\n\n(00:32:59):\nBut the problem with that way of thinking is actually predicting what their lifetime value is isn't really the question. The question is, how much more are they going to spend on my platform because I sent them that promotion?\n\n(00:33:11):\nThat's a very different thing. It's a differential rather than an absolute. I'm not interested in their absolute LTV. I'm absolutely interested in the difference in their LTV because I sent them this promotion.\n\n(00:33:21):\nAnd when you look at it that way, what you realize can happen is picking up on patterns because of good predictions, right? Finding the people that have high LTV because you predicted that is very different than making good decisions, which is about saying the difference in their LTV is going to be higher because I sent them this promotion. \n\n(00:33:39):\nI love this example, because I taught a class here at Stanford. It was like an executive education class. We had all the executives from a company in the room, and one of the people in the room was the chief marketing officer. And I just asked this question like, \"Hey, okay, let's say you got this great LTV model, who would you send the promotions to?\" It's like, \"Definitely the highest LTV people,\" and there's a CMO in the room. And so it's a little bit of a delicate situation, like pushing back a little bit, right? \n\n(00:34:03):\nI do want to be clear, there's reputational reasons you might do that anyway. I mean, I'm not trying to get away from that. But just to make the narrow point that predicting is about picking up patterns, but making decisions, it's about thinking about these differences.\n\n(00:34:15):\nNow, why is that important? Because we learn in high school, correlation is not causation. That's a phrase everybody has heard all over the place. What does that have to do with this? Well, when we teach people to build machine learning models, we're asking them to make predictions, we're asking them to find correlations. Prediction is inherently about correlation. But when we ask people to make decisions, we're asking them to think about causation. \"If I make this decision, then will I actually increase the net value of my business? Will I have by sending the promotion, increased the likelihood that this person is going to spend more on my platform?\"\n\n(00:34:50):\nAnd so the first and most important thing that I feel very strongly about in what would I get a data scientist to do is no matter who they are, even if it was that person in the weeds thinking about building this prediction model for hiring, get them to be thinking in the back of their mind always that their goal is to help the business make decisions. And that the distinction between causation and correlation matters a lot. We can talk a lot more about how does that play out in terms of their day-to-day work. But at least at a starting point, you have to recognize that the first step is always recognition that prediction isn't the same thing as making decisions.\n\nLenny (00:35:27):\nSo the takeaway here is as a data team and as a data scientist on the team, is help the business make predictions. Are there a couple more examples you could share of just what is an example of a decision that you think they often should be making and using data to help them with?\n\nRamesh Johari (00:35:41):\nMaybe the right frame of reference for this, and the word that an academic would use is causal inference. So what we're changing from is machine learning to causal inference. So let's think that through in a couple of different use cases that are related to that marketplace data science flywheel I talked about earlier. Finding matches, making matches, and then learning about matches.\n\n(00:36:04):\nSo finding matches, like you said, a core part of that is search and recommendation, and each of those relies on rankings. So I want to be able to rank order. Let's say I go do a search on Airbnb. On a rank order, the different listings in the marketplace, right? At some level, it's true that what I'm trying to do there is I'm trying to just predict, what are you going to like the most? \n\n(00:36:24):\nBut I think there's an important piece of that also, which is that I want to think a little bit about the distinction between two different ranking algorithms. That's the real decision that's being made. \n\n(00:36:35):\nAnd when I think about the distinction between two different ranking algorithms, I don't want to be only comparing them in terms of how well they recreate the choices people made in the past. The way I'm really going to evaluate those is in my market, does one of those lead to better matches or more matches than the other one, right?\n\n(00:36:54):\nSo Airbnb as a business, what are the most obvious core metrics? It's bookings and revenue. So you're going to want to ask a very basic question. If I use the ranking algorithm Lenny just developed last night versus the ranking algorithm Ramesh developed last week, does Lenny's ranking algorithm lead to more bookings than Ramesh's ranking algorithm?\n\n(00:37:11):\nAnd it's so important to put it that way starkly, because that's so different a question than, does Lenny's ranking algorithm do a better job of predicting over the last two years what bookings people made than Ramesh's ranking algorithm? So that's I think at that level.\n\n(00:37:24):\nThen we talked a little bit about ranking at the point of making a match, and I think that's where this hiring issue popped up. Because in the end, while we might have these predictive algorithms to rank who you're going to hire, that's not the important question.\n\n(00:37:38):\nInterestingly, the important question is actually to evaluate the quality of the match that's made. And we would do that through the next step of that flywheel. We'd ask ourselves, what ratings did they give back to that freelancer? Do they hire that freelancer again? So you're comparing two different algorithms not through their ability to recreate the past, but their ability to make matches in the future that can be objectively evaluated to say, \"Hey, I increased the value of the business. I actually made better matches this way.\" And then rating systems, I think we could talk quite a bit about a similar phenomenon there too.\n\nLenny (00:38:12):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments.\n\n(00:38:28):\nExperimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. \n\n(00:38:42):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more, with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.\n\n(00:39:05):\nEppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny, and 10x your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny.\n\n(00:39:29):\nYeah, I would actually love to talk about rating systems, but there's an implication in everything you're describing of running an experiment versus looking at what would've happened in the previous world made. You've made change, run an experiment, see if it actually makes an impact on bookings and revenue. And that leads me to a question I wanted to ask, which is with experiments, there's kind of this classic challenge, and always elephant in the room of if you just run a bunch of experiments, you're kind of going to micro optimize, lead to these local maxima, and you may miss big opportunities and big unlocks if you're just extremely experiment driven.\n\n(00:40:04):\nYou spend a lot of time thinking about experimentation. What have you learned or what advice do you have for people to either be less worried about optimizing and missing something big, or just finding a balance with running experiments, but also creating opportunity to find a huge new opportunity?\n\nRamesh Johari (00:40:21):\nYeah. First of all, I'm really glad you broached the E word. I was dancing around it, and I'm really glad that we talked about experiments. Because yeah, one of the big lessons of this recent conversation we've been having is just, how could you possibly know that difference without doing something like experimenting? \n\n(00:40:38):\nSo yeah, I am a big believer in experiments. I mean, I'll just lay those cards on the table. I love working with businesses that think experiments are important to helping make good decisions.\n\n(00:40:49):\nNow all that said, I am also someone who feels pretty strongly about this exact issue that you're raising. It's just, you can't experiment your way out of everything. \n\n(00:40:57):\nAnd one frame I like to give people is that although you might say you're an experiment driven business, some businesses will proclaim, \"We literally test everything.\" What that kind of leaves aside a little bit is there's a lot of degrees of freedom in what it means to test everything.\n\n(00:41:15):\nBecause ultimately, what's getting built and tested are choices that are made through the organizational structure, the data scientists, the PMs, the engineers, everybody's on... Before we're running experiments, we're actually thinking about even what's worth experimenting, what designs are we coming with? So that's one.\n\n(00:41:33):\nAnd the other big one is, how long do we run these experiments? Okay, that's a big choice. And what I generally believe, and I think there's a paper we can link to later that I'll point your readers to as well that... Not my paper, from some folks at Microsoft.\n\n(00:41:49):\nWhat I generally believe is we're risk averse on both these two dimensions, that what people decide to test in a world that has promoted experimentation for everything tends to be more incremental by design. Okay? And we'll come back to that actually, answer the because in a second. So that's one. And two is people tend to run experiments for a long time, and probably longer than they should.\n\n(00:42:14):\nNow, what do I mean by these two things? So what's interesting to me about this dynamic is experiments don't live in a vacuum. Companies have incentives. And in companies that really go all in on experimentation, one of the things that gets wrapped up in that is the incentives around experiments. Because if you go all in on experiments, a common thing you'll see is data scientists get judged based on how many wins they had that quarter. How do you get more wins? \n\n(00:42:43):\nWell, it's easier to get wins when you're being incremental. And because it's important to have wins, you have to run them long enough to demonstrate that they're really wins. You're less willing to cut something off in exchange for trying something riskier.\n\n(00:42:56):\nSo the big lesson of this Microsoft paper, it's called A/B Testing with what's called Fat Tails, which in lay terms just means you're running a business where there's potentially big opportunities out there if you look at the effects of the experiments that you run. There's a couple of lessons there about both trying a lot more stuff that's not all risk averse, and not necessarily running everything for so long. So really getting velocity up.\n\n(00:43:20):\nSo you could see that there's a big incentive problem there, because the culture that says it's okay to fail big actually requires changing the terminology of wins. This is one of the things I hate most in A/B testing, I have to say. I get where it comes from. Experimentation was never historically in science about winners and losers. It'd be weird if it Ronald Fisher who's kind of the father of experimentation with his agriculture experiments talked about winners. I don't think that's necessarily how he talked about things. Experimentation is always very hypothesis driven. It's about, what are you learning?\n\n(00:43:53):\nAnd that's really an important distinction because what it means is if I go with something big, risky, and it, \"fails,\" meaning that doesn't win. Nevertheless, if I was being rigorous about what hypotheses that's testing about my business, I'm potentially learning a lot.\n\n(00:44:11):\nSo a great example of this kind of thing is that there's an important feature of marketplaces is badging. So sometimes, it's really important to have badges on your top-rated profiles or whatever, when people are searching. \n\n(00:44:26):\nAnd without going too far into the details, a common finding with badges is that badges you think are going to be great actually turn out to be terrible. And one reason they're terrible is they focus too much attention on the badged folks, and pull too much attention away from the unbadged folks.\n\n(00:44:44):\nAnd if we judge that only in terms of winners and losers, you throw the baby out with the bath water, you're like, \"Well that badging idea was terrible. So ditch that, no badges.\"\n\n(00:44:51):\nBut that's not what it's telling you. It's teaching you something about how inventory is being reallocated, how attention's being redirected through the badges. And you really want to think not in terms of winning and losing, but learning.\n\n(00:45:05):\nSo learning is a win. And I feel that that's a cultural thing fundamentally. It's very hard to somehow attach dollars and cents at the top to data scientists running experiments that fail, but learn. And ultimately, I think getting into that space where you experiment more, meaning you don't run all your experiments for quite as long and you accept the willingness to try experiments that are into the tails where you might fail bigger is a cultural thing. It's about saying that, \"We're allowing that to be part of our social contract with our data scientists,\" or actually our employee contract with our data scientists, that not everything is just about how many launches you had and how many wins there were.\n\n(00:45:45):\nIt's okay to say, \"That's how I want to use experimentation,\" but if you're going to use it that way, then I would say don't be a, \"We experiment everything,\" business. Because then I think you need some other way to deal with these big changes that teach the whole company a lot, but maybe can't fall into the incentives you've created for your data scientists.\n\nLenny (00:46:04):\nThis badging example is, I don't know if you're referring to the Airbnb example, but I actually led the launch of Superhost at Airbnb, which is the ultimate badge on Airbnb. And there was a lot of concern from the data team that it would destroy the marketplace, because they've built, as you've described, this very well-crafted ranking algorithm, with just a prediction of exactly as you described, which listings that guest is most likely to book and be successful booking. And then we're about to throw a badge on random listings in the results. And so this one data scientist on our team's like, \"No, we can't do this. This is insane. We're going to destroy it all.\"\n\n(00:46:42):\nAnd we still went ahead with it. We ran an experiment showing the badge to some people and some not, actually, it was no impact at all. Which Superhost itself had no impact at all on the business as far as we could tell initially, which is also bittersweet because it felt like, \"Why did we even work on this thing?\" There was a slight benefit where a host felt better, they felt more satisfied with being a host, but I went exactly through what you described, so that's pretty funny.\n\nRamesh Johari (00:47:11):\nWithout necessarily going into the weeds on the data science of Superhost, I think there's a lot wrapped up in what you said. I guess another thing I'll say is that I'm a big believer that you don't throw your understanding of the business out the window when you process experiment results. And it's partly, I guess what I mean by this is data science is really about accumulation of evidence. It's never about one finding in isolation. And so another kind of trap I think is to sometimes say, \"Well, I hit stat sig on my A/B test, green light. It's all go.\"\n\n(00:47:47):\nAnd I think you had Ronny Kohavi on your show, and he made a similar point that there are different levels of evidence, and just having an outlier A/B test that goes against everything you believe about your business doesn't mean that you somehow have controverted all your knowledge. And I think that's one side of it.\n\n(00:48:05):\nThe other thing is you can't always measure everything that's important that's needed to really develop a full sense. So with Superhost, one of the things that's hard to measure is the long-term impact of Superhost. Because in the short run, Superhost causes a rebalancing of inventory. There's going to be winners and losers. Part of Superhost is actually about retaining hosts that get the badge over a longer period of time. Recognizing that hypothesis actually says something about maybe how long the experiment needs to be run or what kinds of data analyses need to be done. \n\n(00:48:38):\nAnd in the end, if you can't do that, you can't run it long enough, or you can't do that data analysis due to sparsity of data or lack of data to address the question, it matters what you bring to the table. What are your beliefs about that?\n\n(00:48:51):\nSo what I like to tell people to do there is I like to push people to be what's called quantified rather than data-driven, which is, okay fine, some things we can't measure. But maybe you've got a leadership team with different beliefs about what they think the retention value of Superhost is going to be, and they might be all over the place.\n\n(00:49:10):\nYou can process your experiment results in the context of these competing beliefs. It's almost like a prediction market kind of a thing. And start asking, \"Well okay, if this is what we believe about our business, this is what the data is telling us out of the experiment, let's put those two together and ask, is this enough for us to make the bet that we're still going to go with it?\" Even though maybe that short-term test you ran was flat.\n\nLenny (00:49:31):\nThat's actually exactly how I think of Superhost looking back. It was a great idea. I'm really happy. I can't even imagine Airbnb without that, even though there's no evidence, at least initially, that it made any impact. I'm guessing they looked at it again, and maybe there's something that came out of it. But even if it had no impact, it just feels like it made the marketplace better. And that was a big learning for me. It doesn't need to always drive a metric that you can measure. There's just like, this is the way it should work.\n\nRamesh Johari (00:49:59):\nSo one of the reasons the thing you said happens is because marketplaces are a little bit like a game of whac-a-mole, okay? And what I mean by that is, so narrowly in the context of Superhost, because you're redirecting attention to some hosts at the expense of... It's not even obvious if bookings can really go up. Maybe you get lucky and maybe you get a bunch more bookings. One reason you probably wouldn't expect that in the first place is there's only a limited number of Superhosts. How many more bookings are they going to be absorbing because of all this extra attention? And you're taking attention away from other people. Without doing any data analysis, my prior would've been that booking should probably go down.\n\n(00:50:33):\nAnd one example that I came across with one of the companies I worked with that I love is we were working together over a period of time, and in a month, we looked at some of the data and it suggested that our new supply side was having a pretty bad experience. Say, \"We got to do something about this.\"\n\n(00:50:55):\nSo what we decided to do is build some custom bespoke features that were really going to direct them to more experienced folks on the other side of the market. Good. And then lo and behold, pretty soon those metrics start to look better. But then we're looking at it, we're like, \"Wait a second. Now the existing folks on the other side are having a worse experience.\"\n\n(00:51:12):\nSo you kind of whiplash around. You're like, \"Wait a second, we better do something about that.\" So we take them, we try to match them up with the more experienced folks. And now suddenly a month after that you're like, \"Wait a second.\" And your metrics just keep moving around.\n\n(00:51:24):\nAnd that's because the whac-a-mole game here is ultimately, a lot of marketplace management is moving attention and inventory around. Sometimes you get lucky and you really expand the pie for everybody. But I think Servaes Tholen, who was CFO at Upwork that I got to know there and then went to Thumbtack later, he had this line when he came to visit our class that I love, which is, \"You have to recognize when you run marketplaces that many of the changes that are most consequential create winners and losers. And rolling with those changes is about recognizing whether the winners you've created are more important to your business view than the losers you've created in the process.\" And it's a hard reality, because nobody likes to articulate the idea that a feature change is hurting some of the people in your marketplace. But because of this fundamental constraint baked into how marketplaces work, many of the things that we would choose to do and the reallocation they create can't necessarily create observed high expanding wins in the short run. You're often making bets that that's where you're headed, partly through the reallocation that you're doing right now.\n\n(00:52:30):\nAnd so I think that's interesting about Superhost to me is that partly points to thinking about, what's the objective you would've defined, the metric you would've defined in the short run that captures this idea of a trade-off?\n\nLenny (00:52:42):\nThat's a great way to think about it. I wanted to come back to this idea you're sharing of maybe you should run experiments more quickly, not wait for stat sig, have a culture of learning versus impact. In practice, it's very difficult, because people are measured by impact. There's performance reviews, there's promotions, there's how much impact did this team drive, are going to look at their experiment results? You've worked with a lot of marketplace companies, a lot of different companies. Is there anything you've seen about something you could do to help the company shift and actually work this way, while also recognizing success, and who's doing great, who's not, which team's driving impact, who's not?\n\nRamesh Johari (00:53:22):\nInterestingly, it's actually an active area of research for me now. What I mean by active area of research is I care a lot about the incentives that we create for data science through how we set up reward mechanisms. So there's a couple things I think that could be helpful, that are maybe there may be a little bit less about... Maybe I'm not going to directly answer the question you ask, because I think that's a hard one, right? I think I recognize that measurement on impact is critical. Well, let me answer that actually from the most obvious way first. I think there's a cultural issue here that's really critical. \n\n(00:53:56):\nOne of the things I often find is that my PhD students, our PhD students here often go off and get great data scientist jobs. And in one sense, they're doing amazing stuff. They apply really technically sophisticated methods. But when I look at the problems they're working on, they're often more at the margins of the business than they should be. \n\n(00:54:13):\nAnd it's a cultural thing. It's basically because if you're measured narrowly on impact and that's all anyone sees around you, then it's very hard to engage with the creative aspect of business change and the strategic aspects of business change. \n\n(00:54:26):\nSo the cultural aspect there is, I think it's partly incumbent on the leaders to expect something more of their data scientists. And what I mean by expect more is that you expect them to do more than deliver narrowly defined, statistically rigorous results to you in their reports. You're actually expecting them to talk also about what they're learning about the business in the process. So where that's headed is there's this concept of being hypothesis driven, which is like the technical phrase. What does that mean? Again, in a more lay sense.\n\n(00:54:58):\nWhat it means is tests aren't going to be defined only in terms of winners and losers, that each test should also say something about what will we learn about a business flow, a funnel, preferences of the guests, preferences of the hosts. What will we learn about their demand elasticity if we're changing prices around? These kinds of things. So it's possible to articulate in an experiment doc, a launch doc, what are the hypotheses that are being tested? So that's one thing I would say is just culturally, setting the norms that learning is part of the discourse, and it's expected actually I think is important.\n\n(00:55:33):\nBut the other thing I would say that's maybe a little bit more about programmatically, what could a data science platform team do? A funny thing about experiments is that we throw past learning away effectively. And this is just an artifact of how we analyze experiments, that the statistical methods used typically, P-values, confidence intervals, these fall into a branch of statistics known as frequentist statistics. And the idea behind frequentist statistics without being overly technical is just I let the data speak for itself. There's no beliefs brought to the table about where that data came from.\n\n(00:56:10):\nBut if you think about this in a company, in A/B testing a company, it's a weird thing, right? Because I might've run 1,000 A/B tests in the past on this exact same button, or call to action, or color, and now I am going to completely ignore that and focus only on this. \n\n(00:56:23):\nSo there's ways to take the past into account, to build what's called a prior belief before I run an experiment, and now take the data from the experiment, connect it with the prior, to come up with a conclusion of, \"Okay, in light of the past plus this experiment, what's it telling me about the future?\" And that falls broadly under the category of what's called Bayesian A/B testing. \n\n(00:56:46):\nSo that's one of the things I think can help culturally, weirdly. It's a super technical thing, but I think it can help culturally, because what it's doing is it's now rewarding people for contributing information to that prior. And I think it then becomes possible to say, \"Your experiment that failed actually moved our prior.\" And that's an important thing, because by doing so, you're now altering how we're going to think about this flow or this pricing plan in all future experiments.\n\n(00:57:14):\nSo there's an information positive externality, positive network effect that's generated for the rest of your business if I can somehow encode what you learned into the analysis of future experiments. So this is one thing. There's strong connection between the culture and incentives of A/B testing and the ability to actually incorporate past learning into these prior beliefs.\n\nLenny (00:57:35):\nI love that you're doing research in this area. We should bring you back when you've completed it and have the ultimate answer for everyone to change how they operate. \n\nRamesh Johari (00:57:42):\nYeah, one of the great things about professors is we never complete anything and never have ultimate answers.\n\nLenny (00:57:47):\nOh boy.\n\nRamesh Johari (00:57:47):\nYeah, I'll do my best though.\n\nLenny (00:57:50):\nThis touches on a really interesting concept that you shared with me around how, just learning isn't free. People think that they could just learn a bunch of stuff and there's not a cost to it. I'd love for you to just chat a bit about what that means.\n\nRamesh Johari (00:58:02):\nLet me start with an anecdote, that I just absolutely love this anecdote. I use it every year in class. So I was talking to a real estate platform, and they had a marketing data science manager who's basically responsible, as many marketing managers are, for allocation of ad spend across different channels.\n\n(00:58:22):\nAnd what they discovered had happened at the end of the year is in one hand, the team had done great, but the manager had held out some subset of arriving visitors, not showing them any of the innovations they were making.\n\nLenny (00:58:39):\nLike a holdout group? \n\nRamesh Johari (00:58:40):\nYeah, exactly. What's called a holdout group in experimentation. And one thing about this holdout is it wasn't authorized. That's not the way things are supposed to work. They've got their ad spend, allocate out your ad spend, great. So at the end of the year, they looked at the hole out and they're like, \"Wow, that cost us a couple million dollars, something in that range, and it's not a trivial amount of money. What's the deal? What were you thinking?\" Basically. And of course the answer was, \"Well, I get that I cost you that much, but number one, now you know what my team's worth. And number two, you would never have had that answer unless I'd done that on my own.\"\n\n(00:59:16):\nNow, why is that so powerful? I think what I find so interesting about experiments is that when you don't know something, it seems not even a question that you would allocate some of your samples to all options, right? Treatment and control. I have two different ways of doing something. I don't know which one's better, so of course I'll give some samples to each. After the fact you're like, \"Treatment was better. What the heck were we thinking? Why'd we give all those samples to control? That doesn't make any sense now.\" There's this great Seinfeld clip where he mentions getting a bill at the end of a large luxurious meal, and people stare at the bill like, \"We're not hungry now. Why'd we order all this food?\" So it's the same thing. I mean, you know treatment's better now. Why'd you waste all those samples on control?\n\n(00:59:59):\nAnd I think that is such a powerful observation that you have to put yourself in the frame of reference of when you didn't have the answer. And at that moment, what you're essentially saying to yourself is that it's worth paying to learn the answer. I think it sounds obvious the way we're saying it now, or this anecdote of the marketing manager and the holdout sounds obvious. What's culturally not baked in I think is that idea. And the reason I say it's not culturally baked in, by the way, is because of the language of winners and losers. Because if we use that language, we're implicitly saying is that we wasted time when we ran an A/B test on loser. If I reward you for shipping winners, then what I'm really telling you is all the time that you spent testing out failures was wasted time.\n\n(01:00:46):\nAnd I think, of course, you don't want to keep data scientists around who regularly are just generating failures. That's not my point. \n\n(01:00:54):\nBut my point is there's a disconnect there. On one hand, we can all look at the story of this marketing manager and chuckle at it. And yet, every day we're instantiating language and processes that are reinforcing that same theme, which is essentially trying to say to you, \"If you're wasting samples on things that don't ultimately end up being a winner, then the act of doing so is a failure.\"\n\n(01:01:16):\nSo I really feel that that idea that you have to pay to learn, again, it's a cultural thing, but it's also an education issue for businesses are populated by people of all stripes. Not everybody comes from a data science or experimentation background. And this idea that learning is costly is not natural, actually. It's not natural as a matter of human nature. It's certainly not natural as a matter of running a business.\n\nLenny (01:01:41):\nI love that example of the real estate platform where it's very viscerally, clearly cost. They lost because they didn't roll out experiments to this group for a long time. Such a good example of this idea in action. \n\n(01:01:55):\nYou mentioned star ratings. I know you spent a lot of time on designing rating systems. Sorry, I didn't mean to imply star ratings. That's just one implementation. Rating systems in general.\n\n(01:02:05):\nSo maybe just to keep it focused, say a marketplace founder is trying to decide and design how they do ratings, and reviews, and things like that. What's a couple pieces of advice you'd give them for how to do this correctly? And is there a model marketplace you'd point them to like, \"These guys really do it really well\"? And I know it's super specific based on the marketplace, but is there one just like, \"They really nailed it\"?\n\nRamesh Johari (01:02:30):\nOh man, that's a tough one. I think I'll answer the second part first. I don't feel like anyone's really nailed this. Yeah, I think there's a lot of innovation that's happened, but I think fundamentally, we're still playing with the same kind of tools that we had when eBay and Amazon first started thinking about how to do rating systems ages ago. \n\n(01:02:48):\nAnd part of the reason we haven't nailed it is because there's a lot of dynamics in play that lead to what's called rating inflation, where if you look at ratings over time in the marketplace... One of my colleagues, John Horton, who was a professor at MIT and has worked very closely with Upwork, we worked together when I was at oDesk, he was the staff economist there. He's written a couple of really nice papers with this empirical phenomenon that over time, you see the median rating inflating, let's say on marketplaces like oDesk, like Uber, like any of these.\n\n(01:03:16):\nAnd there's a lot of reasons for this, but one of them is just that there's a reciprocity issue, which is it's effectively, from your perspective, it's kind of costless if someone says to you, \"Hey, please leave me a nice rating.\" And if you're seeing them or you're interacting with them, most people don't want to be mean. So that happens. \n\n(01:03:35):\nBut there's another aspect of it, which is norming. As the ratings in the marketplace go up, they get normed, so that now you're in a condition, you're like, \"A four star rating. I'm really screwing this person over.\" Whereas maybe when the marketplace started, you didn't think that. \n\n(01:03:47):\nSo definitely one thing that we worked on in our research was to think about renorming, the meaning of some of these labels. And renorming could mean something like rather than the star ratings just being poor to excellent, the top rating has actually exceeded expectations. You could go one step further and you could say, \"How did this compare to this experience you had in the past that you rated really highly?\" And Airbnb had something like this in place, where they would actually ask you to compare, or ask you questions about expectations.\n\n(01:04:19):\nI find that that's really valuable because it's easier for people to say, \"That was good but didn't exceed my expectations. That was good, but definitely not better than this amazing stay I had two months ago,\" than it is to say, \"Well, I'm going to ding this person and give them four stars.\" So that's one issue.\n\n(01:04:36):\nAnd I think another thing I want to point out for any marketplace founder is that something you want to be really careful about is the concept of averaging and whether are the implications of averaging. And that's because a default for many marketplaces is to just average the ratings that people get. It feels very natural, right? Lenny's got five ratings, let me average them.\n\n(01:04:57):\nAnd that actually has some pretty important distributional consequences for the marketplace. Distributional in the sense of who wins, who loses. And that's because if you're averaging and you're really established on a platform, think of a restaurant on Yelp with 10,000 reviews, it's irrelevant what the next review is. It doesn't matter. Nothing's moving it at that point.\n\n(01:05:17):\nIf you're new and you break into that market, and your first review is negative, you might be completely screwed. In fact, there's some early work on eBay that showed that if your first rating's negative, that could actually immediately cause an 8% hit on your immediate expected revenue, say nothing of long-term consequences. Subsequent work has found that that's a significant indicator of potential exit from the platform, just because now it's very hard to find work. And some platforms do things like maybe they won't show your ratings until you've accumulated a few.\n\n(01:05:46):\nBut in the end, this kind of distributional fairness aspect of averaging is pretty significant. And one of the recent papers that we've written is trying to get platforms to think a little bit about that. There's ways to address that interestingly, through the same concept of a prior. And the prior basically says hey, if someone comes into the marketplace and instead of averaging them, I average them together with a prior belief, then maybe what that prior belief does, it says, \"Yeah, you got one negative rating, but maybe you got a little bit unlucky,\" and maybe my prior belief is something which actually pulls your rating up a little bit and allows me to still have you alongside others in the marketplace to give you a chance at getting work, getting rides, etc.\n\n(01:06:28):\nSo I believe pretty strongly in this kind of distributional fairness element of designing rating systems. I think it's been understudied. And I'll say in general actually, I think rating systems are understudied, which to me is astonishing. Because the biggest change from those Agoras and Trajan's Market elements of those kinds of markets, to me the biggest change is that we get to see what happened with our matches.\n\n(01:06:52):\nSo as a data scientist working on marketplaces, I feel like it's incredible that more of us don't spend our time thinking about what we're learning from the matches, and what these rating systems are telling us, and what the impact of that is on who wins and who loses in these markets, kind of thinking about the social implications of these things. So that's something I'm pretty passionate about.\n\nLenny (01:07:14):\nI also led the review system flows for a while at Airbnb, and one of the things I'm most proud of is launching what we call double-blind reviews where you don't see the other person's review until you leave your review. The intention was to create more honesty and more accurate reviews.\n\n(01:07:32):\nIt turned out the biggest impact was review rate went up, because people get this email, \"Ramesh left you a review. If you want to see it, should leave a review.\" And that really increased review rate, which gave us more data. And it was a really fun experiment to work on. \n\nRamesh Johari (01:07:44):\nThere's a great concept in the literature on rating systems called the sound of silence, which is this idea that there's a lot of information in ratings that are not left. So Steve Tadelis, who's a professor at Berkeley, he had a really nice paper with some folks at eBay talking about what they called effective percent positive, where rather than normalizing just by the ratings, they normalized by including ratings that weren't left. And what you found was this was much more predictive of downstream performance of a seller. So there's a lot of information in that lack of a response. So it's cool that you're able to get more of that out.\n\nLenny (01:08:23):\nSo much easier just to not leave a review than leave a bad review. Right? The downside to you is just much better. Oh man, marketplaces are so fascinating. I could see why a founder would want to be a marketplace founder, because it's just such an interesting space. And hearing your feedback of, no, you're not a marketplace founder. Let's think about the problem you're solving. And it might be a marketplace, might change people's minds. Also, I feel like there's a podcast episode in every topic we touched on. I know we just scratched the surface a lot of things.\n\n(01:08:52):\nI know you got to run. Before we get to our lightning round, is there anything else you wanted to highlight, touch on, leave people with that are maybe working on marketplaces, thinking about a marketplace?\n\nRamesh Johari (01:09:01):\nI think one of the high level points I would make, and like you said, there's an entire podcast in this topic, is that I think people want to imagine LMs and AI driven data science automating out large parts of what it means to do data science in industry. And I think that's probably the wrong perspective. In some mundane sense, that's true. It's easier for me to code than it used to be before. It's easier for me to develop visualizations than it used to be. I can make dashboards faster. So programmatically, I think it's true in some basic sense.\n\n(01:09:35):\nBut what I believe pretty strongly, and I teach data science here, and my students are asked to use LMs and generative AI on a weekly basis on all their assignments. So I've got an up close and personal beat on this, but I believe very strongly actually is what AI has done for us is it's massively expanded the frontier of things we could think about our problem, hypotheses we could have, maybe things we could test. It's just an astronomical explosion of explanations, and ideas, and principle.\n\n(01:10:06):\nAnd I really think actually what that does is puts more pressure on the human, not less. I think it becomes more important for humans to be in the loop in interacting with these tools to drive the funneling down process of identifying what matters, at all levels. That ranges from you're carrying out a data scientific analysis, and now because you've got these tools, you can hypothesize 10 explanations, maybe 100 explanations. Which of those are you going to focus attention on? What are you going to tell other people to focus their attention on? To you're running experiments, used to have 10 creatives you're testing for a marketing campaign, you got 1,000 creatives, you're testing for that marketing campaign. Maybe that completely changes the game of what it means to run an experiment. What are you actually looking for now? How do you evaluate that you found something that was good enough?\n\n(01:10:52):\nAnd I think these questions are not getting enough attention. I think people are looking for the automated tool that really cuts the human out. But what I've seen so far, and again, who knows? By 2024, I might have a totally different answer for you. I don't think so. But at the moment, what I see is that humans have actually become far more important to the productive data science loop, not far less.\n\nLenny (01:11:16):\nSuch an important point. I feel like we need to add AI corner to this podcast where we always think about, how does AI impact what we're talking about on this podcast?\n\nRamesh Johari (01:11:23):\nYeah, I can see that. I totally see that. \n\nLenny (01:11:25):\nOkay, we might start doing that. Ramesh, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Let's try to knock through them so you can go teach your class. Are you ready?\n\nRamesh Johari (01:11:35):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny (01:11:36):\nAll right. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people\n\nRamesh Johari (01:11:40):\nWhen it comes to books, I have one I love that I start with always, which is How to Lie with Statistics. It's a tiny book, Darrell Huff from 1954, which is just for anyone that likes data at any level, it's such a fun read. It's a great book. \n\n(01:11:55):\nThe second thing I recommend to people, and actually this is true even for people who are not expert, is David Freedman was a statistician at Berkeley who passed away in the 2000s, early 2000s. His writing was fantastic in getting us to think hard about process. He was especially fond of what he called shoe leather statistics, where you rolled your sleeves up, you got on the ground, boots on the ground, really getting in there, really trying to understand your data.\n\n(01:12:27):\nHis writing is fantastic, his explanations are fantastic. He has a few different books at different levels I think people would love reading. Most importantly, what I like about it is he puts such emphasis on driving evidence and understanding of your processes that generate data. And I find often, data scientists don't even look at examples.\n\n(01:12:44):\nSo at oDesk, it meant are you looking at actual jobs, and what's actually going on in your product before you're trying to do data science on it? So I think that's a Freedman insight, Freedman mantra, and so his writing is great.\n\n(01:12:58):\nThe last one I was going to mention has nothing to do with data science or anything. It's called Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman. I'm not a huge self-help type person, but I really like this book a lot. I think it's a little bit stoic in its approach, like stoic philosophy. But the basic point is you're only on earth somewhere in the neighborhood of 4,000 weeks, and my wife and I have this term we call infinite Q, which is no matter what you think you get done on a given day, more stuff's going to just keep coming in.\n\n(01:13:26):\nAnd he basically says that recognizing that is liberating. Because once you recognize it, it doesn't matter what you do. You're always going to have too much to do. There's no point in stressing out about having too much to do. And just that small shift of mindset than puts a lot more attention on the usual thing people worry about, which is, where do I want to prioritize my time? So he has a great way of writing about it, some concrete rules of thumb to help manage that way of thinking. And yeah, I think it's a great book.\n\nLenny (01:13:52):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nRamesh Johari (01:13:55):\nI am a climber, and one movie that I really liked was The Alpinist. I know a lot of people have seen Free Solo, but for anyone that kind of likes that genre, I would recommend they watch The Alpinist.\n\n(01:14:06):\nI think climbing is an interesting sport because has very much a psychological aspect of it. And I think that movie is pretty good at this meta level where you reflect a little bit on, what does it mean to make a movie about people who are obviously putting themselves into such risky situations? So I really enjoyed that.\n\n(01:14:25):\nOn TV, we've been watching Only Murders in the Building, but I'm enough episodes behind right now that I probably won't say anything more, because I am trying to avoid any spoilers and I'm sure there's people out there trying to do the same. So great show though on Hulu.\n\nLenny (01:14:39):\nWhat's a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're hiring?\n\nRamesh Johari (01:14:43):\nI interview people probably that are a little bit different than most of your podcast listeners. But that said, there's one question I like to ask a lot, and that's if you imagine... Often in our interviews in academia, whether it's grad students or faculty will ask people about their plans.\n\n(01:15:00):\nAnd what I like to ask people is, \"Okay, now imagine everything works out, all the challenges you're facing work out, all your plans work out, everything hits the top end of your vision for what this could be. What do you imagine is the impact of having done that? Who's being impacted by that? Why is that a big deal that happened?\"\n\n(01:15:20):\nAnd I find that's a really valuable question to ask, because first of all, many people haven't thought about that. We're so short-term focused, we don't even think, \"Boy, if everything worked out, what would be the big deal because of what I did?\" Startup founders tend to be better at this than most people obviously.\n\n(01:15:35):\nBut another reason I like it is because you will find in that conversation that their vision expands a little bit of additional spheres that are touched or impacted by what they're thinking about doing. So on both sides, it's kind of a revealing question, I think. So I find that important for my line of work, but my hunch is that might be useful for some of your listeners too.\n\nLenny (01:15:57):\nYeah, such a unique perspective on interviewing, versus most of the guests that I interview in tech company.\n\nRamesh Johari (01:16:03):\nYeah, normally there's a coding question, right? I should say I would never ask a coding question post November 2022 after we got AI to help us code. I think it's a superpower.\n\nLenny (01:16:15):\nAI corner. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nRamesh Johari (01:16:22):\nI also really like cycling. And I'm not ashamed to admit that I think that e-bikes are the greatest thing for cycling. Admittedly, I'm late forties, so maybe I'm the right target demographic too. But yeah, I love my e-road bike. It's great, because it's not one of those with a throttle, you have to work, but it kicks in just when you're on your sixth hill and you don't want to go up the last hill anymore on the way home. So yeah, that's amazing. I think that's just transformative for people that like cycling, but have busy lives.\n\n(01:16:51):\nAnd I think another one that my son who's 10 roped me into actually, is we were in Santa Cruz browsing at a kitchenware shop of all places, and he saw an outdoor pizza oven, a tiny portable one. And he just did research for two weeks and insisted we get one. \n\n(01:17:07):\nSo he got one over the summer, and after we got it, he refused to eat pizza out anymore as a 10-year-old. So maybe that's the best thing I could say about the quality of pizza you can get from a home outdoor portable pizza oven.\n\nLenny (01:17:20):\nOh my God, I'm hungry. I am going to go have to get some pizza now. What is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat to yourself, share with folks, find useful in your day-to-day?\n\nRamesh Johari (01:17:31):\nA lot of my work involves talking to students of all stripes. And I guess these students go on to be data scientists, go on to be founders, and a lot of them go in the tech industry. So maybe in that sense, that advice is relevant. \n\n(01:17:43):\nMy main thing I tell people is slow down. I think what I've found has been happening, is we're so convinced that speed is the way you're going to find the right answer, that I just don't think we slow down to develop meaningful mental models of the things we're doing. That's certainly true in the research projects I work on. It's consistently true when I talk to people in business, and I ask them about their... By mental model, I just mean if you're running a marketplace, what is your model of what people care about? What makes people stay versus leave? What makes matches work versus not work? All those things shape a roadmap in your mind. And I think a lot of roadmapping, a lot of execution, paper writing in academia has all just become far more fast-paced, at the expense of deeper thinking about these kinds of structural features of the thing you're building. \n\n(01:18:41):\nSo with my students, but also I think with people I interact with in industry, I think slowing down is actually more of a virtue than it's given credit for.\n\nLenny (01:18:50):\nVery similar to a motto that a recent guest shared, which I think was go slow to go fast, or stay smooth to go fast.\n\nRamesh Johari (01:18:59):\nYeah, I like that. Maybe I'll pilfer that, when I go talk to my grad students [inaudible 01:19:03].\n\nLenny (01:19:04):\nFinal question. You're a professor at Stanford University, which sounds incredibly cool. What's something about being a professor at Stanford in particular or in general that would surprise people, either good or bad?\n\nRamesh Johari (01:19:17):\nYeah. I mean, we've had a rough ride, as everybody probably knows. Stanford's been in the news for a lot of not so great reasons, I think over the last five years especially. \n\n(01:19:29):\nSo I don't know if this is the right kind of surprise, but I think one thing that I find really energizing at Stanford is people have never asked me for credentialing here. And what I mean by that is that I came from a bunch of other good schools, and obviously I've spent time in industry with a lot of great companies. And a kind of cultural dynamic that can often develop is, \"Well, before I'm going to talk to you, I want to know something about why you're worth talking to. Give me your credentials. Where are you a grad student or where are you a professor? Tell me about yourself first.\"\n\n(01:20:10):\nOne of the things that I found very surprising when I came here is just how that never happened at any level. Grad students tell me this all the time. Go talk to someone across campus and just launch right into a conversation about how your X meets my Y, and we have something we could do together. As a faculty member, it happens all the time. I just had a conversation a couple days ago with someone about effectively a marketplace of experiment designs for nano fabrication here, which is totally out of left field for things I do, and yet seamless. Our conversation was about the substance rather than the credentialing.\n\n(01:20:46):\nI really think part of the reason for that is that Stanford is sort of unique in that it doesn't have a weakness across the board. We have strong professional schools, law, business, medicine, strong engineering schools, strong humanities and social sciences. And then that and the weather is what I usually tell people honestly, which matters a lot. People are willing to walk anywhere. I think those things combine to create a culture and an environment where you don't credential everybody.\n\n(01:21:09):\nAnd I think that means a lot. I think that's something that I haven't found elsewhere. And if people wanted to know something about what's Stanford's like on the inside, I think that's one aspect of it that probably isn't discussed very much. I think that's part of what makes it really fun to be here.\n\nLenny (01:21:27):\nIt's also an incredibly dreamy campus, that is very joyful to walk around. That helps, I'm sure. Ramesh, I feel like we got people's brains tingling. I think we've created new marketplace founders, and also convinced people maybe they aren't marketplace founders. So maybe we netted out zero new marketplace founders. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nRamesh Johari (01:21:49):\nI think the easiest way, if someone's interested more on the industrial side is probably LinkedIn. You send me a message or connect there. Also, because I'm an academic, I have my own Stanford webpage, and it's pretty easy to figure out how to find me there as well.\n\n(01:22:02):\nAnd how can listeners help me? I kind of feel the most important thing that someone listening to this could do is take forward some of the messages that came out in terms of what it means to be data literate. And I think there's a lot you can do to educate yourself there. \n\n(01:22:18):\nMaybe one final thought I'll share is that in the same way that AI generates a lot of ideas, AI also generates a lot of prose. And in data science, that can actually be deadly because you're getting more explanations that sometimes maybe are extraneous. \n\n(01:22:35):\nSo taking that as a little vignette, I think that what the world needs is data literacy on the part of people interacting with these tools and with each other. So that's the thing I care most about. The things I teach, the things I do research on, they're all connected to that theme. And so that's where I'm pretty excited. I do work with companies regularly, and so if there's interesting opportunities that fall in the sphere of stuff we've discussed on the podcast, always happy to listen.\n\nLenny (01:23:00):\nAwesome. I think we've made a dent in helping people become a little more data literate. Ramesh, thank you so much for being here.\n\nRamesh Johari (01:23:07):\nAll right. Thank you so much, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:23:08):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:23:11):\nThank you so much for listening.
