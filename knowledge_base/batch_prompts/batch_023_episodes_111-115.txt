I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Ian McAllister. Ian is the author of one of the most classic posts on product management, What Separates a Top 1% PM from a Top 10% PM, amongst many other pieces of writing that he shared online. Ian has managed over 100 product managers in his career. He spent 12 years at Amazon where he built Amazon Smile and led the team responsible for growing Alexa internationally. He also worked at Airbnb with me and now he's at Uber leading global product for the vehicles platform, which includes making Uber's fleet increasingly electric and autonomous. In our conversation, we focus primarily on two topics. What separates a top 1% PM from everyone else, specifically for new PMs and also for senior PMs. And we also dig deep into the working backwards process. We get into how you can implement the process on your team and how you might be doing it wrong. There's also a bunch of links to templates and guides in the show notes, so if you want to follow along, definitely check those out. With that, I bring you Ian McAllister.\n\nLenny (00:01:32):\nThis episode is brought to you by Mixpanel. Offering powerful self-serve product analytics.

I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferris and Lex Friedman, and so I finally gave it a shot earlier this year and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One, with a small scoop that dissolves in water you are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as a little safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies and internal testing that they do.\n\nLenny (00:03:13):\nAnd three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day and that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/lenny. To take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.\n\nLenny (00:03:55):\nIan, welcome to the podcast.\n\nIan McAllister (00:03:57):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. I've been looking forward to this.\n\nLenny (00:03:59):\nMe too. I'm sure you hear this a lot, but when I was a new product manager, a very new PM, the post that you wrote on what makes a top 1% product manager was really influential and really helped me figure out what to focus on and what skills are really important. And I find that it continues to live on as this very legendary post for product managers who are trying to figure out what to do. And I just reread it in prep for this post and I was just like, wow, this is ... Now that I'm on the other side, I'm like, this is so right. And so I'm really excited to dig into a lot of these things in person, virtually in person, and with you. So thank you again for doing this.\n\nIan McAllister (00:04:35):\nYeah. Man, it's awesome. I'm excited just to spend some time talking with you about product and we'll see what happens.\n\nLenny (00:04:42):\nDid you expect the impact that this post had when you were writing it, when you were just putting this together, the impact that the post had in your career or just the PM industry?\n\nIan McAllister (00:04:51):\nDefinitely not. I used to lurk on Quora at the time and then I was just having fun reading things and answering some questions and I used to look for questions in the Goldilocks zone. They weren't too high level of abstract like how do you be a good problem, but they weren't too super specific and this one was kind of right in the middle. And so I'd pluck off a couple of those and I think more as a way to structure my own thoughts, that was what was interesting and fun for me to do that. Not because I thought it'd have any kind of real reach. But obviously it's been cool to see that people reference it pretty often and that's been pretty fun.\n\nLenny (00:05:23):\nWe'll link to this in the show notes. If folks that are listening don't know what we're talking about, we'll link to it and you can check it all out. And we're going to be talking about a lot of this stuff in the actual chat, but there's a couple things there that are worth maybe drilling in on a little bit. One is just the impact that writing on the internet can have on someone's career. This one post I imagine had a lot of impact on the trajectory of your career. Is there something you could share there? Is that true?\n\nIan McAllister (00:05:45):\nYeah, it did. And there's another post, I think it was before this one, someone just asked about Amazon's product development process and so I wrote about the working backwards process. Which isn't my process. I just used it and just described it and just kind of caught on a little bit there as well. I think those two, and then I started to write more about people management and product management. And I think the value for me was so awesome just to make connections with people in the industry and it felt like this is, I guess, the 2010 or something like this where a lot of Amazon people I of thought were just so 100% heads down. It was a little bit of a secretive culture, not maybe like Apple, but it was pretty private. But I was interested in the startup community and product in general and so I think I spent a little time trying to engage with folks and I just made so many great connections and relationships from this.\n\nIan McAllister (00:06:39):\nI remember interacting with you and getting to know Joebot and other folks at Airbnb early on even before I joined. But obviously I'd credit this work and those relationships for me ultimately going there and so many great relationships and people I've met because of it. And aside from just the little positive feedback, I mean people tweet at me periodically, be like, \"Hey, by the way, just love this post,\" and whatever. And so it's super gratifying.\n\nLenny (00:07:03):\nYou mentioned a little bit about your background and we're about to get into that and I want you to share all the things you've done. But the other piece there that I think is interesting that comes up again and again in the power of writing is it often just starts with you trying to collect your thoughts and putting it out there and ends up, wow, so many people find that valuable and it spreads. And so that's just a really simple way of thinking about if you're starting to write online, just summarize something that you've been thinking about that you want to just crystallize in your own head. There's this quote that's probably falsely attributed to Mark Twain and Hemingway often of just like, I don't know what I've thought until I've written it down. And that's super true with these things and so that's a good example of this.\n\nIan McAllister (00:07:42):\nAnd I think with any kind of writing, it was probably less structured initially, but I would, partially because I was trying to share something for an external audience, try to just organize it and make it compact and not too wordy or rambling. And I think business writing, I spent a lot of that time doing that at Amazon, is so valuable because you've got to be a clear thinker to be a clear communicator. And so there's two tests in writing well or communicating well. It's both those things. So I found it's pretty valuable in kind of sharpening your ax.\n\nLenny (00:08:15):\nSo these are the two things we're going to focus our chat on is what makes a top 1% product manager and then the Amazon way of working and especially working backwards. So these are all good cues for where we're going. But before we get there, can you just spend just a minute giving us a sense of some of the wonderful things you've done in your career and what you're up to now?\n\nIan McAllister (00:08:31):\nWell, I can tell you what I have done. I'll let others decide what's wonderful or not. So after doing finance and economics in school, I made the logical choice and I got a job doing marketing in the beer industry and then the next logical choice, I moved to Tokyo and I bootstrapped my way into software development without knowing Japanese or software development. Did that for a few years, came back to the states working as a developer at a startup and then kind of a midsize company and then moved to Microsoft as a program manager, pretty much a product manager. The same thing there in that role. Learned some good stuff and then made a connection with Amazon and moved there 2006. And that was really the start of when I think about building my product toolbox and leadership toolbox. So few different things I did over 12 years, a few years in retail and conversion.\n\nIan McAllister (00:09:22):\nI then moved in traffic and direct traffic loyalty when I created Amazon Smile. The role in Alexa. I led Alexa International, so scaling Alexa and Echo to six more countries. And the last role in delivery experience and operations. So I led a number of different programs there and then recently joined Uber where I'm a senior director of product and tech for vehicles. So that means everything, all the tools that help fleets and rental companies make their vehicles accessible to Uber drivers so they can earn. Sustainability tech and electrification, our vehicle platform, and then creating a path for autonomous vehicles to come onto the platform. And that's it.\n\nLenny (00:10:03):\nAmazing. I just realized this one thread through your career is autonomy and AI a little bit, right? With Alexa and then with Uber, with these autonomous cars stuff you're working on now. Is that something realized or is that an accident?\n\nIan McAllister (00:10:18):\nWell, I mean I guess you could connect those things. Obviously both are machine learning, AI. The way I think about it is that I've done a whole bunch of different lifetimes, especially around eCommerce, and so it allows me to cover the gamut. Plus, I guess I forgot to mention the time at Airbnb working with Joebot and you and Vlad and Dan and Shirley and there was focused on building out the customer support technology platform. So that's another part of the eCommerce platform. Covers the gamut.\n\nLenny (00:10:45):\nI forgot to bring that up too. I'm glad you touched on that.\n\nIan McAllister (00:10:48):\nI don't know how I missed that. I guess I skipped past that with the Amazon stuff.\n\nLenny (00:10:50):\nThe most transformative time getting to work together.\n\nIan McAllister (00:10:53):\nThat was awesome. That was awesome. I learned a lot from you too during that time.\n\nLenny (00:10:56):\nWhat a time. This is a good time to chat about, speaking of Airbnb and all that, to chat about what makes a top 1% product manager. So I know your post was really titled what separates a 1% PM from a 10% PM, but it feels like it's even broader, just like how do you become a top 1% product manager. And I thought maybe a good way to start here is maybe just run through the attributes that you've found over the years or here's the things that a top 1% PM needs to get great at. Maybe just run through them and then we'll talk through them in a little more detail.\n\nIan McAllister (00:11:28):\nYeah, I was going to pull up my post here so I could actually refer to it. Do you want me to go through all of them or just pick out a couple to touch on?\n\nLenny (00:11:33):\nLet's maybe just go through them quickly just to put them out there and then I'll have some follow up questions to dig into a few of them.\n\nIan McAllister (00:11:40):\nAll right, sounds good. Well, the way I listed it at the time, think big. Always want to hunt for bigger impact. Communicate, I think we'll probably touch on that a little bit. It's super important for PMs as a test of their thinking and their communication. Simplify. How you can do more with less and have more impact. Simplifying is a great way to do that. Prioritize. That's I think the core skill after communication of a PM and there's so many different lenses to view that. Let's see here. Forecasting and measuring. I think that it's really important. What separates product managers from consultants sometimes is you forecast and then you execute and then you measure and validate and that helps you build your instincts. Just obviously the core execution of just shipping and doing what you said you do. Understanding technical trade offs is that you don't have to be a software engineer to be a great PM, but the more you learn about technical trade offs, not just product and customer trade offs, that will help you simplify and get more yield out of your resources.\n\nIan McAllister (00:12:40):\nUnderstanding good design. If you're working on anything customer focused, that's always going to help you think in the mind of a customer or user. You don't need to design, but the more you understand helps. Writing effective copy. This goes a long way not to get close and not to sub out the copy to somebody else, but to get good at communicating with a couple words to your customers. That's a great skill. Those were the ones that I wrote at the time, I guess 10 years ago, and then I refreshed the post recently in my newsletter. And I added a couple new ones honestly, because as I reflected back, there was a few that I think a lot about these days that I missed the first time around. Earn trust with others. That's so important as a PM, but especially if you're going to grow as a product leader becomes even more important.\n\nIan McAllister (00:13:29):\nAnd I think trust is the currency of a product manager and a product leader, especially if you're going to grow in your career. Digging for data. It's out there and you got to develop the tools to go find it. Not to depend on your analyst or what's in the reports today. So that's a really important skill for anyone in product. And probably the more junior you are, the more important it is as you're really in the weeds there building product. Pushing back effectively. This is an art and a skill, but I think your ability to do this is pretty correlated with your ability to grow and succeed as a leader. Because if you say yes to everything, you're going to go nowhere. Adapting to change. How you react to change will obviously impact one, your mood and your morale, as well as how effectively you can rally yourself, your team. And then driven by impact, not promotion. Ultimately that's what you want to wake up every day thinking about how to have an impact for your business and that will be an indicator on your likelihood of promotion. So do that instead of just focusing on how to get promoted and having that guide your day.\n\nLenny (00:14:33):\nAwesome. So it's a long list. There's a lot that a PM needs to be good at, which I think if you're a PM you already know. It's a wild, crazy, impossible job to have everything nailed down. And at the end of this post even mention you've never met a 1% PM that does all these things. And I think that's important. No one's going to be the best at all these things. And so just to drill down a little bit and get a little more focused. Say you're a new product manager. Of these, I forget how many there, maybe 10, 12, what are the top three that you think new PMs should get most good at and focus on?\n\nIan McAllister (00:15:06):\nProbably communicate, prioritize, and execute. I think those are just the core building blocks. Other ones will be more important as you grow and become more senior, but those ones, no matter where you are in your product career I think are super important. Being a better communicator is something I've been working on my entire product career and I'll be working on until the day I stop. And I remember years ago I was at Microsoft, my first effectively product manager role and my product unit manager, Thomas, came by the office and I think he asked me, \"When is this going to ship?\" And I was like, \"Well, this thing is taking a little bit longer here and this other thing and yada yada.\" And I gave a bunch of background, but I didn't really answer the question. And I got a little feedback from him like, that's not really the ... Ultimately he's waiting for a date.\n\nIan McAllister (00:15:53):\nAnd so I just reflected on that and that was, as I remember, my journey to try to be a better communicator over time and I'm still on it. When I went to Amazon, I worked for Kim Rackmiller who was our, I think at the time, SVP for Worldwide Discovery. And I think she was Amazon's first TPM. And she was tough but super smart. And so that was also an early experience to learn from her. And sometimes you get some feedback when you didn't really answer the question. And my first boss, Russell and I organized and started to gather this thing called the Book of Kim. And so we would gather these best practices that we learned from her elsewhere. Avoid weasel words, answer first and then explain, own your problems. And started building this.\n\nIan McAllister (00:16:36):\nAnd then I extended that over time and added a bunch more and wrote a post called the Operators Manual. I tried to gather all these things together. But it's such an important thing and the stakes get higher as you work with more and more senior people. But if you can get in the habit early of answering a when question with a date, knowing how to use numbers to answer questions and honestly just learning from feedback and grade yourself after you get feedback on a doc or after a meeting or after answering a question in an elevator. And if you try to say, \"Gosh, how could I have done that better?,\" and then try to get better, you can. And you can go far if you just focus on that and all the other 150 skills of a product manager, but if you don't have that, it's unlikely that you're going to really go too far in your product career.\n\nIan McAllister (00:17:24):\nSo that was communicate. I guess prioritize as the next one. And so I think this is the number one key tool of a product manager is prioritization. Because so many things come from being good at prioritizing. And it's not just what project do you do next or do you do this project or that project. There's so many different dimensions to prioritization. There's which themes are you going to prioritize in a roadmap and which projects within a theme and how are you going to sequence those projects, how much of a project you're going to build. And also just time management is also a prioritization function. Like what are you going to choose to spend your time on? Which things are you going to really go all out to make great and which things are you going to starve for attention or just not do? Given the same amount of skill intelligence and resources, a product manager with a great innate ability to prioritize is going to generate 5X the impact of someone without that skill.\n\nIan McAllister (00:18:18):\nMy early, if you could call it success at Amazon, I think was completely dependent. It wasn't because I worked smarter or I was smarter, I worked longer hours or I was more technical than other people. I think it was just because I was one, super hungry for impact. And if there was a number or a metric that measured success at the business I was running, I wanted that to go up and to the right. Not to hit a goal, but just to go as far and as fast up to the right as possible. And if anything, it was just working with a team to hone in on the projects that would do that with the greatest leverage and just marshaling all the team's resources. So that was a good start. That was a fit with Amazon in terms of working backwards from a fitness function or a metric.\n\nIan McAllister (00:19:01):\nAnd so did that with the first team I was there and then again later managed the gifting business. And so it just was one skill that I think helped me as well as make up for maybe some deficiencies I'd had. I don't have the biggest brain in the world and I don't have the biggest working memory and I wasn't the most technical, but by trying to really get good at that prioritization, I think that's helped me and it still does.\n\nIan McAllister (00:19:23):\nI think execute is the third one, which is no surprise that every PM has to execute. And I think assuming you prioritize well then execution means sort of molding what you want to build into a simple compact package that has the highest impact possible. And then also execution's a big function of the team you're working with. So it's your designers and your data science folks, and especially your engineers.\n\nIan McAllister (00:19:47):\nSo anything to do with how well they're doing their jobs or how well they're resourced or whether they're getting better and better at every sprint, you have some amount of ownership in helping make that happen because that directly impacts your team's ability to execute and ultimately your reputation as well for being able to execute. The drive that goes into execution, product managers are the mode of power behind execution and impact. And if you stall out or you don't do your job, the project's probably going to stall out as well. And so you're the ones, especially with a TPM, if you're lucky enough to have one in the back of the ship, kind of beating the drum and driving everyone forward. But again, lots of people have written a lot of stuff about execution and there's a lot to it, but I think those are probably the three I'd focus on.\n\nLenny (00:20:32):\nAwesome. And what's interesting about these three is if you look at the rest of the list, think big, understand technical trade offs, understand good design, I think what I would take away from this is those are the things you don't need to focus on that much when you're a new PM. Focus on, as you said, communication, prioritizing, executing. Focus less on these other things because later they'll become more and more important and obviously learn as much as you can, but it's almost bit easier to think about the things you don't need to stress about when you're starting out.\n\nIan McAllister (00:21:02):\nYeah, I think that makes sense. If there's a core or think about in year one as a PM, focusing on those things. And you can develop other skills over time. But yeah, I think you're spot on there.\n\nLenny (00:21:14):\nIf we were to go back through these three, just maybe as a last question, and you may not have an answer to this, but if you think about communicating, prioritizing, and executing, is there one tactical thing you could suggest that a PM listening to this can do to get better at one of these things? Is there a trick you've learned of, wow, this is one way you could level up communicating, executing, prioritizing or not?\n\nIan McAllister (00:21:37):\nThe closest thing to a checklist, the post I mentioned, the Operator's Manual, that was the closest thing to, if you do these things, these specific actions, I think it'll go a long way. Because a lot of them are guided around not doing the easy pitfalls and communication mistakes like rambling. If you're asked a question and you explain and then maybe you get to the answer, if you just think, answer and then explain or sometimes answer and then shut up, that actually is a tactical thing you can do to get better at communicating. And there's some other tips in there as well. So that was my attempt to try to encode, to take some of the ones that we gathered early at Amazon, add some more. The others are ... Yeah. There's no just simple trick unfortunately to prioritize other than ... I mean I think working backwards is a good technique to have impact to guide your prioritization. And that is something where it's not a simple tip, but there's a set of practices and behaviors that you can do that will ultimately lead you to prioritize better.\n\nLenny (00:22:39):\nAwesome. We'll talk about all that.\n\nIan McAllister (00:22:40):\nAnd then I think communication, the simple tip was just grade yourself after you communicate and try to just take a moment and after a while you'll just do it naturally to think about, \"Gosh, how would I have answered that question better?\" And so the next time you could try to answer that question better and it's just a continuous improvement process.\n\nLenny (00:22:58):\nOr maybe even ask your manager, \"Hey, what could I have done better in terms of how I communicated in that last meeting or that last email?\"\n\nIan McAllister (00:23:04):\nYeah, absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nLenny (00:23:06):\nOkay, so then coming at it from the other direction, say you're a senior PM, what are three of these attributes that you would suggest folks focus on to get better and level up in their career?\n\nIan McAllister (00:23:17):\nGosh, it's still communicate, to be honest. I think that's the one at every level of product, just the stakes are higher. I think think big is one for sure. There was a phrase I think Warren Buffett in the Berkshire Hathaway letter used at some point. Was at our scale we got to hunt for bigger elephants. And so I think at any scale as a PM, whatever your idea is or whatever your solution or the problem you're solving, take a minute at the beginning to say, could this be bigger? Could this be a bigger thing and more impactful than the initial idea, even if the initial idea sounds big? So that's a tool and that's often where I'd start when my PMs were sharing an idea is I'd try to expand it to the degree it might be expanded, think about it from that perspective and then maybe you want to still start small, but with a bigger vision in mind.\n\nIan McAllister (00:24:04):\nEarn trust is a huge one and that's kind of why I added it more recently. And it becomes even more important as you get into senior roles because I think it's truly the currency of a product leader or probably any leader in any function. Because if you want to ask for more resources to do something bigger, if your leadership doesn't trust you to use those resources well or do what you said you're going to do, you're probably not going to get them. But if you've built trust that you're a good steward of resources and you make a lot of impact with a given team, that's directly going to correlate with your ability to gain more resources. Trust is just built by repeatedly setting and meeting expectations. And I think that's a good mantra to think about as a FM. Am I meeting the expectations that I set? And not just doing good things, but calling your shots, forecasting, setting a goal, and then hitting it.\n\nIan McAllister (00:24:54):\nAnd if you do that repeatedly, you're going to be in pretty good shape. And there's so many practices as a product manager or product leader that build trust. You tell the truth without fail. And you launch when you say you'd launch and you launch what you said you'd launch and you own your mistakes. And then the other practices just lose trust. If you lie or if you're evasive, if you don't ship what you said you're going to do, if you ignore your mistakes or you repeat them. And so I think just simply having high standards for yourself and think of trust as that currency, that's going to correlate well as a PM, as a GPM or director of product in any level, that's the thing that you want to build.\n\nLenny (00:25:34):\nSo thinking big, building trust. Was there a third?\n\nIan McAllister (00:25:37):\nI think maybe the last one, which is certainly relevant for a PM but is really true as well, is driven by impact. And if you forget about everything else, forget about politics, forget about promotion or having a bigger org or whatever, if you simply wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact you can, or if you're a leader trying to use your team to have the biggest impact you can in the company, which will influence how you build your roadmap and how you do every part of your day, that's a really good guiding light. And I remember in my first 10 years at Amazon, just naturally not because I thought about it, I was just hungry to have an impact. Take my business, grow it as fast as possible. I wasn't maybe loosely thinking about promotion, but I wasn't thinking about it. I never talked to my manager about it and I wasn't bringing it up. I was just focused on taking my book of business and making it bigger. And then the net result was I was promoted several times and I did grow in my role, but that wasn't what drove me. It was just the impact.\n\nLenny (00:26:38):\nWould you say that driving impact is more important for a new PM or senior PM? It feels like impact is the soup within which all PMs swim and that's constantly important, but it's interesting that you mostly put that into the latter part of a career. Do you feel like with new PMs on your team you're less expecting them to think about impact and focus on impact?\n\nIan McAllister (00:27:01):\nWell, I mean I think for junior PMs, if you're a brand new PM, then yeah, you want to have an impact, but you're really just ... You have a project or a feature to ship or something like that and you're often not necessarily given a lot of latitude to build your own roadmap. But you're asked to ship this. So you want to spec it, you want to execute and do it. But increasingly as you grow, there are opportunities to sense out and try to have a bigger impact maybe and then start to influence prioritization or roadmaps. It's just that the expectations, it goes from being a nice to have as a junior or first time PM to as you get a little more senior, hopefully if things work the way they should work, that's really how you're evaluated. Yes, you want to treat your team well and you want to do a whole bunch of other things, but take two people, one has a massive impact on the business and one who doesn't, then the right way to work should be that first person should be the one that grows and develops and is tasked and with bigger challenges just because if you're impactful at a bigger challenge, that's even more important for the business. So I think that's a good way to think about the flywheel of product leadership.\n\nLenny (00:28:11):\nIt feels like a lot of times you get lucky as a new PM. You work on a project that ends up having a lot of impact that you didn't necessarily drive. You just happen to work on something that, wow, this was a huge deal and that feels like an important thing to optimize for a little in your early career is work on something that's likely to have a lot of impact even if you're not responsible for setting the strategy and prioritizing.\n\nIan McAllister (00:28:29):\nWell, I think that's true if you have a choice in where you work in product. If you have a choice to work on something that's part of offense, something that drives the business. And it's true that executives wake up if something drives dollars or customers or offense things and it just maybe shouldn't be this way, but a little less interested in things that maybe less than a risk that just the risk never happens, it comes to pass or a cost center that operates a little more efficiently. So that it's one lens where that might relate to your success. I think also who you work for. And I think most of us don't get to choose that especially early in our career. It either works out in your favor and which is great and that was the case for me, especially at Amazon, some of the leaders I worked with. But sometimes it doesn't. But I think the more that you can suss out who you work for because then the better they are at these skills and prioritizing, one, they're just going to be a better teacher and a better role model to learn from. So I think that's an important thing to think about in any kind of job change.\n\nLenny (00:29:30):\nTo close the loop on this piece for more senior PMs, the skills to focus on, you said, thinking big, building trust and driving impact. I'll put you on the spot. I'll give you two options, two directions to go with this. One is if you want to get better at each of these three things, do you have any one thing someone could do or what does great look like for thinking big or building trust or driving impact? Those are two options.\n\nIan McAllister (00:29:58):\nThat was six questions there Lenny. Let me see here what I'm answering. Well, I think the think big one is interesting and one way to think about thinking big, especially as you grow in your career is most people operate within a box. There's a box of there's product management and these are the things that product managers do. And you basically build a roadmap and you prioritize features and you work with eng. And so that might be the typical kind of product scope and tech. Most of my roles were ones where I was kind of a GM but a really product focused GM and so I naturally found myself taking a much wider view of what product is across disciplines. And I was lucky enough that I had engineering teams and marketers and analysts and other folks and so that helped me. But I think as a PM you can still do that, even if those functions don't report to you, is take that really wide view of what success for your product is and not have the blinders on its product or tech.\n\nIan McAllister (00:30:58):\nIt's anything. It's anything that influences the success and your customers' success or anything else. And it just means, you don't own marketing or you don't own this other function, but you own it until you find somebody else to own it. And so that's not necessarily thinking big in terms of scale or whatever, but in terms of how you think about your role as a PM and what your ownership responsibility is. And so I think just the more that you ... You don't want to get over your skis as a PM and then you're trying to change your CFO's mind about something necessarily. But the more you grow, that you have to increasingly do that and find the constraints or barriers to your success or your product success and knock them down no matter what they are.\n\nLenny (00:31:43):\nYeah. It makes me think about just the advice of think like an owner, think beyond just your one little bubble, think about the broader business outside of the one little product you might be working on. So that's great advice.\n\nLenny (00:31:55):\nThis episode is brought to you by Assembly AI.

My wife Sarah is a product manager in AWS and so as I've mentored her a little bit in her career and I've seen how this is really a superpower for her, it really made me reflect like, what are the things I could have done better in different roles to earn trust more? And it's not just the basic things like to be honest and tell two different people the same thing versus different things. I think it's trying to really understand, work backwards from that person and what are their goals and what are their organization's goals and honestly spend the time and the energy to try to get to alignment in the same place.\n\nIan McAllister (00:34:09):\nAnd be willing, not just bullheaded, which I might have been earlier in my career, maybe still to many people, but charging forth what do I think's right but taking some more time to try to forge an alliance with someone because if you do that you're ultimately going to be more successful. So that was just one that I was probably slow to recognize the importance of and I'm trying to catch up now.\n\nLenny (00:34:30):\nIs there a story that comes to mind where you look back and I should have earned trust there or I broke some trust here that you'd be willing to share?\n\nIan McAllister (00:34:39):\nWhen I was working with you and the team at Airbnb, I think this is one where Joebot brought me on to help build out the customer support technology platform maybe more how Amazon would do it. To maintain a high level of quality but to become more efficient as well and to reduce the cost so that Airbnb wouldn't have to scale customer support this to the same degree the business was scaling. And so trying to build a new team and develop and I was pretty heads down doing it the way I thought it should be done and working with the team there in terms of let's get a strong analytics framework. Let's measure all these things and really understand what's going on at the data level and then let's use the same prioritization muscles that had made me successful at Amazon to prioritize things that were best worked backwards.\n\nIan McAllister (00:35:26):\nAnd I think that what I didn't do as much as I should have is obviously really partnering with the customer support leadership team as well. That was something where I think in some ways it felt like we were in alignment and getting on stage together and stuff, but it turned out I maybe hadn't spent as much time and effort on that as I thought to build that true support there such that that leader would rally the organization around it as well and we'd be marching in the same beat. And so that was something that I would reflect. Now, I think the team did amazing things and Shirley really carrying the torch there in the entire team and so accomplished a lot. But that was a learning about ... Going back, I probably would've spent more time and really tried to do even more on that.\n\nLenny (00:36:12):\nThanks for sharing that. I never knew that story. And it sounds like the takeaway there is maybe don't take for granted the leadership team, the team that'll actually be using the product. Is that a roughly way to think about it?\n\nIan McAllister (00:36:23):\nWell I would say that if you have a certain approach you may be believe it's the right one and it may be the right one, but if you don't build the support and the relationships that they're going to help carry that out and execute on that strategy, it may not get executed as well as you think it should be. And so that's an important part of success. It's a risk that you have to mitigate. And trying to earn trust and to do it that way is a way to mitigate that risk that the right product and the right direction and the right strategy, it may not land if you don't have that support that you need. And so that I think was my learning.\n\nLenny (00:37:00):\nWhat better way to learn a lesson than get some wrong and then you never forget it again.\n\nIan McAllister (00:37:06):\nYou could call it getting wrong. Just think of something I could have done better. And just that same continuous improvement mindset. It's to everything, every role, every experience, every project, every communication. And if you build that muscle to try to do it better the next time and also just the try to be a little self aware about what could have gone better, then I think it's a really good muscle to build.\n\nLenny (00:37:27):\nThis is a good segue to the second area of where our chat is going to go, which is Amazon and things you've learned about just the working backwards process. How many years did you say you worked at Amazon total?\n\nIan McAllister (00:37:38):\n12 years.\n\nLenny (00:37:39):\n12 years. It feels like everyone that worked at Amazon is 10 years or more. It's these large numbers. So they must be doing something right and I don't know. What do you think that is actually? Why do people stay there so long? It's amazing.\n\nIan McAllister (00:37:52):\nWhat's interesting about Amazon, and it's changed over time, is that I think pretty quickly whether you're a fit for it or not. And it can be kind of a crucible and a little spartan. And it just clicked with me though because I'm kind of a structured thinker and right brain. And so this idea that hey, I could have this business and then figure out one metric or fitness function that determines success and then my job is to make that number go up and to the right. That kind of fit with me. And then I rewired my brain probably over the first 10 years around this concept and I just felt like I was learning, I was not only working with smart people that were driven, which was true at Microsoft as well, but there was kind of this DNA in the organization and this wiring that I thought was really effective and it just kind of clicked with me.\n\nIan McAllister (00:38:44):\nAnd so I molded myself to the environment and at every step of the way I felt like I was learning and growing and one of the benefits for me is you get a chance to learn from so many other people in these different settings. You get the chance to read documents that make you learn more so than probably a slide deck. You get a chance to be in weekly business reviews with really smart people and learn from that. Not just learn from your own experience but from everyone else in that room. So I was just a sponge and so much learning happening that I think propelled my career. And so that was why, especially the first 10 years, that it was so fantastic of just growing and feeling yourself build these new muscles and develop these new tools and I loved it. So that was why I stayed so long and obviously Airbnb then, it was the time to try something new, which was a great experience and kind of a test. I was in Seattle and the company was in San Francisco and spending three days on a road each week was a good learning and ultimately a reason to come back and be Seattle based. But then I chose Amazon again because it was still a great place and I thought I could continue to learn.\n\nLenny (00:39:52):\nAwesome. I was going to mention they drew you back in. So yeah, that's pretty rare. What did you learn from folks like Jeff Bezos and Jeff Wilke about building product leadership, company building? What's stuck with you working with folks like?\n\nIan McAllister (00:40:04):\nI would say two very different people but complimented themselves so well. I didn't have hundreds of meetings with Jeff Bezos while I was there, but I did have a chance, especially in the development of Amazon Smile and then early when I started the social team to have some of those meetings where I wrote the doc and it was Jeff and 10 other people reviewing. The process of doing, even before hitting on Amazon Smile, it was really kind of a innovation process I guess you could call it, where we had a goal in mind to increase customers' loyalty to Amazon, their direct traffic loyalty, not in the way Prime did, which is a paid program, but to try to come up with another program or way in which customers might start their shopping on Amazon instead of elsewhere. And so I was running the gifting business. I moved over to the traffic org to try to come up with a new program with no team or anything.\n\nIan McAllister (00:40:58):\nAnd then I would meet with Jeff Bezos and Wilke and others every couple months and I would profile a couple different options and use the working backwards process and we'd review some facts. And so there was a bunch of learnings throughout that process. One, I found Jeff to be super encouraging. And each time we'd leave one of those meetings, we maybe didn't find the thing in that meeting. We'd talk about it and brainstorm a little bit, but he would always leave and be encouraging and with a quote. One time he was like, \"Remember, this process doesn't have to be efficient because the prerequisite for efficiency is knowing where you're going.\" And then he'd leave the room and whatever. So I found the rhetoric around Jeff or blowing up or whatever, I didn't find any of that and I found him to be super encouraging and he found all these times to help train me in the working backwards process.\n\nIan McAllister (00:41:52):\nThere was a time when I came with a press release for a concept and it didn't have a problem paragraph. I'd skipped that. And he reviewed it and so forth and he was like, \"You know what, maybe if you don't have a problem paragraph, there's not really a problem.\" And so it was kind of a little lesson to me like, \"Yeah, maybe that is why I did it. I wasn't really working backwards, I kind of had the solution in mind and so I'd skipped over that part.\" So that was one just very specific learning about the process from Jeff. So Jeff Wilke, I probably learned more from Wilke just because I had more exposure over my time there. At one point he was my skip level. And I have such tremendous respect for Wilke or Jaw as he was called internally because he was sort of the consummate operator.\n\nIan McAllister (00:42:34):\nThis muscle that I think you learn working at Amazon about being an operator, whether you're ... You're not in operations, but any part of the business that I think came from him. And I think it was due to him that Amazon developed that muscle. And I think it's one way that separates some Amazon PMs from people who haven't worked there in that environment and that continuous improvement mindset. That's so important. And one of the forums that was a great learning was the WBR or Weekly Business Review. Or later called Consumer Business Review. So this was a forum where Jeff would lead the meeting. It would be a series of metrics for different parts of the business. Everywhere from fulfillment to customer support, to traffic to category teams to programs. And I would present on Amazon Smile there. And the way he would run that meeting and enable you to get through a metrics meeting for the entire North American retail business in one hour.\n\nIan McAllister (00:43:27):\nAnd the way he ran that meeting would lead all those leaders to build these muscles because you wanted to be prepared to speak to the variances or trends in your business in a key metric and know your business and know what you were doing based on that thing. And so just this hour a week of probing and asking questions and everyone ... There might be a hundred people in that room prepared to answer questions about your business. And it had this cascading effect that not only was I or the leaders there on the spot having to answer a question and being prepared, but then I would do the same thing with my team, et cetera. And so I was trying to build those muscles in my team such that they could bring their insights and understanding and actions on things in this cascading effect. So that was a mechanism, which is another really big thing at Amazon that led to all these amazing behaviors.\n\nIan McAllister (00:44:17):\nAnd I think a lot of those mechanisms came from Jeff Wilke or he created an environment where they would be developed throughout the organization and then propagated. And so that was one thing, just that operational mindset and rigor that being a product leader is not just about building new things, it's about how well you run what you've already built. And if you're really paying attention to the product that you operate, it will give you ideas for things you could do to double down on something that's happening well or to prevent something bad happening. And I think that's been a very key reason for Amazon's scale. Another thing I really respect about Jeff Wilke, and I think Doug Harrington has some of this as well, is the notion of a little bit of tough love. And I think that's important and that neither were assholes, but sometimes, and especially Wilke, you need to get that look kind of like your dad might look over his glasses at you and be like, \"Hey.\"\n\nIan McAllister (00:45:15):\nAnd so I think that was kind of the vibe that you would get. It was professional, it was respectful, but sometimes everyone needs a little kick in the ass and I think that was something, but it almost builds more respect from him and just incredible leaderly behavior, which I really respect and I try to model and I try to do the same because I respected it so much. And then I guess the last attribute of Wilke, which I really saw was teaching. And it wasn't just saying this is the right thing or this is what my decision is in a meeting, but teaching the why and the pattern, the mental model that informs him to think this is the right thing. And so I think he was just great at teaching, taking a moment. It might just take 10 seconds in a meeting to teach.\n\nIan McAllister (00:46:01):\nAnd that's something that I've forgotten at different parts of my career, especially as you get more experienced and you know the right decision to do and you know what you want, whatever, that may be the right thing, but I think you'll have a lot more lasting effect if you could abstract it to a degree and teach the lesson. Because then that person will hopefully learn the lesson and can apply it to a bunch of future situations and also understand the why more. And it helps them sometimes disagree and commit more so than just being given prescriptive advice.\n\nLenny (00:46:33):\nSounds like it must have been an incredible experience learning from these two. Thanks for sharing all that. I want to get to the working backwards stuff. I feel like we've talked about this a lot. We've talked about this on other podcasts with other guests. I feel like people understand the general idea. Yeah, Amazon works backwards. They write a PR. Maybe there's a six pager thing they do. But I feel like there's not a lot of, here's how actually do this thing. And so just to spend a little time on this, when you see teams trying to work backwards and be like, \"Let's work backwards. We're going to be like Amazon.\", what do you find they do wrong when they're actually trying to implement this idea of working backwards? What's the most common mistake do you find?\n\nIan McAllister (00:47:11):\nWell, working backwards is all about the problem and starting there and obsessing about the problem and being guided by it to then go into the solution. So when teams that do it wrong is they don't do that. They don't work backwards. They have something they want to build. These things look similar. These two technologies or whatever. We could combine them and then do this. And if you say we could and it's not grounded in a customer or customer's problem, you're not working backwards. And then you may use \"the working backwards process\", but you already have the solution. And so you're adding the problem after the solution. You're retrofitting the problem, retrofitting the customer. And so that I think is the number one thing is that they don't get the importance of truly starting with the problem that you're trying to solve and being faithful to that working backwards from the problem.\n\nIan McAllister (00:48:03):\nWhen I first started at Amazon and community, we had this business of automated merchandising using community content, and that was the core thing we were doing is to grow that. But there was this Jeff idea that a team was super excited about. Because I think in some meeting he'd kind of sketched it out or whatever. And so that there was already all this momentum to build this thing that was actually a Jeff project, but I should have known at the time, in hindsight I do, because the name they had for this project was ASIN to ASIN linking. And ASIN was the identifier for a product on Amazon. And so it was kind of this not working backwards idea ultimately of if you could link to products by a subjected attributes and then you could build a feature around it that allowed customers to vote on these things and then it would be kind of ...\n\nIan McAllister (00:48:50):\nSo in spirit, it really wasn't working backwards. But the team was all excited and so we eventually wrote the press release and we did it. And it turned out, it wasn't successful. We ended up shutting it down later. And so I learned a lot, this was the first year or two at Amazon, about using the working backwards process but not really working backwards. And so that's literally, if I'm reviewing a working backwards press release or fact, or even talking with someone about a new initiative, my brain is wired now to not be able to process any information until I focus on the problem and the customer. And then once we start talking about that, then I can engage and literally work backwards to say, okay, how do we solve that problem? And what's the most elegant way to solve it? Or if there's three problems, what's number one or two or three? So it's probably a gap in me that I can't process information without working backwards from the problem, but I find it to be helpful when people do that.\n\nLenny (00:49:47):\nSo when people talk about working backwards, the way you're describing it is interesting where it's focused on start with the problem, which I think generally product teams try to do. Their one pagers their PRDs often have, here's the problem we're solving, here's why it's a problem, here's how we think about ... Is that the core of working backwards? I always imagined it was the launch release and the PR thing and maybe the FAQ. Working backwards at Uber and other and Airbnb, do you actually do that for every project yourself at this point?\n\nIan McAllister (00:50:17):\nThere's two parts of it. One, there's the concept of working backwards from what you're trying to accomplish. And I still absolutely do that with my teams as well. What are we trying to accomplish for the business or accomplish for a customer and let's start there. And if they have a problem that is interfering with their ability to be profitable for their ability, if it's a business customer or it's a customer trying to accomplish a goal, starting with that problem. That's different from the working backwards mechanism, which is the press release and the FAQ, which was the mechanism that Amazon used to enforce working backwards, which I think is effective. And I've tried to teach that and write some posts about with templates and things like that because it's a great way to start of the press release has a paragraph about the problem. That's what you write.\n\nIan McAllister (00:51:00):\nAnd then you write the solution paragraph and then the customer quote. And then the fact which is is there a legitimate plan to succeed? So if you don't have that muscle to work backwards already and your team, it's a great thing to try, but that's not the only mechanism that can do it. And eventually if you do it enough and you build that muscle to work backwards, you can do it in any number of formats, whether it's something in a PRD or some other way. But the key is that you don't think what we could build, you think about the problem and then the solution that solves that problem.\n\nLenny (00:51:35):\nGot it. Okay. So the press release is not core to it. It's like a trick to get you to think about the problem you're solving. It's not how you plant announce it.\n\nIan McAllister (00:51:42):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:51:43):\nInteresting. I never thought about it that way. So when you're doing this process at other places outside Amazon, say you're a product leader that's trying to ... I want to improve the way we think about product. What is it that you suggest they do specifically? Is it write out, here's the problem we're solving? Is there more to it? What would you suggest there?\n\nIan McAllister (00:52:02):\nIf it's a blank slate, truly, you could certainly use the working backwards process like Amazon does with the internal press release and then the fact and so forth. So that's fine. But a lot of companies have a different way they go about it. Some companies are very much, it's slide culture and presentations and so forth. And so as a product leader you could think about what you do with your team and what you do upwards or across. And so you may have the latitude to use any process with your team. And I've done that at some companies where using documents and if they're supportive of the team and they recognize the value of that, like, oh actually this is good and this is a great way to write things down on paper and to have better information content and richer discussion that oftentimes I think people will find that versus a slide with a couple bullets is not great. Then you can build that muscle.\n\nIan McAllister (00:52:54):\nAnd I've found it's a great way to teach and use those to dive deeper into product. But depending on the organization you're at, that may not wash to train your senior leadership to use the process you want to use. And so then it might be a matter of finding the opportunities to try something and saying, \"Are you open to doing something this way?\" A review of a doc instead of a review of a whatever. So that's a little separate than just working backwards, but I think you just have to acknowledge the environment you're in. And also, unless the organization has a specific format to do this. If it does, you probably just need to use it. Different leaders process information, different ways. You may find one format's effective with your leader, but another one to educate a broader organization. But it's very company specific. So despite what I might want to do, I've just got to recognize that I have more leverage down with my team versus up or across.\n\nLenny (00:53:51):\nIs there a template that you use consistently? Is that something that you've published of how to frame the problem, how to frame all these other elements?\n\nIan McAllister (00:54:00):\nI have shared posts on, I know for sure LinkedIn and I probably should put it on the newsletter, on my newsletter, that's a working backwards template and some posts about how to do the process or tips on how Amazon does the process. And so I'll make sure to put those up on my newsletter as well. And the template's free. Obviously anyone could just copy it and grab it.\n\nLenny (00:54:19):\nAwesome. We'll link to that in show notes. Definitely send that to me after we wrap this thing. And I was going to ask, does Amazon work backwards on every product they work on/do you suggest working backwards in every feature and product?\n\nIan McAllister (00:54:33):\nI think there's some scale below which it doesn't probably make sense to do this process because there's a little bit of overhead to it. But I think if it's a new product, absolutely. And I'm sure there's some at Amazon that don't use the process, but in general that was the way and often enforced that you need a working backwards review. Ideally that would happen at the outset, but sometimes it would be added later. And yeah, I think it's a great thing whether you use the mechanism. Again, it's a great template to start with and use if you have the flexibility to, but I think it's also possible just to have the spirit and to try to be true to the spirit of working backwards from what you're trying to do for customers and what problem. That's the most important thing. The template is just a mechanism to help ensure that happens.\n\nLenny (00:55:18):\nGot it. You mentioned a review. What is that? Working backwards review?\n\nIan McAllister (00:55:22):\nWell that would just be a meeting with leadership or other folks to review the concept, review the press release, review the FAQ and ask questions. And in some cases that would be the gate to approving it. That was the case with me and Bezos before we went off and built the team and launched Amazon Smile is I would do these reviews about different concepts and that was the one that we green lit. I mean that's often the case. It's also just a great way to educate other people about what you're trying to accomplish. Ground them in the customer problem and solution. And the FAQ is a whole nother concept. It's about the legitimate plan to succeed. One other thing that I use, I got a chance to have lunch with Jeff Bezos. It was probably back in 2008 or something like this. And I asked him, \"What's your criteria for investing in something new?\"\n\nIan McAllister (00:56:09):\nAnd he said, \"Well it's three things. One, is it a big idea? And then second, is it something we should be doing?\" So if maybe you have an idea, if you have this new way to extract oil from shale, is it a big idea? Yeah, probably could be a big idea. Is it something Amazon should be doing? Probably not. And the third test, is there a legitimate plan to succeed? And you got to have all three of those things. And I think the FAQ part of the working backwards process is that early stage legitimate test of whether this thing has a plan. Because you could have this internal press release or big idea or big idea for a solution, but the FAQ basically says, okay, I've thought through the internal components or the finances or the key technical hurdles or whatever. And so that's one that's not written about as much, how to do the FAQ, but I think it's another way to build trust that you've been thoughtful enough given the stage of the product to deserve the resources or deserve to move forward with it.\n\nLenny (00:57:03):\nThat's awesome. I feel like most PMs listening to this are going to be like, \"I always start with a problem. I'm always problem focused so I'm working backwards. So I'm good.\" Other signs of just like, no, you're not. You think you are but you're probably not doing this well. Is there a symptom of you're not actually doing this correctly?\n\nIan McAllister (00:57:23):\nThe most common thing that I see that tips me off is when they talk about something, there's different pieces in the pantry and we have these ingredients, we could put them together, we could add these two things together and make a meal out of it. And so it might be a technology, it might be a service, it might be two different things or the building blocks are there and what's enabled if you add these two building blocks together is something. But that's not really working backwards. It may be true that there's some leverage or some benefit from the company having these technologies or assets, but that to me is often the first step that these two things look similar. We combine them and it's all goodness in this new thing.\n\nIan McAllister (00:58:09):\nSo if you start talking about those things or the technology, I think that's a likely case that you're not really working backwards as opposed to the opposite is if there's a customer problem that feels compelling even before the solution, yeah, that does feel compelling. And just like with every startup out there, probably a lot of the pitches are there's a big audience and a painful problem and it's the painkiller versus the vitamin thing. And then we have a novel way to solve that. That's kind of working backwards. But more often, especially in a big company, you'll have all these ideas because you have more ingredients in the pantry of ways you could combine them and try to feed it to someone but may not be working backwards.\n\nLenny (00:58:56):\nAwesome. We're reaching about an hour chatting and so I want to let you go. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you want to share on anything we've chatted about?\n\nIan McAllister (00:59:06):\nLet's see. No. I mean I think we covered a bunch of good ground. It's been fun, but nothing particular.\n\nLenny (00:59:11):\nOkay, great. Well then we've reached our very exciting lightning round. We've got six questions here. They'll be pretty quick and easy. Whatever comes to mind, share and we'll go through them relatively quickly. Sound good?\n\nIan McAllister (00:59:22):\nAll right. Let's do it.\n\nLenny (00:59:23):\nLet's do it. What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people?\n\nIan McAllister (00:59:28):\nI say Getting Real by 37 Signals and it's specifically the chapter on epicenter design. I've shared that many, many times. You can link to it. That's definitely the most thing I've shared. For fun, The Wool Trilogy by Hugh Howey, he's probably my favorite author and a great series. And then for learning, just a recent one that I thought would be super fascinating was Energy and Civilization by Vaclav Smil. So it might not be on the best seller list, but I thought it was interesting.\n\nLenny (00:59:55):\nWhat's another favorite podcast of yours other than this one possibly?\n\nIan McAllister (00:59:59):\nI think How I Built This is really interesting just to decompose how interesting businesses and products came about. And then just because of my work, EV News Daily is a daily digest of what's going on in the electric vehicle space. So that's a very good use of my time, five minutes a day to get up to speed.\n\nLenny (01:00:18):\nVery niche. I love it. What's a favorite movie or a TV show you've recently seen?\n\nIan McAllister (01:00:24):\nYellowstone. That's definitely my favorite. Can't wait for the next season. Montana's my happy place, although I'm probably the kind of person that they rail about in the show, so it's kind of ironic. And I think the movie was Everything Everywhere All At Once. I love movies that are not predictable and I thought that was just very creative.\n\nLenny (01:00:40):\nI'm shocked by how many people on Yellowstone die. That show is just murder left and right. I was not expecting that on a ranch oriented show.\n\nIan McAllister (01:00:50):\nIt's a harsh environment.\n\nLenny (01:00:51):\nQuite harsh, turns out. Especially if you mess with the Duttons. Next question. Favorite interview question that you like to ask.\n\nIan McAllister (01:00:58):\nWhen I'm coming out of left field, I ask people at this stage in your career, what have you learned about yourself? How are you different from other people? No one's prepared for that.\n\nLenny (01:01:06):\nWhat do you look for in their answers?\n\nIan McAllister (01:01:08):\nI don't know. There's not one specific thing and there's no right answer, which maybe makes it unfair, but just maybe a little self-reflection and maybe they will have understanding their strengths and that might be a good bit of self-awareness about what makes them different, where they can harness that and that makes them a better PM or engineer or something. And so that's kind of what I'm looking for, but there's no set answer. It's more just to throw them off balance.\n\nLenny (01:01:32):\nInteresting. Favorite app right now.\n\nIan McAllister (01:01:35):\nIt's probably not too interesting, but to be honest, YouTube. It's like the eighth wander of the world and just every day I'm amazed if I want to learn about something new. A couple summers ago I had some time off and so I basically taught myself how to do woodworking and built a kitchen and other stuff. And so it's just like it continues to be this resource and this jewel that helps me grow and learn about anything.\n\nLenny (01:01:58):\nI imagine some people are watching this on YouTube right now.\n\nIan McAllister (01:02:01):\nAll right.\n\nLenny (01:02:02):\nI just read a story about an Olympic javelin thrower who learned how to do this watching YouTube. He was somewhere in, I think maybe Africa. He had no coaches around and he just watched this one other javelin guy that just shared lessons on how to do this and became incredibly good. It's insane.\n\nIan McAllister (01:02:18):\nAnd I mean, I'm old, so I didn't have this when I was growing up. I remember going to the library and sending away for a brochure in the back of a magazine and things. Learning was not so easy back then. The internet obviously was a huge resource and is, but then YouTube as well to see somebody do it. It's also interesting to see somebody live. So anyway, I'm a fan.\n\nLenny (01:02:40):\nFinal question. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader, someone you look up to?\n\nIan McAllister (01:02:46):\nI say Gibson Biddle. I think that he is one, just tremendous amount of product experience that I think is valuable. I respect the fact that he takes the time to share it. He doesn't have to, but he does. And he's also a great communicator and he invests in being ... You can tell he measures [inaudible 01:03:02] of his talks and things like this. He's invested over his career to be a great communicator. So I think he's a good role model for me and I think for others out there.\n\nLenny (01:03:11):\nThat guy's a force. I'm happy that we've had him on this podcast. I'm hoping that everyone eventually, that people mention in this question we end up having on this podcast. So that's great to check. I also love Gibson. He's got a great newsletter. Askgibbs.substack.com I think. Ian, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing. I really appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nIan McAllister (01:03:38):\nYeah, I guess Twitter's a great place. So IanMcAll, I-A-N-M-C-A-L-L, is my handle. And then I've started a newsletter. I'm not that frequent to be honest. I have a lot of good intentions and a bunch of ideas. Ianmcallister.substack.com. And that's something to connect and feel free to subscribe and hit me up on Twitter if you have ideas for posts or questions. And if I can answer in a tweet, I will. If not, I might put it on the queue of things to write about. And yeah, thanks for having me on Lenny. We were talking earlier about writing or doing other things and the value of that is just making connections with people. And so that was what I was one, just to reconnect with you is awesome. And to whatever extent I get a chance to make new connections in the world, that's a good thing.\n\nLenny (01:04:25):\nAmazing. And we originally connected over that piece that you wrote, so it all circles back 10 years later maybe. Thanks, Ian.\n\nIan McAllister (01:04:32):\nAll right. Thanks Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:04:34):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# The future of AI in software development | Inbal Shani (CPO of GitHub)\n\n## Transcript\n\nInbal Shani (00:00):\nThe user of the AI tools to develop software needs to form a different thinking. You need to start figuring out how are you using these AI tools to help you be successful. And it's no longer just the actual code writing, it's really evolving your thinking to the big picture, to the connected experience, to connected systems, which today we just find it more in the world of more senior developers and less and less in the junior developers.\n\n(00:24):\nThe junior developers, when they start, usually we expect them to be able to write simple code. But if now there is an AI system that is helping them writing code, they can spend more time from the get-go understanding the system, understanding the environment that they're building, or understanding that product that they're building, which today they don't have time because they're still learning how to code.\n\nLenny (00:46):\nToday, my guest is Inbal Shani. Inal is Chief Product Officer at GitHub, formerly a general manager at AWS and at Microsoft, and also a senior software developer on Amazon Robotics.\n\n(00:58):\nIn our conversation, we explore the end state of Copilot and AI-based tooling for software engineers, what the future of software development looks like with AI, what's underhyped and overhyped in AI and software development, what metrics the teams look at to understand if Copilot is doing its job, what mistakes teams and companies make jumping into AI, the design philosophy of Copilot, plus what's helped Inbal most become the leader she is today, and also where GitHub is heading as a product and an organization.\n\n(01:27):\nWith that, I bring you Inbal Shani after a short word from our sponsors. You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming of big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates, and you're spending your days basically putting out fires. A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and roadmapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian.\n\n(01:59):\nWith Jira Product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets, create and share custom product roadmaps with any stakeholder in seconds, and it's all built on Jira where your engineering team's already working. So true collaboration is finally possible. Great products are built by great teams, not just engineers. Sales, support, leadership, even Greg from finance, anyone that you want can contribute ideas, feedback, and insights in Jira Product Discovery for free.\n\n(02:32):\nNo catch. And it's only $10 a month for you. Say goodbye to your spreadsheets and the never ending alignment efforts. The old way of doing product management is over. Rediscover what's possible with Jira Product Discovery. Try for free at atlassian.com/lenny. That's atlassian.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Sanity. Your website is the heart of your growth engine. For that engine to drive big results, you need to be able to move superfast, ship new content, experiment, learn, and iterate.\n\n(03:06):\nBut most content management systems just aren't built for this. Your content teams wrestle with rigid interfaces as they build new pages. You spend endless time copying and pasting across pages and recreating content for other channels and applications. And their ideas for new experiments are squashed when developers can't build them within the constraints of outdated tech. Forward-thinking companies like Figma, Amplitude, Loom, Rightgames, Linear, and more use Sanity to build content growth engines that scale, drive innovation, and accelerate customer acquisition.\n\n(03:36):\nWith Sanity, your team can dream bigger and move faster. As the most powerful headless CMS on the market, you can tailor editorial workflows to match your business, reuse content seamlessly across any pager channel and bring your ideas to market without developer friction. Sanity makes life better for your whole team. It's fast for developers to build with, intuitive for content managers, and it integrates seamlessly with the rest of your tech stack. Get started with Sanity's generous free plan.\n\n(04:02):\nAnd as a Lenny's Podcast listener, you can get a boosted plan with double the monthly usage. Head over to sanity.io/lenny to get started for free. That's sanity.io/lenny. Inbal, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nInbal Shani (04:22):\nAwesome. Thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (04:25):\nI want to start with just a broad question about where software development is going. It feels like you're at the center of the storm of what is changing in software development. It almost feels like GitHub kicked off the storm with the launch of Copilot. So let me ask, what do you think is overhyped in terms of what is changing in software development and then what do you think is underhyped?\n\nInbal Shani (04:46):\nSo I joined GitHub as a CPO basically a year ago. Two days ago, I celebrated my first year. And for me, the initial approach is let's look at the platform, let's look at the software development lifecycle, and draw some conviction. And for me, the biggest conviction is that developer happiness and productivity strongly depends on their environment and dev tooling. And as such, AI is really critical to that mission.\n\n(05:11):\nWhen we're looking into what's happening right now with AI, it really became table stakes on expectations among developers, and it's really central and critical for them to be able to do their job. We know that something like 92% of developers are already using AI tools. But in that landscape, some of the things that are overhyped is that generative AI will replace humans. I don't see that happening in the near future. The way I think about it, you always need that human in the loop because AI cannot replace innovation.\n\n(05:45):\nThat creative spark, that creative thinking that is the center of humanity, this will not be replaced by AI, at least not in the near future. If we think about what does that mean having an AI tool that is successful, you need data. In order to generate data, you need humans using tools, acting with tools, doing something, something. So I think the overhype that is happening right now is that generative AI will replace humanity. It's going to be the solution for everything, and I think it's a tool.\n\n(06:15):\nIf I'm drilling down to the things that are underhyped right now in the world of software development, I'm starting hearing a little bit more on AI driven testing, but there's not lots of mention on it. And if we're thinking about the world of AI where we're going to generate much code, much more productive, much more efficient, more lines of code, more application, then testing is becoming such a critical part of that journey of developing software.\n\n(06:43):\nAnd I would like to hear more about that and what companies are thinking about how do they use AI to generate a larger suite of testing to be able to validate the work.\n\nLenny (06:53):\nAnd by testing you mean like unit testing, integration testing, things like that?\n\nInbal Shani (06:57):\nAll of them, load testing, load testing, infrastructure testing, security testing, penetration testing. When you need a human to write all these testing capabilities, you need a lot of humans that needs to form different thinking. Can we leverage AI to really generate that testing suite that test everything that you need from unit testing and functional testing to load testing, to performance testing?\n\n(07:23):\nThere's a lot of testing that we do that we don't even consider them as testing, so we don't necessarily spend a lot of time in doing them. But if we're now saying software is in the center of everything, all companies will become a software company in some form or another, there is more code being generated. Hence, the importance of testing is becoming much more critical.\n\nLenny (07:43):\nLet's follow that thread. You talked about how you don't see software engineers completely disappearing. What's your just general sense of how software development will be different in three to five years? What do you think is going to be different? And then also just how do you see the end state of all of this of Copilot and tools like this getting better and better and better? What do you think this ends?\n\nInbal Shani (08:02):\nFor me, and I keep on saying that again and again, Copilot is a copilot. It's not a pilot. You still need the human in the loop. But that means that now the software developer or the user of the AI tools to develop software needs to form a different thinking. One, you need to start thinking more systems, more architecture. You need to start figuring out how are you using these AI tools to help you be successful? And it's no longer just the actual code writing, it's really evolving your thinking to the big picture, to the connected experience, to connected systems.\n\n(08:36):\nAnd what we will see in the fullness of time that developers, one, will adopt much more of that mindset, which today we find it in software development, don't get me wrong, we just find it more in the world of more senior developers and less and less in the junior developers. The junior developers, when they start, usually we expect them to be able to write simple code.\n\n(08:57):\nBut if now there is an AI assistant that is helping them writing code, they can spend more time from the get-go understanding the system and understanding the environment that they're building or understanding the product that they're building, which today they don't have time because they are still learning how to code. So I think that's one element. The second element that I expect to see changes is in the world of hardware development, because we know that AI has a big footprint and requires a lot of resources.\n\n(09:24):\nAnd in order to be able to meet the scale, to meet the demand, we need to be able to improve our hardware, our CPUs, our GPUs, our compute and optimization of code. And that's another area that today it's a niche of people that are spending time and I think it'll become much more aligned across the software development lifecycle.\n\n(09:44):\nIntegration with AI is something that will definitely become something that is more normal for every developer, is today something that we start seeing that revolution, that acceptance, that AI tools, I need to figure out how to integrate with AI, I need to know how to use AI. It will become something that is more custom, and we will start seeing that shifts from very early on. When developers are start shaping their thinking, they will start understanding all these components.\n\nLenny (10:14):\nI saw a stat that at Shopify over a million lines of code and their code base was written by Copilot, which I don't know if I can do the math, but I imagine that's more than one person would've written in their lifetime and probably many engineers write in their lifetime. And I think that number reminds us just how fast things are moving and how much is actually changing.\n\n(10:35):\nYou also mentioned 92% of engineers are using AI tools already. Is there any other stats that you can share that might surprise people about the usage of Copilot, growth of Copilot, things along those lines?\n\nInbal Shani (10:46):\nYeah. Well, we have over 37,000 organization and more than 1.5 million developers that are using Copilot.\n\nLenny (10:54):\nWow.\n\nInbal Shani (10:54):\nAnd they're writing code based on our surveys 55% faster. Imagine that you can give a software developer even few minutes, half an hour back in every given day, how much more productive they're becoming, and also as a result, how much happier they're becoming. So we know that in a survey that we have run through our users is 85% of that participants felt more confident in their code quality and also code reviews were completed 15% faster without Copilot. And we know that usually no one likes to do code reviews.\n\n(11:32):\nSo if we can help accelerate and make developers take their time in doing code reviews, and also if we think about removing frustration, then 88% felt less frustrated and more focused on their ability for coding. And that is just the beginning. We have different examples from our customers. I think Accenture is a recent one that we got where they had 88% of suggested code was retained. So we have a lot of these stats that are coming together to showcase the size and the impact of using Copilot and AI tools for software development.\n\nLenny (12:07):\nSay companies hear these stats of like, oh, we're going to be 25% more efficient. Some people may think we need 25% less engineers. We're going to do all the same things. I imagine what you're actually finding is your engineers can do more. So it's not like you need to cut your people, it's that people can be faster and better.\n\nInbal Shani (12:23):\nNo, let me be very clear, you cannot cut your people. You have to have a human in the loop. Copilot is a copilot, it is not a pilot. And I keep on saying that sentence again and again. I think the second thing that what companies need to realize, and that's another developer experience survey that we have run recently, that throughout the years we have added so much tasks on a single software developer from writing code, writing testing, interacting with people, collaborating with 21 people on every given week, going to meetings, waiting on builds, digging into legacy code, all of that is added to the fact that they need to write code, which is their basic work.\n\n(13:03):\nSo most developers span less than 25, some say less than 20% of their time writing in code. So if we're able to give them half an hour back, one, they can write more code. Second, they can have a break and take a breath so we don't burn them out and they're more happy. Third, we give them more time for collaboration and creative thinking, so that sparks innovation. That is not something you want to cut back.\n\n(13:28):\nThis is something you want to be able to give as a gift to your developers so they're happy with you and you can retain them. They can do their job. They're productive. Hence, they're happy.\n\nLenny (13:38):\nI've talked to a bunch of engineers that use Copilot. One thing that surprised me is the most amazing engineers love Copilot. You think this would be for junior engineers learning to code better and faster, but 10X engineers say that... Someone told me it made them 50% better and faster too, which is incredible. What mistakes do you see product teams and engineering teams make when they rush to start adopting AI, integrate AI into their workflows?\n\nInbal Shani (14:07):\nI think there are a couple things. The first one is companies expect a change to happen magically. Here's a tool, go use it. And it's not always flying the same way across all companies. So investing time in really taking the company through a change management process. The second thing that I'm seeing is that since AI is so hyped right now, there is often the questions of, oh, what should we do with AI? So there is that sense that I have to do something with AI.\n\n(14:38):\nBecause if not, I'm not doing the right thing. Versus the question that for me is a big focus for my product team is, what is that problem that we're trying to solve and how can we leverage AI better to help solve the problem versus what do we do with AI? So it's really working backwards from the customer problem from what we're trying to solve, and then realize what are the best tools that we have in order to do that work better and think through that landscape versus, oh, AI is here, we have to use it. Because if not, we're not doing something right.\n\nLenny (15:11):\nIs there an example of that that comes to mind of someone that did that incorrectly or wasted a lot of time?\n\nInbal Shani (15:17):\nIt's not necessarily examples, but I've been talking to some of our customers and they're coming to us. \"We heard about AI. What do you think we should do with AI? And how should we adopt AI? And can we learn from your experience?\" And I'm sharing our experience. When we started thinking about AI, it was with the idea to make developers much more productive. And what are some of the things that we've seen? That developers have multiple tasks on them and they don't have enough time to spend on coding.\n\n(15:45):\nSo how can we give them time to spend more on coding and what are some of the coding element that we can automate? And from that comes the need to, okay, let's incorporate OpenAI, let's incorporate ChatGPT, let's connect all of them to help create that tool that helps developer be more productive and is AI based. So I'm sharing how we went through that journey to think about how to use AI. I see a lot of the times light bulbs with the customers like, \"Oh, we didn't think about it like that.\"\n\n(16:15):\nIt's more about we wanted to plaster AI on a lot of things versus I have this workflow and it requires a lot of manual work, or it requires a lot of configuration. Maybe I can think how to incorporate AI into that and really shorten the time or make it seamless or make it less friction for developers to adopt that tool and so on and so forth. So it's really sharing more how we are thinking about it and helping our customers to understand the same.\n\nLenny (16:42):\nAlong the same lines, you're talking about how you think about it with your teams. It feels like your product teams are probably living in the future of how other product teams will operate because you have access to stuff everyone else doesn't necessarily have access to. They probably adopt these tools a lot faster than the other teams would. What are some ways that your product teams operate that other teams may not yet be operating?\n\nInbal Shani (17:04):\nIn GitHub in general, it's not just the product team. GitHub is GitHub. I'll say we eat our own dog food, and that means that we are the first to try every feature, every capability that we're developing. And it's not just our engineering team, it spans across GitHub. So for example, GitHub is running on GitHub. There are several blog posts and talks. Even in the recent Universe, we had a specific talk in terms of how GitHub is using GitHub and adopting AI across software development lifecycle.\n\n(17:32):\nAnd the biggest focus for us is if we're saying that GitHub is a developer platform and it's more than that, it's a software development platform, how are we making sure that all the persona that are taking part in the development of GitHub are also using GitHub? So for example, our finance team is using discussions and posts and PRs and reposts to communicate our AR numbers and so on and so forth. We have our legal team using, we have our HR team. If they like it or not, it's a different question.\n\n(18:02):\nBut the idea is that we're using GitHub to run GitHub, and the product team is one of the first early adopters along with our engineering team. So for example, when we've tested chat and we wanted to see the quantity or the recommendation, the search, this is something that the product team was one of the first users to go and figure it out. Is it giving me the right thing that I need to do that? Is it summarizing the PR the way I want to summarize? And so on and so forth.\n\n(18:27):\nBut we are really strong in advocating that we have to be the one testing our tools. If we cannot use them, our customers cannot use them for sure. So nothing is shipped before it spends enough months cooking inside GitHub, so we have to say this is working for us or not before we put it at the end of our customers.\n\nLenny (18:47):\nOne of the magical elements of Copilot is how it just fades into the background. You don't have to chat with it. You don't have to tell it anything. It just infers, here's what you're doing, here's the answer for you. If you want to use, it's cool. If you don't, it's fine. Is there anything you could share about just the design philosophy of Copilot?\n\nInbal Shani (19:05):\nYeah. The design philosophy for Copilot is very much aligned with the working backwards concept that I just mentioned. It's really putting yourself in the shoes of your customers and figuring out what is it that they need, how is that experience going to work for them? If it's an extra tool and if you need to ask for it and if you need to ask for it or if you need to wait for it, then developers will not adopt it.\n\n(19:27):\nSo because we developed it for ourselves first and we wanted to experiment with that, the design philosophy was put yourself in the shoes of a developer, how would you like that experience to be? In 2020, we had a group of GitHub engineers that were working with the design team and with OpenAI GPT to really figure out how we're going to build that and how it can work to help developers to do their job more efficiently, more productively, improve their collaboration and happiness, and so on and so forth.\n\n(19:57):\nBut the grounding principle was the developer needs to want to use this tool. And the more you add friction, the more you add churn, the more you add complexity, the developers will not want to use their tool. We just talked about all the things that the developer needs to do in every given day. Now add to that mix, I need to learn how to adopt AI, we knew that it will not fly. So it has to be a seamlessly integration. It needs to be something that is very intuitive for developer to use to be successful.\n\nLenny (20:24):\nWhat are the success metrics for Copilot? It's such an interesting problem of measuring efficiency gains and productivity gains for engineers. What metrics do you focus on to tell you this is doing what we want it to be doing?\n\nInbal Shani (20:35):\nWe are in a world that there are no right metrics. There is no one metric to rule them all. It's a combination of the things that you're looking to measure out of adopting AI. You can think about measuring code quality using AI. Can you improve the code quality? Can you improve the security of your code by introducing, for example, our GitHub Advanced Security using AI?\n\n(21:00):\nSo there's a lot of different metrics that if you combine them together are providing you with that developer productivity, and then there's developer productivity, developer collaboration, time gain, that if you're bringing them together are yielding the developer happiness. The biggest area of focus for us right now is the definition of productivity because we have so many users that are coming to GitHub and they're looking for that productivity gain.\n\n(21:27):\nBut one of the things we're very conscious of as we continue evolving Copilot and AI across the software development lifecycle across all the tools, productivity is not the right metrics against each one of these components. When we're implementing AI to GitHub Advanced Security, writing more secure code is the right element. It's like how many secrets were we able to prevent from leaking? How many issues in the code we're able to detect and find and fix before you ship that?\n\n(21:51):\nSo I think that the world of the metrics for AI is really a big one. We are working a lot with our customers as they're asking the same questions and they're running their own experiments within their companies to figure out what is it that they want to measure. The most easiest one is time, but time is, it's funny what I'm going to say, but time is not quantifiable as a success metrics because you can write really bad code really fast.\n\n(22:18):\nSo it's really about how are we taking time and translating it to efficiency, to productivity, to something that are harder to measure, and then how does that lead to develop core happiness, which is another harder metrics to measure. So the combination of all these input metrics leading to eventually developer happiness is what we're focusing on.\n\nLenny (22:40):\nYeah, it's so interesting because engineers could end up spending more time coding because they're enjoying it more. They're getting more done. Also, more lines of code isn't a good metric because you don't want to know if those are good lines of code. That's a classic way to not measure engineers well. So to me, it feels like developer happiness is the ultimate metric. We had Nicole on the podcast who came up with this framework, DORA, that's an interesting way of just measuring developer experience, developer happiness.\n\nInbal Shani (23:05):\nRight. I think one of the things that we're talking to customers and we're trying to figure out how we're articulate is instead of time, can we talk about time to value? So from the moment you put a developer on a task, how long did it take you until you realize the full potential or the full value of that, if it's generating revenue, if it's in adoption, if it's time to market? You can define your time to value in different ways.\n\n(23:28):\nBut eventually you're investing in AI tools to help your developer to be more productive, to be more efficient, to be more happy, and then is it impacting your time to value, which is something that's the business side that they're looking to measure.\n\nLenny (23:44):\nThis episode is brought to you by HelpBar by Chameleon, the free in-app Universal Search Solution built for SaaS.

Coming back to where this all goes, imagine you've seen all these demos of people like sketching a website, taking a picture, sending it to ChatGPT, and it builds the website for you?\n\nInbal Shani (25:04):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (25:05):\nHow do you see all of that sort of thing playing into this? Do you see CEOs being like, \"Here's the iPad app I want,\" I'm going to sketch it for you, and then just run it through Copilot version 10 and it writes it for you? I know that you're saying engineers won't be cut and only increase and become more efficient, but I guess where do you see that version of it going of just like, here's a sketch, build it for me?\n\nInbal Shani (25:27):\nI'm thinking about that as a better collaboration tool versus a production tool. Because right now, a lot of the time where we see challenges in articulating ideas is the communication. It's the clarity of thoughts. So if we can leverage AI to improve collaboration, and you basically put a drawing in front of Copilot and it helps tell the story of what is it that you're asking your developers to do, it shortened a lot of cycles and the back and forth. So what did you mean?\n\n(25:53):\nDid you mean the button here, or did you wanted it pink, or did you want that application, or did you want that operating system? So if Copilot can help refine communication, and it's becoming likely the best collaboration tool that exists in the market, especially in the global world where we are where we see communication is ongoing challenges between different personas that are taking part in coming up with an idea and basically we see AI and in our view is Copilot becoming that next natural language conversation.\n\n(26:26):\nIt's that translator that helps bring everyone on the same page because it's creating that universal conversation language, the same that math used to be.\n\nLenny (26:37):\nReminds me, there's another conversation I was having with an engineer and he was saying how he loves writing those simple functions that Copilot is now doing for him and he's sad that it's doing it for him, but he doesn't turn that off. But he kind of is like, \"That's what I really enjoy. These little things that I could just crack like sort function of some sort.\" I guess, is there anything you think we lose with so much of our code being written for us?\n\nInbal Shani (27:01):\nI think each developer has their own part that they enjoy doing. And you don't have to use Copilot to write your simple code. You can use Copilot through a chat experience and use them as an AI assistant and brainstorm. We're giving you a set of tools, and we have a scenario in mind how you should use them. But what we're seeing is developers are using them very differently. Everyone is choosing their own flavor on how to use the tools. There is no right and wrong way to use it.\n\n(27:32):\nIt's a tool. It's a language. When I was learning how to code, I used to code in C, and then Java became a thing. I'm like, oh, but this is taking away my job because I used to write all these functions and all these libraries and now Java has it all. And then Python came, which is another abstraction layer. It's like, okay, so now I don't even need to think about that because Python can do all of that. So it's a matter of how you use the tools and what you use them to do what. There are areas that I will still go and write in C, even today.\n\n(28:04):\nI don't trust someone inventing metrics for me in an efficient way if it needs to run on a very small CPU. So I'll do that myself. On the other hand, there is going to be an element that I'm going to delegate to a higher obstruction tool, and that's exactly the way I think about AI. You pick and choose how you want to use it. There is no global way that is the absolute truth that everyone has to follow. You need to think how you use your tools to do your job in a way that you're still keeping the things that make you happy.\n\n(28:34):\nOn the other hand, use AI to do the things that you less enjoy. Maybe you like writing functions, but you don't like writing, testing, so generate unit testing and so on and let AI do its job for you and you still focus on the things you enjoy.\n\nLenny (28:48):\nAre you actually still finding time to code? Are you still writing some C on the side?\n\nInbal Shani (28:52):\nA little bit now. Now I'm mainly playing with my older son, so he has more time to cook, but sometimes I enjoy spending time with him and brainstorming and talking about things and architecture. I think recently a few months back, he did a project on sensors and sensors integration, and he came across common filter, which was the thing that I used to do many, many years back.\n\n(29:16):\nAnd he's like, okay, what is it and how is it done? And then we went through that and I helped him think about the structure and the sensors fusion and all of that. And then sometimes I'm like, \"Okay, move aside, here you go. This is how you...\"\n\nLenny (29:29):\nTurn on Copilot. Just kidding.\n\nInbal Shani (29:29):\nMommy's Copilot.\n\nLenny (29:33):\nThat's so funny. That reminds me, I was watching a talk of yours and you were training tuning models and LMS way back in the day, before it was very cool. And so you've been in this space for a long time. Looking back, is there something that you see now of where things were going that you didn't see at the time?\n\nInbal Shani (29:51):\nI grew up in a world of niche AI where you have to be an expert and you need to be trained for years understanding how to tune a model, what is the right output, and you needed to understand how to build a simulation to test it, how to ingest data, focus on optimization. I've seen the evolution of AI throughout the year with all the talking devices and conversational AI, and then it started as a single term. It came up as a multi-term.\n\n(30:22):\nSo I've started seeing that trend of more democratizing AI, but I didn't expect that boom of generative AI. Everyone that even doesn't even know what AI is, that they need to use AI. I think that was the thing that caught me by surprise because I was so trained that you have to be an expert to use AI. So for me that was aha moments, like hmm, this is interesting. So what's next?\n\nLenny (30:47):\nDo you have an opinion on whether large language models are the end all and be all of where all this goes and just continue to add in compute and data? Or do you think there's another, I don't know, something on the horizon that's going to again completely transform the transformer model of AI?\n\nInbal Shani (31:06):\nI think we've pivoted very hard towards a generative AI and generalized AI can solve everything. I believe that the future is going back to scale back a bit to the niche AI. So we will live in a hybrid world where you still have specific AI models that are solving very specific problem where the generative AI will have its limitation. It's a general purpose tool, so it can be as good as the data sets, but it also try to find some statistical recommendation. Is it good? Is it not good? So it's limited by the training set that it has and it's trying to be everything for everyone.\n\n(31:43):\nThere are going to be areas where you still need to train models. For example, I spend my time in the aerospace industry and in the automotive industry. I don't see self-driving car models that requires so much delicate, specific models, tuning, high safety regulation, all of that being developed on the ChatGPT. I might be wrong, but I think that eventually we will find ourself in the world of hybrid models and multi-models where there will be several LLM models coming together because each one of them will have their own benefit.\n\n(32:19):\nAnd then there's going to be a niche AI or a more configurable customized model for specific use cases. So that's my prediction of the future. But in 10 years from now, we'll all be smarter.\n\nLenny (32:32):\nYeah, the future hard to predict.\n\nInbal Shani (32:34):\nYes.\n\nLenny (32:35):\nI wanted to ask, so GitHub came up with this whole Copilot idea. We had Ryan on the podcast talking about how there's a researcher just experimenting with what can we do with a bunch of data. And then that essentially turned into, wow, this is actually working. Let's quickly scale this and launch it.\n\n(32:54):\nI guess is there anything you learned from that huge success within GitHub and Microsoft to find other big opportunities? Is there something you do about how you structure product teams or create space for people to experiment with things like this to find the next Copilot?\n\nInbal Shani (33:10):\nIt's a lot about that. It's a lot about creating that bandwidth for the team to innovate and experiment and carving that time out, but also being okay that not every experiment is going to be successful. So the shift to learn or to fail forward, these are the philosophies that I believe in. If you don't try, if you don't experiment, you will never innovate. And if you don't fail, you will never learn from your mistakes, you'll never learn from your experience, so you will not progress forward.\n\n(33:36):\nSo really creating that ability to experiment, the same that we've done with Copilot or we've done in GitHub Advanced Security or even the way GitHub was created, it's all that innovative thinking that the teams have that are thinking about what is that next generation use case? What is the future developer will need to be happy, to be more productive, to do their job? In a world that software development is changing so fast, you have to create that bandwidth for the next generation, the next innovation.\n\n(34:08):\nAnd if you didn't have a chance to see that the two-day keynote in Universe, I highly recommend because we basically shared our next vision for Copilot with Copilot Workspace. We also had Satya Nadella on stage and he was very excited. He's like, \"Oh my god, GitHub, if you build that, this is amazing.\" So you see that we keep on putting this vision forward again and again at least six months to a year before we even have something in the market because we're already thinking, we're already innovating, we're already on the next thing.\n\nLenny (34:38):\nIs there something that you do to allow for that other than just these principles of ship to learn and it's okay to fail? Is there a way you structured teams or resource teams? Is it like you have a percentage of time to think about other ideas, or is it just generally we're okay failing, find time to work on other things?\n\nInbal Shani (34:55):\nIt's a couple things. One, it's spend time with customers and learn from your customers, because a lot of the innovative ideas are coming basically from conversation with customers because they're sharing with you their frustration, they're sharing with you what they would like to have, they're sharing with you what will be an amazing invention for them. So that's the first thing is creating that mechanisms. And we spend a lot of time talking to our customers and also talking to our community.\n\n(35:21):\nWe're fortunate to be the home for all developers and home for all open source. Large open source foundation and small open source foundation are running on top of GitHub. So that's another feedback cycle that we have to really gather those ideas and those asks to help us shape the future. And then the second thing is really about the teams pitching idea. It's like, \"I have this idea. I've been doing some research. Here's a paper that describes what is it that I want to do,\" and then we figure out, okay, when can we fund it?\n\n(35:49):\nHow can we fund it? Can we allocate a specific bandwidth? Can we do a POC? Do we do that in that team? Do we do it as a V team? So we keep it flexible. And we also have a research team, which are GitHub vNext, that basically that's our day job is to think about the next big innovation. But in GitHub, innovation is coming from everywhere. It's coming from our field team that are talking to customers and are implementing different variations of GitHub for customers. And they'll come back with some feedback or an idea.\n\n(36:18):\nIt's coming from the product team. It's coming from the design team, from the engineering team. It comes from everywhere. So if you try to structure innovation, you're losing that organic spark that is humanity. Imagine that someone say you have 15 minutes a day to be creative. I don't think it's the pull. So it's encouraging that thinking more than structured.\n\nLenny (36:50):\nCan you talk more about that team that you mentioned? What is it called? The vNext team?\n\nInbal Shani (36:50):\nThe GitHub Next. Yes.\n\nLenny (36:51):\nNext team. Can you talk a bit more about what that team is and how that works?\n\nInbal Shani (36:53):\nThey're basically applied scientists, research scientists that are working together, and they're really thinking about three, five years horizon. They're not thinking about the right now. They're thinking about what is the future for software development is going to look like. They're writing papers. They're running experiments. They're doing POCs. Their job is to invent the future.\n\n(37:16):\n But again, it's really a synergy because they're talking to the product, to their engineering, so they're getting ideas from that. They're talking to customers, or we're sharing feedback. So that's our GitHub Next. It's basically our research team.\n\nLenny (37:28):\nAnd that's where Copilot emerged out of, is that right?\n\nInbal Shani (37:28):\nRight.\n\nLenny (37:32):\nIt's so interesting because, I think I talked about this with Ryan, there's so many companies with a team like that. Like Facebook had a famous one, New Product Experience team. Google had Google... Forget what it was called. But none of them have really been successful is my understanding and this one was. Is there anything you think you're doing differently? Is it more science-based and research versus just product managers trying a bunch of different apps? I don't know, is there anything you think is key to this team being successful?\n\nInbal Shani (37:59):\nI think there are two elements for that. One is having the right people with the right mindset on the team, allowing them and giving them the bandwidth and freedom to innovate. And the second thing is that we're focusing on making things real. So we're not keeping them far or in disconnect from the product and engineering.\n\n(38:15):\nThere's a lot of synergy, there is a lot of discussion, because what happens in teams that are not successful, at least from what I've seen, one, that the team is becoming basically an university, they write papers, but nothing is coming out of that, so nothing finds its well to production. So if you don't introduce that, how do we take it to production from day zero when you're thinking about a new idea? It's rarely that it'll go through that hump cycle and itself in production. And the second thing that companies tend to use these teams is too much tactical.\n\n(38:47):\nHere is that, \"We need something in six month. Go invent it right now,\" and then they're basically creating another engineering or producting to think about the things that are now in horizon one. So I think in GitHub we found the right balance between having the right people, having the right mindset, but also creating that synergy between the future thinking to how we make it real, so we have a strong relationship, especially between the product team and GitHub Next, to make sure that this relationship are ongoing and ideas are flowing both ways.\n\nLenny (39:20):\nToday, you're chief product officer at GitHub, which is I think a dream job for a lot of people. Early product managers, senior product managers want to figure out how to get to a place that you're at today. And I'm curious what you found most helped you build the skills that were necessary to be successful in this role? Was it mentors, exec coaches, just doing the job for a long time? Anything else along those lines?\n\nInbal Shani (39:47):\nCombination. It's never one thing, because the role of the chief product officer is so broad. You're not just the head of products. And that's the mindset that is now evolving in the industry is that a chief product officer is more than just the head of product. They need to have a business thinking. They need to understand their go-to market strategy. They need to understand the sales play. They need to understand how engineering are building products. It's not just about let me write a set of requirements or think about the vision and the future.\n\n(40:16):\nIt's how all these components in the company are operating together to build that product. And some of that you learned from looking into the leaders that you work for and see how they're thinking. From my first boss in the aerospace industry, I learned how to think system. Not to think just on the problem that I'm solving right now, but how the problem that I'm in charge in solving that filter that I'm responsible in tuning is connected to their control system and the ignition system and all of that and how is it eventually being displayed.\n\n(40:47):\nSo that requires me to think from the get-go on the bigger solution, not just my component. So I think that's one. The second thing is really thinking about the people and change management and how you take people with you, because a product manager role is a very influential role and a lot of the things you do is influencing other people. Although everyone thinks that as a product manager you get to do things, you get to write papers, but you need to influence the engineering team to build a product that you want them to build.\n\n(41:17):\nYou need to influence the revenue team to go with a go to market and sell the product the way you envision it. So there's a lot of influencing happening. You need to understand how to do that and building that skillset as a product manager from the get-go is very critical. So for me, it was the fact that I was fortunate enough to do different roles in the industry and learn from different people, but also looking up, looking across, and looking down into the people that I manage and what are the things I could learn from them?\n\n(41:47):\nWhat are some of the skills that they have that are not necessarily in my toolbox and how can I adopt them? What does success look like and what are some of the things that make people unhappy? And you don't necessarily want to have these tools in your toolbox. So it's a lot of what's yes and what's no in a combination.\n\nLenny (42:04):\nYeah, it's exactly like you said, it's all the things combined. I really like that last point of just identifying people that are good at something that you want to get better at and just learning from them, watching them, maybe asking them questions about how they're operating. I am trying a new segment of this podcast called Failure Corner, and my question to you is, what's the biggest career or product failure of your career and what did you learn from that experience?\n\nInbal Shani (42:30):\nI'll call it the biggest learning because I'm not a believer in failure. I'm a believer in learnings. And every time you fail, it's a big learning and I prefer to look at that as opportunities. I think biggest one was likely early on when I started being a leader and the manager of a team, I'm a very go, go, go person and I have a lot of energy. And when I'm coming to something and I see all the issues that need to be fixed, it's like, okay, let's take the toolbox out. Let's go fix everything. And that includes driving change.\n\n(43:03):\nAnd I've seen that when I started doing that without building that understanding of why we need to do a change or why this is a problem that we need to go and fix it, then you don't take people with you through that journey. So really analyzing that not everyone appreciate change the way you are, not everyone has that mindset of the go, go, go, let's go do it. And really figuring out, taking a step back and assessing what is happening so you can take the team with you on that journey of changing.\n\n(43:35):\nThat was for me, the biggest learning and likely a lot of the not supportive feedback I got from the team at that time was, \"You're moving too fast. Slow down. Explain the why. Why are we doing that? How should we move forward?\"\n\nLenny (43:52):\nWhere did this actually happen? Which company? Which role?\n\nInbal Shani (43:55):\nIn TomTom when I was leading the location-based services team. And I think for me it was one, it was the first time I was working in international company, so really figure out that my character not always fly with every culture that exists. So how am I adjusting to that? And the second thing is that they were very accustomed in working in a specific environment in a specific way. And yes, I was hired to drive change, but one, the team doesn't have to accept. That's your job to drive change.\n\n(44:31):\nAnd also they're not necessarily on board with the fact that you're here to drive change. So how you take them with you through that journey was a big learning and being able to communicate in a general way of communicating to drive clarity, that was a big learning.\n\nLenny (44:48):\nThat's actually a recurring theme on Failure Corner of the failure stories I'm thinking about is just somebody starting at a company and trying to change too much too quickly.\n\nInbal Shani (44:55):\nRight. It's very common because we are human beings. We think that if we're coming, we have our experience, we're coming to a new space, and you immediately see all the things that are not working or all the things that needs to be fixed. If you're working in the same space for a long time in the same team, you often don't see these gaps anymore because you got used to living with them.\n\n(45:15):\nSo as someone new, you're coming in, you immediately see all these holes and cracks. And it's like, okay, here's all the things I need to fix. But you have a team that has been there for what? So how you find that bridge to communicate between the things you see and the things that they think is fine. Like, \"Why are you driving these changes? It's be working. Don't fix it.\"\n\nLenny (45:35):\nInbal, is there anything else you'd like to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nInbal Shani (45:40):\nFor me, it's an exciting moment in time. I've been celebrating my first year in GitHub and my first GitHub Universe on stage last week. It was amazing experience for me to meet our customers, our partners and talk a lot about the importance of developer experience, our AI power platform, and how we're shaping the future. So I'm in a very exciting part of my journey with GitHub.\n\n(46:05):\nYou don't get here if you don't make some mistakes and you do some learnings and you have some successes and then you take the right turn and sometimes you take the wrong turn, but you find your way to a place that makes you happy and feel fulfilled as a product leader.\n\nLenny (46:19):\nAwesome. We're going to link to that talk in the show notes that people want to watch it. With that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nInbal Shani (46:26):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (46:28):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nInbal Shani (46:32):\nFailing Forward by John Maxwell, The Flywheel from Good to Great by Jim Collins, and a recent book that I read that is called Dare to Lead Like a Girl by Dalia Feldheim.\n\nLenny (46:45):\nThat's a new mention on the show. Awesome. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nInbal Shani (46:51):\nI like a lot of fantasy and I like a lot of history based movies and theories. There is a recent one that came up on Netflix, All the Light We Cannot See. Amazing. So well produced. Really tells an interesting part of the history of World War II.\n\nLenny (47:06):\nHave you seen Wheel of Time on Amazon Prime if you like fantasy?\n\nInbal Shani (47:09):\nYeah. Yes., I love that. It's done. It's a good one.\n\nLenny (47:13):\nYeah, especially season two is like wow. It's a lot better. Next question, do you have a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them?\n\nInbal Shani (47:22):\nI think the first question that I really like to ask is, what is the most innovative thing you have done and why do you think it's innovative? And it's really interesting that there are some people that think they need to answer about the biggest invention that they've done, and there are some people that are very vulnerable and they talk about something very personal that they have innovated.\n\n(47:41):\nIt shows a lot of their character. And I think the second question that I like to ask a lot is give me an example in a time where you had a disagreement with your manager, you're in the line with your manager, and then what did you do about it and how did you go? Because it showcase a lot about your character and are you willing to stand your ground and push up when you need to? And then what is that communication skills that you have, your influential skill that you have?\n\nLenny (48:09):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you like to share with people, often come back to either in work or in life that you find useful?\n\nInbal Shani (48:15):\nI think it's, if you don't take risks, you cannot create a future. I forgot who said it. I think it's from one of the animation Monkey Luffy if I remember. But it basically summarized the life motto that you have to take risks, you have to experiment. If you feel comfortable, it's not a good thing. You always need to feel uncomfortable to stretch yourself to go to the next thing. So that's something that I've done. You just heard about my career story from applied scientist to chief product officer. Who knew?\n\nLenny (48:46):\nI love that motto. lnbal, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on anything? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nInbal Shani (48:57):\nLots of interesting sessions and talks from Universe. So if people want to learn more about what is it that we're doing, how we're thinking about AI, LinkedIn is likely the best social media platform to find me where I have a chance to talk to a lot of people. These are the best places.\n\nLenny (49:12):\nAnd then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nInbal Shani (49:16):\nIf you can share a similar experience or a story that you think will be helpful for me as I'm thinking about, what does that mean being chief product officer for GitHub, any tips and tricks on how you use GitHub, so maybe I can learn, or share your experience and story so I can learn from your experience as well.\n\nLenny (49:31):\nAmazing. lnbal, thank you so much for being here.\n\nInbal Shani (49:35):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny (49:36):\nBye, everyone.

She was also a PM at Stripe. Currently, she's actually starting her own company. Here's Eeke sharing her favorite interview question.\n\nEeke De Miliano (03:36):\n\"To what do you attribute your success?\" And you can't say \"luck\". Because I think humble people will always say \"luck\" in some way, and I always kind of want to know, how self-aware are you, basically, and how curious are you? I think people have really sort of gone back and reflected on why are they where they are today really says a lot about how they think about the world.\n\nLenny (03:58):\nNext up, we've got Geoff Charles, Head of Product at Ramp, and also just happens to be one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.\n\nGeoff Charles (04:06):\nI ask, \"What's the hardest thing you've ever done?\" I ask that because working at Ramp is hard, and I want to understand what hard means for them. I want to understand why it was hard. I want to understand how they overcame that difficulty, how they worked with other people to overcome that difficulty, and how much agency they had in overcoming that. So it's a really good sign around what is difficulty to them and how much work they put into overcoming that.\n\nLenny (04:31):\nNext up we've got Shishir Mehrotra CEO, and Co-founder of Coda. Funny enough, we posted this exact clip to TikTok and Instagram Reels, and it blew up. It's one of the most popular clips we've ever put on our channels. By the way, did you know I have a TikTok and an Instagram channel? Just look up Lenny's Podcast on TikTok or Instagram. Anyway, with that, here's Shishir Mehrotra sharing his favorite interview question.\n\nShishir Mehrotra (04:56):\nIt's a very simple question, and it's a coded Eigenquestion test. The question is, \"A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you, Lenny, to be their business counterpart, bring this to market, product [inaudible 00:05:14].\" This question will actually work well for any role. But say, \"You could be a product manager for this thing, bring it to market. What do you do?\" That's the whole question.\n\n(05:23):\nUsually people will start asking a bunch of questions and say, \"Well, tell me more about this device. What does it do? How does it work? Is it big? Is it small? Is it vast? Does it disintegrate things or not? Does it need a receiver and a sender? Is it safe?\" All these different questions come out.\n\n(05:39):\nI'll just let those questions come out, and at some point I'll say, \"Okay, nice job generating all the questions. Turns out these scientists, they hate talking to people and they're kind of annoyed by all your questions. And so they've decided that they will answer only two of your questions, and after that they expect a plan. What two questions do you ask?\"\n\n(05:59):\nInterestingly, all of a sudden the sharp product managers, engineers, basically every role, they very quickly find what are the one or two Eigenquestions on this topic. There's no right answer, but I'll tell you one of my favorite ones, because the product manager said, \"Okay, if I had to ask two questions, the two questions I would ask, one, is it safe enough for humans or not?\" That was a very crisp way to get to just safety. How reliable is it? They didn't ask how reliable it is, how many bits in the middle of this. \"Just tell me, is it safe enough for humans or not?\"\n\n(06:31):\nThe second one is, \"Is it more expensive CapEx or OpEx? Is it more expensive to buy them or to run them?\"\n\n(06:37):\nAnd then he took those two questions, and he said, \"Just with those two questions, I can form these quadrants.\" You can say, \"Oh, it's safe enough for humans and they're very cheap to buy, but expensive to run.\" Then you probably run them like human fax machines. You put them everywhere you can and you say, \"Hey, look, it's expensive to use, but you all have the ability to teleport anywhere you want and this is how we're going to run it.\"\n\n(06:59):\nOn the other hand, they're very expensive to buy, but cheap to run, you'd probably have to place them very strategically, in which case what you'd probably do is replace airports. Because airports are pretty strategically placed in places where people are trying to get around places.\n\n(07:12):\nIf it's not safe enough for humans, then you've got a whole different class of use cases where you go value what goods are transported in very costly ways? And people come up with, \"Do you do the most expensive things? Is teleporting people's replacement [inaudible 00:07:29], is that a really demanding thing?\"\n\n(07:32):\nBut these two questions kind of get to the heart of it. The question is totally made up. No teleportation device exists, at least not yet. I find that people's ability to learn the method is significantly higher if it's low stakes.\n\n(07:45):\nThat question, by the way, if you ask a kid that question, the new teleportation device, you get to ask two questions, almost every kid will quickly get to two pretty good Eigenquestions. Again, kids are incredibly good at simplifying these things down. It's actually a skill we remove from ourselves. A lot of your candidates tell me things like, \"I guess I would ask them what size it is.\" I'm like, \"Why would you ask them? What decision is that going to allow you to make, to know what size it is?\" Sometimes they can explain it, but sometimes not. They don't get hired.\n\n(08:16):\nBut then, actually, the thing I'd say about it is, there are Eigenquestion kind of everywhere. You could take any product out there. I'll do it with my kids a lot. I was just riding with with my younger daughter, and she said, \"How come there's three gas stations in the same corner? Why do people do that?\" That's a really insightful observation. What's the Eigenquestion? How do you place a gas station? You can almost take anything and say, \"What is the question that really drives this answer?\"\n\nLenny (08:45):\nThis next interview question comes from Yuhki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, also a former Head of Design at Uber.\n\nYuhki Yamashita (08:53):\n\"Describe to me a time when you were part of a controversial product decision. What did you do?\" All those things. I think it's really revealing, because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides and such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, and they can do it in this kind of even-keeled way where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives, you start to learn a lot about that person, I think.\n\n(09:25):\nOr sometimes I just ask them for basic things like, \"Okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on.\" The thought experiment for me is always, coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? Right? No matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager kind of casts something. It's like, \"Well, this is why it's so existential and this is why it's so interesting, and really rallied the troops up. That's kind of one big thing of storytelling and communication, because at the end of the day, so much of our job is around that.\n\nLenny (09:57):\nNext you'll hear from Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe; Karri Saarine, CEO of Linear; and Camille Hearst, Product Leader at Spotify, former Product Leader at Patreon; who all share the same favorite interview question.\n\nKatie Dill (10:12):\n\"Tell me what work you are most proud of?\" The reason I ask that is because, well, it helps me understand their taste and their judgment, what motivates them, what work they view as good and as a good outcome. It also helps me understand a little bit about what they like to do and where their gravity pulls them.\n\nKarri Saarinen (10:36):\nI think usually I like to ask what is the candidate most proud of and why on their professional life or otherwise. What they're most proud of and why? But I think it's gives you a little bit of indication of what the person values and how they think about things. Also, I think it's always nice that people can share something they think they did really well, and we can spend time on it, versus just asking something more negative things.\n\nCamille Hearst (11:04):\nI like to ask people to tell me about something they're really proud of that they accomplished, take me through the process, and talk to me about why they're proud of it. I find you can learn so much about a person's motivations, about their work ethic, about what they care about, what good looks like to them, and I think those are all really important things to understand about a person if you're going to work closely with them.\n\nLenny (11:29):\nNext is JZ, Head of Product at Webflow, former Airbnb colleague, sharing her favorite interview question.\n\nJiaona Zhang (11:35):\nI do like to do behavioral questions. Just really understanding, when they've been in challenging situations, when they've been in ambiguous situations, how do they navigate?\n\n(11:44):\nAmbiguity is a big one for me, because at the end of the day, the PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter. Good answers are people who put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity. That's what you look for. You want your PM to not just be like, \"Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity,\" but actually put a path forward.\n\n(12:05):\nI think, also, looking for people who are seeking help, seeking those inputs, as opposed to being like, \"Yep, this is the way. This is very clear.\" Because, again, the chances of whatever path you chart out for any product, for anything that you're doing, is the right path from the first time that you do it, so rare. And so I want to see someone be able to get those inputs, be able to say, \"This is the path. This is how I learned why I put this path together.\" And then going back to a lot of the stuff I think we touched upon in this podcast is like, what are the little milestones that make you say, \"Hey, is this working? Is this not working?\" And then make you either make a different decision. Seeing people do that really well is a big thing I look for.\n\nLenny (12:44):\nNext up is Noah Weiss, Chief Product Officer at Slack.\n\nNoah Weiss (12:49):\n\"What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product team?\" When I say \"unfair\" or \"secret\", I usually mean not something that you probably read on a media [inaudible 00:13:02]. \"What did you learn? How did you learn it? How does it work, and how do you apply it?\" You also just get amazing, interesting bits of inspiration from asking that.\n\nLenny (13:11):\nThis next question comes from the very sultry voice of Ben Williams, former VP of Product at Snyk and now an advisor to product-led growth startups.\n\nBen Williams (13:22):\n\"Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?\" A lot of people will default to telling you where they aspire to be in terms of role or title, but what I'm really looking for is signals of humility, of self-awareness, around areas of personal and professional growth. People who can be open about where they think they need to work on to grow themselves as people. I love that.\n\n(13:49):\nAlso, just generally throughout interviews, I'm looking for curiosity. Day-to-day, good PMs will be asking \"why\" as much as my six-year-old son does, which is a lot, so I'll try and discern that through the course of the conversation. It's not really a question, but something I'm looking for.\n\n(14:08):\nAnd then maybe I want to flip it, because building on something that Adam Fishman was saying, his theme of evaluating the people dimension of folks you are potentially going to work with when you're interviewing with a company. This was a question I got asked myself recently by a candidate, which I just thought was brilliant, and that was, \"Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with?\" It just felt like a really great way for them to be able to test alignment of their personal values with those of someone they'd be working with really closely, so I love that.\n\nLenny (14:42):\nNext up is Meltem Kuran Berkowitz, Head of Growth and a very early employee at Deel.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (14:48):\n\"What would your siblings say about you?\" It's very telling. If they have siblings; if they don't, I will say, \"What will your parents say about you?\" But it's very telling what you think other people think of you.\n\nLenny (15:00):\nWhat do you look for in their answer that gives you a sign that they're a good candidate or not?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (15:05):\nI look for sincerity and self-awareness. Your siblings are never ... I mean, I love my sister, but she'll call me. She'll talk to me a lot. Being aware of that is very important. If someone was like, \"My siblings will say I'm very organized and that I'm the one that brings our family together,\" that's probably a bullshit answer. But if they're like, \"Oh, yeah, they'll say these weird things about me,\" that shows a little bit of self-awareness and humbleness that I want to see in a person.\n\nLenny (15:30):\nNext is Paige Costello, Co-Head of Product Management, and also Head of AI at Asana.\n\nPaige Costello (15:36):\nI like to ask, \"Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it?\" Yada, yada. Effectively, the question gets at, when the product failed, when something about the team didn't work, just things that go wrong because that's what happens when you're doing this work. Evaluating people's mindset, the way they talk about it, and the way they relate to evaluating the situation, I think it's a great question. It really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well.\n\nLenny (16:15):\nWe are in the final stretch now. There's only five more interview questions to go. Next up is Nikhyl Singhal, VP of Product at Facebook, also one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (16:25):\n\"What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?\" Sometimes I'll ask a manager, \"Look, you've managed hundreds of people in your career. What's conventional wisdom that you bet against, that you have found is actually inaccurate?\" And you could do that for, \"What do people think about AI that's inaccurate, that everyone believes?\" You could do that for domains. You can do all kinds of things.\n\n(16:53):\nI'm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset. Everyone always prepares for interviews, and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say. As a result, you can have high-quality people that you dismiss, because they weren't genuine.\n\n(17:19):\nThere's no way to answer that question without being genuinely opinionated. Because it starts with, 'What is the thing that you think ...? I want to sit here and then tell me why it's inaccurate.\" When I break that wall, I'm testing, is this person authentic? Because sometimes I'm dismissing them because they told me nothing new. But I don't want the interview process to penalize them, and this was my save question.\n\nLenny (17:52):\nThis next question comes from Ayo Omojola, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health, former Product Lead at Square, and also a former founder.\n\nAyo Omojola (18:01):\n\"Tell me something you did that worked out, but not for the reason that you thought it would work,\" or, \"Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work.\" A lot of my process is just teasing out introspection. It's just like, \"Are you a person who is reflective about the decisions you've made, and why they worked and why they did not, and incorporating that into your model so you make different decisions next time?\"\n\nLenny (18:21):\nNext up is Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, former Chief Product Officer of Adobe, also former Founder of Behance.\n\nScott Belsky (18:31):\nI like asking about something people have learned about themselves that reveal the limitation in how they work. It's a way to test introspection, and once this person hits their limits or struggles, can they be open and introspective, or are they going to blame and point fingers? So I do ask that.\n\n(18:49):\nI also like the question, \"Do you consider yourself lucky?\" I think it's a fascinating question, because some people who are super-insecure about where they are and how they got there and might decline admitting luck. Those who are comfortable should admit that they were lucky. I mean, I think the truth is, we're all very lucky and certainly privileged, and I just think that that's always an interesting conversation.\n\nLenny (19:18):\nOur penultimate interview question comes from Lauryn Isford, Head of Growth at Notion, former Head of Growth at Airtable.\n\nLauryn Isford (19:26):\n\"Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful.\" I'm looking for someone to help me understand how they define impact and what it means to them. I think a good answer for a growth practitioner is intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business.\n\nLenny (19:46):\nOur final interview question is actually advice for doing reference calls, which comes after finding someone great through your interview process. This comes from Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom, with a killer Irish accent.\n\nPaul Adams (20:00):\nI have to do referral calls. You're interviewing someone, you want to give them the job, and they've got referees. Of course, the referees they have are the best people that they ever worked with and their favorite managers. This question is, \"What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?\" It's an amazing question, because the person can't dodge it. There's an answer, and it's incredibly enlightening.\n\nLenny (20:23):\nAnd it's a wrap. Thank you so much for listening. I hope you found this valuable. Leave a comment either on the newsletter post, or in the YouTube comments, or even on Twitter. Let me know what you think. If there's a great response, we'll continue to do this. If not, we'll never do this again. All right, thank you. Enjoy."

We used a lot of those in the tabbed inbox by the way, one of the first early versions was actually we showed the tabbed inbox working to people. But it wasn't really Gmail, it was just a facade of HTML and behind the scenes and according to the permissions that the users gave us some of us moved just the subject and the sender into the right place. So initially the interviewer kind of distracted them and then showed them their inbox and then the top 50 messages were sorted to the right place more or less if we got it right. And people were like, \"Wow, this is actually very cool.\" But it gave us some evidence to go and say, \"Hey, we should try and build this thing.\"\n\nLenny (00:00:43):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences, building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Itamar Gilad. Itamar, is a product coach, author, speaker and former longtime product manager at Google where you worked on Gmail, identity and YouTube. He also just published an awesome new book called Evidence-Guided: Creating High-Impact Products in the Face of Uncertainty. Itamar, has an important perspective on why and also how you can push your team and organization from an opinion-based decision-making process to a more evidence guided approach. In our conversation, Itamar, shares a number of very practical and handy frameworks that do just that including the confidence meter, metrics trees, GIST and the GIST board, plus his take on how people often misuse ICE for prioritizing ideas. Also, how you could make your OKRs more effective and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Itamar Gilad, after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Ezra, the leading full body cancer screening company.\n\n(00:01:49):\nI actually used Ezra, earlier this year unrelated to this podcast completely on my own dime because my wife did one and loved it and I was super curious to see if there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes and then about a week later you get this detailed report sharing what they found in your body. Luckily, I had what they called an unremarkable screening which means they didn't find anything cancerous. But they did find some issues in my back which I'm getting checked out at a physical next month probably because I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer. Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will one third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late.\n\n(00:02:40):\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80% survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The Ezra, team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer early and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such as aneurysms, disc herniations, which may be is what I have or fatty liver disease. Ezra, scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs using a full body MRI powered by AI and just launched the world's only 30-minute full body scan which is also their most affordable. Their scans are non-invasive and radiation free and Ezra, is offering listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your scan at ezra.com/lenny. That's E-Z-R-A.com/lenny.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:04:40):\nIt's a pleasure being here, thank you for inviting me.\n\nLenny (00:04:42):\nIt's my pleasure. I thought we'd start with the story of your work on Google+ and Gmail and how those experiences formed your perspective on how to build a successful product. Can you share that story?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:04:57):\nGoogle+ was my first experience at Gmail, I joined Gmail in August 2011 and the first thing they asked me is, \"Let's connect Gmail with Google+.\" If you're hazy about the story, back then Facebook was massive. It's still massive but then it was growing like mushrooms, people were spending hours. That really freaked out Google and the obvious solution was to launch a social network of Google called Google+ and we all believe in this thing, it really caught on very well initially we all used it, we all believed in it. So our mission was to build this thing and Google really cut no costs. It created a whole new division within Google and it created a whole strategy around Google+ and we had to connect Gmail and YouTube and search to Google+ to make them more personalized in a sense and more social. So that was the idea and we went on and we launched a series of features in Gmail for a couple of years, honestly and Google+ itself became this massive project, very feature rich and with a lot of redesigns and iterations and none of it worked.\n\n(00:06:09):\nIt turned out people actually didn't need another social network, people didn't love it, people didn't use it. Eventually in Gmail we rolled back all the Google+ integration a few years later and Google+ itself was shut down in 2019. So putting aside all the tremendous waste that went into this, all the millions of person hours and personal weeks. In hindsight, not only did Google bet on the wrong thing it missed much easier opportunities. So just not far from Google's headquarters there was WhatsApp, not very famous in the US but they actually created massive impact. Hundreds of millions of people were using their stuff and they became a threat to Facebook much more than Google was. So Google missed the opportunity of social mobile apps like WhatsApp, like Snapchat, etc and for me this story kind of was the epitome of what I call today, opinion-based development. We come up with an idea, we believe in it, all the indications show it's good.\n\n(00:07:13):\nMaybe the early tests show it's good, then we just go all in and we try to implement it and I made this very mistake many times as the product manager, I was the guy pushing for the ideas. So for me, this was kind of a turning point I felt we need to adopt a different system.\n\nLenny (00:07:32):\nAnd just before you move on to the next story, how big was the team? Roughly how many years was spent on this area? Just to give people a sense of the waste as you said.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:07:41):\nSo there was a tremendous earthquake inside Google to create the Google+ team, teams and the entire divisions were kind of thrown apart and reformatted and I think at its peak it was about 1000 people inside-\n\nLenny (00:07:55):\nWow, [inaudible 00:07:56].\n\nItamar Gilad (00:07:56):\nIt was a division the size of Android and Docs and a really sizable thing, they're under their own buildings. It's taken from the playbook of Steve Jobs, create this whole secretive project inside and just run like hell.\n\nLenny (00:08:13):\nYeah. I remember though Facebook was really scared, I remember they shut everything down. It as like a code DEFCON one situation too, so it really scared Facebook at the same time.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:08:22):\nYeah, it's true. But at the end of the day, neither Google's advertising revenue was affected, neither was Facebook affected. So it turned out this idea was not that necessary after all.\n\nLenny (00:08:35):\nYeah, okay. So that's an example of something that didn't work because it was opinion based software, I think the phrase you used and then there's a different experience with tabs I think with Gmail.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:08:47):\nThat's right. So Google, is a very successful company. It's not for me to criticize it or to in hindsight kind of say you guys need to be better and some of the people that were behind Google+ was some of the smartest leaders and I still think they are despite this story. If you look back at the history of Google, how things started in the first decade or so. Google, was what I call an evidence guided company. So essentially it put a high premium on focusing on customers, coming up with a lot of ideas on looking at the data, looking at how these ideas actually worked out. They weren't shy about launching betas and things that were very rough and incomplete and learning from that and then they expected people to take action based on the results. So fail fast is a very famous paradigm and so you had to kill your project or pivot it seriously if it didn't work out and I think had we kept fail fast it would've really have helped Google+, if we had this mentality.\n\n(00:09:56):\nBut for some reason with Google+, Google put this playbook aside and used a different playbook which I call plan and execute essentially. But I think inside Google the DNA still existed. So inside Gmail, the next project after Google+ was the tabbed inbox. So it was kind of the reverse of Google+, it started as a very small idea that no one believed in and we started looking what's behind the city? What's the goal? What's the problem actually we're trying to solve? It turned out that a lot of people were receiving social notifications and promotions, etc, and most of them were very passive. They weren't clearing their inbox, they were just living in this world of clutter and I came up with an idea how to fix this. I was sure it was great, I wanted to push it, plan and execute, but my colleagues were like, \"Hold on, we actually tried this. We have a bunch of ideas to help people organize their inbox, they're not using it. Why is your idea good?\"\n\n(00:10:57):\nSo that sent us, kind of me and my team into researching these users into establishing a goal that was much more user-centric and then thinking of other ideas. And then we started testing them much more rigorously and basically we started testing on our own inboxes and then we recruited other dog footers, other Googlers to test the same inbox, then we put it outside for external testers. We did usability studies, we did data, we built a whole data mining team and a whole machine learning team to build the right categorization and we ended up with a solution that turned out to be very successful for a lot of these passive users. This was a surprise to a lot of people because most of my colleagues and most of the people I talk with actually know how to manage their inbox. So for them that solution makes complete nonsense, like splitting promotions and social to the side sounds like the stupidest idea. But there's about 85% of the population, 85 to 88% that absolutely love it and today Gmail has about 1.8 billion active users according to Gmail.\n\n(00:12:14):\nMost of these users are using this feature, so it was a pretty high impact feature as well.\n\nLenny (00:12:20):\nAnd the feature specifically, just in case people aren't totally getting it is the promotions folder and the social I think and then the regular.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:12:27):\nYeah, there are a couple more that you can enable in settings if you like.\n\nLenny (00:12:30):\nYeah, I use it, I love it. Except it puts my newsletter in people's promotions folder, who do I talk to about that?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:12:36):\nYeah. Newsletters are a very complicated scenario for the categorization engine.\n\nLenny (00:12:41):\nYeah. We just need an exception for my newsletter and then we're good. Okay, but go on.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:12:45):\nSo in hindsight I was asking and saying, \"Why was this project so different?\" And I think the reason is that we didn't have that much confidence in our opinions. We had opinions, we had ideas but we didn't just go all in and just let's build it. We actually used an evidence guided system and I think that's not unique just to Google. I think every successful product company out there that you look at Amazon, Airbnb, anyone you will check, at least in their best periods they found a way to balance human judgment with evidence. They didn't try to obliterate human judgment and opinion just to supercharge them with evidence and they came up with very different models. Apple, is another example but the principle still holds in all of these companies.\n\nLenny (00:13:33):\nAwesome. So you took that experience and all the experience you've had from coaching product leaders working with companies and you wrote this book called Evidence-Guided, which people on YouTube could see sitting there behind you. So I want to talk through some of these stories and then some of these other lessons and frameworks that emerged. But maybe just to start, what's the elevator pitch for this book?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:13:55):\nSo this is a book for people like us, product people who want to bring evidence guided thinking or modern product management if you like into their organizations. There's a lot of challenges, it's not simple, we all read the books, we all know the theory, we all know some parts of the system. It tries to give you a system how to do that, it's a meta framework that kind of helps you lift your organization in the direction of evidence guidance if that's what you want to do.\n\nLenny (00:14:23):\nSo going back to the story briefly before we get into the frameworks and lessons of the book. In the first example of Google+, basically it came top down, \"Hey, we need to build a social network, go build it.\" Obviously that happens at a lot of companies, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this. But are there cases where it does make sense to approach it that way? Obviously Apple is a classic example of Steve Jobs, is like we need to build an iPhone. I don't know if that's exactly how it went. But are there instances where it is worth just approaching new product ideas that way based on the experience and creativity and insights of the founder? Or is your thinking it should always come from this evidence-based approach?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:15:01):\nI think the founders are very important, especially in the startup and scale-ups phase. They come up with many of the most important ideas and it's super important that they have the space to express and to push the organization to look at those. However, it's not about shutting them down it's about looking at them critically. You need to create the environment in the organization where the leader comes and says, \"You know what? I talked to these three customers, I figured it out. Here's what we need to do in the next five years.\" And you need to ask, \"Where's your evidence?\" And by the way, the example you give that's a classic example. Steve Jobs, he just brainstorm in his kitchen the iPhone and then just told the team to build it. That's the story Steve Jobs, told but it's not the real story at all. Now we know what actually happened and the iPhone has actually a story of discovery, of trial and error, multiple projects to do it, multitouch with phones, most of them failed.\n\n(00:16:02):\nSteve Jobs, was the architect. He kind of managed to connect the dots and eventually come up with this perfect device but he wasn't actually the creator, it wasn't his brainchild. He was actually against it for a while but over time as he saw the evidence, as he saw what this thing can do, as he saw the demos he was able to piece together something that was very useful.\n\nLenny (00:16:26):\nThat's really important insight. People that are hearing this might feel like I like this idea of pushing back and encouraging the founders to make it more evidence guided. In the case of say Google+, was it even possible? Could you have come to Larry and Sergey and be like, \"Here's all this data I've gathered that tells us this is not going to work?\" Do you have any advice for how to push back and encourage the founders and execs to really take the counterpoint seriously or really kind of vet their idea?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:16:58):\nSo another nice thing about Google is that it's a very open culture and people are not shy to tell even Sergey and Larry that they are wrong and they do this all the time. In certain forms, right? You need to know the right channels. But there was a very big discussion about Google+ and whether it's the right thing to create a clone of Facebook, there was a very public internal discussion. I think what I would change is not have this discussion based on opinions, because when you have the discussion you come with your own opinions usually the most senior person's opinions will win. That's just the way it is. If we had come with hard data and we said, \"Listen, things are not actually panning out the way you guys are expecting. What can we do? Should we continue? Should we pivot this?\" I think the discussion would've done better. Now I'm doing a huge disservice, I was not in all the discussions. I know probably in Google+, there were very serious discussions happening along these lines.\n\n(00:18:02):\nBut it's just as a general trend, I find that evidence is very empowering for us smaller people in the organization or mid-level managers to be empowered to challenge the opinions.\n\nLenny (00:18:15):\nIs there anything tactically you found to be useful and effective in giving people, say they don't work at Google. They work at companies where founders and bosses and execs are not as open to challenge. [inaudible 00:18:26] any tactically found about how to present a counter proposal or like, \"Hey, I have this data that we should really pay attention to?\"\n\nItamar Gilad (00:18:33):\nI think if you come with data, if you run a secret experiment and you come back and you show them you usually get one of two results. Either they get extremely mad at you and they tell you to get back to work and to do what you were told and in that case, probably you need to start polishing your resume and look for another place either inside the organization or outside it because that person is not being reasonable to be honest. But the more common case is they're pleasantly surprised and that's what happened with Steve Jobs, as well. He was against phones but then people showed him all sorts of evidence that Apple can make a phone. He was against multitouch initially but then he changed his mind, there was a lot of back and forth. So even, Steve Jobs, given evidence was willing to flip and I say this in many organizations. So evidence is so powerful, that's why this is the principle I based the book on.\n\nLenny (00:19:28):\nYou have this concept of being evidence guided. People listening may feel like, \"Hey, we're evidence guided, we're in experiments, we make decisions using data.\" Oftentimes they aren't actually and so what are signs that maybe you're not actually that evidence guided or as evidence guided as you think you are?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:19:45):\nI think there's a few telltale signs that I look for, first the goals are very unclear. Either there are many or they're very kind of obscure and vague or they are about output, there's misalignment. So the goals part is not there, usually this goes hand in hand with metrics. Missing metrics or just using revenue and business metric but there's no user facing metrics. So that's another telltale sign, then there's a lot of time and effort spent on planning especially on road mapping. Creating the perfect roadmap which really can consume a lot of time of the top management and PMs, etc. Then as you go down you see there's not a lot of experimentation and if there is experimentation there's not a lot of learning and finally another telltale sign is that the team is disengaged. So the engineers are kind of getting the signal that what they need to do is deliver, they're focused on output, that's what they're measured on. So they're kind of disengaged, they're disengaged from the users, from the business, they don't care that much.\n\n(00:20:57):\nIt's usually something that you can fix by adopting a more evidence guided system.\n\nLenny (00:21:05):\nOkay. So let's dive into your approach to becoming more evidence guided. In the book, you share this model that you call the GIST model which is kind of this overarching approach to building a product that almost forces you to be more evidence guided. So let's just start with what's the simplest way to understand this GIST model?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:21:26):\nWith your permission, I can show a few slides.\n\nLenny (00:21:28):\nOh, let's do it.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:21:29):\nAnd maybe that will help.\n\nLenny (00:21:32):\nHere we go, and then yeah, a good excuse to go check this out on YouTube.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:21:36):\nAll right, you're seeing this? So this is the GIST model, goals, ideas, steps and tasks, and essentially it's tries to break the change which is a really big change for a lot of companies into four slightly more manageable parts. They're still big but each one you can tackle on its own and that's kind of the reason I kind of split it, and goals are about defining what we're trying to achieve, ideas are hypothetical ways to achieve the goals, steps are ways to implement the idea and validate it at the same time. So essentially build, measure learn loops and tasks are the things we manage in Kanban and Jira and all these good tools. These are the things that your development team is usually very focused on and just listening to this, a lot of this will sound familiar to you because GIST is not a brand new invention. It's a meta framework that puts in place a lot of existing methodologies. It's based on lean startup, on design thinking, product discovery, growth, There's a lot of all of these things here. It just tries to put them all into one framework or one model.\n\nLenny (00:22:43):\nSo what's the simplest way to think about what this model is meant for? Is this how you think about your roadmap? Is this how you plan? What is this trying to tell people to do differently in the way they build product broadly?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:22:56):\nI would say these are four areas that you need to look at and ask, are we doing the right thing in each? In each you may need to change or even transform and as I go and explain each one of those I'll give you basically three things. In each chapter in the book I try to touch on three things. The principles behind them, the frameworks or models that implement the principles and then process and the process honestly is the most brittle part and the one that you would need to change and adapt to your company. Because not two companies are exactly the same, and it's very tempting when you write a book not to give any process but that's the part that people actually want the most. So it's included as well, but just be aware that you will have to change this process.\n\nLenny (00:23:44):\nAwesome. Okay, so we're going to talk about each of these four layers. Before we do that, where do vision and strategy fit into this? Do they bucket into one of these four layers and how do you think about strategy and vision?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:23:55):\nThat's a great question, so there's this whole strategic context that is outside of GIST. GIST, is not trying to tackle that, it assumes it's in place, there's another huge blob which is research. GIST, is not about research it's more about discovery and delivery. But strategy is extremely important and you can use some of the tools we will talk about to develop your strategy as well. In many companies the strategy is just a roadmap on steroids, it's small plan and execute just on a grand scale and Google+ again, was a strategic choice actually if you think about it. So in the book there is a chapter where I touch on strategy and I explain how the same evidence guided methods are being used by companies to develop their strategy as well.\n\nLenny (00:24:43):\nAwesome, maybe one last context question. So people might be seeing this and thinking okay cool, I have goals, I have ideas steps, I have tasks, I'm already doing this. What is this kind of a counter or reaction to? What are people probably missing when they're seeing this and they're like, \"Oh, I see. This is like what we're not doing and this is the most important, this is something we should probably change.\" And we'll go through these in detail too.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:25:03):\nI think talking about each one will help.\n\nLenny (00:25:06):\nOkay, let's do it.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:25:09):\nBut we can talk about in each level what's actually being done. So when people say I have goals, usually they take the goals layer and use it as a planning session. They talk about what shall we build by when, what are the resources? And that's actually not goals at all, that's planning work.\n\nLenny (00:25:26):\nCool, let's talk about goals and I know part of this is OKRs related too, so I'm excited to hear your take on OKRs.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:25:33):\nOh, that's a whole different discussion. You had, Christina, the real expert over there so I doubt I can add more to that. But it's true OKR is all part of it, but let's start with goals. What's our goals supposed to be? Goals are supposed to paint the end state to define where we want to end up and the evidence will not guide you unless you know where you want to go, and in many companies what you have is goals at the top for revenue, market share, whatever it is, and then a bunch of siloed goals for each department. There's engineering goals, there's design goals, there's marketing goals, etc, and that actually pushes people into different vectors and it's really hard to decide. I would argue that in evidence guided companies, and you've worked for a few so probably you've seen this. They use models in order to construct overarching goals for the entire organization. One of the models I show in the chapter about goals is the value exchange loop.\n\n(00:26:34):\n Where basically the organization is trying to deliver as much value as it can to the market and to capture as much value back, and by creating a feedback loop between these two you are actually able to grow very fast. Now, I would argue that you want to measure both of these and to put a metric on each and the metric we usually use to measure value delivered is called the North Star metric. I know you wrote an article, a very good article about it.\n\nLenny (00:27:01):\nThank you.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:27:02):\nAnd in it you listed dozens and dozens of companies, like leading companies and what they considered the North Star metric is super interesting. I would argue that what they told you is what is the most important metrics we measure? What is the number one metric for us? But it's not what I call the North Star metric, the North Star metric measures how much value we create for the market. For example, let's take WhatsApp. WhatsApp for a very long time measured messages sent because every message sent is a little incremental of value for the sender, the receiver, it's free, it's rich media, you can send it for anywhere in the world, compared to SMS that's huge value. So if in year one we have a billion messages being sent in year two, two billion probably we doubled the amount of value. In Airbnb, I think one of your key metrics or the real North Star metric was nights booked. I don't know if it was still the case while you were there?\n\nLenny (00:27:55):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:27:56):\nAnd there are examples like this in Amplitude for example, they measure active learning users or weekly active learning users. Which are users that found in the tool some insight that was so important that they shared it with at least two other users and they consume it. So it's a very powerful thing to point at this metric and say, \"This is the most important metric combined with the value metric that we want to capture, revenue, market share, whatever it is.\" Once you have these two, you can further break them down into what I call metrics trees. So there's a metric three for the North Star metric and there's the metric three for the top KPI, the top business metric which you see here on the left side in blue and usually they overlap. So you might find in the middle some metrics that are super, super important because moving them actually moves the needle on everything else.\n\nLenny (00:28:57):\nCan you clarify again the difference between what you call this top KPI versus North Star metric?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:29:02):\nSo the North Star metric is measuring how much value we're creating for the user, the core value that they're getting. In this case this is some productivity suite, so this is number of documents created per month for example. Because we think that every document created maybe it's a small document, I don't know. AI is in fashion now, is a little incremental value, so that's the number we're trying to grow. The top KPI is what we expect to get, it should be revenue or profit.\n\nLenny (00:29:31):\nI see, this is the value exchange. I see, one is what users are getting, one is what you're getting back from them.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:29:36):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:29:37):\nBasically how the business is benefiting. Awesome. I think this is a really important concept, the metric tree. I think a lot of people think they have something like this in mind where they're just like, \"Cool, here's our North Star Metric, here's the levers and things that we can work on to move that.\" But I think actually mapping it out the way you have it here where it kind of goes layers and layers deep to all of the different variables that impact this metric. Not only is it a way to think about impact and goals and things like that, but also helps you estimate the impact of the experiment you're potentially thinking about running. So if you're going to work on something at the bottom here like activation rate, say you move that 10%. How much is that going to impact this global metric? It's probably a very small amount.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:30:19):\nThis is a very important one and we'll talk about impact assessment shortly, this helps with it. It also helps with alignment because the entire organization is trying to move these two metrics, it's the two sides of our mission essentially. We have the mission that's the top objective of the company and these are the two top most key results if you like, the top most things. So when you go and work with another team and you say, \"Hey, why don't you work on my project?\" They might say, \"This idea actually might move the North Star metric model in your idea.\" And that helps you guys align and I've seen cases where team B put aside their own ideas to jump on the ideas of team A, because of this model. It also creates an opportunity to give some sub metrics to teams to own on an ongoing basis, so it creates a little sense of ownership as well and mission within the tree.\n\nLenny (00:31:10):\nIt also helps you figure out what teams you should have, which teams have the biggest potential to impact the metric.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:31:18):\nAnother thing that happens in a lot of organizations, the team topology reflects the structure of the software or some hierarchical model where we want to organize the organization in a particular way. But if you start with a metrics tree, you can try to arrange the topology around goals and sometimes you need to readjust. It's not a constant reorg but from time to time you will realize the goals have changed and we need to reorganize, so the tree helps visualize that as well.\n\nLenny (00:31:49):\nI think for people that are listening to this and thinking about this, I think the simplest way to even think about this is basically there's a math formula that equals your North Star metric or your revenue or whatever you're trying to do and if you don't have some ideally really clear sense of what that math formula is you should work on that. Because that will inform so much of how you think about where to invest, what teams to have, where to invest more resources, less resources.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:32:13):\nRight.\n\nLenny (00:32:15):\nImagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies Webflow and Census are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team, for Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4 they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech LinkedIn, generated two to five X higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn, have two times the buying power of the average web audience and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in.\n\n(00:33:20):\nMake B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign, just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny, terms and conditions apply. Okay. So metrics trees, what comes next?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:33:39):\nAll right. So next we need to go to the ideas layer and the ideas layer is there to help us sort through the many ideas we might encounter and they may come from as you said the founders, the managers, the stakeholders, from the team, from research, from competitors. We're flooded with ideas, and what usually happens inside organization is some sort of battle of opinions or some sort of politics sometimes or highest paid person's opinion. You had, Ronny Kohavi, who invented this term in your show. What doesn't happen is very rational, logical decisions these are the best ideas, because it's really, really hard to predict honestly. There is so much uncertainty in the needs of the users, in the changes in the market, in our technology, in our product, in our own organization. It's almost impossible to say this idea is going to be the best, but we do say this because we have cognitive biases that kind of convince us that this idea is far superior to anything else and it's definitely the right choice.\n\n(00:34:48):\nIn order to avoid this, what we want to do is to evaluate the ideas in a much more objective and consistent and transparent way. In the book I suggest using ICE, impact, confidence and ease. I think I have a slide coming on this. So impact, confidence and ease which is basically a way to assign three values to each idea. The impact tries to assess how much impact it'll have on the goals and that's why it's so important that we have very clear goals and not many. How we are measuring the ideas on the North Star metric, on the top business KPI, on a local metric of the team. Whatever it is, let's be clear about it and then let's evaluate the ideas against this thing. Ease, is basically the opposite of effort. How easy or hard it's going to be, but both of those are guesstimates, both of those are things we need to estimate. I would argue that just by breaking the question to these two questions we usually have a slightly better discussion than just my idea is better than yours.\n\n(00:35:52):\nBut then there's the third element which is confidence, which tries to assess how sure are we or should we be about our first guesstimates about the impact and the ease.\n\nLenny (00:36:03):\nIt's interesting you use the word ease, because I think it's usually effort. You kind of make it positive, is that an intentional tweak you made?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:36:12):\nI'm using the definitions of, Sean Ellis. Sean, invented ICE. You know Sean, I don't know if you've had him yet? But he's-\n\nLenny (00:36:21):\nI haven't had him on yet.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:36:23):\nYeah. For the people who don't know him, Sean, is amazing. He's like one of the fathers of the growth movement, he coined the term growth hacking and he popularized the concept of product market fit.\n\nLenny (00:36:36):\nYeah.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:36:36):\nHe created ICE, he created a bunch of things that we use in product that we don't even know.\n\nLenny (00:36:40):\nWow, I didn't know he came up with ICE. Okay, cool. So the original version of ICE is ease instead of effort.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:36:45):\nExactly, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:36:45):\nFun fact.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:36:47):\nA lot of your viewers are wondering where's the R because there's another variant of this culture. RICE, where there's rich as well. I prefer ICE because I prefer to fold the rich into the I for various reasons but both are valid, both are equivalent in a sense.\n\nLenny (00:37:04):\nI'm in your boat, that's exactly how I think about it. I think people over complicate this stuff and try to get so many math formulas involved with estimating impact, and I feel like these are just simple heuristics to kind of bubble the best ideas to the top. It doesn't have to be a perfect estimate of impact and confidence and all those things, so I think the simpler is better and it always ends up being a spreadsheet. People always have these tools to estimate these things but it's like a spreadsheet, Google Sheets. Great.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:37:28):\nSo yeah, you're actually leading me to my next point. So when you come to estimate impact you will realize it's the hardest part. So sometimes it's just a gut feeling and it's a guess and sometimes it's based on some spreadsheet or some analysis and the back of envelope calculation you've done and I think that's legitimate. Sometimes these things do show you some things you didn't think of and sometimes the best case it's based on tests. You actually tested it, you interviewed 12 customers, you show them the thing and out of those only one actually liked it. You should reduce your impact based on that usually, or you do other types of tests. We'll talk about testing in a second. What happens is that people tend to just go with gut instinct and then give themselves a high confidence. They say it's an eight and I'm pretty convinced, so it's eight for confidence and I found this a bit disturbing because it kind of subverts the whole system.\n\n(00:38:22):\nSo I wanted to help people realize when they have strong evidence in support of their guesses and when it's weak evidence, how to calculate confidence in a sense. For that I created a tool called the confidence meter, which you can see here this colorful thing and should I go and explain it?\n\nLenny (00:38:41):\nYeah, let's do it. And then again, if you're just listening to this you can check this out on YouTube and you can see the actual slide.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:38:47):\nAll right, awesome. So basically I constructed it a bit like a thermo meter. It goes from very low confidence which is the blue area or the upper right, all the way to high confidence which is the red area and you can see the numbers going from zero to 10. Where zero is very low confidence, we don't know basically anything we're just guessing in the dark and 10 is full confidence. You know for sure this thing is a success, no doubt about it and across the circle I put various classes of evidence you might find along the way. So for example, starting at the top right, all of these blue areas about opinions. It could be your own self-confidence in the idea, your self conviction, you feel it's a great idea. Guess what? Behind every terrible idea that was ever someone thought it was great, that gives you 0.01 out of 10. Maybe you created a shiny pitch deck or a six-page document that explains in detail why this is a great idea. Slightly harder to do but still very low confidence, maybe you connected it to some theme, it's about the blockchain...\n\n(00:39:59):\nWell sorry, the blockchain is out of fashion. What's hot right now?\n\nLenny (00:39:59):\nAI.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:40:04):\nExactly, AI. It's about AI, that makes it a good idea? Absolutely not. Or the strategy of the company, that's another thematic support. Thousands and thousands of terrible ideas are being implemented right now as we speak based on these themes. So all these things combined can give you a maximum 0.1 out of 10 according to the tool, if you follow it then we move into slightly harder tests. One is reviewing it with your colleagues, your managers, your stakeholders the idea. They don't know it either, they don't have a crystal ball, they're usually not the users, they cannot predict. But they can evaluate it in a slightly more objective way and maybe find flaws in your idea. On the other hand groups tend to have biases too, politics group thing. So groups can actually arrive sometimes with worse decisions than individuals, there's some research to that. Next, our estimates and plans. So you may do some sort of back of the envelope calculation or your colleagues might go out and try to evaluate the ease a little bit better.\n\n(00:41:07):\nThat gives you a little bit more confidence, but still we're at the level of guesswork at this point. Next we're moving to data and data could be anecdotal. So you find a few data points dotted across your data or you talk to a handful of customers or maybe one competitor has that same idea. In many companies I meet, if the leading competitor has this feature and we think it's a good idea validation is done. Let's launch it, that's it. It's a great idea, we need to do it. It never works honestly, you should not assume that your competitor actually knows what they're doing anymore than you do. Data could be also what I call market data. That comes from surveys, from assessing a lot of your data by doing a deep competitive analysis and there are other methods where you create a larger dataset and you contrast your idea against it. Finally, to gain medium and high confidence you really need to build your idea and test it and that's where the red area is.\n\n(00:42:11):\nSo there's various forms of tests, we'll talk about them if we have time and they give you various levels of confidence.\n\nLenny (00:42:19):\nAwesome, this is a very cool visual. We'll link to a image of this in the show notes too if people want to check it out. I think what's awesome about this is you could just use this as a little tool on your team of just like where are we along the spectrum? We think the impact of this is very high. But we're probably in this blue area of confidence and so let's just make sure we understand that and it's really clear language to help people understand. I see if we had this, it'd be a lot more confident.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:42:45):\nSo you can also tie your investment into the idea based on the level of confidence you had found essentially, so early on you want to do the cheap stuff just to gain more confidence and then you can go and invest more. If it's a really cheap idea, you can jump to a high confidence idea, you can test, you can do an AB experiment. Early adopter program, whatever it is and then launch it. Some ideas you don't need to test, sometimes the expert opinion is enough. If you're just changing the order of the settings, no one sees this or no one will be impacted. The risk is low, you can launch it without testing. So part of the trick is also knowing when to stop, not just trying to force your way all the way up when you don't have to.\n\nLenny (00:43:31):\nThat's a really important point. The other important point here is just a big part of a PM's job is to say no and to stop stupid shit from happening and this is an awesome tool to help you do that. To be like, okay, here's this idea you have, just like let's just be real, how confident are we in this? And, okay, it's going to take us three months to do this. Maybe we should think about something different, maybe we should work up the confidence meter before we actually commit to this.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:43:56):\nYeah. This is a real world usage that I hear about a lot, some people use this to kind of do... An objective way to say no and gently. Or to say we'll think about it but look at these other ideas we have and how their impacting is and confidence stack up.\n\nLenny (00:44:12):\nClassic PM move, just like that was a great idea but what about this better idea? Coming back to something that we talked a bit about at the beginning, say you have a founder who's actually very smart and experienced. Say even at a startup where you don't really have the time to build tons of evidence for ideas. Do you have a different perspective on how much time to spend building confidence in ideas versus just like cool, they actually have really good ideas let's just see what happens?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:44:41):\nSo there's always like a trade-off between speed of delivery and speed of discovery, and that actually leads to the next layer of how do we combine the two? Because people tend to think it's an either/or. Either we are building very fast or we are learning and then we're building very slow, but I think we're using the wrong metric. The metric is not how fast can we get the bits into production, when there's a lot of uncertainty and we all face uncertainty and startup especially. It's not about getting the bits to production, it's about getting the right bits to production. It's about creating the outcomes that you need, the impact, and so it's about time to outcomes and I would argue that the evidence guided method is far more impactful. It's far faster, it's far more resource efficient than the opinion-based method. Because opinion-based methods tend to waste a lot more of your resources, building the wrong things or discovering, learning too late. Well, evidence guided helps you learn earlier.\n\n(00:45:50):\nPlus it is a fallacy that if you learn you don't build, good teams know how to do both at the same time and that's actually what the steps layer is meant to teach you or to help you do.\n\nLenny (00:46:03):\nAwesome. So maybe just to close off that loop, say someone listening is at a bigger company, say Netflix versus a series A, series B or startup. Is there something you'd recommend about them approaching this differently? Any kind of guidance there of just how to take what you're sharing differently if you're a different source of companies like that?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:46:23):\nAbsolutely. I think the concept we talked about of the North Star metric, the value created versus the value captured is very important in every company. Building your entire metrics trees, maybe overkill, doing heavy weighted OKRs may be overkill for early stage. Early stage companies even don't know how they create value, so they need to iterate and their goals is really to find product market fit. Beyond that, what happens is that you need to start building your business model. So that's your goal and you iterate towards that and you need to put metrics on that and then when you move into scale, you need to try to create order because when you scale up... And all of this is covered in the book, there's a special chapter just about these questions. When you scale up, you get a lot of people and a lot of money and everything is happening at the same time. So there you need a order of evaluating ideas in a very systematic way. In a company like Netflix, by the way I don't know if they need this specific method. They're very-\n\nLenny (00:47:27):\nYeah, maybe that was a bad example. They're probably doing things pretty well.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:47:30):\nOne thing I discovered by the way, there's two types of companies that really benefit from this technique. One is those companies that are kind of emerging into modern product development. They have product teams, they have product managers, they have OKRs, they're starting to do Agile. But they're starting to do experimentation, but they're struggling to put it all together. Every CPO is building their own little framework and the other type is those companies that used to be evidence guided and they regressed and that happens way too often. Change of management, change of culture, and then all of a sudden they need to rediscover, to rekindle that spirit that was lost along Google+. So some of the people that actually respond to the strongest are actually surprisingly in these companies.\n\nLenny (00:48:19):\nWhat I love about your frameworks and kind of all these things we're talking about is these are just a... You can almost think of them as a grab bag set of tools to make you more evidence guided as a company. You could start with thinking about the confidence meter, you could start using ICE more. You could start using the metrics tree and all these things just push you closer and closer to being more evidence guided, you don't have to adopt this whole thing all at once.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:48:41):\nAbsolutely. I would recommend that you don't try because if the transformation is way too big, you will get fatigued and you will just create a lot of process for a lot of people and you would not see the results and after a quarter you'll give up. So exactly what you suggested is the right approach.\n\nLenny (00:48:57):\nWhat would be the first thing you'd suggest if people were trying to move closer to being less opinion oriented and more evidence-based? Which of these frameworks or models would you recommend first?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:49:06):\nI recommend that they discuss internally where is the biggest problem that they're facing. If the goals are unclear, there's misalignment, we keep chasing the wrong things, start at the goals layer. Try to establish your North Star metric, your top business metric, your metrics trees, start assigning teams with their own area of responsibility. If you're spending a lot of time in debates and you're constantly fighting and changing your mind. Start with the ideas there and establish impact is confidence or whatever prioritization model you like, but involve evidence in it. I think the confidence meter is a good tool to use irrespective. If you're building too much and you're not learning enough, start adopting the steps layer which we haven't seen yet and if your team is very disengaged. You have one of these teams where the developers are very into Agile, very into quality, very into launching things, start working on the tasks there.\n\nLenny (00:50:10):\nAwesome. Okay, let's keep going.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:50:13):\nAll right, so steps. Steps are about kind of helping us learn and build at the same time as we said and one of the patterns I see is that organizations don't know that they can actually learn at a much lower cost. They believe they need to build this elaborate MVP which is not minimal in any way and then launch it and then they will discover it and basically it's what we used to call beta 20 years ago but just with a different name. What I'm trying to do here in the steps layer is to help companies realize there's a gamut of ways to validate your ideas or more specifically to validate the assumptions in your idea and I created a little model for this, it's called after assessment fact finding, tests, experiments and release results. But again, it's just putting together things that much smarter people invented. So in assessment you have very easy things, things that don't require a lot of work. You check if it aligns with the goals, this idea that you have in your hand.\n\n(00:51:14):\nYou do maybe some business modeling, you do ICE analysis, you do Assumption Mapping which is great tool by, David J. Blend, or you talk to your stakeholders one-on-one just to see if there are any risks, etc. These are usually not expensive things and they can teach you an awful lot about the impact and the ease of your idea. The next step is to dig data and usually that goes hand in hand with this. So you can find data in your data analysis through surveys, through competitive analysis, through user interviews and through field research, observing your users. Obviously these last two are pretty expensive, so it's often good not to wait until you have the idea and then start doing your research. It's best to keep doing your research ongoing and then you have some sort of data to lie on and to compare your idea against. But until now we didn't build anything, now you're ready to start testing, building versions of the product and putting them in front of users and measuring the results. But initially you don't build anything, you fake it.\n\n(00:52:18):\nYou do a fake door test, you do a smoke test, Wizard of Oz test, a concierge test, usability test. We used a lot of those in the tabbed inbox by the way, one of the first early versions was actually we showed the tabbed inbox working to people. But it wasn't really Gmail, it was just a facade of HTML and behind the scenes and according to the permissions that the users gave us. Some of us moved just the subject and the sender into the right place. So initially the interviewer distracted them and then showed them their inbox and in it the top 50 messages were sorted to the right place, more or less if we got it right and people were like, \"Wow, this is actually very cool.\" And that gave us a lot of evidence.\n\nLenny (00:53:02):\nThat's an awesome story. So that was in the user research, it wasn't rolled out to people? It was a manual individual?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:53:08):\nThere wasn't a single line of code written, this was just cooked up by the researchers and our designers. But it gave us some evidence to go and say, we should try and build this thing.\n\nLenny (00:53:19):\nLove that.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:53:21):\nSo initially you fake it, mid-level tests are about building a rough version of it, it's not complete, it's not polished, it's not scalable, but it's good enough to give to users to start using. So those are early adopter programs, alphas, longitudinal user studies and fish food. Fish food is testing on your own team.\n\nLenny (00:53:40):\nFish food? I haven't heard that term before. So it's dog fooding, but more local to your team.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:53:46):\nI think it's a Googly thing, but some people told me that they use fish food as well in their company the name. So I'm using it, I don't know if there's a better name for it.\n\nLenny (00:53:54):\nI wonder why it's called fish food, because it's like little? It's like little gentle little clicks?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:53:58):\nIt could be. Yeah, I don't know.\n\nLenny (00:54:00):\nWow. Okay, super cool. I'm learning a lot here.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:54:03):\nSo the next stage is to actually build a kind of more complete version of this and then you can dog food it, then you can give this to your users internally. When I joined Microsoft many years ago, the first thing I noticed was that Outlook was very buggy and I asked people what's going on? And they told me we are all dog fooding the next version of Outlook that hasn't come out yet and that's a very common practice in Silicon Valley. You can do previews, you can do betas, you can do labs, so those are tests. Now, there's a special class of tests which are experiments because they have a control element. So AB tests, multivariate tests, those are all experiments. I'm using the word experiment the way data scientists use it, although people tend to call experiments to everything that you see here and finally, even the release you can do stage release, you can do percent launches, you can do hold backs. All of these things help you further validate your assumptions. Sometimes you need to roll back and change things, but it's another opportunity to learn.\n\n(00:55:06):\nSo the key point is you don't have to start at the right-hand side, which is expensive. You can start early on and that leads to poking a lot of ideas very quickly. You realize they're not as good as you thought, and then you can invest more effort into the good ideas. If they generate positive evidence, you can go further and further until that point where you feel you're ready for delivery.\n\nLenny (00:55:29):\nOkay. So we've talked about goals, we've talked about ideas, we're talking about steps here. Is there anything else along steps? And then next I know comes tasks.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:55:37):\nNo, this is it for steps. There's a lot more with this, we will not go into all of it.\n\nLenny (00:55:42):\nOkay, that sounds good. Let's talk about tasks and what you mean there.\n\nItamar Gilad (00:55:46):\nAll right, awesome. So in many organizations there's these two worlds. There's the planning world where basically you have the managers, the stakeholders, some of the PMs really sit and think about what we need to launch and that's where we create the strategies and the roadmaps and the projects. But guess who is not invited to the party? The people who are actually doing the work. They live in Agile world, they're very focused on moving tickets to the done state, on completing burning story points, pushing stuff into production and there's a big gap between these two worlds. They don't understand each other, they don't see eye to eye, there's a lot of mistrust being built sometimes against the plans or the managers feels that the teams are just not being very effective. We've seen all of this and the solution, the stop gap is to put a PM in the middle. The PM is supposed to make all of this work, deliver on the roadmap like a project manager, feed the Agile machine with perfectly prioritized product backlogs and stories and it just doesn't work honestly.\n\n(00:56:50):\nAnd the PMs I meet are very tired and they have to spend so much time in planifications and roadmap discussions and they're very busy, they don't have time to do research or to test ideas. So I suggest changing this and bringing the developers a little bit out of their Agile cage if you like and no disrespect to Agile, it's a great thing but let's let them do more than just develop. Let's let them discover as well and one of the tools I suggest and again this is a process is what I call the GIST board. So it's basically the top three layers of GIST. The goals are on the right, these are just the key results usually per team I suggest not more than four. So you create a GIST board per team, then the ideas we're working on right now sometimes with our ICE scores and then the next few steps that we might want to pursue in order to validate these ideas and this is a very dynamic thing.\n\n(00:57:48):\nIt changes all the time, the team leads need to update it and the team needs to meet around it at least once every other week to think to talk about what's going on. Are we still following the right ideas? How are we doing on the goals? What are the next steps? What's blocking us from completing the most important steps? And this is a discussion that is not happening today, because most of the discussion happens at the roadmap level and then there's a lot of discussion at the task level. But this middle layer of what actually are we trying to achieve and how well are we doing on it doesn't exist. If you do have this, you create a lot more context in the minds of your team and then they need to ask you fewer questions. You need to tell them less what to do. They know what's success and they are able to actually do a lot more on their own.\n\nLenny (00:58:37):\nIs the way to think about the GIST board as the way you should be road roadmapping or is this more of a strategy framework to think about why you should be prioritizing broadly?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:58:48):\nThe way I say this is at the beginning of the quarter, the team defines its goals. The leads of the team define the goals, but they review it with the team, they review it with the managers, of course with the stakeholders. Everyone's in agreement, these are the maximum four key results and the one or two objectives you guys need to work on, teams cannot deliver on more than that. You copy these key results into the GIST board, then you start looking at your idea bank or you start generating ideas and say, how can we achieve these key results?\n\nLenny (00:59:18):\nAnd to clarify the thing you copy is the key result as the goal?\n\nItamar Gilad (00:59:22):\nYes, exactly. You can write the objectives alongside that to remind people what are we trying to achieve, but the key results are the thing we show here. Then you pick some ideas, the ones that look most promising and as unintuitive as it sounds or counterintuitive as this sounds I would recommend that you let the team pick these ideas. The manager of the stakeholders can propose the ideas, everyone can propose, but the team should use the ICE process to kind of... And especially the product manager is very important here to choose which ideas to test first. Then the team together needs to develop which steps should we run, how can we validate this? Some of the steps will be done by the PM, some by the data analyst, some by the user researcher. But some will involve the team, there'll be some coding, there'll be some running of experiments and so there's some ownership around the steps. A sub team owns each one of these steps and we will change the board very actively.\n\n(01:00:24):\nSo if an idea turns out to be bad we will take it off the board and put another idea in this place or maybe we achieve the goal, we don't need to work on this anymore, we can focus something else. So it's a project management tool in a sense.\n\nLenny (01:00:36):\nAwesome. So I'm looking at it and I think maybe the most important piece of this is that steps aren't just like a project, like launch a better onboarding or add the step to onboarding. It's you want to emphasize the steps that you're going to take to get to more and more confidence essentially, and more and more evidence guided thinking versus just, \"Well, let's figure out how to launch this feature idea.\"\n\nItamar Gilad (01:01:03):\nExactly. It's not a engineering milestone or a design milestone, it's a learning milestone. So we build something and along the way we actually grow the scope of what we build. We are building the product in the process and we learn, so the two have to come hand in hand.\n\nLenny (01:01:20):\nAnd for folks that aren't watching this on YouTube, just to walk through an example, we'll do it real quick. So one of your goals here is average onboarding time, you want your goal to be the average onboarding time less than two days, currently five and a half days. An idea there is an onboarding wizard, and then the steps are a usability test with mockups and then a usability test as a prototype and then an AB test?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:01:42):\nYeah, basically, and you can alter this as you go along. Sometimes you can run multiple steps in parallel it's not always sequential. But that's basically the process, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:01:53):\nAwesome. So again, what you're trying to emphasize here as a team is just we're not just going to launch this onboarding wizard and we're not going to figure it out later. It's like let's be upfront about the steps we're going to take to build more and more confidence. This is something we should keep investing more and more in, which is really interesting.\n\nItamar Gilad (01:02:09):\nYeah, and another interesting thing that happens every time you run a step if it's successful you have evidence and you can go back to the managers and tell them and share and say, \"With this idea we thought it was great, but we got this result. What do you think that means?\" And sometimes that manager that propose it would say, \"I think the test failed, let's rerun it.\" Or sometimes they will say, \"Maybe it's not as strong as I thought. The discussion just becomes that much more nuanced and objective if you like.\n\nLenny (01:02:42):\nMaybe just to close out this framework. How does this relate to a roadmap that they may have in a spreadsheet or in Jira or in Asana or something like that. Does this sit on top of that? Is this replacing a roadmap somewhere else?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:02:54):\nI would say that release roadmaps where you are just saying by Q3 we want to launch this or by October we have to launch that, they're kind of competing with this. If you're doing that and people know that the goal is to launch that thing by October, forget about learning, forget about evidence guided, I recommend using outcome roadmaps saying by October we want to achieve this outcome. By Q4 we want to launch in another three countries, or we want to grow our usage in India by that much, by this time we need to tackle the problem of churn and how we achieve this. Sometimes we know we have a concrete idea that is high confidence that we already tested, we switch into delivery, then we can put it on the roadmap and say, \"Yeah, we're going to build this thing and we'll aim for October.\" But otherwise you want to keep it open and the roadmaps can kind of suffocate this process if you decide upfront with low confidence that this particular idea must be launched.\n\nLenny (01:04:04):\nOkay. So you're proposing people switch the roadmapping practice to this, which is very ambitious. I love it.\n\nItamar Gilad (01:04:10):\nWell, this is not a roadmap. This is just a tool for the team to manage the project, but I have a proposal for outcome roadmaps inside the book.\n\nLenny (01:04:20):\nOkay, awesome. Okay. So I was going to ask if people wanted to try this approach, the book is the best way to fully understand the framework and how implement it.\n\nItamar Gilad (01:04:30):\nThat's one way. I have articles, I have resources on my site, but I try to condense much of what we just discussed in a lot more nuance in the book. So if you are interested in that, I would give it a go.\n\nLenny (01:04:45):\nAwesome. Maybe just on the topic of OKRs real quick. How do OKRs connect to all this? It sounds like broadly you kind of assume people will keep working on here's our metric or key results or objectives and then that plugs into this kind of GIST framework.\n\nItamar Gilad (01:05:01):\nSo the metrics trees, plus your mission, plus the individual missions of the teams give you most of what you need to populate your OKRs. There's of course a process of alignment, top down, bottom up, side to side, which I talk a little bit about as well. OKRs is a very rich topic, but those things are usually the core. There's usually some other OKRs that's about the health of the company, the health of the product, etc. Those are called supplementary OKRs, I talk about those as well. So yeah, I think OKRs are a helpful tool if you like them.\n\nLenny (01:05:37):\nAnd just zooming out again. Basically you don't need to take all of these ideas and lump them all together and change the way you work as a business. You can start with picking some of these ideas and starting to become more and more evidence guided. It sounds like this GIST board isn't where you probably want to start, but maybe it's once you have more and more experience using some of these tools or you tell me. Do you sometimes go straight to this way of thinking about the roadmap and the plan?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:06:04):\nSo it might not be the full board because you're missing some of the pieces, maybe your goals are not as good or your idea prioritization isn't as good. But if your team is very, very delivery focused and sometimes it's also the opposite. The managers are telling them how to build and you want to break this kind of dynamic, you want to create a step backlog. So instead of a product backlog, let's create a backlog of steps which are just validation steps, betas and previews, etc, and that changes the dynamic pretty strongly.\n\nLenny (01:06:39):\nSo by the time this podcast comes out, the book will be out. What is the best place to find the book?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:06:44):\nHopefully on Amazon, you can search for it. You can go to my site, itamargilad.com and it'll be presented prominently there and there's also the book landings page where you'll find everything you need to know about the book, evidenceguided.com.\n\nLenny (01:06:59):\nWell, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:07:03):\nYes, let's go.\n\nLenny (01:07:04):\nWhat are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:07:07):\nSo I'm going to cheat, I'm going to recommend a series of books so two series. One is the-\n\nLenny (01:07:12):\nCheating is allowed.\n\nItamar Gilad (01:07:13):\nAll right, cool. One, and those are obvious one. One is the series published by SVPG, Silicon Valley Product Group. So INSPIRED, EMPOWERED, now I think TRANSFORMED has come out, I haven't read it yet but I'm sure it's amazing. So this is Marty Cagan and his colleagues, they write some tremendous books and every product manager should read them. The other series, a bit older, this is the Lean series, The Lean Startup, Lean Enterprise, Lean Analytics, there's gold in all these books, Lean UX, really, really important books and I think they're not as appreciated as they should. Running Lean, that's another example.\n\nLenny (01:07:54):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:07:57):\nI'm not really a big TV or movie buff, I just put on whatever comes up. I'm discovering that YouTube is actually becoming one of my sources of information entertainment. I'm learning a lot of Spanish recently, so I discovered this channel called Dreaming Spanish which is if you're learning Spanish it's incredible. So that's my recommendation.\n\nLenny (01:08:19):\nThat's a unique choice, I love it. Favorite interview question you like to ask candidates.\n\nItamar Gilad (01:08:24):\nI like to ask them to design something for a niche audience. So a navigation system for elderly people or some sort of laptop for people with vision impairment, etc. So those are good questions to see their customer empathy, their creativity, their ability to evaluate multiple ideas, their ability to find flaws in their own ideas. So there's a lot of room to dig in there and kind of see how this person is thinking as a product person.\n\nLenny (01:08:57):\nWhat is a favorite product you recently discovered that you love?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:09:00):\nIt's a cliche, but it's AI. There's a company called ElevenLabs, that do voices and the best voices, synthetic voices you heard, but they can also replicate your own voice so you can create a voice signature. If you're American you can use their kind of default free version or cheap version to replicate your own voice and that could be pretty useful if you need to narrate an audiobook or do some online course. So I'm finding this service very interesting.\n\nLenny (01:09:36):\nThis is all part of my big retirement plan, find all of these components together that can replace me eventually. You got AI generating content, we'll have this voice thing. I love it, it's all happening.\n\nItamar Gilad (01:09:45):\nThere's an AI version of you, right? I can ask you questions now with-\n\nLenny (01:09:48):\nOh, there is lennybot.com.\n\nItamar Gilad (01:09:50):\nRight.\n\nLenny (01:09:51):\nIt's all part of the plan. Okay. What is a favorite life motto that you repeat most to yourself that you share with others?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:09:59):\nThat's a big one. Albert Einstein I think said, \"Strive not to be a success, but to be of value.\" And I think that's a great motto for people and for companies. It's something that kind of guides me and this whole concept of the value exchange, etc, is kind of loosely connected to that.\n\nLenny (01:10:19):\nI love that, that's such a important point for people putting out content online. So many people are just like, I just want to be successful, get followers, here's all these things I'm tweeting and showing and the thing that actually works is deliver value, create valuable stuff that people really value and want. I find the signal for that is, do you find it interesting and valuable? If you're like, \"Oh wow, that's really interesting.\" Oftentimes other people are going to find it interesting. So I love that, great choice, I'm going to look at that one up. Two more questions. What's the most valuable lesson you learned from your mom or your dad?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:10:53):\nI think both of them in their own way, they had relatively modest jobs, teaching or doing other things, but they always strived again to be the best they can and to deliver the most value they can. So it's very connected somehow, maybe I'm seeing the world through this lens. But they kind of taught me to strive to be the best I can at what I do.\n\nLenny (01:11:19):\nThe final question, you're Israeli for folks that can't tell. What is your favorite Israeli food that people should definitely check out or I try to get whenever they can?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:11:29):\nWhen I arrive in Israel I usually go for shawarma, which is like döner kebab if you know it, it's just better. So if you're in Israel, if you go visit Haifa, which is the city where I grew up definitely check out the shawarma.\n\nLenny (01:11:44):\nAwesome. Itamar, I hope people got the gist of your book from our conversation. What's the best way to find it? What's the best way to learn about you and reach out if they want to ask any questions? And then also, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nItamar Gilad (01:11:56):\nTo find it you can go to itamargilad.com or to evidenceguided.com, and you'll find a book and you'll find me. Best value to me, try it out, just take some of these ideas, bring them back to your office, talk with your colleagues, say what do you think we should do about this? Just give it a go and reach back to me, tell me I'm easy to find in my website. Tell me what happened I'm really interested.\n\nLenny (01:12:22):\nAmazing. Itamar, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nItamar Gilad (01:12:25):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:12:26):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

The first version, okay, everybody can make and create their software, so let's just build a developer tool that's so easy that more people can do that. We tried that a couple of years and learned that actually most people just don't care. Our realization is actually let's hide our vision, which is everybody can create their software in the form factor that people do care. So what kind of tool do people use every day? Productivity software. It took us two years to realize we need to build a productivity tool. We called it sugar-coated broccoli. People don't want to eat the broccoli but people like sugar, so it gave them the sugar then hide your broccoli inside of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):\nWhat other elements do you think are key to you finding something that actually ended up working?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:00:44):\nWhat is the building a product or business. You want user. You want revenue. That's the product business. And building for something you want the world to have is building for your value. You have some taste. You have some aesthetic. There are different energy. You need to create a balance. Too much of yourself. Then there's no users. Then you're just doing our project. And too much for business, you're building a commodity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):\nThe way you think about Notion, it's almost like a philosophy of how to work and be versus just a productivity tool. And so I'm just curious how you think about the relationship between tools and human potential.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:01:15):\nTools are extensions of us. And once they extend us, once we shape them, once we bring them to world, they can come back to shape us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:28):\nToday, my guest is Ivan Zhao. Ivan is the co-founder and CEO of Notion. Ivan is a really unique and also a deeply philosophical founder who doesn't do a lot of podcasts, so I'm really excited to share a glimpse into how he built one of the most beloved and most popular products in the world.\n\n(00:01:45):\nWe talk about the first three to four years of Notion that he describes as the lost years, how he was able to get into a great school in China by winning a programming contest, the joy and suffering of building a successful horizontal product, plus his approach to staying lean and craft and making trade-offs and also leadership. Also, a wild story about how Notion almost died during COVID because the one database that everything lived in almost ran out of space.\n\n(00:02:10):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. Also, if you become a paid annual subscriber of my newsletter, you now get a year free of Notion Pro and Perplexity Pro and Superhuman and Linear and Granola. Check it out at lennysnewsletter.com. With that, I bring you Ivan Zhao.\n\n(00:02:32):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A-B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams, companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.\n\n(00:03:02):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more With advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A-B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:50):\nThis episode is brought to you by Airtable ProductCentral, the unified system that brings your entire product org together in one place. No more scattered tools. No more misaligned teams. If you're like most product leaders, you're tired of constant context switching between tools. That's why Airtable built ProductCentral after decades of working with world-class product companies. Think of it as mission control for your entire product organization. Unlike rigid point solutions, ProductCentral powers everything, from resourcing to voice of customer, to roadmapping, to launch execution. And because it's built on Airtable's no-code platform, you can customize every workflow to match exactly how your team works. No limitations, no compromises. Ready to see it in action? Head to airtable.com/lenny to book a demo. That's airtable.com/lenny.\n\n(00:04:44):\nIvan, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:04:47):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):\nI know you don't do a lot of podcasts, and so I'm very honored that you're here. I want to start with the story of Ivan. Your background is quite unique for a founder of a $10 billion plus tech company, and I don't think a lot of people know it. For example, you grew up in a small town in China. And the way you got out of there, the way you got into tech is pretty interesting. Can you just walk us through that early years of Ivan and how you got out there?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:05:16):\nYeah. I think a small town in China, the definition, it's actually 4 million people. It is called Urumqi. It's in the northwest desert part of China. So I grew up there and then I moved into... My mom took me to Beijing, the capital of China. And that's actually how I got into programming, coding, because I'm from somewhere else and in order to go into good school in the capital, you need to win some kind of competition. And there's different paths. You can get at math or you can get at programming like Information Olympiad. I was really into computer games at the time so of course I picked the programming one so I can play computers all day long. And I win some competition and got me to a good school. So that's how I got into programming.\n\n(00:06:05):\nLater then, I moved to Canada. When I moved to Canada, got into college, did not study computer science since I already knew how to code, but a lot of video games. Did a lot of art actually, art and science. By the time I graduated college, I realized most of my friends are artists. They need to make their websites, get web portfolio made. And I'm the only nerd in my art friend circle so I made three or four websites and realized, \"Oh, actually people don't know how to create with the software media, computing media.\" So that got me into want to create a product like Notion today which it allow more people to create tools, create software for their daily work and life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:49):\nOkay. So going back to get into a great school and to leave the small town, not so small, you had to enter a programming contest. And you placed first or second or how well did you actually do in this one?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:07:05):\nSecond in Beijing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:07):\nIn Beijing, okay.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:07:08):\nPretty big. Beijing is a big city.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:11):\nOkay. Incredible. Another stat or a story I heard is that you learned English by watching SpongeBob SquarePants. Is that real?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:07:18):\nYeah, it's real. I moved to Canada pretty late, 16 years old, and what I learned is in China you can learn English but it's typically just grammar and doing exams. What you're missing is the context, the culture. So you have to watch SpongeBob or Simpsons to get a sense of humor essentially. You can understand jokes. Watching cartoons, it's probably the easiest way to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:45):\nThat's amazing. And there's another seminal moment in your path. I don't know if it was this point or later, but the Douglas Engelbart paper ended up being a very meaningful moment for you.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:07:57):\nSo while I was in Canada in last year of school working on trying to building website from our friends and building a creative tool for them, and then you just look into the history of a creative tool for software, for computing. Eventually arrived at 1960 and '70s. So you realize the first generation of computing pioneers, which is around San Francisco, Stanford areas, South Bay, they actually had the best ideas. For them, people like Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Ted Nelson, those first generation pioneers, for them computing, there shouldn't be a separation between builders and users. It's the same medium. Engelbart's original paper called Augmenting Human Intellect, when I read that paper, it's like holy shit. If you are making software, if you know how to code or design, this is the highest leverage thing you can do for other people. So giving them the ability to use computing to augment their problem-solving ability or their intellect, that just got me obsessed with this problem and I want to start a company like Notion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:05):\nIt makes me think of Steve Jobs's famous line of how the computer is a bicycle for the mind.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:09:10):\nYou know what? Steve Jobs is actually at fault of this in some strange ways. So the story is... Actually, the fact. It's not a story. Xerox PARC has working on the first-generation personal computers called Xerox Alto. Alan Kay was one of the main persons behind it. Alto runs down the system called Smalltalk, which is there's no separation between users and users' app. There's no thing called application. Everything is malleable. You can change the tools. So when Steve Jobs, the famous story is when he went to Xerox PARC to in demo with Alto, he does not... It's the first time he see graphic user interface, one of the first time, and it's also they present them with this Alto system that everything could change. But he did not see the power of it. Even when people would demonstrate like, \"Hey,\" Steve Jobs say, \"I don't like this direction of scroll bar direction. When you scroll up and down, it shouldn't scroll the opposite reverse direction.\" Then people just instantly change the scroll bar direction for him.\n\n(00:10:16):\nThat's the power of the original Smalltalk Alto system. He only saw the graphic user interface. He did not see the underlying object or the environment power. As the generation of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates made PC, personal computing, popular and they stuck with this an application framework rather than the Smalltalk object framework. Then that has all the apps we have today and has the SaaS route we have today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:43):\nThat vision of how products should be sounds very familiar and we'll talk about that later of how you think about Notion, but let's assume to the beginning of Notion, when we were chatting earlier, the way you described the early years of Notion, you started Notion in 2013 and some over 10 years ago at this point, you described the first three to four years is the lost years of Notion. And I think this is actually a really big deal for founders to hear about because there's all these companies these days, you hear these stats, they had 100 million ARR in two years, in under two years now. And you don't hear a lot of stories of companies of your scale and success that took three to four years to find product market fit essentially. What went on during these lost years as you described them and just how did you stick with it? That's a long time to stick with something that isn't working.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:11:32):\nBecause the goal is always building a computing tool. It's like what product is this? It's really hard to shape the product. The vision is, the dream is there, but the product is very... There's so many paths. We'll try many different versions. The first version to take, okay, everybody can make and create their software. So let's just build a developer tool that's so easy that more people can do that. We tried that a couple of years and learned that actually most people just don't care. The majority of people, they wake up, they have report due, they need to get their job done, they don't care creating software to optimize whatever they're doing. They don't care. So we give to our friends, give to investors. It did not resonate with people.\n\n(00:12:22):\nBut we really want to build that tool so we just keep going and our realization is actually, let's hide our vision, which is everybody can create their software, in the form factor that people do care. So what kind of tool do people use every day? Productivity software. So that's why it came to Notion today. If you use Notion, Notion are more understood as the productivity suite, but our intent, and if you use Notion, more you discover intent, which is that it has a no-code developer power into it and you can create almost any kind of productivity software using Notion itself. That took us two plus year to realize. So actually the world is not like you. The world are not developer, designer mind. That the world is they only care what's in front of them and they're so noisy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:16):\nThere's a quote that this makes me think about where you said, \"The first version of Notion was more about what I wanted than what people wanted.\"\n\nIvan Zhao (00:13:23):\nIt's very much so because sense of maturation is you don't see the world just from your perspective but from outside your perspective. At tech, we were young. Took us multiple years. It hit your head straight into the wall to realize that. People just don't care.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:40):\nI love the way you phrased that, that you have to hide your vision behind something that people understand and know how to use and...\n\nIvan Zhao (00:13:47):\nWe call it sugar-coated broccoli. People don't want to eat the broccoli but people like sugar, so give them the sugar then hide the broccoli inside of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:55):\nWow. The other thing I've heard is that you threw away your code every time, so you rebuilt it many times. You threw away the code each time.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:14:03):\nThat's true. Actually, it took us four year to get somewhere. First two year is that you build too much like developer product. Nobody cares. It took us two year to realize we need to build a productivity tool. Then it took another year to realize to build this out, but in the middle of that I realized we built on the wrong technical foundation. So eight, 10 years ago, there's computing before. Right now, all the web app runs on React. Before React wins, there's a competing technology called Web Component from Google. And it makes sense. Web Component feels like a Lego-like, the building block-like, and we're betting on that technology. And then we realize because it's so new, it's just so unstable. It don't know where the bug come from. It's from your source code or from the underlying libraries? Then we have to restart the company, rebuild the whole thing. Otherwise, we're going to run out of time. So we set a code base. We set a company so we can build on our own more orthodox technology foundation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:10):\nHow did you actually stay solvent all this time? A lot of people want to keep working at an idea. Oftentimes they need to pay the bills. How practically were you able to keep working for three to four years? I know there's a story of your mom loaning you some money during that time.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:15:25):\nWell, Chinese mom always can help, and I'm a single child. Yeah, actually my mom helped me kickstart the company because I'm Canadian. In order to move to US, you need to register a company. So my mom helped me with the initial and raised the money. I returned the money to her. Then we run out of the money so, \"Hey mom, can I borrow that just to bridge us?\" Which she did. I'm really grateful for that. How we bridged? How do you last here so long? Because the thing you want to create does not exist, which what is called Notions. It's a Lego for software. It doesn't quite exist. There's a Lego for Lego. You can see that in furniture exist, but Lego for software at the usable mass market adoption level doesn't quite exist. And you just want that thing to exist. And I grew up with Legos. It's the only toy I ever wanted, and I want the same feeling of creativity and playfulness to the toy that people can use every day. And my co-founder, Simon, feels the same way. Lego is the only thing he wanted for every Christmas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:36):\nHave you guys seen Magna-Tiles though? I have a one-and-a-half-year-old and Magna-Tiles are quite delightful. I think it's like a pre-Lego. The children can play them.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:16:45):\nMagna-Tile?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:46):\nYeah. It's like they're little magnetic plastic planes and then you can build much bigger things really quickly. It's more for babies, but I'm having a blast.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:17:01):\nOh, I see it. It's like... Uh-huh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:02):\nIt's a different version of Legos. I like that you're in real-time looking it up. You're like, \"Okay, our new vision Magna-Tiles for software.\"\n\nIvan Zhao (00:17:08):\nNow, most people know, \"Oh, Magna-Tile.\" Idea is the same. Modular, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:13):\nYeah, creativity. Okay, back to your story. So there's also a moment where you moved to Japan. Just what was that about? Is that just escape and disconnect?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:17:20):\nYeah, that was during one of the rebuild phases. During the... We know what the product should look like. It should be a productivity software with a Lego power hiding inside of it. We build on the wrong technical foundation. And if we continue to build on the wrong ones, we're going to run out of money. Company won't exist. So we decided to lay off everybody. At that time, the Notion was five people. The layout I brought back to me and Simon, two people. And morale obviously there was really low. You have to say goodbye to your teammates. And so we have the idea, \"Let's just go somewhere that we've never been to change the scenery a little bit.\" And Japan is always top on our list.\n\n(00:18:00):\nSo the funny thing is if we... And we subleased our apartment and office. We're actually making money living in Japan and then San Francisco. So we did that for a while. We actually travel around the world for a while just to change it up, me and Sam just coding every day and design every day. That's some of the happiest moments. Birthday every day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:27):\nI saw a stat you're coding 18 hours a day. Here's the quote I heard, :We just code, code, code. Then hey, let's go for food. Then we go eat, go back to work, and do it again.\"\n\nIvan Zhao (00:18:35):\nBecause me and him working so well now. Even back then, it's like you know what each other other people are thinking and you can just cross through the problem space really quickly. The technical product space, design space, and just non-stop of shaping stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:55):\nSo maybe just to close out this thread, for people, for founders that are either struggling and just can't find a thing that's working, \"I've been working on something for a long time,\" I'm curious what advice you'd share for sticking with it. And I'll share things I've heard you say so far and I'm curious if there's something you'd add. One is you just believe this needs to exist in the world and you need to really feel this, \"I need this to be a thing.\" I think there's an element of staying lean, like you've let everyone go and it's just you and Simon again. There's also this element of disconnecting almost and just going to a different location and just like, \"Let's just reset.\" What other elements do you think are key to you finding something that actually ended up working?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:19:36):\nI'm lucky and Simon lucky that high is never too high, low is never too low for us, so somehow it wasn't feeling too down. Whenever I feel down, I just go to sleep and next day I'm just reset. So that's lucky for me. Definitely don't be afraid to reset. I think courage is quite important because oftentimes you're working on things don't matter, but momentum just took you there. Your first point of building something you want the world to have. What is the building a product or business? You want user. You want revenue. That's a product business. It's almost like a sports. The market is the arena. Then you'd want to optimize the scorecard where it's building for winning. And I grew up playing sports. I like to compete so I like that.\n\n(00:20:34):\nAnd building for something you want the world to have is building for your value. You have some taste. You have some aesthetic. You have some values. You want the world to have more of that. They are different energy. I realize actually fairly recently, they're really different. Depends on which day I wake up, I might be in different mood for things, but building for value it's more lasting and more fulfilling. Looking in the thing we're building today and looking back, I find most proud of thing I create something authentic to myself and happen to be also useful for others, and that just keeps you going. And that feels like a more durable energy source for all those dark years, loss years during Notion, and still every day for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:24):\nIt's interesting you say that because also there's this aspect of it wasn't working initially because you're building it for yourself and not for people, but what I'm hearing is it's still important to build a thing that you are still excited about but also have you go back and forth. Here's what the business needs and here's the thing I'm excited about.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:21:42):\nYeah, really a cue. Almost like a therapist, right? It's true. You're building too much for your own self and value without realizing at the end of the day, if you're building a product and tool has to be used by others, you need to create a balance. Too much of yourself, then there's no users. Then you're just doing our project. You're just doing a research project. And too much for a business, you're building a commodity. So where's the spectrum? Yeah, it's never ending spectrum. It's interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:17):\nYeah, okay. So I'll summarize some of those things you shared of just how to stick with it and stay with an idea and not give up. So I love that you said just get sleep, very Brian Johnson of you, just like, \"Get some sleep when it's a real down day. There'll be another day tomorrow.\" Really simple but...\n\nIvan Zhao (00:22:32):\nIt's like a daily personal physical reset. You can reset your code base. You can reset your mental model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:39):\nOkay. And then there's also, I love these points. Don't be afraid to reset, as you just said. Tobi Lutke was on the podcast. He said the same thing. \"Just be comfortable with some cost. I have done all this already and I will throw it away and start again and that's okay.\"\n\nIvan Zhao (00:22:53):\nYeah. I think it's not just a self-help way to say don't be afraid to reset. That's like, that's okay, that's fine. I think the more interesting point here, it's like you can create progress through better abstractions. And that thing compounds faster, can catch up to all the things you build much quicker than you ever thought. Or humans are not thinking, not good at thinking in terms of abstraction or exponentials. We're thinking in terms of linearly. If you just reset it and you find a better way to do it, you can get all the thing you have to some cost recovered really quickly.\n\n(00:23:29):\nSo actually going back to the computing pioneers part, small talk, one of the first system and a huge influence for Notion was really tiny code base and inspired by Lisp, which is another programming languages and probably a hundred lines of code or something. The kernel of things could be really small, but just like math. It can compound. It can have complex behavior that unlocks so much value and things for you. But if you just find those right, you can catch up to all the things you did. You are free to lose really quickly. So I think that's the kernel of why reset is so powerful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:10):\nAnd we're seeing exactly what you're describing in LLM advancements these days. All these companies have been working on this for so long and then they've cracked an abstraction of how to think about scaling these systems. And now just people launch them and are immediately where the companies that have been working this for decades are today because they are building off these abstractions as you described in these.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:24:34):\nTrying to caught up the US really quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:36):\nWith DeepSeek, yeah. The point you also made about momentum, be weary of momentum taking you in direction and moving in a different... not being stuck to that direction is exactly the way I think the chain of thought models network actually where generally LLMs are like, next word, next word, next word, next word. And if they ever make a wrong turn, they're stuck. They keep going from that path. And these chain of thought models are now good at just like, wait, let me rethink. Is this actually the right path or should I start again? So I feel like AI has almost figured out exactly what you're describing.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:25:06):\nInteresting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:07):\nOh, man. Okay, last question about the early years. Everyone's always wondering what does product market fit feel like? You worked on it for three to four years. What was the moment? What would it look like? What was different when you're like, \"Okay, this is going to work\"?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:25:20):\nI think going back to me and Simon, high is never that high, low is never that low, it never hit us as a binary state. Just like, \"Oh, good. We have people who care about this thing we make now. Oh, good. People reach out to us who are paying us.\" And it's a very gradual ramp. Maybe that's why early days when it's really the lost eras, it doesn't feel too low because it just... Even for Notion today, it feels like it's so small in terms of where it could be. It just they keep going, right? It's a less of a milestone way to thinking about things. It's more just like, \"Can we do the same that's in our head and better than we did last week?\" way of thinking about things. So there's a such movement that product market, boom, milestone achieved. Didn't feel that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:13):\nI've heard that from a lot of founders actually. Was there a moment in that point of just like, \"Oh, this is different,\" or, \"Maybe it's going to work this time\"?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:26:23):\nI think for a while, okay, once we start revenue, product grows faster now. Investors start knocking on the door was like, I remember one day it's like there's a dog food, dog treats sent to our entire office. So first of all, office wasn't public, the address. And the dog treats, why do people want this so much? So that was a moment I paused a little bit and I guess there's enough attraction for investors.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:55):\nAnd the dog treats were trying to... It was like a gift to be like, \"Hey, you should talk to us. We're sending this fun gift.\"\n\nIvan Zhao (00:26:59):\nYeah, because of the way how we just hire someone in the office as a dog. Then I think we post on Twitter or something. And I said, \"Why did this show up to our office?\" Someone really hustled into where we are in our office address and follow us on Twitter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:17):\nDid you end up taking their money?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:27:19):\nNot the first time, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:20):\nOkay, later. Okay, it's long game.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:27:24):\nNo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:25):\nAwesome. So I've never heard that before. Sign product market fit as VCs are starting to... You start getting a lot more messaging and cold outreach from VCs.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:27:33):\nActually, I had one of our investor, it's really helpful because all those years you just like there's no feedback loop. You just go for it. Then the feedback loop gradually show up. Then for a while it's, oh, VCs start knocking on doors. So I should talk to those people. The people like what we're doing. I did some meetings, quite a few of meetings. Maybe it doesn't... I realize and one of the members is saying, \"Ivan, what are you doing? You clearly don't need money. You're just trying to feel good to do external validation about this.\" And I said, \"Oh, that's so true.\" It doesn't help us make a better product and the truth is with what customer tell us. Then we just went back to building. I went back to hardcore building, no meeting modes. That's where the dog food story came about and realized, \"Oh.\" It's interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:30):\nYou mentioned this investor, they said it was really helpful. Is you want to give them some credit or do you want to keep-\n\nIvan Zhao (00:28:35):\nOh, Shana Fisher. She's in New York.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:38):\nOkay, cool.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:28:39):\nYeah, she's like another therapist, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:43):\nThis episode is brought to you by Sinch, the customer communications cloud. Here's the thing about digital customer communications. Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes or account alerts, you need them to reach users reliably. That's where Sinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses, including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally, use Sinch's API to build messaging, email, and calling into their products.\n\n(00:29:09):\nAnd there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about, Rich Communication Services or RCS. Think of RCS as SMS 2.0. Instead of getting texts from a random number, your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new. It's a more secure and branded experience, plus you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies. And here's why this matters. US carriers are starting to adopt RCS. Sinch is already helping major brands send RCS around the world, and they're helping Lenny's podcast listeners get registered first before the rush hits the US market.

So a few stats I've seen. One is that you guys are profitable. You've been profitable for a couple of years now. I don't know if you've spent even the money you've raised. I think most of it is still in the...\n\nIvan Zhao (00:30:20):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:20):\nIt's still in the bank. You're nodding, if you're on YouTube. You didn't have a salesperson until you hit over 10 million ARR. You hired your first PM at 50 people. You've always kept the team generally really small. Why is that been important to you? It's very cool now. Everyone's like, \"Of course, that's how it should be.\" But for the past decade, that has not been the case. You've always been that way. Why has that been so important?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:30:44):\nI think going back to the abstraction system way of problem solving, I think we're lucky that me and Simon and Akshay, we have the skillset you probably can run a whole company, which is a couple of us, I can design, I can do marketing, storytelling, close sales deals. So you realize you don't need a lot. But when you can do a lot at the same time or hire people who can do that, naturally keep the company small. And you all know you're doing product management. The overhead is actually more from internal communication. It's really hard to get people's mind to be aligned on things, to see the world in the same way. And the part that you do need people, maybe you can solve better through systems, through better tools.\n\n(00:31:39):\nNotion itself is a meta tool to build other tools. So we pretty much run everything on Notion. We use the same mindset to build our company. And accidentally, that keep our headcount low, keep our company profitable, which then puts you on a positive treadmill of you don't have to go for the next 18, 24 months to find money. You can just focus on building.\n\n(00:32:03):\nAnd also because your team's small, we have this internal Notion called talent density. We don't try to track number of people but we try to track how talent-dense, revenue per employee we are. And people want to work with either more talented people. So it's a positive company group.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:27):\nI wonder how much of this is actually from being around for so many years without success of, \"We just have to stay very lean and save our cash because otherwise, we'll die.\" Do you think that was a formative experience to inform how you want to operate or is that always something?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:32:42):\nNo, I wouldn't say we're, Notion, is a cost saving-first company. I like fancy chairs. I like furniture. But we're not wasting money. I think it's more just from a taste or approach to problem solving. I just believe better system is much better than brute force through people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:05):\nWhen people hear this idea of staying lean and staying small, it sounds great or we're going to be super efficient and lean and smart with our money and down dense. It's very hard to do and it's very hard not to hire more engineers, more designers. What advice do you have for folks that want to operate this way? What has allowed you to actually be successful while staying lean and not having as many engineers as competitors, many designers as competitors?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:33:29):\nI think just understand abstraction or system is a better curve than pecan curve, right? Linear. We internally help other people and understand this. Internally we use the metaphor that Notion's a small bus. The bus, the smaller the bus, it's easier to turn corners, easier to accelerate, easier to maneuver. The bigger the bus it is, bigger the boat or bigger the bus, slow down. And as a leader in the company, you decide who sit around you on the bus seats. That dictates how fast our overall bus moves, dictate your work and life experience at this company because you pick your roommate, you pick your seat mates. That metaphor clicks with people inside a company and overall help us optimize to make the bus link.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:18):\nI've never heard of that metaphor before.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:34:22):\nIt probably came up somewhere but... Or it does not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:25):\nSmall bus. So along these lines actually, so I visited the office recently and I noticed that it's just a very cozy vibe. And I learned that you had a rule of no shoes in the office for a long time until the last office, that you all ate around one table for a long time, that you try 30 different shades of warm white on the walls before you chose. Why is that important to you? Why is it so important to be so thoughtful about the office experience?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:34:53):\nMaybe there are two dimension part of it. One is the pragmatic part. You just want office to be a pleasant experience to be at. Therefore, most office, the top light feels like hospital. You're just like, \"Oh, man.\" And the white is so pale and the floor is so dark. Why use some kind of cream, make floors more friendly colors? And don't use top light. Top light is evil. So just the office feels cozy so people spend more time. You feel more creative, more at ease in the office space.So the vision work we have is should feels like artist studio or should feel like your home. And that's why most our office furniture are home furnitures. It just feels cozy. That's more so people spend more time, feels more creative, juices flow better.\n\n(00:35:42):\nThe other world just like at least personally for me, it hurts the eyes if you just see ugly things. It's more from a value aesthetic front. It's like we talk about ergonomic chairs. Does it hurt your back when you sit on bad chairs? But you have more visual improve from, at least for me from the eyes. If the chair looks ugly, the wall looks ugly, it hurts. So it's better to not have thing that hurts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:05):\nYou also have a really interesting naming convention for your conference rooms.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:36:08):\nYeah, that's true. Yeah. We name our conference room after timeless tools in history. So there, I'll give you an example. iPhone's obvious one, original Macintosh, various different form of chairs, Lamy's 2000 pens, Toshiba rice cookers, and other ones because they're inspirations. They're just like at the end of the day, we're creating a tool. We're creating a meta tool. A lot of people to create tools, software tools. And Toshiba rice cooker changed how people eat rice in Asia for a hundred million, tens of a hundred million people. The Sony transistor radio is the first one to shrink something small and useful for people. And those things change people's life and last for decades. What it's like to create a software product like that? I want to inspire my team to think that way. Because software, and especially tech, it's every six months, every 12 months cycle. We don't think enough about creating something that lasts. I care creating something that at least the form factor lasts longer than 18 month.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:21):\nThere's a quote that you tweeted once that I think of as you talk about this from Steve Jobs. \"The problem is that there's just a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product.\" I don't know if you remember tweeting that, but just what do you think of when you hear that?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:37:36):\nYeah, I think the key word here is craft. Internally, our company philosophy called crafts and values. Craft is your skill set, your taste. Value is your personal value and how do you see the world. Craft is interesting word. It's like about apply your value to some technical know-how and to make more clever trade-offs to create something new and useful and just keep doing that.\n\n(00:38:09):\nMy wife often refer me as a wood cabinet builder. That's how at least my mindset training towards building Notion is like, \"Oh, can I make this wood cabinet more beautiful and more useful and feels nicer on your hand?\" And that's like you have aesthetic direction towards it and you have your technical know-how to actually make things happen. Then you need to do permutation and trade-off in your head where on paper and to get there. That to me, that's craft. And building product, to me at least, to me feels that way. Building business feels that way. Building company feels that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:44):\nIt's interesting that so much of this conversation is this and the way you think about building this company is this balance between practical, useful things people need and business and practical stuff, and then the value of building something you're proud of and craft. And there's always this trade-off almost of speed and quality, and I know that's an important element for you. Just thinking about trade-offs between decisions, so talk about just trade-offs, just how you think about making a trade-off.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:39:13):\nYeah, I think this is quite relevant especially for product makers and business makers is there's no free lunch. You don't get something for free. You have to give up something. Then what do you give up? It's essentially you give up the right thing that market or your user wants at that given space and time. It's just the craft of building a business or building a product. And that the market is so dynamic, especially now with AI. The optimized function for the market changes so then you need to make new trade-off and new technology emerges. I always feels like AI language model feels like a new type of wood. It feels like aluminum. It's a new type of material. So you can make... Mass air travel wasn't available until aluminum become cheap enough that people can make airplanes that support this at cost. And it's like computer wasn't there until semiconductor becomes... It's like require new technology to unlock new way to making trade-offs, and then you need to balance the technology trade-off with human behavior trade-off.\n\n(00:40:35):\nAs a human, ever since we got out of Africa, we're set, right? That's a constraint. It's invariable. And every generation pick up some new things but after you're 16 years old you don't want to learn new things. So those are there are the people trade-off, technology trade-off. There's some macro. There's a different dimension of things just cooking together that come together as a product more as a business than what is that? And I think a product maker, business maker's job is to find that sweet spot of all the multiple dimensions, then create something has a right to exist. At least it's more durable to exist.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:16):\nAnd I'm hearing there's this thread of just like with new technologies, what is now possible. And I know you guys are doing some cool stuff with AI that I'm going to get to that is unlocking some cool new ideas. But before I get there, I want to talk about just you as a leader. At this point, you've been at this for 12 years, something like that.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:41:31):\nLike that, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:32):\nAnd if you don't mind me saying, you're a soft-spoken leader, which is you're not like the archetype of what people imagine is like the CEO of a 10 billion... And I'm sure you guys are valued much more now. I don't even know. That was probably an old valuation. I think it's great for people to see leaders like you that are not necessarily the classic archetype of CO, and I imagine there are things you've had to work on and build and lean into that aren't natural to you to step into this role of this increasingly growing, high-scale business. What are some of the areas you've had to most build and learn to do that didn't come naturally to you?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:42:10):\nI guess you've never been in a business meeting or brainstorm session with me. You're not there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:15):\nHaven't seen that side of Ivan Zhao.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:42:18):\nYeah, I wouldn't say I'm the most soft interaction person at work. It's actually the reverse is true because I grew up in China. People way more direct. People just say what they want, say what they think. And you move to California, you move to US, you move to the West, you felt wow, everybody says everything's wonderful, everything's nice, but that's not true. I would say Notion's ethos probably more like a East Coast rather than West Coast, so somewhere in between. It's more direct.\n\n(00:42:51):\nWhat do you want to learn? A bunch of things. I think the early days is we talk about that the world's not like you. The world don't care about you so you have to shave off the idealistic part of you to go something that's like the world actually cares, the sugar coat of broccoli. You have to hide the broccoli within something, the sugar pills. So that's one. That's more self. That's more myself.\n\n(00:43:20):\nAs company grows, you realize... I'm pretty good at storytelling. So that's a one-to-one influence. But as a company grows, you realize you need to be one-to-many storytellers. That's a skill. The one reason I try not to do podcasts and all those things, oh, it's actually it drains energy in a different ways. I prefer just building product and brainstorm sessions. Then you realize it's a necessary craft for me to pick up in order to change the shape of the company, the business I'm building. I treat it like a craft. There's some things skill that's in the video game. You need to pick up something to unlock something else and to make new demand, you trade off with yourself and the business. That's fun though. Every 12, 18 month, Notion's like a new company or at least they require different skill set coming from me. So I need to pick up new things. And it's an infinite game and infinite games are more fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:19):\nI love this idea. I love that you keep coming back to this idea of there's the ideals and the values and the vision and what you're trying to do, and then you have to find the way to frame it and package it so that people actually understand and want it. And that's how you get in.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:44:35):\nYeah. It's like human minds are resistant to change, and how do you land in people's head? Through my best word marketing and positioning are for. So you need to find the sweet spot to get in. And you also be truthful. It's not just deceiving. So deceiving is not truthful. You can fool other people once or twice, then there's no future. It has to be actually tied back to something genuinely the value creating or the exchange with the other person. So yeah, it's a craft. Storytelling is the vast dimension of making trade-offs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):\nI love this word, trade-offs. Comes up again and again too. It's so interesting that there's these threads that have come up again and again in our chat. Along that journey of becoming this leader that you've become, what would you say has maybe the biggest surprise or most unexpected part of the journey of something you've had to learn to do or something that didn't turn out the way you expected? Just as a personal growth story.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:45:36):\nIf you use the product in the past three years, you realize Notion product, you realize, \"Hey, we actually ship bunch of things not so great.\" Two years ago. Actually last year, 2024, is the year that I can say we ship good stuff at good velocity and good quality and align with our values. We get lost there for a year, a year and a half shipping something not according to our value, not according to my value. Notion, we call Notion is Lego for software. We ship non-Lego pieces into our product. We're still there. We're still cleaning up part of it. That's a realization. It's like going back to the value part, it's like if you create this thing called a product or business, you attract people are value aligned to it. Then if you're trying to optimize too much on this competition revenue side of things, forced to introducing something anti-your-value, then the system, it's like there's organ rejection with your employees, with your customers.\n\n(00:46:42):\nI'll give you a concrete example. For a while and still is, project management is one of the most important use cases for Notion. And you can get a better project management tool just by hard coding things like sprints, milestones, all those things into your product, or you can do it in the way the Notion are being, through Lego pieces. What are the sprint? Sprints are clusters of a task that group together. So it's a new Lego. So introducing Lego is much harder, slower. You can instead we hard-code a sprint concept into the product. And this doesn't quite fit. And took me at least a year, a year and a half to realize that's not the way we should continue building Notion. We should go back the original Lego way of building the product. So we changed quite a bit internally. Now, it feels good now. Building according to your values is the meta point, at least for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:43):\nOkay, I got to follow this thread. What is it that you changed that allowed you to come back to your first principles? Was it like you step... Is it founder mode was the answer? Is it people, personnel shift? What allowed you to change the way things were going?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:47:58):\nI would say all of that above, but especially just release the sprint product through our community and customers. Then it's like what is this? It's like underpowered compared to other competitor products to doing product management and it doesn't work well with the rest of Notion like I said. And if you talk with engineers, they'll say, \"Okay, there's this part of Notion you have to touch the code base. That's just weird. That's your hardcore too much into it. From all the dimension technical front, calling a customer. And when you use the thing it just doesn't feel right.\" So there's another saying that if you build in a Lego way inside Notion in the code base or product, the system work for you. If you're building non-Lego way, the system work against you. So in some sense, we're creating a tool that has emergent behavior, inter-channeling that emergent behavior to unlock more values.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:52):\nSo I'm hearing as you launched it, it just didn't go well. Everyone's just like, \"What is this? This isn't feeling good.\" And there's a moment of realization of I see. Here's what we did wrong here and we should come back to this original abstraction vision of what we're trying to build.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:49:04):\nThat took nine months, a year to realize sometime.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:11):\nAlong those lines actually, people come on this podcast and they share all these stories of things are going awesome all the time. And this was a great example of it didn't. I'm curious if there's another story of let's say a crisis that you all went through when things were looking pretty bleak for Notion along the journey of building Notion.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:49:31):\nYeah, one of the bleakest one, it's when we... During COVID, we just couldn't scale up our infrastructure. For the longest time, Simon's really good at don't do premature optimization, so for the longest time, we Notion runs on one instance of Postgres database. And then we find the beefiest machine. We keep scrolling, find a beefier future machine to scale our user base, but then we're running off even the largest instance there is for Postgres. So there's a doomsday clock that when we're going to truly run out of this space to store everything in Notion and Notion got a complete shutdown. So we stopped building any new features, all hands on deck, almost every engineer in the company trying to solve that problem. Eventually we did, but it was a close call.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:21):\nHow close are we talking about?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:50:23):\nIf I recall correctly, probably in weeks running out of the time. And then as you approach the limit of what Postgres can do, behavior becomes sporadic. You really don't know which day going to hit you. But we just need to go as fast as you can to become sharding problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:39):\nYeah, I was going to ask, so the solution is sharding the database?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:50:39):\nYeah, sharding.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:40):\nOkay, cool.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:50:43):\nDon't do as late. Yes. Don't do premature optimization but plan ahead a little bit. Don't go late.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:49):\nHow long did you have from when you launched this doomsday clock to time running out? Was that a few months?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:50:54):\nMaybe a bit longer. Yeah, in the month, less than six but more than three, something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:59):\nThe bittersweetness of COVID just ramping up certain businesses.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:51:03):\nPeople just run like they have to use online productivity software, collaboration tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:08):\nYeah, blessing and a curse. Speaking of a blessing and curse, this is a great segue to where I wanted to go in the final area I want to spend time on which is building horizontal software and building software that bundles together a bunch of different stuff. Notoriously hard to build a horizontal platform that does a lot of things when there are often point solutions that are very, very good at that one thing. And it's interesting. If you look at the timelines of companies that have built horizontal products, they all take a long time to build and finally find product market fits. It's actually a really common pattern. And when we were talking about what would be fun to talk about, the way you described it is the joy and pain of building horizontal products. So let me just ask broadly just what have you learned about what it takes to successfully build a horizontal platform type of product?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:51:56):\nFirst of all, no regret. And second, I wouldn't want to build anything else because going back to the value, Lego for software doesn't exist and Lego is a horizontal thing. So that's the thing we want to build. We always want to do that. So we did not start to optimize for business but we're optimized for that vision.\n\n(00:52:19):\nLearning-wise, I think segmentation is quite important because people can use a Lego for different things. Only hardcore Lego fans care about Lego bricks. Most people care about Lego boxes. And they actually want the Lego box to be ready-made. When you unpack the box, the set is there for you, right? That's what we're learning a lot, especially move up market. There's this term that took me a while to learn. It's called solutions. You need to be a solution for enterprise customer, you need to sit somewhere on a P&L to optimize for their business where due third risk. That's Lego box. It's not a Lego brick. Segmentation related to that. So you need to shift your mindset as you more towards B2B, more towards move out market. I wish we have done earlier. For the longest time, I've stalled too much in the Lego brick mindset, now in the solution Lego box mindset.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:14):\nThat's such a good metaphor. I feel like even if you're not building Legos for business, just this idea of what is the box that you are selling to people, how's it being positioned? How do you picture it? What are the value? Props such a good metaphor.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:53:29):\nIf you're building vertical software and naturally your vertical is the box, right? So you know you have 1 or 2% of your selling to. Pretty straightforward that your market constrains you and no judgment. People like you, you can go that way, but then you just hit the wall off the market. The advantage of building horizontal, there's no wall, at least for in our space. We, Notion, go after entire software market, but then you need to create a wall yourself. So to make your go-to-market distribution, to create the spot in people's mind, your customer's mind more clearly for them and for your go-to-market teams. That's why where solutions is one of my favorite word internally to rally the sales team or the product team. You think that way, but then you need to hold in your head, make sure you're still building bricks behind the scene. Otherwise, you pigeonhole yourself into the best spot, like what we did with project management sprints features.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:25):\nSo speaking of that, so I don't know if you know this. I ran a survey recently where I asked my readers what tools they use most, what tools they love most. And it went out to my entire subscriber base. We've got 6,500 people filling out the survey. And Notion more than any other company placed very highly in many categories. For example, I have the notes here, it was the second most popular project management tool after Jira. It was the fourth most popular docs. Which is interesting because you think Notion would... Notion is known for docs and it's interesting, that was the lowest one actually. And then it was third in CRM, just behind Salesforce and HubSpot.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:55:02):\nYeah, we did not intend to build CRM, but what is a CRM is relational database. That's why we give people that brick. That's a relational database and they can build CRM themselves. I think the good advantage is if a customer use Notion, they can address those three, four use cases in one place. Especially for our startup mid-market companies, their need for each of the vertical use case is not as complex so they can have all the information in one place, good for their teams, good for AI actually. That's a huge market change that's like we did not expect until recently. And save their costs, which is more and more people care about the bundling purchase nowadays. And our approach for that is, yes, we're number two in project management, number what? Number four in CRM, but we're interested in more bricks to make us number... Move up the categories in ranking. So it just takes time, but that's our approach.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:05):\nYeah. Well, it's working whatever you're doing there. So say someone is trying to build a horizontal tool like yours. There's a lot of founders that are trying to build something that can do a lot of things really well. Do you have any advice for that first use case? Just figuring out something that initially works like you're talking about segmentation, is there something there of like, \"Do this if you want to find any success with a horizontal tool\"?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:56:28):\nFirst, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:30):\nBut you wouldn't do it differently?\n\nIvan Zhao (00:56:32):\nI wouldn't do it differently myself, but I wouldn't recommend it. It's a problem. The problem space too large to have best practice, but I can share something that's relevant for us. Notion, we always want to build a meta tool, a tool to build the lack of our software. We somehow stand up upon document notes as one use case. And that just gave us a large top of the funnel that there's a 1 billion plus people use this use case every day. So that fuels our growth. We call our internal strategy called B2C2B. All those consumers, personal user use Notion for the most simple way you can use a computer or your phone, which is note-taking or document-sharing. And then they realize, \"Oh, Notion can do more of that.\" There's relational database power, you can do tasks, you can manage track other things. Then they bring Notion to work.\n\n(00:57:24):\nHalf our B2B customers coming from prior personal users, and most of them are using Notion for notes and talk in the first place. So pick. Well, at least we stumble upon a use case, a horizontal use case to give us a large top of funnel that help us grow our more verticalized enterprise use cases, and that's the reason where we ship a calendar product last year because which other category of software has 1 billion plus users? There's document notes, there's calendar, there's email, right? That's why we're also working on the email product right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:01):\nYeah, man. Watch out, everyone. And then you mentioned AI and it's such a good point that AI is best when it has data. And the fact that you have all of this stuff already in there gives you a lot of really interesting opportunities to leverage AI.\n\nIvan Zhao (00:58:17):\nWe definitely did not expect language model. It's such a gift for everybody building tools, right? Complete change the material you can work with. One realization, it's you have a surface area that people spend daily work with, especially during writing and managing your tasks and project. It's really easy to slice the language model writing AI capability into it. So that's the first part we built. That realization is AI is so good at reasoning and understanding and searching things, and we can do a much better job of finding and searching things if all the information are together. That's what we realized. AI is really good with bundled offerings. AI is really good with horizontal tools. So that's the second phase, we call it. The first product was our AI writer product. Second product is AI Q&A or connectors. Please look at all the information in Notion and give your answer.\n\n(00:59:18):\nAnd then we also need to work with the external connector because there's things that are living in Jira, living in Zendesk that other customers still rely on. So we need to build AI connectors. But more and more information coming back to the Notion core. I would say the third one, which is even more fascinating, it's for the longest time and it's still is one of the biggest weaknesses of building for Legos, it's hard to piece together. It's not everybody can put together a Lego set from scratch. There's always the builders and user with the Legos. But guess who is really good at piecing things together, assemble things? Especially things like since Sona 3.5. AI is so bad at writing code. Coding is just assembling things together. So now we're looking at holy shit, we spent the last five, six year building all those Lego blocks for knowledge work. If we're just putting AI coding agent on top of it, you can create any kind of knowledge, customer software, customer agent for whatever your vertical use cases you need. So that's the most fascinating approach for me, and we did not expect this at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:33):\nThank you, AI. Is there anything else along the lines of building horizontal products and bundling that you think is interesting to share or important? Otherwise, I have one last question I want to ask you.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:00:43):\nI think market is like waves. There's... Who said this? There's two-way to build business, bundling and bundling, right? There's too much of a zig and the zag. Actually, my favorite version of this is there's a classic Chinese literature called Romance of Three Kingdoms. It's great novel. It talked about the three kingdom era of China and the opening sentence of this novel, it's, \"Empires long united must divide, long divided must unite.\" That has always been bundling, unbundling. It's one of my favorite book to read when I was a kid, but business works same way. When there's too much, you can see this.\n\n(01:01:29):\nIt's like before computers, everything works on paper. Our knowledge work are done through papers is fully democratized medium. Then PC happens during the '80s. The first era is a piece there actually are so many applications. There's early database software, dBASE, it's quite famous. It started dBASE 2 because it gives them credibility. Oh, they have been stick around for some time. So that's the first unbundling phase of software computing. Then Microsoft bundled everything back into one suite in the '90s. Then the SaaS unbundled it. Now, we're at the tail end of SaaS. There's so many verticalized SaaS average company to use almost a hundred tools. It's madness. So there's more the market shifting towards more a bundling approach. And with AI and with the macro, so there's more value to be created through bundling, at least for now. The market could shift again. So understand this trend, I think, helpful to see should you build a vertical solution or should you build horizontal solution because it does different things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:40):\nI love that story. Okay, so last question. Something that one of your early investors, Finn Barnes, suggested to ask you. I'm curious where this goes. There's this, and you've touched on this a number of times, just the way you think about Notion, it's almost like a philosophy of how to work and be versus just a productivity tool. And so I'm just curious how you think about the relationship between tools and human potential and humans and how we live in the world.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:03:08):\nThe tools are extensions of us. That's why our office room named as timeless tools. They extend us a little bit. And once they extend us, once we shape them, once we bring them to world, they can come back to shape us.\n\n(01:03:29):\nOne of my favorite quotes like the Marshall MacLean quotes, \"We shape our tools. Then after, our tools shape us.\" I think that's probably too philosophical for building product or business, but there is a sense thinking what are you bringing to the world that will come back to bite you or shape you? And are you extending the part, the so-called good part of human nature, or are you extending the part that might be more zero-sum, might be more negative, right?\n\n(01:04:05):\nFor me, what is Legos? Lego is creativity. Lego is beauty. Software to me feels like lacking both. It's definitely lacking a lot of creativity. It's so rigid. So I believe both are human nature that worth amplifying. You can build another business that amplifies a different part of human nature. There was Sequoia famously invests in seven sins or seven human natures of human because they're so powerful if you just latch onto them, you can create a business, you can create a product. But at least I prefer to amplify creativity and beauty in the domain of software. To me, that's aligned with my values and I think can at least shape the market, shape our user of our product towards the better part of themself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:58):\nIt must feel so good to have a product that is so aligned with the way you want to see the world and actually working and growing at this rate and scaling and becoming this, I don't know, part of the ether of the world.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:05:11):\nIt feels good. Yeah, it feels good that some of the most heartwarming thing is still it never gets old when you walk by coffee shop and see people using Notion. Oh, it feels good. And it feels good that we see people in our community can create a living selling Notion template, Notion apps, that they're not a software engineer. And going back to the original mission of when people create software, I think that's one of the most fulfilling thing, at least as a maker of tools can experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:39):\nThat last point, I think people don't realize, so people are making millions of dollars selling Notion templates on the internet like at Etsy and other places.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:05:48):\nConsulting templates, yeah, and they're not programmers. I think I would say that's the heart of that because their domain expertise, they're YouTubers or creators. They have lifestyle brand. They know certain things but they're not makers of software. Then they can use Notion, package their workflows and expertise into Notion and templates and make limit with it. It's awesome, all that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):\nYeah, millions of dollars is it's crazy. Ivan, before we get to an abridged lightning round, I'm curious if there's anything else that you wanted to touch on think might be useful for folks to hear before we get to a very exciting lightning round.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:06:27):\nI think people in tech, I wish more people look beyond tech to steal good ideas. It's like Tech Hacker News Twitter are so focused on the now and what's in front of it, what happened six months ago, versus humanity. If you just read books in other industry, you can look sideways. If you go back to history, there's a massive amount of patterns and shapes and trade-offs you can steal from and you can make what's in front of you much more interesting. You could give you... People figure out clever patterns in whatever domain in the past. You can just take in front of you. And I wish more people do that. I think it would be a very interesting way for product makers, business maker to solve the problem in front of them by stealing outside of from the domain of tech and business. So at least it's very inspiring, very useful for me personally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:26):\nIt makes me think of the quote, \"Good artist copy. Great artists steal.\"\n\nIvan Zhao (01:07:30):\nGreat artists steal, yeah. Well, Steve Jobs stole that from Picasso or something who stole from former artist probably.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:37):\nWell, this is actually an amazing segue to our very abridged lightning round. And the first question is... And by the way, welcome to the lightning round.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:07:43):\nOh, okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:45):\nThe first question is just what are a couple of books that you find yourself recommending most to other people? Could be along the lines of what you just described or could just be generally.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:07:53):\nI think the domain that are interesting the most is the complex system domain. You can look up the term. I think more and more people talk about this, but thinking a system, complex system when all the different things merge together, it creates emergent properties. Talking about ants, talk about beads, talk about life itself. It's just so fascinating how do with few primitives, few Lego bricks, you can create a thing called life. That thing just, it's sugar for me. So I love reading in that domain. And this is really helpful for create product, at least a horizontal product because you're trying to channel the energy, smaller parts to create something that the sum is much larger than its parts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:43):\nIs there a specific book that comes to mind or is it just generally that's a cool area?\n\nIvan Zhao (01:08:48):\nThat's a cool area to your attention to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):\nNext question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nIvan Zhao (01:08:55):\nI like to watch old documentaries. Maybe this is another area or category too. There's quite a few on YouTube. People make really good documentary in the '80s, in the '70s. That's like all the old BBC ones, they're just excellent and they have a strong opinion in them. It's no longer just general education thing. They have a direction. They have a taste. Go look it up. Oh, yeah. One is a really good one to get started called Connections. I think it's called but the gentleman's name is Burke. It's about how different things from different domains inspire other domains, and usually he used 30 minutes or 60 minutes to chain together a bunch of connection of stories. It's really good for technologists to watch. Highly recommend.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:49):\nI feel a very consistent pattern throughout all of these answers and your entire conversation of just emerging properties, connections, Legos, building abstractions.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:10:00):\nYeah, I think I did Enneagram. My Enneagram, it's 7 and 7. 7 is, it is actually perfect with what we just talking about. 7 is creative, finding connection, see the forest and tree. 8 is they call Challenger. It's like competitive AR optimizing. So true energy accessing me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:23):\nOh, wow. It's all makes sense. I got to take this Enneagram. This comes up a bunch on this podcast.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:10:27):\nRight, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:29):\nFinal question. Do you have a life motto that you often think back to, that you often repeat in your head of just like when times are hard or just to keep going with something you're working on that you find useful?\n\nIvan Zhao (01:10:41):\nI like to think things as a craft. You just make it better. Make for yourself. If it's unique enough for yourself and useful for others, things will follow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:51):\nIvan, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, working folks find you online if they want to follow-up on anything, and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nIvan Zhao (01:11:00):\nProbably find on me on Twitter, Ivan Z-H-A-O. It's helpful give us feedback about Notion, about our product. That's the best help.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:12):\nWhat's the best way to do that? Is it like DM, Ivan, or is it-\n\nIvan Zhao (01:11:14):\nYeah, just DM me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:15):\nOkay.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:11:15):\nDM me. Yeah, that's probably the best way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:19):\nOkay. Oh boy, here you go. And then you guys are hiring. Anything specific you're looking for? Anything people should know if they're like, \"Oh shit, I want to go work here\"?\n\nIvan Zhao (01:11:29):\nWe're trying to hire misfits. So if you think you're a misfit, if you're exceptional at many things especially, you want to build Lego for software, you want to take interesting spin on AI with Lego for software, then DM me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:45):\nAmazing. Ivan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:11:47):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:49):\nBye, everyone.\n\nIvan Zhao (01:11:50):\nBye.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:53):\nThank you so much for listening.
